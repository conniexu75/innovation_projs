https://openalex.org/W2752983955,"Rotary molecular machines, activated by ultraviolet light, are able to perturb and drill into cell membranes in a controllable manner, and more efficiently than those exhibiting flip-flopping or random motion. Victor García-López et al. report that ultraviolet-light-activated rotary molecular machines are able to perturb and drill into cell membranes in vitro. Molecules without the drilling action, which either flip-flopped in a washing-machine-like motion or demonstrated random rotation, were inefficient at traversing the cell membrane compared to those with unidirectional motion. Membrane perturbation was rapidly followed by membrane blebbing, and necrosis. Changing the structure of the motors sterically slowed the transport across the membrane, while the addition of peptides to the molecular motors allowed targeting of the molecules to specific cells. This research offers new opportunities for molecular motors in bioengineering applications. Beyond the more common chemical delivery strategies, several physical techniques are used to open the lipid bilayers of cellular membranes1. These include using electric2 and magnetic3 fields, temperature4, ultrasound5 or light6 to introduce compounds into cells, to release molecular species from cells or to selectively induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) or uncontrolled cell death (necrosis). More recently, molecular motors and switches that can change their conformation in a controlled manner in response to external stimuli have been used to produce mechanical actions on tissue for biomedical applications7,8,9. Here we show that molecular machines can drill through cellular bilayers using their molecular-scale actuation, specifically nanomechanical action. Upon physical adsorption of the molecular motors onto lipid bilayers and subsequent activation of the motors using ultraviolet light, holes are drilled in the cell membranes. We designed molecular motors and complementary experimental protocols that use nanomechanical action to induce the diffusion of chemical species out of synthetic vesicles, to enhance the diffusion of traceable molecular machines into and within live cells, to induce necrosis and to introduce chemical species into live cells. We also show that, by using molecular machines that bear short peptide addends, nanomechanical action can selectively target specific cell-surface recognition sites. Beyond the in vitro applications demonstrated here, we expect that molecular machines could also be used in vivo, especially as their design progresses to allow two-photon, near-infrared and radio-frequency activation10."

We have previously demonstrated that nano-sized extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, secreted into ML after trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) have the potential to activate immune cells in vitro Here, we assess the function of ML exosomes in the development of T/HS-induced ALI and the role of TLR4 in the ML exosome-mediated inflammatory response. ML exosomes isolated from rats subjected to T/HS stimulated NF-κB activation and caused proinflammatory cytokine production in alveolar macrophages. In vivo experiments revealed that intravenous injection of exosomes harvested after T/HS, but not before shock, caused recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lung, increased vascular permeability, and induced histologic ALI in naive mice. The exosome-depleted supernatant of ML had no effect on in vitro and in vivo inflammatory responses. We also demonstrated that both pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knockout of TLR4 completely abolished ML exosome-induced cytokine production in macrophages. Thus, our findings define the critical role of exosomes secreted into ML as a critical mediator of T/HS-induced ALI through macrophage TLR4 activation.-Kojima, M., Gimenes-Junior, J. A., Chan, T. W., Eliceiri, B. P., Baird, A., Costantini, T. W., Coimbra, R.

https://openalex.org/W2753833746,"It is generally accepted that muscle adaptation to resistance exercise (REX) training is underpinned by contraction-induced, increased rates of protein synthesis and dietary protein availability. By using dynamic proteome profiling (DPP), we investigated the contribution of both synthesis and breakdown to changes in abundance on a protein-by-protein basis in human skeletal muscle. Age-matched, overweight males consumed 9 d of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet during which time they either undertook 3 sessions of REX or performed no exercise. Precursor enrichment and the rate of incorporation of deuterium oxide into newly synthesized muscle proteins were determined by mass spectrometry. Ninety proteins were included in the DPP, with 28 proteins exhibiting significant responses to REX. The most common pattern of response was an increase in turnover, followed by an increase in abundance with no detectable increase in protein synthesis. Here, we provide novel evidence that demonstrates that the contribution of synthesis and breakdown to changes in protein abundance induced by REX differ on a protein-by-protein basis. We also highlight the importance of the degradation of individual muscle proteins after exercise in human skeletal muscle.-Camera, D. M., Burniston, J. G., Pogson, M. A., Smiles, W. J., Hawley, J. A.

https://openalex.org/W2753271243,"Telomere length (TL) trajectories in somatic tissues during human growth and development are poorly understood. We examined a blood-and-muscle model during early life, focusing on TL trajectories in leukocytes, representing the highly proliferative hematopoietic system, and skeletal muscle, a minimally pro-liferative tissue. Leukocyte TL (LTL) and skeletal muscle TL (MTL) were measured in 28 fetuses and 73 children. LTL and MTL were highly variable across individuals (SD: fetal LTL = 0.72 kb, MTL = 0.72 kb; children LTL = 0.81 kb, MTL = 0.82 kb) but were highly correlated within individuals (fetuses, r = 0.76, P < 0.0001; children, r = 0.87, P <0.0001). LTL was shorter than MTL in fetuses (10.63 vs. 11.01 kb; P = 0.0004) and children (8.46 vs. 9.40 kb; <0.0001). The LTL-MTL gap was smaller in fetuses than children. TL in children was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) (LTL: -0.047 6 0.016 kb/BMI, P <0.005; MTL: -0.037 6 0.017 kb/BMI, P = 0.03). We conclude that variations in TL across adults and differences in TL between somatic tissues are largely established in early life. Because TL plays a significant role in aging-related diseases, insight into the factors that fashion TL in somatic tissues during early development should contribute to an understanding of the relationship of TL with these disease and longevity in humans.—Sabharwal, S., Verhulst, S., Guirguis, G., Kark, J.

https://openalex.org/W2750961475,"The marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus causes food-borne diseases, which may lead to life-threatening septicemia in some individuals. Therefore, identifying virulence factors in V. vulnificus is of high priority. We performed a transcriptome analysis on V. vulnificus after infection of human intestinal HT29-methotrexate cells and found induction of plpA, encoding a putative phospholipase, VvPlpA. Bioinformatics, biochemical, and genetic analyses demonstrated that VvPlpA is a phospholipase A2 secreted in a type II secretion system-dependent manner. Compared with the wild type, the plpA mutant exhibited reduced mortality, systemic infection, and inflammation in mice as well as low cytotoxicity toward the human epithelial INT-407 cells. Moreover, plpA mutation attenuated the release of actin and cytosolic cyclophilin A from INT-407 cells, indicating that VvPlpA is a virulence factor essential for causing lysis and necrotic death of the epithelial cells. plpA transcription was growth phase-dependent, reaching maximum levels during the early stationary phase. Also, transcription factor HlyU and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) mediate additive activation and host-dependent induction of plpA Molecular biological analyses revealed that plpA expression is controlled via the promoter, P plpA , and that HlyU and CRP directly bind to P plpA upstream sequences. Taken together, this study demonstrated that VvPlpA is a type II secretion system-dependent secretory phospholipase A2 regulated by HlyU and CRP and is essential for the pathogenicity of V. vulnificus."
https://openalex.org/W2753831728,"'Cataclysmic variables' are binary star systems in which one star of the pair is a white dwarf, and which often generate bright and energetic stellar outbursts. Classical novae are one type of outburst: when the white dwarf accretes enough matter from its companion, the resulting hydrogen-rich atmospheric envelope can host a runaway thermonuclear reaction that generates a rapid brightening. Achieving peak luminosities of up to one million times that of the Sun, all classical novae are recurrent, on timescales of months to millennia. During the century before and after an eruption, the 'novalike' binary systems that give rise to classical novae exhibit high rates of mass transfer to their white dwarfs. Another type of outburst is the dwarf nova: these occur in binaries that have stellar masses and periods indistinguishable from those of novalikes but much lower mass-transfer rates, when accretion-disk instabilities drop matter onto the white dwarfs. The co-existence at the same orbital period of novalike binaries and dwarf novae-which are identical but for their widely varying accretion rates-has been a longstanding puzzle. Here we report the recovery of the binary star underlying the classical nova eruption of 11 March AD 1437 (refs 12, 13), and independently confirm its age by proper-motion dating. We show that, almost 500 years after a classical-nova event, the system exhibited dwarf-nova eruptions. The three other oldest recovered classical novae display nova shells, but lack firm post-eruption ages, and are also dwarf novae at present. We conclude that many old novae become dwarf novae for part of the millennia between successive nova eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W2753866902,"Anthropogenic disturbance has been pointed to as one of the major causes of the world´s biodiversity crisis. Among them, noise pollution is a potential underestimated threat, projected to increase in the next decades accompanying urban expansion. Rising levels of noise pollution may result in negative impacts on species highly dependent on acoustic communication. Amphibians have long served as model organisms for investigating animal acoustic communication because their reproduction depends on transmitting and receiving acoustic signals. A few studies have investigated the effects of anthropogenic noise on anurans, but there is still limited knowledge on how it affects them. In this study, we test the effect of two intensities of traffic noise on calling males of two Neotropical treefrogs species. We expect to record more changes in call parameters, to avoid masking effect, at higher intensity noise treatments, and in the species with higher call/noise frequency overlap. We performed a set of field playback experiments exposing male frogs to road noise at two different intensities (65dB and 75dB). Focal species are Boana bischoffi (high call/noise frequency overlap) and B. leptolineata (low call/noise frequency overlap). Both species changed acoustic parameters during or after the exposure to traffic noise. Advertisement call rate of B. bischoffi decreased during road noise, and dominant frequency decreased over time. Call length of B. leptolineata increased or decreased, depending on the order of noise intensity. We also observed spatial displacement in both species, which moved away from the noise source. Our results provide evidence that traffic noise affects anuran calling behavior, and noise intensity is an important factor affecting how species respond."

However, the geometrical constraints of short linker DNA between the consecutive nucleosomes may inhibit such interactions, and therefore variations in the DNA linker length may influence the resulting higher-order folding (19Grigoryev S.A. Nucleosome spacing and chromatin higher-order folding.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is especially relevant in the context of epigenetics because the expression of particular genes can be correlated with the occupancy and spacing of nucleosomes on the DNA (20Jiang C. Pugh B.F.

However, a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in this epigenetic regulation requires a significant advance in our knowledge of chromatin folding. Although nucleosomal arrays readily fold into 30-nm fibers in vitro, their existence in vivo has been questioned (23Maeshima K. Hihara S. Eltsov M. Chromatin structure: does the 30-nm fibre exist in vivo?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it seems likely that interactions between nucleosomes will occur in a crowded eukaryotic nucleus (24Ricci M.A. Manzo C. García-Parajo M.F. Lakadamyali M. Cosma M.P.

Nucleosome positioning, nucleosome spacing and the nucleosome code.J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2010; 27: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is relevant to uncover how the length of the linker DNA affects nucleosome-nucleosome contacts and the chromatin structure that is induced by those interactions. Tandem arrays of the Widom 601 sequence, which force the nucleosomes into well defined positions, have been instrumental in structural studies of chromatin (26Lowary P.T. Widom J.

Life Sci. 2011; 5: 5-27Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The most detailed structures show chromatin fibers that form two stacks of nucleosomes connected by straight linker DNA as shown in the crystal structure of a tetranucleosome (12Schalch T. Duda S. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. X-ray structure of a tetranucleosome and its implications for the chromatin fibre.Nature. 2005; 436: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The same tetranucleosomal geometry was recently visualized by cryo-EM (10Song F. Chen P. Sun D. Wang M. Dong L. Liang D. Xu R.M. Zhu P. Li G. Cryo-EM study of the chromatin fiber reveals a double helix twisted by tetranucleosomal units.Science. 2014; 344: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), implying that a two-start configuration is the predominant structure of chromatin fibers. Other studies, however, indicate that arrays of nucleosomes may form alternative structures (29Koslover E.F. Fuller C.J. Straight A.F. Spakowitz A.J. Local geometry and elasticity in compact chromatin structure.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 3941-3950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In particular, the one-start or solenoid structure has been proposed early on (30Finch J.T. Klug A. Solenoidal model for superstructure in chromatin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The relatively irregular folding of these fibers impeded averaging of structures, leaving the linker DNA unresolved. Probing the mechanical response of chromatin to tension constrains some of the proposed models of the underlying structure. In single-molecule force spectroscopy, the extension of individual chromatin fibers is measured as a function of the applied force (31Chien F.-T. van Noort J. 10 years of tension on chromatin: results from single molecule force spectroscopy.Curr.

Both of the proposed folding geometries imply stacking of nucleosomes, which has been proposed to be mediated by electrostatic interactions between the H4 tail and the acidic patch on the H2A-H2B dimer (36Chen Q. Yang R. Korolev N. Liu C.F. Nordenskiöld L. Regulation of nucleosome stacking and chromatin compaction by the histone H4 N-terminal tail-H2A acidic patch interaction.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 2075-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An elegant way to study such tail-mediated nucleosome interactions was developed by Dorigo et al. (18Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Nucleosome arrays reveal the two-start organization of the chromatin fiber.Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), who cross-linked neighboring nucleosomes by introduction of two cysteines, one in the acidic patch and one at the end of the H4 tail. The reversible cross-linking process is controlled by the redox potential of the measurement buffer. Under oxidizing conditions, a covalent disulfide bond between two cysteines in adjacent nucleosomes mimics the suggested native structure of the H4 tails in stacked nucleosomes. Both gel electrophoresis and EM imaging confirmed the two-start folding of cross-linked fibers by showing that odd and even nucleosomes form two separate stacks (18Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Nucleosome arrays reveal the two-start organization of the chromatin fiber.Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Here, we combine cysteine-mediated nucleosome cross-linking with single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy. This approach brings the advantage of being able to distinguish the signatures of rupturing nucleosome-nucleosome contacts from those of gradually unwrapping nucleosomal DNA. As long as the nucleosome-nucleosome stacking is not disrupted, i.e. H4-mediated interactions between nucleosomes are not broken, the introduction of disulfide links between nucleosomes should not change the force-extension relation. The obtained force-extension curves of cross-linked nucleosomes should in this case overlap with those of either arrays containing wild-type (WT) nucleosomes or reduced Cys mutant (MT) nucleosomes. Both the stretching stiffness and the extension at the rupture force would be unaffected by the disulfide bonds. Alternatively, if the linear stretching of folded chromatin fibers mainly involves DNA unwrapping, cross-linking the nucleosomes with the H4 tails should inhibit large extension of the fiber. Thus, single-molecule force spectroscopy of cross-linked chromatin fibers should be able to discriminate different unfolding pathways of a chromatin fiber. The results presented in this work clearly reveal H4 tail-mediated nucleosome stacking and one- and two-start structures for 167- and 197-bp NRLs, respectively. We first briefly recapitulate our previous force spectroscopy results on chromatin fibers and how the force-extension data can be interpreted. We use a statistical physics model that quantifies the changes in extension of each intermediate nucleosome conformation upon stretching the fiber and explicitly takes variations in the fiber composition into account. The force-dependent extension of the tether is obtained by the sum of the extensions of each nucleosome and the extension of the bare DNA handles at the flanks of the chromatin fiber, which are modeled by a wormlike chain. The features of individual chromatin fibers are captured by fitting this model to the experimental force-extension curves (Fig. 1A). A characteristic feature of the force-extension curves of folded chromatin fibers is the force plateau at 3–4 pN. We will refer to this region as the unstacking transition of the chromatin fiber. At forces below this transition, the fiber is folded into a condensed structure that is stabilized by nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. In this regime, the fiber extension increases linearly with applied force, like a Hookean spring. When the force exceeds the rupture force, the extension of the total fiber rapidly increases to about 1 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). This extension corresponds to about 30 nm per nucleosome and is consistent with a single wrap of DNA remaining around each histone core. The unstacking transition is modeled with a force-dependent equilibrium in which the stacking energy is balanced with the work done by the bead. For a more detailed description, we refer to Meng et al. (33Meng H. Andresen K. van Noort J. Quantitative analysis of single-molecule force spectroscopy on folded chromatin fibers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 3578-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Only at forces exceeding 7 pN does the second wrap of DNA start to be released. As opposed to the low-force ruptures, this second transition is not in equilibrium, resulting in clear, well defined steps of 25 nm for each unfolding event (Fig. 1C). We note that the release of DNA from singly wrapped octameric nucleosomes, as present after the unstacking transition, cannot be distinguished from the unfolding of tetrasomes, which consist of two copies of the histones H3 and H4 wrapped by a single turn of DNA; both would result in the appearance of 25-nm steps. The force-dependent extension of the entire fiber is defined by the sum of the force-dependent extensions of each nucleosome, tetrasome, hexasome, and the flanking DNA. The number of nucleosomes and tetrasomes are fitted to the force-extension curve of each individual fiber, yielding the black lines in Fig. 1. All force-extension curves feature a similar unfolding pathway, although the detailed composition and interaction parameters may differ between individual fibers. Several features of the force-extension curves depend on the NRL. Compared with 197-bp NRL fibers, 167-bp NRL fibers exhibit an increased rupture force of 3.5 and 4 pN, respectively, and an almost 4 times larger slope in the low-force regime that precedes the unstacking transition (Fig. 1B). For the 167-bp NRL fibers, the latter feature results in a maximal extension of the fiber before the unstacking transition of about 5 nm per nucleosome, compared with roughly 10 nm per nucleosome for 197-bp NRL fibers. Furthermore, 167-bp NRL fibers feature a sharp force plateau, implicating cooperative unfolding, whereas the more gradual unstacking of 197-bp NRL fibers indicates independent ruptures of stacked nucleosomes. Interestingly, the stacking energy, which can be approximated by the product of the rupture force and the length of the force plateau divided by the number of stacked nucleosomes, is the same for both fibers (Fig. 1B, inset). This suggests that similar nucleosome-nucleosome interactions govern the folding of the two types of nucleosomal arrays into higher-order structures. These results and those of our previous studies imply a two-start zig-zag structure for the 167-bp NRL fibers and a one-start solenoidal folding for the 197-bp NRL fibers. However, this interpretation has been questioned (9Victor J.M. Zlatanova J. Barbi M. Mozziconacci J. Pulling chromatin apart: unstacking or unwrapping?.BMC Biophys. 2012; 5: 21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arguing that the excessive bending of the linker DNA does not allow for stacking of neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, it was suggested that stacking of nucleosomes involves more than just histone tail-mediated interactions and would require a closely packed stack of nucleosomes, which is inconsistent with an extension of up to 10 nm per nucleosome. Clearly, identifying the exact structural nature of the unstacking transition will help to address these issues. In the absence of DNA, H4-V21C and H2A-E64C mutant histones readily dimerize under oxidizing conditions but remain largely separate in the presence of a reducing agent such as DTT (Fig. 2A). When these histones are folded into a chromatin fiber, H2A-H4 cross-linking stabilizes the MT fiber against a stretching force (Fig. 2B). Indeed, cross-linked chromatin fibers remain condensed up to much larger forces than fibers in reduced conditions, which exhibit an unstacking plateau similar to WT fibers. The difference in extension is more than 500 nm at 5 pN for a fiber containing 15 nucleosomes, or about 30 nm per nucleosome. Moreover, at forces above 10 pN, we observed large, discrete, and irregular rupture events on cross-linked MT fibers (Fig. 2B) as opposed to clear 25-nm steps (Fig. 1B) for WT fibers. Similar to WT fibers, this transition is irreversible, and the refolding curve does not overlap with a stretching curve (supplemental Fig. 2). Not all histones dissociate from the DNA, however, as the refolding curve significantly deviates from that of bare DNA as described by a WLC at forces below 25 pN. Compared with WT fibers, this deviation appears to be slightly bigger for the cross-linked fibers, but large variations were observed. To quantify the unfolding more precisely, we computed the fraction of fully unwrapped nucleosomes as a function of force (Fig. 2C) for all types of fibers. Whereas forces of 20 pN are sufficient to unwrap more than 90% of the nucleosomal DNA in WT fibers and MT fibers under reduced conditions, only about a third of the nucleosomal DNA is released in cross-linked MT fibers (Fig. 2C, 167- and 197-bp NRLs in light and dark blue curves, respectively). To unwrap more than 90% of the nucleosomal DNA in cross-linked MT fibers, forces in the range of 35–40 pN are required. Thus, efficient cross-linking of Cys residues is achieved in folded fibers when the redox potential is sufficiently low. In contrast to the observed differences in the high-force regime, inspection of the low-force regime reveals that here the mechanical properties of the cross-linked MT fibers are very similar to those of folded WT fibers. For 167-bp NRL fibers (Fig. 3A), close overlap is observed for the force-extension curves below the 4-pN unstacking plateau. Both fibers yield the same stiffness (p = 4 × 10−12). At 4.5 pN, the WT fiber undergoes the unstacking transition, whereas the cross-linked MT fiber continues to stretch in almost linear fashion. The force-extension curves of the 197-bp NRL fibers also feature substantial overlap up to the unstacking plateau (Fig. 3B), whereupon the curves start to deviate. Again, both fibers yield the same stiffness (p = 2 × 10−12). As in the case of the WT fibers, the cross-linked 197-bp NRL MT fibers exhibit reduced stiffness relative to the cross-linked 167-bp NRL MT fibers. We therefore conclude that the mechanical properties of the folded fibers at forces below the unstacking transition are unaffected by cross-linking. This is noteworthy as it implies that contacts between the H4 tail and the H2A acidic patch remain intact throughout the linear stretching regime. One would expect that MT fibers under reducing conditions and WT fibers exhibit similar force-extension behavior, but instead we found that MT fibers are generally more extended at low force (Fig. 4, A and B). This difference can be understood by explicitly accounting for the numbers of nucleosomes, hexasomes, and tetrasomes present in the fibers. Fitting the data to our physical model of chromatin stretching shows that MT fibers generally contain fewer nucleosomes, but more tetrasomes, than their WT equivalents. Consider, for example, the 167-bp NRL WT fiber and the corresponding MT fiber shown in Fig. 4A. The WT fiber is found to contain 14 nucleosomes and five tetrasomes, whereas the MT fiber contains nine nucleosomes and 10 tetrasomes (fit results with residuals are listed in supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). As both fibers contain 19 nucleosomal particles in total, their extensions at forces exceeding 5 pN are very similar. In a similar fashion, we fitted 15 nucleosomes and eight tetrasomes for the 197-bp NRL WT fiber shown in Fig. 4B, whereas the 197-bp NRL MT fiber contained nine nucleosomes and 15 tetrasomes. These fit results are typical for our reconstitutions and may reflect an inherently lower stability of nucleosomes in MT fibers. If so, H2A-H2B dimers may more easily dissociate. H2A-H2B dissociation will result in less nucleosome-wrapped DNA (as tetrasomes only wrap a single turn of DNA) and fewer nucleosomes that stack on each other (for which the acidic patch on H2A-H2B is required). Both effects will increase the extension of the fiber at forces below the unstacking transition. These differences in fiber composition, however, do not impact the stiffness of WT and cross-linked MT fibers, which continue to reflect the stiffness characteristic for their NRL (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). We can further exclude the effects of differences in the composition of individual fibers by exposing individual fibers sequentially to cross-linking and reducing conditions. We first applied forces up to 6 pN on MT fibers under cross-linking conditions (Fig. 4, C and D, green curves). Next, we flushed in DTT to disrupt cross-linking and repeated the pulling experiment (Fig. 4, C and D, blue curves). As before, the force-extension curves of cross-linked and reduced MT fibers largely overlap at forces below the unstacking transition with the differences in stiffness between 167- and 197-bp NRL fibers being independent of the presence of cross-linking. Because cross-linking of H4-V21C to H2A-E64C does not affect the mechanical properties of the folded fiber but does inhibit the unstacking transition (Fig. 3), we can unequivocally attribute this unstacking transition in both 167- and 197-bp NRL fibers to the ruptu"

Baleen refers to the food-filtering system of Mysticeti whales; a full baleen rack consists of dozens of plates of a tough and flexible keratinous material that terminate in bristles. Due to its properties, baleen was a valuable raw material used in a wide range of artefacts, from implements to clothing. Baleen is not widely used today, however, analyses of this biomolecular tissue have the potential to contribute to conservation efforts, studies of genetic diversity and a better understanding of the exploitation and use of Mysticeti whales in past and recent times. Fortunately, baleen is present in abundance in museum natural history collections. However, it is often difficult or impossible to make a species identification of manufactured or old baleen. Here, we propose a new tool for biomolecular identification of baleen based on its main structural component alpha-keratin (the same protein that makes up hair and fingernails). With the exception of minke whales, alpha-keratin sequences are not yet known for baleen whales. We therefore used peptide mass fingerprinting to determine peptidic profiles in well documented baleen and evaluated the possibility of using this technique to differentiate species in baleen samples that are not adequately identified or are unidentified. We examined baleen from ten different species of whales and determined molecular markers for each species, including species-specific markers. In the case of the Bryde's whales, differences between specimens suggest distinct species or sub-species, consistent with the complex phylogeny of the species. Finally, the methodology was applied to 29 fragments of baleen excavated from archaeological sites in Labrador, Canada (representing 1500 years of whale use by prehistoric people), demonstrating a dominance of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) in the archaeological assemblage and the successful application of the peptide mass fingerprinting technique to identify the species of whale in unidentified and partially degraded samples."

Here, we report the extirpation of the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a temperature-sensitive small mammal, from a 165-km2 area located within its core habitat in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains. While sites surrounding the area still maintain pikas, radiocarbon analyses of pika fecal pellets recovered within this area indicate that former patch occupancy ranges from before 1955, the beginning of the atmospheric spike in radiocarbon associated with above ground atomic bomb testing, to c. 1991. Despite an abundance of suitable rocky habitat climate warming appears to have precipitated their demise. Weather station data reveal a 1.9°C rise in local temperature and a significant decline in snowpack over the period of record, 1910–2015, pushing pika habitat into increasingly tenuous climate conditions during the period of extirpation. This is among the first accounts of an apparently climate-mediated, modern extirpation of a species from an interior portion of its geographic distribution, resulting in habitat fragmentation, and is the largest area yet reported for a modern-era pika extirpation. Our finding provides empirical support to model projections, indicating that even core areas of species habitat are vulnerable to climate change within a timeframe of decades."

Therefore, an efficient system is needed for visualizing the stage of intestinal differentiation and further identifying hIOs derived from hPSCs. Here, 2 fluorescent biosensors were developed based on human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines that stably expressed fluorescent reporters driven by intestine-specific gene promoters Kriippel-like factor 5 monomeric Cherry (KLF5mCherry) and intestine-specific homeobox enhanced green fluorescence protein (ISXeGFP). Then hIOs were efficiently induced from those transgenic hiPSC lines in which mCherry- or eGFP-expressing cells, which appeared during differentiation, could be identified in intact living cells in real time. Reporter gene expression had no adverse effects on differentiation into hIOs and proliferation. Using our reporter system to screen for hIO differentiation factors, we identified DMH1 as an efficient substitute for Noggin. Transplanted hIOs under the kidney capsule were tracked with fluorescence imaging (FLI) and confirmed histologically. After orthotopic transplantation, the localization of the hIOs in the small intestine could be accurately visualized using FLI. Our study establishes a selective system for monitoring the in vitro differentiation and for tracking the in vivo localization of hIOs and contributes to further improvement of cell-based therapies and preclinical screenings in the intestinal field.—Jung, K.

It not only represents the important Rosaceae family that includes economically important species such as apples, pears, peaches and roses, but it also complements the well-known model organism Arabidopsis thaliana in key areas such as perennial life cycle and the development of fleshy fruit. Analysis of wild populations of A. thaliana has shed light on several important developmental pathways controlling, for example, flowering time and plant growth, suggesting that a similar approach using F. vesca might add to our understanding on the development of rosaceous species and perennials in general. As a first step, 298 F. vesca plants were analyzed using microsatellite markers with the primary aim of analyzing population structure and distribution of genetic diversity. Of the 68 markers tested, 56 were polymorphic, with an average of 4.46 alleles per locus. Our analysis partly confirms previous classification of F. vesca subspecies in North America and suggests two groups within the subsp. bracteata. In addition, F. vesca subsp. vesca forms a single global population with evidence that the Icelandic group is a separate cluster from the main Eurasian population."

The presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is believed to be among the underlying reasons for the aggressiveness of PDAC, which contributes to chemoresistance and recurrence. However, the mechanisms that induce chemoresistance and inhibit apoptosis remain largely unknown.We used serum-free medium to enrich CSCs from panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells and performed sphere formation testing, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and semi-quantitative western blotting to confirm the stemness of panc-1 CSCs. Hallmarks of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including IRE1, PERK, ATF4, ATF6α, GRP78 and uPA expression, were detected after gemcitabine treatment. Effects of gemcitabine-induced uPA expression on cell invasion, sphere formation, colony formation and gemcitabine sensitivity were detected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to detect interaction between the uPA mRNA 3'-UTR and mutant p53-R273H expressed by panc-1 CSCs. The effects of upregulated uPA by gemcitabine on apoptosis were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and the impact of uPA on small molecule CP-31398-restored mutant p53 transcriptional activity was measured by a luciferase reporter assay.Enriched panc-1 CSCs expressing high levels of CD44 and CD133 also produced significantly higher amounts of Oct4 and Nanog. Compared with panc-1 cells, panc-1 CSCs presented chemoresistance to gemcitabine. ER stress gene detections demonstrated effects of gemcitabine-induced ER stress on both the pro-apoptotic and pro-survival branches. ER stress-induced ATF6α upregulated level of uPA by transcriptionally activating GRP78. Gemcitabine-induced uPA promoted invasion, sphere formation and colony formation and attenuated apoptosis induced by gemcitabine in panc-1 CSCs, depending on interaction with mutant p53-R273H. Upregulation of uPA abolished CP-31398-mediated restoration of mutant p53 transcriptional activity in panc-1 CSCs.Gemcitabine treatment induced ER stress and promoted mutant p53-R273H stabilization via transcriptionally activated uPA which may contribute to chemoresistance to gemcitabine. Notably, upregulation of uPA by gemcitabine treatment may lead to the failure of CP-31398; thus, a novel strategy for modulating mutant p53 function needs to be developed."

Non-cycloplegic automated refraction and visual acuity test were performed at baseline and the 6-year follow-up examination for all participants. In addition, 50% of the participants were randomly selected for axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and lens thickness (LT) measurements using non-contact partial coherence laser interferometry. Lens power (LP) was calculated with the Bennett's equation.A total of 1300 participants were included in current analysis (2008 mean [SD] age, 51.4 [10.6] years; 54.5% women). Mean change in spherical equivalence (SE) was +0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], +0.19 to +0.30), +0.51 (95% CI, +0.46 to +0.57), +0.26 (95% CI, +0.15 to +0.38) and -0.05 (95% CI, -0.21 to +0.10) diopters (D) for individuals in the age groups of 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64 and 65+ years at baseline, respectively.

Hallmarks of central mechanisms after nerve injuries include nociceptive facilitation and reduced endogenous pain inhibition. Methods to study nociceptive facilitation in CTS so far have been limited to quantitative sensory testing and the integrity of endogenous inhibition remains unexamined. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate changes in facilitatory and inhibitory processing in patients with CTS by studying hypersensitivity following experimentally induced pain (facilitatory mechanisms) and the efficacy of conditioned pain modulation (CPM, inhibitory mechanisms). Twenty-five patients with mild to moderate CTS and 25 age and sex matched control participants without CTS were recruited. Increased pain facilitation was evaluated via injection of hypertonic saline into the upper trapezius. Altered pain inhibition through CPM was investigated through cold water immersion of the foot as the conditioning stimulus and pressure pain threshold over the thenar and hypothenar eminence bilaterally as the test stimulus. The results demonstrated that patients with CTS showed a greater duration (p = 0.047), intensity (p = 0.044) and area (p = 0.012) of pain in response to experimentally induced pain in the upper trapezius and impaired CPM compared to the control participants (p = 0.006). Although typically considered to be driven by peripheral mechanisms, these findings indicate that CTS demonstrates characteristics of altered central processing with increased pain facilitation and reduced endogenous pain inhibition."

We recently demonstrated that phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides from highly pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus are efficient ligands for the human FPR2. How PSM detection by FPR2 impacts on the course of S. aureus infections has remained unknown. We characterized the specificity of mouse FPR2 (mFpr2) using a receptor-transfected cell line, homeobox b8 (Hoxb8), and primary neutrophils isolated from wild-type (WT) or mFpr2-/- mice. The influx of leukocytes into the peritoneum of WT and mFpr2-/- mice was analyzed. We demonstrate that mFpr2 is specifically activated by PSMs in mice, and they represent the first secreted pathogen-derived ligands for the mFpr2. Intraperitoneal infection with S. aureus led to lower numbers of immigrated leukocytes in mFpr2-/- compared with WT mice at 3 h after infection, and this difference was not observed when mice were infected with an S. aureus PSM mutant. Our data support the hypothesis that the mFpr2 is the functional homolog of the human FPR2 and that a mouse infection model represents a suitable model for analyzing the role of PSMs during infection. PSM recognition by mFpr2 shapes leukocyte influx in local infections, the typical infections caused by S. aureus-Weiss, E., Hanzelmann, D., Fehlhaber, B., Klos, A., von Loewenich, F.

Here, we evaluated the usefulness of the percentage changes in serum PG I/II ratios for determining the success of eradication therapy for H. pylori. Materials and methods In total, 650 patients received eradication therapy from October 2008 to March 2013 in our Cancer Institute Hospital. We evaluated the relationship between H. pylori eradication and percentage changes in serum PG I/II ratios before and 3 months after treatment with CLEIA® (FUJIREBIO Inc, Tokyo, Japan). The gold standard of H. pylori eradication was defined as negative by the UBT performed 3 months after completion of eradication treatment. Cut-off values for percentage changes in serum PG I/II ratios were set as +40, +25 and +10% when the serum PG I/II ratio before treatment was below 3.0, above 3.0 but below 5.0 and 5.0 or above, respectively. Results Serum PG I and PG II levels were measured in 562 patients with H. pylori infection before and after eradication therapy. Eradication of H. pylori was achieved in 433 patients studied (77.0%).

An increasing percentage in the serum levels of the PG I/II ratios after treatment compared with the values before treatment clearly distinguished success from failure of eradication (108.2±57.2 vs. 6.8±30.7, p<0.05). Using the above cut-off values, the sensitivity, specificity and validity for determination of H. pylori were 93.1, 93.8 and 93.2%, respectively. Conclusion In conclusion, the percentage changes in serum PG I/II ratios are useful as evaluation criteria for assessing the success of eradication therapy for H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W2753640027,"The pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), a gleaning bat found in the western United States and Mexico, hunts a wide variety of ground-dwelling prey, including scorpions. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pallid bat is resistant to scorpion venom, but no systematic study has been performed. Here we show with behavioral measures and direct injection of venom that the pallid bat is resistant to venom of the Arizona bark scorpion, Centruroides sculpturatus. Our results show that the pallid bat is stung multiple times during a hunt without any noticeable effect on behavior. In addition, direct injection of venom at mouse LD50 concentrations (1.5 mg/kg) has no effect on bat behavior. At the highest concentration tested (10 mg/kg), three out of four bats showed no effects. One of the four bats showed a transient effect suggesting that additional studies are required to identify potential regional variation in venom tolerance. Scorpion venom is a cocktail of toxins, some of which activate voltage-gated sodium ion channels, causing intense pain. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) contain nociceptive neurons and are principal targets of scorpion venom toxins. To understand if mutations in specific ion channels contribute to venom resistance, a pallid bat DRG transcriptome was generated. As sodium channels are a major target of scorpion venom, we identified amino acid substitutions present in the pallid bat that may lead to venom resistance. Some of these substitutions are similar to corresponding amino acids in sodium channel isoforms responsible for reduced venom binding activity. The substitution found previously in the grasshopper mouse providing venom resistance to the bark scorpion is not present in the pallid bat, indicating a potentially novel mechanism for venom resistance in the bat that remains to be identified. Taken together, these results indicate that the pallid bat is resistant to venom of the bark scorpion and altered sodium ion channel function may partly underlie such resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2752185855,"Marine microbes exhibit highly varied, often non-spherical shapes that have functional significance for essential processes, including nutrient acquisition and sinking rates. There is a surprising absence of data, however, on how cell shape affects grazing, which is crucial for predicting the fate of oceanic carbon. We used synthetic spherical and prolate spheroid microbeads to isolate the effect of particle length-to-width ratios on grazing and fate in the ocean. Here we show that the shape of microbe-sized particles affects predation by the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, a globally abundant marine grazer. Using incubation experiments, we demonstrate that shape affects how particles are retained in the house and that the minimum particle diameter is the key variable determining how particles are ingested. High-speed videography revealed the mechanism behind these results: microbe-sized spheroids oriented with the long axis parallel to fluid streamlines, matching the speed and tortuosity of spheres of equivalent width. Our results suggest that the minimum particle diameter determines how elongated prey interact with the feeding-filters of appendicularians, which may help to explain the prevalence of ellipsoidal cells in the ocean, since a cell’s increased surface-to-volume ratio does not always increase predation. We provide the first evidence that grazing by appendicularians can cause non-uniform export of different shaped particles, thereby influencing particle fate."

https://openalex.org/W2753234336,"Objective Female sex is considered a significant risk in cardiac surgery and is included in the majority of scores for risk assessment. However, the evidence is controversial and older women undergoing cardiac surgery have not specifically been investigated. We assessed the influence of female sex on surgical risk (30-day mortality) in a secondary analysis of the GOPCABE trial (German Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass grafting in the Elderly (GOPCABE) trial, comparing on- to off-pump) and also evaluated its impact on risk prediction from commonly used risk scores. Methods We performed logistic regression analyses on the GOPCABE trial population, where patients were randomized to either on- or off-pump CABG. The study was performed in 12 cardiac surgery centers in Germany and analyzed 2394 patients having undergone CABG at age ≥75 years (1187 on-pump, 1207 off-pump). Of the 2394 patients, 755 (32%) were women. The logistic EuroSCORE and the German KCH score were calculated as expected (E) mortality and values were compared to observed (O) 30-day mortality (O/E ratio). Results There was no difference in mortality or major cardiovascular adverse events after 30 days between men and women for both on- and off-pump CABG (men: on- vs. off-pump OR = 0.90, 95%-CI: [0.63;1.27]; women: on- vs. off-pump OR = 1.07, 95%-CI: [0.62;1.87]). Therefore, groups were combined for further analyses. Both men and women had considerable and similar comorbidities. Expected mortality was significantly higher for women than for men (logistic EuroSCORE: 8.88±6.71% vs. 7.99±6.69%, p = 0.003; KCH score: 4.42±3.97% vs. 3.57±3.65%, p = 0.001). However, observed mortality rates (O) tended to be even lower in women (2.1% vs. 3.0%). The O/E ratio was closer to 1 in men than in women (0.84 vs. 0.47). Excluding female sex from the risk models increased O/E ratio to 0.69. Conclusions Female sex is not a risk factor in coronary bypass surgery in the GOPCABE population. The result is the same for on- and off-pump surgery. Since female sex is a component of most risk scores, the findings may identify a potential inaccuracy in current surgical risk assessment, specifically for elderly women.

https://openalex.org/W2753792493,"Photoreceptor degeneration can lead to blindness and represents the most common form of neural degenerative disease worldwide. Although many genes involved in photoreceptor degeneration have been identified, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we examined photoreceptor development in zebrafish kif3a and kif3b mutants, which affect two subunits of the kinesin-2 complex. In both mutants, rods degenerated quickly, whereas cones underwent a slow degeneration process. Notably, the photoreceptor defects were considerably more severe in kif3a mutants than in kif3b mutants. In the cone photoreceptors of kif3a mutants, opsin proteins accumulated in the apical region and formed abnormal membrane structures. In contrast, rhodopsins were enriched in the rod cell body membrane and represented the primary reason for rapid rod degeneration in these mutants. Moreover, removal of the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin to reduce its function, but not decreasing rhodopsin expression levels, prevented rod degeneration in both kif3a and kif3b mutants. Of note, overexpression of full-length rhodopsin or its cytoplasmic tail domain, but not of rhodopsin lacking the cytoplasmic tail, exacerbated rod degeneration in kif3a mutants, implying an important role of the cytoplasmic tail in rod degeneration. Finally, we showed that the cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin might trigger rod degeneration through activating the downstream calcium signaling pathway, as drug treatment with inhibitors of intracellular calcium release prevented rod degeneration in kif3a mutants. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown function of the rhodopsin cytoplasmic domain during opsin-triggered photoreceptor degeneration and may open up new avenues for managing this disease.

Photoreceptor cells consist of highly polarized neurons with a distinct photosensitive compartment, termed the outer segment (OS). 2The abbreviations used are: OSouter segmentISinner segmentIFTintraflagellar transportRPretinitis pigmentosadpfdays post-fertilizationhpfhours post-fertilizationqPCRquantitative PCRWISHwhole-mount in situ hybridizationPFAparaformaldehyde. The OS comprises a modified cilium with a large stack of disk membranes containing opsins, the most abundant protein of the cell. The retina contains two types of classic photoreceptors, rods and cones, which are responsible for vision at low and high levels, respectively. Because of a lack of protein translation machinery, all of the OS protein components must be first synthesized in the inner segment (IS) and transported to the OS through a narrow channel called the connecting cilium (1Kennedy B. Malicki J. What drives cell morphogenesis: a look inside the vertebrate photoreceptor.Dev.

Similar to cilia in other cells, the connecting cilium contains the microtubule-based axoneme with a “9 + 0” configuration. The initiation and maintenance of connecting cilia require an elaborate intraflagellar transport (IFT) process that is driven by two classic motors, kinesin-2 (anterograde) and cytoplasmic dynein 2 (retrograde). The heterotrimeric kinesin-2 motor is composed of three subunits, including two kinesin-2 motor subunits (KIF3A and KIF3B) and one nonmotor subunit (KAP3) (2Song Z. Zhang X. Jia S. Yelick P.C.

In vitro studies suggest that KIF3C, another kinesin-2 protein, may substitute for KIF3B in the kinesin-2 motor (4Muresan V. Abramson T. Lyass A. Winter D. Porro E. Hong F. Chamberlin N.L.

In addition, KIF17, another member of the kinesin-2 family, functions as a dimer during ciliary transport (3Scholey J.M.

Kinesin-2 family members mediate protein transport in photoreceptor cells. Loss of function of KIF3A in the mouse retina interrupts the transport machinery and leads to rapid photoreceptor cell death (6Marszalek J.R. Liu X. Roberts E.A. Chui D. Marth J.D. Williams D.S.

Malicki J.J. Unexpected roles for ciliary kinesins and intraflagellar transport proteins.Genetics. 2016; 203: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of Kif3b, however, affects only a subset of cilia, and photoreceptor connecting cilium is initially absent but then partially recovered latterly (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P.

Although inhibition of Kif17 by dominant-negative expression or morpholino-based knockdown may affect OS development, zebrafish kif17 mutants are able to grow to adulthood with normal photoreceptor functions (10Zhao C.

Furthermore, another study has suggested that KIF17 is dispensable for photoreceptor development (13Jiang L. Tam B.M. Ying G. Wu S. Hauswirth W.W. Frederick J.M. Moritz O.L. Baehr W. Kinesin family 17 (osmotic avoidance abnormal-3) is dispensable for photoreceptor morphology and function.FASEB J. 2015; 29: 4866-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor degeneration occurs in many human genetic disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of inherited retinal degeneration (14Ferrari S. Di Iorio E. Barbaro V.

However, the requirement of kinesin-2 for opsin transportation remains controversial. Mutation of either the IFT or KIF3A gene results in rod degeneration together with mislocalization of rhodopsin, indicating that IFT mediates opsin transport (6Marszalek J.R. Liu X. Roberts E.A.

Further analysis using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method in live cells also shows that KIF3A plays a role during opsin transport (18Trivedi D. Colin E. Louie C.M. Williams D.S.

The structure and function of photoreceptor cells are similar in zebrafish and humans. The zebrafish retina contains five types of photoreceptor cells, including one rod photoreceptor cell type and four cone photoreceptor cell types. According to their absorption spectra and morphology, cone photoreceptors are classified as short single cones sensitive to ultraviolet light, long single cones sensitive to blue light, and double cones comprised of a red-sensitive and a green-sensitive cell (21Pujic Z. Malicki J. Retinal pattern and the genetic basis of its formation in zebrafish.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Larison K.D. Bremiller R. Early onset of phenotype and cell patterning in the embryonic zebrafish retina.Development. 1990; 109: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cone and rod photoreceptors form a highly ordered mosaic in the adult retina (23Fadool J.M. Development of a rod photoreceptor mosaic revealed in transgenic zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that rod photoreceptors degenerated in zebrafish kif3b mutants, although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be understood (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P. Malicki J. Kinesin-2 family in vertebrate ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2388-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we further generated zebrafish kif3a mutants and investigated rod and cone development therein. As for kif3b mutants, rod photoreceptors in kif3a mutants exhibited a faster degeneration process than cones. Further experiments demonstrated that opsins were accumulated in the apical part of cone photoreceptors, whereas most rod opsins localized to the cell membrane. We next generated a zebrafish mutant allele lacking the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin and found that rods were maintained in kif3a/rho double mutants. Furthermore, we showed that the cytoplasmic domain plays a key role during rod degeneration, as overexpression of full-length opsin or the cytoplasmic domain alone, but not the form lacking the cytoplasmic domain, accelerated rod degeneration in kif3a mutants. Finally, drug treatment with calcium channel blockers increased the rod survival ratio in kif3a mutants, suggesting that the calcium signaling pathway is involved in photoreceptor degeneration. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of rod photoreceptors observed following kif3b dysfunction in early zebrafish embryos (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P. Malicki J. Kinesin-2 family in vertebrate ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2388-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in this study, we further generated kif3a mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 methods (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Similar to other ciliary mutants, zebrafish kif3a mutants displayed body curvature at 3 days post fertilization (dpf). Whole-mount immunostaining with an anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibody demonstrated that all cilia were absent in kif3a mutant larvae (supplemental Fig. S1, D–I), which differs from the consequences of mutation of the other two kinesin-2 genes, kif3b and kif17 (9Pooranachandran N. Malicki J.J. Unexpected roles for ciliary kinesins and intraflagellar transport proteins.Genetics. 2016; 203: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K.

Biol. 2008; 316: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The complete absence of cilia has also been described in another kif3a mutant line derived from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis (data not shown and Ref. 9Pooranachandran N. Malicki J.J. Unexpected roles for ciliary kinesins and intraflagellar transport proteins.Genetics. 2016; 203: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Kif3a is indispensable for ciliogenesis in zebrafish. We next examined photoreceptor development in kif3a mutants by crossing these animals to Tg(Xla.Rho:GFP), a rod-specific transgenic line driven by the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter (referred to here as XOPS-GFP) (23Fadool J.M. Development of a rod photoreceptor mosaic revealed in transgenic zebrafish.Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). At 3 dpf, the GFP signals in the retina of wild-type and kif3a mutants were indistinguishable (supplemental Fig. S2). However, kif3a mutants displayed a rapid decrease of GFP signals in the retina in the following 48 h of development, and only scattered GFP signals could be observed in the sections of mutant retina at 5 dpf (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Fig. S2). We further analyzed the expression of rod-specific genes via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and found that these genes were all down-regulated in kif3a mutants at 5 dpf (Fig. 1, D–F). These results suggest that mutation of kif3a leads to fast rod degeneration from 3 to 5 dpf, which is similar to that observed in kif3b mutants (Fig. 1, D and F) (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P. Malicki J. Kinesin-2 family in vertebrate ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2388-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In kif3b mutants, cone photoreceptors survive longer than 5 dpf, as shown by both WISH and qPCR analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, WISH results for two cone opsin genes, uv and green, demonstrated similar staining levels at 5 dpf in the retinae of kif3a and wild-type larvae (Fig. 2A), whereas qPCR analysis indicated that the expression of cone-specific genes decreased slightly (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined cone development via whole-mount immunostaining using the zpr-1 antibody, which recognizes Arr3a and selectively labels cell body of the red- and green-sensitive double cones (22Larison K.D. Bremiller R. Early onset of phenotype and cell patterning in the embryonic zebrafish retina.Development. 1990; 109: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ile K.E. Kassen S. Cao C. Vihtehlic T. Shah S.D. Mousley C.J. Alb Jr., J.G. Huijbregts R.P. Stearns G.W. Brockerhoff S.E. Hyde D.R. Bankaitis V.A. Zebrafish class 1 phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins: PITPβ and double cone cell outer segment integrity in retina.Traffic. 2010; 11: 1151-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to the fast degeneration of rods, the majority of double cones were still present at 4 dpf in the retinae of kif3a mutants, and only a small number of cones degenerated at 5 dpf, suggesting that cones degenerate much slower than rods in kif3a mutants (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2). Similarly, the double cones of kif3b mutants showed a grossly normal staining pattern comparable with that of wild-type siblings at 5 dpf. In contrast, the cone photoreceptors in another ciliary mutant, ovl, which harbors a mutation that affects one of the IFT proteins, Ift88, displayed a much more severe degeneration phenotype at the same developmental stage (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2). Next, we crossed kif3a mutants to a stable transgenic line, Tg(hsp:GFP-CT44), which expresses GFP fused to the 44 C-terminal amino acids of rhodopsin driven by a heat shock promoter (25Zhao C. Malicki J. Nephrocystins and MKS proteins interact with IFT particle and facilitate transport of selected ciliary cargos.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Hurd L.B. Papermaster D.S. Identification of an outer segment targeting signal in the COOH terminus of rhodopsin using transgenic Xenopus laevis.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In wild-type embryos, this fusion protein could be easily transported to the outer segment within 4 h after heat shock (25Zhao C. Malicki J. Nephrocystins and MKS proteins interact with IFT particle and facilitate transport of selected ciliary cargos.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We reasoned that such GFP signals might localize to the inner cell membrane of photoreceptors because of the dysfunction of IFT in kif3a mutants. However, we noticed that the majority of GFP signals accumulated at the apical region of photoreceptor cells in kif3a mutants after heat induction at 5 dpf (Fig. 2E). Further immunostaining results with Tom20, a mitochondrial marker, suggested that these GFP fusion proteins localized apically to the mitochondria (Fig. 2E). Similarly, such protein accumulation also occurs in UV light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, as shown using another stable transgenic line expressing tdTomato fused to the same outer segment targeting signals driven by the sws1 promoter (27Takechi M. Hamaoka T. Kawamura S. Fluorescence visualization of ultraviolet-sensitive cone photoreceptor development in living zebrafish.FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Song Z. Wang Y. Zhao C. Establishment of a transgenic zebrafish line with tdTomato expression in the ultraviolet-sensitive cone photoreceptors.Acta Laboratorium Animalis Scientia Sinica. 2015; 23: 453-457Google Scholar). Noticeably, a small amount of fusion proteins also localized to the cell membrane and synapse in the mutants (Fig. 2E, arrows). These results suggest that opsin proteins may be sequestered apically in the mutant photoreceptors. Interestingly, most of these ectopic opsins did not colocalize with Rom1b, another outer segment membrane protein (supplemental Fig. S3). Next, we performed electron microscopy analysis of the retina of 5-dpf larvae. As shown in Fig. 2, F–I, irregular membrane structures were consistently formed on the exteriors of mitochondria in the photoreceptors of kif3a mutants. Considering that rods already degenerate at this stage, these results suggest that the majority of opsins localized to the apical region of cone photoreceptors in kif3a mutants. In contrast to the complete absence of cilia in kif3a mutants, loss of function of Kif3b only results in ciliogenesis defects in a subset of cilia (Fig. 3F) (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P. Malicki J. Kinesin-2 family in vertebrate ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2388-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Robust cilia were still present in the central nervous system (CNS) of kif3b mutant embryos on a Tg(bactin2:Arl13b-GFP) transgenic strain background (data not shown). Similarly, although rods degenerated quickly in kif3b mutants, the cones were relatively normal compared with those of kif3a mutants (Fig. 2, A–D, and supplemental Fig. S2). The mild phenotype of kif3b mutants may be related to the presence of the Kif3c protein, which can also bind to Kif3a in vitro (4Muresan V. Abramson T. Lyass A. Winter D. Porro E. Hong F. Chamberlin N.L. Schnapp B.J. KIF3C and KIF3A form a novel neuronal heteromeric kinesin that associates with membrane vesicles.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Zebrafish carry two KIF3C homologues, kif3ca and kif3cb, both of which are mainly expressed in the CNS, although kif3ca is expressed at a relatively higher level (Fig. 3, A–D). To test in vivo functional redundancy between Kif3c and Kif3b, we further generated zebrafish kif3ca mutants (Fig. 3E). Although cilia developed normally in kif3ca mutants, kif3b/kif3ca double mutants failed to develop cilia in ear cristae and photoreceptor cells, suggesting that Kif3ca is involved in the formation of these cilia in kif3b mutants (Fig. 3F). In addition, the photoreceptor layer was also severely disorganized in the double mutants (Fig. 3F). Next, we generated a stable transgenic line expressing GFP fused to the N terminus of the Kif3ca protein and driven by a heat shock promoter (Fig. 3G). We found that all examined cilia that were absent in kif3b mutants could be fully rescued upon heat induction, including motile, non-motile, single, and multiple cilia (Fig. 3, H–P). These results demonstrate that Kif3b and Kif3ca are interchangeable during ciliary transport. Next, we focused on photoreceptor development in kif3b mutants. The expression of rod-specific genes was maintained following Kif3ca protein overexpression (Fig. 4, A and I). Rod outer segments and photoreceptor-connecting cilia were recovered as well (Fig. 4, B–H). In contrast, overexpression of another member of the kinesin-2 protein family, Kif17, could not prevent rod degeneration, although the cilia could be rescued in several other tissues, including the spinal cord (Fig. 4A) (10Zhao C. Omori Y. Brodowska K. Kovach P. Malicki J. Kinesin-2 family in vertebrate ciliogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 2388-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of neither kif3ca nor kif3cb can rescue cilia or photoreceptor defects in kif3a mutants, although both can rescue ciliary defects in kif3b mutants, suggesting the essential function of Kif3a during ciliogenesis (supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). Together, these results suggest that function of Kif3ca and Kif3b are redundant in ciliogenesis, which is the reason underlying the mild phenotype in kif3b mutants. Considering that opsin mislocalization is one of the causes of photoreceptor cell death, we further investigated opsin distribution using the Tg(hsp:GFP-CT44) transgenic line. Specifically, the transgene was heat-induced at 3.5 dpf when most of the rods were still present in the kif3a mutants. In the photoreceptors of wild-type embryos, the GFP signals exclusively accumulated in the outer segments 12 h after heat shock, whereas robust signals were still present in the cell membrane of the photoreceptors in kif3a mutants (data not shown). To better distinguish cones and rods, we isolated single photoreceptors and simultaneously labeled them with zpr-1 and zpr-3 antibodies. Zpr-3 is a monoclonal antibody that can recognize outer segments of both rods and short double cones (29Yin J. Brocher J. Linder B. Hirmer A. Sundaramurthi H. Fischer U. Winkler C. The 1D4 antibody labels outer segments of long double cone but not rod photoreceptors in zebrafish.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Comparison of topographical patterns of ganglion and photoreceptor cell differentiation in the retina of the zebrafish, Danio rerio.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 371: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the isolated mutant photoreceptors, the short double cones would be labeled with both antibodies (cell membrane, zpr-3; cell body, zpr-1), whereas only the cell membrane would be labeled in rod cells (Fig. 5A). Comparison of the average fluorescence intensity in the cell membrane between double cones and rods identified that the GFP signals were significantly higher in the membrane of rods than those of cones (Fig. 5, A and B). We further investigated the distribution of endogenous proteins by staining with an anti-bovine rhodopsin antibody, 4D2. Because the 4D2 antibody recognizes both rod and double cone opsins in zebrafish (supplemental Fig. S6), we performed this analysis using the XOPS-GFP transgenic line to identify rod photoreceptors. Similarly, rod cell membrane was found to contain a higher level of opsins than those of cones (Fig. 5, E and F). Next, we repeated the opsin transport experiments in ift88 mutants, which exhibit rapid degeneration of both rods and cones (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 5C, both rod and cone cell membranes contained robust but similar fluorescence intensities, indicating that opsin transport was similarly affected in cones and rods lacking Ift88 proteins (Fig. 5, C and D). The high GFP intensity in the cell membrane was consistent with the rapid photoreceptor degeneration in kif3a and ift88 mutants. These results suggest that excess opsin accumulation in the cell membrane of rods contributes to their fast degeneration in kif3a mutants. As the rod cell membrane contains a higher level of opsin proteins, we reasoned that elimination of rhodopsin might prevent rod degeneration in kif3 (kif3a and kif3b) mutants. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant line harboring a 5-bp deletion in the rho gene, which encodes a truncated protein lacking the entire cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (amino acids 315–354) (Fig. 6A). Whole-mount immunostaining and ultrastructural results suggested that the photoreceptor cell layer appeared to be grossly normal in the mutants at the larval stage (Fig. 6, B–E, and data not shown). Notably, the truncated proteins still localized to the outer segments at the larval stage, as shown by zpr-3 and 4D2 antibody staining (Fig. 6, D and E, and dat"
https://openalex.org/W2752320731,"The need for generating precisely designed mutations is common in genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Here, I describe a new λ Red recombineering method (Direct and Inverted Repeat stimulated excision; DIRex) for fast and easy generation of single point mutations, small insertions or replacements as well as deletions of any size, in bacterial genes. The method does not leave any resistance marker or scar sequence and requires only one transformation to generate a semi-stable intermediate insertion mutant. Spontaneous excision of the intermediate efficiently and accurately generates the final mutant. In addition, the intermediate is transferable between strains by generalized transductions, enabling transfer of the mutation into multiple strains without repeating the recombineering step. Existing methods that can be used to accomplish similar results are either (i) more complicated to design, (ii) more limited in what mutation types can be made, or (iii) require expression of extrinsic factors in addition to λ Red. I demonstrate the utility of the method by generating several deletions, small insertions/replacements, and single nucleotide exchanges in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, the design parameters that influence the excision frequency and the success rate of generating desired point mutations have been examined to determine design guidelines for optimal efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2752559496,"We previously reported the development of a new acquired neurogenic HO (NHO) mouse model, combining spinal cord transection (SCI) and chemical muscle injury. Pathological mechanisms responsible for ectopic osteogenesis after central neurological damage are still to be elucidated. In this study, we first hypothesized that peripheral nervous system (PNS) might convey pathological signals from injured spinal cord to muscles in NHO mouse model. Secondly, we sought to determine whether SCI could lead to intramuscular modifications of BMP2 signaling pathways. Twenty one C57Bl6 mice were included in this protocol. Bilateral cardiotoxin (CTX) injection in hamstring muscles was associated with a two-stage surgical procedure, combining thoracic SCI with unilateral peripheral denervation. Volumes of HO (Bone Volume, BV) were measured 28 days after surgery using micro-computed tomography imaging techniques and histological analyses were made to confirm intramuscular osteogenesis. Volume comparisons were conducted between right and left hind limb of each animal, using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to explore intra muscular expression of BMP2, Alk3 and Id1. Nineteen mice survive the complete SCI and peripheral denervation procedure. When CTX injections were done right after surgery (n = 7), bilateral HO were detected in all animals after 28 days. Micro-CT measurements showed significantly increased BV in denervated paws (1.47 mm3 +/- 0.5) compared to contralateral sides (0.56 mm3 +/-0.4), p = 0.03. When peripheral denervation and CTX injections were performed after sham SCI surgery (n = 6), bilateral HO were present in three mice at day 28. Quantitative PCR analyses showed no changes in intra muscular BMP2 expression after SCI as compared to control mice (shamSCI). Peripheral denervation can be reliably added to spinal cord transection in NHO mouse model. This new experimental design confirms that neuro inflammatory mechanisms induced by central or peripheral nervous system injury plays a key role in triggering ectopic osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2750712679,"Ischemic stroke is often complicated by brain edema, disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB), and uncontrolled release of arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Conivaptan, a V1a and V2 receptor antagonist, reduces brain edema and minimizes damage to the blood-brain barrier after stroke. Most stroke patients do not receive treatment immediately after the onset of brain ischemia. Delays in therapy initiation may worsen stroke outcomes. Therefore, we designed a translational study to explore the therapeutic time window for conivaptan administration.Mice were treated with conivaptan beginning 3, 5, or 20 hours after 60-minute focal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Treatments were administered by continuous IV infusion for a total of 48 hours. Brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption were evaluated at endpoint.Conivaptan therapy initiated at 3 hours following ischemia reduced edema in the ipsilateral hemisphere, which corresponded with improvements in neurological deficits. Stroke-triggered BBB disruption was also reduced in mice when conivaptan treatments were initiated at 3 hours of reperfusion. However, 5 and 20-hour delays of conivaptan administration failed to reduce edema or protect BBB.Timing of conivaptan administration is important for successful reduction of brain edema and BBB disruption. Our experimental data open new possibilities to repurpose conivaptan, and make an important ""bench-to-bedside translation"" of the results into clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2752595878,"The integrity of the distinguishing, multilaminate cell envelope surrounding mycobacteria is critical to their survival and pathogenesis. The prevalence of phosphatidylinositol mannosides in the cell envelope suggests an important role in the mycobacterial life cycle. Indeed, deletion of the pimE gene (ΔpimE) encoding the first committed step in phosphatidylinositol hexamannoside biosynthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis results in the formation of smaller colonies than wild-type colonies on Middlebrook 7H10 agar. To further investigate potential contributors to cell-envelope mannan biosynthesis while taking advantage of this colony morphology defect, we isolated spontaneous suppressor mutants of ΔpimE that reverted to wild-type colony size. Of 22 suppressor mutants, 6 accumulated significantly shorter lipomannan or lipoarabinomannan. Genome sequencing of these mutants revealed mutations in genes involved in the lipomannan/lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis, such as those encoding the arabinosyltransferase EmbC and the mannosyltransferase MptA. Furthermore, we identified three mutants carrying a mutation in a previously uncharacterized gene, MSMEG_5785, that we designated lmeA Complementation of these suppressor mutants with lmeA restored the original ΔpimE phenotypes and deletion of lmeA in wild-type M. smegmatis resulted in smaller lipomannan, as observed in the suppressor mutants. LmeA carries a predicted N-terminal signal peptide, and density gradient fractionation and detergent extractability experiments indicated that LmeA localizes to the cell envelope. Using a lipid ELISA, we found that LmeA binds to plasma membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol. LmeA is widespread throughout the Corynebacteriales; therefore, we concluded that LmeA is an evolutionarily conserved cell-envelope protein critical for controlling the mannan chain length of lipomannan/lipoarabinomannan."
https://openalex.org/W2752705012,"There are co-morbidity between osteoporosis (OP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some genetic risk factors have been identified for these two phenotypes respectively in previous research; however, they accounted for only a small portion of the underlying total genetic variances. Here, we sought to identify additional common genetic loci associated with OP and/or RA. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach allows detection of additional genetic factors (those respective ones as well as common pleiotropic ones) for the two associated phenotypes. We collected and analyzed summary statistics provided by large, multi-center GWAS studies of FNK (femoral neck) BMD (a major risk factor for osteoporosis) (n = 53,236) and RA (n = 80,799). The conditional quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots can assess the enrichment of SNPs related to FNK BMD and RA, respectively. Furthermore, we identified shared loci between FNK BMD and RA using conjunction cFDR (ccFDR). We found strong enrichment of p-values in FNK BMD when conditional Q-Q was done on RA and vice versa. We identified 30 novel OP-RA associated pleiotropic loci that have not been reported in previous OP or RA GWAS, 18 of which located in the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) region previously reported to play an important role in immune system and bone health. We identified some specific novel polygenic factors for OP and RA respectively, and identified 30 novel OP-RA associated pleiotropic loci. These discovery findings may offer novel pathobiological insights, and suggest new targets and pathways for drug development in OP and RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2753154789,"Imprinted genes show parent-specific activity (functional haploidy), which makes them particularly vulnerable to epigenetic dysregulation. Here we studied the methylation profiles of oppositely imprinted genes at single DNA molecule resolution by two independent parental allele-specific deep bisulfite sequencing (DBS) techniques. Using Roche (GSJunior) next generation sequencing technology, we analyzed the maternally imprinted MEST promoter and the paternally imprinted MEG3 intergenic (IG) differentially methylated region (DMR) in fetal cord blood, adult blood, and visceral adipose tissue. Epimutations were defined as paternal or maternal alleles with >50% aberrantly (de)methylated CpG sites, showing the wrong methylation imprint. The epimutation rates (range 2–66%) of the paternal MEST and the maternal MEG3 IG DMR allele, which should be completely unmethylated, were significantly higher than those (0–15%) of the maternal MEST and paternal MEG3 alleles, which are expected to be fully methylated. This hypermethylation of the non-imprinted allele (HNA) was independent of parental origin. Very low epimutation rates in sperm suggest that HNA occurred after fertilization. DBS with Illumina (MiSeq) technology confirmed HNA for the MEST promoter and the MEG3 IG DMR, and to a lesser extent, for the paternally imprinted secondary MEG3 promoter and the maternally imprinted PEG3 promoter. HNA leads to biallelic methylation of imprinted genes in a considerable proportion of normal body cells (somatic mosaicism) and is highly variable between individuals. We propose that during development and differentiation maintenance of differential methylation at most imprinting control regions may become to some extent redundant. The accumulation of stochastic and environmentally-induced methylation errors on the non-imprinted allele may increase epigenetic diversity between cells and individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2752617127,"On the Amazon floodplain, the main predators of black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) eggs are jaguars (Panthera onca), tegu lizards (Tupinambis teguixim), capuchin monkeys (Sapajus macrocephalus) and humans (Homo sapiens). In this study, we investigated the relationship between predator attacks on nests and incubation period, and evaluated the influence of initial predation on subsequent predation in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. We also evaluated the influence of presence of females near the nests and manipulation of nests on the occurrence of attacks. We compared results from data obtained with camera traps and vestiges left by predators on estimates of rates of predation by different predators. Egg predation was recorded in 32% of the 658 black caiman nests monitored during two years. Our results suggest that the probability of predation on black caiman eggs is relatively constant throughout the incubation period and that predation on eggs was lower when adults, presumably females, were present. Careful opening of nests and handling of eggs did not increase the number of attacks on black caiman nests. Nest opening by a predator appeared to increase the chances of a subsequent attack because most of the attacks on nests occurred soon after a predator first opened the nest. However, attacks by another species of predator do not appear to be necessary to initiate attacks by any other species of predator. Results based on camera traps and vestiges differed, but use of vestiges was adequate for identifying the principal predators on eggs in black caiman nests and, in many circumstances, the vestiges may be better for estimating predation by humans. In this study, opening nests and handling eggs did not increase the number of attacks on black caiman nests."
https://openalex.org/W2753646190,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great potential in cell therapies by virtue of the regenerative effects and immunomodulatory properties, but the scarce nature of MSCs makes ex vivo expansion indispensable prior to transplantation purposes. However, potential loss of stemness ensuing culture expansion has hindered the advancements in MSCs-based treatments. In principle, stemness could be preserved by reconstructing the stem cell niche. To test whether the endothelial cells (ECs) participate in the constitution of the stem cell niche for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ECs derivatives including extracellular matrix (ECM) and conditioned medium (CM) prepared from aortic endothelial cells (AECs) and Mile Sven 1 endothelial cell line (MS1) were investigated for the potential to maintain MSCs stemness. MSCs expanded on endothelial ECMs, especially on MS1-ECM, possessed a more juvenile morphology and showed delayed proliferation, when compared with untreated MSCs and MSCs on MSC-ECM and in CMs. Once induced, MS1-ECM group showed better tri-lineage differentiations indicating that MS1-ECM could better preserve MSC stemness. MSCs on MS1-ECM showed stronger immune-modulatory potential and had significantly higher H3K27me3 with lower Kdm6b expression. Taken together, MS1-ECM shapes an inhibitory chromatin signature and retains MSCs stemness. Our work provided supportive evidence that MSCs can reside in a perivascular niche, and a feasible novel approach for MSCs expansion."

This study was performed to determine its accuracy on a soft surface. Methods Four trials, trial 1: chest compressions on the floor using an accelerometer device; trial 2: chest compressions on the floor using an IR-UWB sensor; trial 3: chest compressions on a foam mattress using an accelerometer device; trial 4: chest compressions on a foam mattress using an IR-UWB sensor, were performed in a random order. In all the trials, a cardiopulmonary resuscitation provider delivered 50 uninterrupted chest compressions to a manikin. Results The CCD measured by the manikin and the device were as follows: 57.42 ± 2.23 and 53.92 ± 2.92 mm, respectively in trial 1 (p < 0.001); 56.29 ± 1.96 and 54.16 ± 3.90 mm, respectively in trial 2 (p < 0.001); 55.61 ± 1.57 and 103.48 ± 10.48 mm, respectively in trial 3 (p < 0.001); 57.14 ± 3.99 and 55.51 ± 3.39 mm, respectively in trial 4 (p = 0.012). The gaps between the CCD measured by the manikin and the devices (accelerometer device vs. IR-UWB sensor) on the floor were not different (3.50 ± 2.08 mm vs. 3.15 ± 2.27 mm, respectively, p = 0.136). However, the gaps were significantly different on the foam mattress (48.53 ± 5.65 mm vs. 4.10 ± 2.47 mm, p < 0.001). Conclusion The IR-UWB sensor could measure the CCD accurately both on the floor and on the foam mattress."
https://openalex.org/W2752376565,"Background Three variant formulations of a spatiotemporal shared component model are proposed that allow examination of changes in shared underlying factors over time. Methods Models are evaluated within the context of a case study examining hospitalisation rates for five chronic diseases for residents of a regional area in New South Wales: type II diabetes mellitus (DMII), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary arterial disease (CAD), hypertension (HT) and congestive heart failure (CHF) between 2001–2006. These represent ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) conditions, often used as a proxy for avoidable hospitalisations. Using a selected model, the effects of socio-economic status (SES) as a shared component are estimated and temporal patterns in the influence of the residual shared spatial component are examined. Results Choice of model depends upon the application. In the featured application, a model allowing for changing influence of the shared spatial component over time was found to have the best fit and was selected for further analyses. Hospitalisation rates were found to be increasing for COPD and DMII, decreasing for CHF and stable for CAD and HT. SES was substantively associated with hospitalisation rates, with differing degrees of influence for each disease. In general, most of the spatial variation in hospitalisation rates was explained by disease-specific spatial components, followed by the residual shared spatial component. Conclusion Appropriate selection of a joint disease model allows for the examination of temporal patterns of disease outcomes and shared underlying spatial factors, and distinction between different shared spatial factors."
https://openalex.org/W2752625512,"The maximum depth of sediment biomixing is directly related to the vertical extent of post-depositional environmental alteration in the sediment; consequently, it is important to determine the maximum burrowing depth. This study examined the maximum depth of bioturbation in a natural marine environment in Funakoshi Bay, northeastern Japan, using observations of bioturbation structures developed in an event layer (tsunami deposits of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake) and measurements of the radioactive cesium concentrations in this layer. The observations revealed that the depth of bioturbation (i.e., the thickness of the biomixing layer) ranged between 11 and 22 cm, and varied among the sampling sites. In contrast, the radioactive cesium concentrations showed that the processing of radioactive cesium in coastal environments may include other pathways in addition to bioturbation. The data also revealed the nature of the bioturbation by the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum (Echinoidea: Loveniidae), which is one of the important ecosystem engineers in seafloor environments. The maximum burrowing depth of E. cordatum in Funakoshi Bay was 22 cm from the seafloor surface."
https://openalex.org/W2751568380,"Reduced cerebral glucose utilization is found in aged individuals and often is an early sign of neurodegeneration. Here, we show that under glucose deprivation (GD) conditions, decreased expression of presenilin 1 (PS1) results in decreased neuronal survival, whereas increased PS1 increases neuronal survival. Inhibition of γ-secretase also decreases neuronal survival under GD conditions, which suggests the PS1/γ-secretase system protects neurons from GD-induced death. We also show that neuronal levels of the survival protein, phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes at ∼15 kDa (PEA15), and its mRNA are regulated by PS1/γ-secretase. Furthermore, down-regulation of PEA15 decreases neuronal survival under reduced glucose conditions, whereas exogenous PEA15 increases neuronal survival even in the absence of PS1, which indicates that PEA15 promotes neuronal survival under GD conditions. The absence or reduction of PS1, as well as γ-secretase inhibitors, increases neuronal miR-212, which targets PEA15 mRNA. PS1/γ-secretase activates the transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein, regulating miR-212, which targets PEA15 mRNA. Taken together, our data show that under conditions of reduced glucose, the PS1/γ-secretase system decreases neuronal losses by suppressing miR-212 and increasing its target survival factor, PEA15. These observations have implications for mechanisms of neuronal death under conditions of reduced glucose and may provide targets for intervention in neurodegenerative disorders.-Huang, Q., Voloudakis, G., Ren, Y., Yoon, Y., Zhang, E., Kajiwara, Y., Shao, Z., Xuan, Z., Lebedev, D., Georgakopoulos, A., Robakis, N.

The delicate changes in annulus shape and papillary muscle position throughout the cardiac cycle have significant impact on the stress distribution in the leaflets and chords, thus preservation of anatomically accurate positioning is critical. The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro method and apparatus for obtaining high-resolution 3D MRI images of porcine mitral valves in both the diastolic and systolic configurations with physiologically appropriate annular shape, papillary muscle positions and orientations, specific to the heart from which the valve was harvested. Positioning and mounting was achieved through novel, customized mounting hardware consisting of papillary muscle and annulus holders with geometries determined via pre-mortem ultrasonic intra-valve measurements. A semi-automatic process was developed and employed to tailor Computer Aided Design models of the holders used to mount the valve. All valve mounting hardware was 3D printed using a stereolithographic printer, and the material of all fasteners used were brass for MRI compatibility. The mounted valves were placed within a clear acrylic case, capable of holding a zero-pressure and pressurized liquid bath of a MRI-compatible fluid. Obtaining images from the valve submerged in liquid fluid mimics the natural environment surrounding the valve, avoiding artefacts due to tissue surface tension mismatch and gravitational impact on tissue shape when not neutrally buoyant. Fluid pressure was supplied by reservoirs held at differing elevations and monitored and controlled to within ±1mmHg to ensure that the valves remained steady. The valves were scanned in a 7 Tesla MRI system providing a voxel resolution of at least 80μm. The systematic approach produced 3D datasets of high quality which, when combined with physiologically accurate positioning by the apparatus, can serve as an important input for validated computational models."

An additional assessment was held at 12 weeks. Participants received transdermal rivastigmine (9.5 mg daily), lithium (400 mg twice daily, titrated progressively), or remained in a control group (no new medication). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in a global cognitive score (NPZ-7). Secondary endpoints included change in specific cognitive measures, domains, and functional parameters. Safety covered the frequency of adverse events and changes in laboratory results.Seventy-six subjects were screened, and 29 were finally enrolled. Better cognitive outcomes were observed in all groups, although there were no significant differences between the arms (mean NPZ-7 change [SD]): rivastigmine, 0.35 (0.14); lithium, 0.25 (0.40); control, 0.20 (0.44) (p = 0.78). The rivastigmine group showed the highest positive trend (mean NPZ-7 [SD], baseline vs week 48): rivastigmine, -0.47 (0.22) vs -0.11 (0.29), p = 0.06; lithium, -0.50 (0.40) vs -0.26 (0.21), p = 0.22; control, -0.52 (0.34) vs -0.32 (0.52), p = 0.44. The cognitive domains with the highest positive trends were information processing speed at week 12 and executive function at week 48 (rivastigmine vs control): information processing speed, 0.35 (0.64) vs -0.13 (0.25), p = 0.17, d = 0.96; and executive functioning, 0.73 (0.33) vs 0.03 (0.74), p = 0.09, d = 1.18. No relevant changes were observed regarding functional outcomes. A total of 12 (41%) individuals dropped out of the study: 2 (20%) were due to medication-related effects in the rivastigmine group and 4 (36%) in the lithium group. No severe adverse events were reported.The results from this small randomized trial indicate that transdermal rivastigmine did not provide significant cognitive benefits in people with HAND on stable antiretroviral therapy, even though positive trends were found in specific cognitive domains. Relevant tolerability issues were not observed."
https://openalex.org/W2751881154,"The adoptive transfer of effector T cells combined with lymphodepletion has demonstrated promising antitumor effects in mice and humans, although the availability of tumor-specific T cells is limited. We and others have also demonstrated that the transfer of polyclonal naïve T cells induces tumor-specific effector T cells and enhances antitumor immunity after lymphodepletion. Because tumors have been demonstrated to induce immunosuppressive networks and regulate the function of T cells, obtaining a sufficient number of fully functional naïve T cells that are able to differentiate into tumor-specific effector T cells remains difficult. To establish culture methods to obtain a large number of polyclonal T cells that are capable of differentiating into tumor-specific effector T cells, naïve T cells were activated with anti-CD3 mAbs in vitro. These cells were stimulated with IL-2 and IL-7 for the CD8 subset or with IL-7 and IL-23 for the CD4 subset. Transfer of these hyperexpanded T cells after lymphodepletion showed significant antitumor efficacy, and tumor-specific effector T cells were primed from these expanded T cells in tumor-bearing hosts. Moreover, these ex vivo—expanded T cells maintained T cell receptor diversity and showed long-term persistence of memory against specific tumors. Further analyses revealed that combination therapy consisting of vaccination with dendritic cells that were co-cultured with irradiated whole tumor cells and the transfer of ex vivo—expanded T cells significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. These results indicate that the transfer of ex vivo—expanded polyclonal T cells can be combined with other immunotherapies and augment antitumor effects."
https://openalex.org/W2752453505,"The rapid pace of bacterial evolution enables organisms to adapt to the laboratory environment with repeated passage and thus diverge from naturally-occurring environmental (“wild”) strains. Distinguishing wild and laboratory strains is clearly important for biodefense and bioforensics; however, DNA sequence data alone has thus far not provided a clear signature, perhaps due to lack of understanding of how diverse genome changes lead to convergent phenotypes, difficulty in detecting certain types of mutations, or perhaps because some adaptive modifications are epigenetic. Monitoring protein abundance, a molecular measure of phenotype, can overcome some of these difficulties. We have assembled a collection of Yersinia pestis proteomics datasets from our own published and unpublished work, and from a proteomics data archive, and demonstrated that protein abundance data can clearly distinguish laboratory-adapted from wild. We developed a lasso logistic regression classifier that uses binary (presence/absence) or quantitative protein abundance measures to predict whether a sample is laboratory-adapted or wild that proved to be ~98% accurate, as judged by replicated 10-fold cross-validation. Protein features selected by the classifier accord well with our previous study of laboratory adaptation in Y. pestis. The input data was derived from a variety of unrelated experiments and contained significant confounding variables. We show that the classifier is robust with respect to these variables. The methodology is able to discover signatures for laboratory facility and culture medium that are largely independent of the signature of laboratory adaptation. Going beyond our previous laboratory evolution study, this work suggests that proteomic differences between laboratory-adapted and wild Y. pestis are general, potentially pointing to a process that could apply to other species as well. Additionally, we show that proteomics datasets (even archived data collected for different purposes) contain the information necessary to distinguish wild and laboratory samples. This work has clear applications in biomarker detection as well as biodefense."
https://openalex.org/W2953144110,"Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or “latent” personality traits that explain broad patterns of behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g., factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4–10 months, 10 months–3 years, 3–6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; Tucker-Lewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate “aggressive personality” trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the atherosclerotic plaque burden in the carotid arteries of patients with acute coronary syndrome according to their glycemic status.Patients with acute coronary syndrome and no previous history of type 2 diabetes were consecutively included in the study. Glucose metabolism was evaluated with fasting glucose in plasma, HbA1c and a standard two-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries was evaluated with a standardized ultrasound examination where total plaque area was measured and patients classified as having no plaque or a significant plaque formation.A total of 245 acute coronary syndrome patients (male 78%, 64 years (SD: 10.9)) were included. The proportion diagnosed with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes was 28.6%, 64.1% and 7.3%, respectively. A significant atherosclerotic plaque was found in 48.5%, 66.9% and 72.2% of patients with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. An incremental increase in total plaque area was found from normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes (25.5%) and from normal glucose metabolism to type 2 diabetes (35.9%) (p = 0.04). When adjusted for conventional cardiovascular risk factors the OR of having significant atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries was 2.17 (95% CI 1.15-4.15) for patients with newly diagnosed dysglycemia compared to patients with normal glucose metabolism. When additionally adjusted for the 2-hour plasma glucose after glucose loading (2hPG) the OR attenuated to 1.77 (95% CI 0.83-3.84).Newly detected dysglycemia is an independent predictor of significant atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries with oral glucose tolerance test as a major determinant of carotid plaque burden in this group of individuals with acute coronary syndrome."

Through epigenomic analyses of multiple adipose depots, the transcription factor nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) is now shown to drive the brown fat genetic program through binding to lineage-specific cis-regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2752177277,"Phosphorylation-mediated negative feedback regulation of cAMP levels by phosphodiesterase is well-established in eukaryotic cells. However, such a mechanism remains unexplored in prokaryotes. We report here the involvement of eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr kinases, particularly PknA in trans-phosphorylating phosphodiesterase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mPDE), that resulted in decreased enzyme turnover rate compared with its unphosphorylated counterpart. To elucidate the role of mPDE phosphorylation in hydrolyzing cellular cAMP, we utilized a phosphodiesterase knock-out Escherichia coli strain, ΔcpdA, where interference of endogenous eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr kinases could be excluded. Interestingly, the mPDE-complemented ΔcpdA strain showed enhanced cAMP levels in the presence of PknA, and this effect was antagonized by PknA-K42N, a kinase-dead variant. Structural analysis of mPDE revealed that four Ser/Thr residues (Ser-20, Thr-22, Thr-182, and Thr-240) were close to the active site, indicating their possible role in phosphorylation-mediated alteration in enzymatic activity. Mutation of these residues one at a time to alanine or a combination of all four (mPDE-4A) affected catalytic activity of mPDE. Moreover, mPDE-4A protein in kinase assays exhibited reduction in its phosphorylation compared with mPDE. In consonance, phosphoproteins obtained after co-expression of PknA with mPDE/S20A/T240A/4A displayed decreased phospho-signal intensities in immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibodies. Furthermore, unlike mPDE, phospho-ablated mPDE-T309A protein exhibited impaired cell wall localization in Mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas mPDE-4A behaved similarly as wild type. Taken together, our findings establish mutually exclusive dual functionality of mPDE upon PknA-mediated phosphorylation, where Ser-20/Thr-240 influence enzyme activity and Thr-309 endorses its cell wall localization."
