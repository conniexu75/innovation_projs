https://openalex.org/W2066624199,"THE ORL1 receptor, an orphan receptor whose human1and murine2-8 complementary DNAs have recently been characterized, structurally resembles opioid receptors and is negatively coupled with adenylate cyclase1. ORL1 transcripts are particularly abundant in the central nervous system. Here we report the isolation, on the basis of its ability to inhibit the cyclase in a stable recombinant CHO(ORL1+) cell line, of a neuropeptide that resembles dynorphin A9 and whose amino acid sequence is Phe-Gly-Gly-Phe-Thr-Gly-Ala-Arg-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Ala-Asn-Gln. A rat-brain cDNA encodes the peptide flanked by Lys-Arg proteolytic cleavage motifs. The synthetic heptadecapeptide potently inhibits adenylate cyclase in CHO(ORL1+) cells in culture and induces hyperalgesia when administered intracerebroventricularly to mice. Taken together, these data indicate that the newly discovered heptadecapeptide is an endogenous agonist of the ORL1 receptor and that it may be endowed with pro-nociceptive properties."

https://openalex.org/W2088861631,"The unc-13 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans is essential for normal presynaptic function and encodes a large protein with C1- and C2-domains. In protein kinase C and synaptotagmin, C1- and/or C2-domains are regulatory domains for Ca2+, phospholipids, and diacylglycerol, suggesting a role for unc-13 in regulating neurotransmitter release. To determine if a similar protein is a component of the presynaptic machinery for neurotransmitter release in vertebrates, we studied unc-13 homologues in rat. Molecular cloning revealed that three homologues of unc-13 called Munc13-1, −13-2, and −13-3 are expressed in rat brain. Munc13s are large, brain-specific proteins with divergent N termini but conserved C termini containing C1- and C2-domains. Specific antibodies demonstrated that Munc13-1 is a peripheral membrane protein that is enriched in synaptosomes and localized to plasma membranes but absent from synaptic vesicles. Our data suggest that the function of unc-13 in C. elegans is conserved in mammals and that Munc13s act as plasma membrane proteins in nerve terminals. The presence of C1- and C2-domains in these proteins and the phenotype of the C. elegans mutants raise the possibility that Munc13s may have an essential signaling role during neurotransmitter release.

https://openalex.org/W2086941496,"EVOLUTIONARY theory has not explained how competition among lower level units is suppressed in the formation of higher-level evolutionary units1,2. For example, the key problem of early evolution is how small, individual replicators formed cooperative groups of sufficient complexity to allow accurate copying of the genetic material3. The puzzle is why parasites did not subvert the formation of cells by obtaining benetics benefits from the group without contributing to shared traits that enhance reproduction4. These parasites would outcompete other replicators within the cell, disrupting reproductive fairness among subunits and destroying the functional coherence of the group. A similar problem arose at a later evolutionary stage with the orderly mendelian segregation of subunits (chromosomes) within cells, and reproductive fairness continued to be a problem in the evolution of insect5 and human societies6. Here I present a simple model to show how reproductive fairness evolves among subunits to create functional coherence and higher-level units. Self-restraint, which evolves according to the kin-selection coefficient of relatedness, is not sufficient: mutual policing and enforcement of reproductive fairness are also required for the evolution of increasing social complexity."

https://openalex.org/W2043790932,"The dioxin receptor is a cytoplasmic basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim homology (bHLH/PAS) protein known to bind planar polycyclic ligands including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzoflavones, heterocyclic amines, and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. dioxins. Ligand-induced activation of the dioxin receptor initiates a process whereby the receptor is transformed into a nuclear transcription factor complex with a specific bHLH/PAS partner protein, Arnt. In analogy to the glucocorticoid receptor, the latent dioxin receptor is found associated with the molecular chaperone hsp90. We have defined and isolated a minimal ligand binding domain of the dioxin receptor from the central PAS region, comprising of amino acids 230 to 421, and found this domain to interact with hsp90 in vitro. Expression of the minimal ligand binding domain in wheat germ lysates or bacteria, systems which harbor hsp90 homologs unable to interact with the glucocorticoid or dioxin receptors, resulted in non-ligand binding forms of this minimal 230 to 421 fragment. Importantly, affinity of the minimal ligand binding domain for dioxin was similar to the affinity inherent in the full-length dioxin receptor, and a profile of ligand structures which specifically bound the minimal ligand binding domain was found to be conserved between this domain and the native receptor. These experiments show that the minimal ligand binding domain maintains the quantitative and qualitative aspects of ligand binding exhibited by the full-length receptor, implying that the central ligand binding pocket may exist to accommodate all classes of specific dioxin receptor ligands, and that this pocket is critically dependent upon hsp90 for its ligand binding conformation.

https://openalex.org/W1968709898,"The two type II topoisomerases in Escherichia coli, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase (Topo) IV, share considerable amino acid sequence similarity, yet they have distinctive topoisomerization activities. Only DNA gyrase can supercoil relaxed DNA, whereas during oriC DNA replication in vitro, only Topo IV can support the final stages of replication, processing of the late intermediate and decatenation of the daughter molecules. In order to develop an understanding for the basis of the differential activities of these two enzymes, we have initiated a characterization of Topo IV binding to DNA. We find that unlike gyrase, Topo IV neither constrains DNA in a positive supercoil when it binds nor protects a 150-base pair region of DNA from digestion with micrococcal nuclease. Consistent with this, DNase I footprinting experiments showed that Topo IV protected a 34-base pair region roughly centered about the topoisomerase-induced cleavage site. In addition, Topo IV preferentially bound supercoiled rather than relaxed DNA. Thus, the DNA binding characteristics of Topo IV are more akin to those of the type II eukaryotic enzymes rather than those of its prokaryotic partner.

Four DNA topoisomerases (Topos) 1The abbreviations used are: Topotopoisomerasebpbase pairPCRpolymerase chain reaction. have been identified in Escherichia coli. Topo I (encoded by topA; Refs. 1 and 2) and Topo III (encoded by topB; (3DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) are type I enzymes. DNA gyrase and Topo IV are type II enzymes. Both gyrase and Topo IV are composed of two subunits: GyrA and GyrB (4Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), respectively. DNA sequence analysis shows that parC and parE have significant homology with gyrA and gyrB, respectively. Whereas these two topoisomerases share some common biochemical features, they can catalyze different reactions in vitro(7Kato J. Nishimura Y. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol.

In an ATP-dependent fashion, gyrase can supercoil relaxed DNA, catenate and decatenate DNA rings, knot and unknot circular DNA, and convert positive supercoils directly to negative ones. Gyrase will relax negatively supercoiled DNA in the absence of ATP(10Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). All Topo IV-catalyzed reactions require ATP. Topo IV will relax both positive and negative supercoils, knot and unknot DNA, and decatenate DNA rings (7Kato J. Nishimura Y. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During DNA replication in vitro, only Topo IV is capable of supporting the terminal stages of replication, processing of the late intermediate 2H. Hiasa and K. J. Marians, unpublished data. and decatenation of the daughter molecules(8Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both gyrase and Topo IV can support nascent chain elongation during theta-type DNA replication in vitro(12Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has suggested that both Topo IV and gyrase are involved in chromosome decatenation(6Kato J. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 13Steck T.R. Drlica K. Cell. 1984; 36: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This was supported by the study of Bliska and Cozzarelli (14Bliska J.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) showing that gyrase was responsible for unlinking catenanes produced as a result of a recombination event. On the other hand, Adams et al.(9Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) showed that pBR322 replication catenanes accumulated at the nonpermissive temperature only in parC or parE strains, not in gyrA or gyrB strains. In order to supercoil DNA, gyrase must be able to pass strands in one direction; otherwise only relaxation would occur. The mechanisms of gyrase-catalyzed reactions and the interaction of the enzyme with DNA has been studied extensively(15Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). When bound to DNA, gyrase constrains about 150 bp of DNA about itself in a positive toroidal supercoil (16Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C.

A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the results of both nuclease protection experiments (17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and DNase I footprinting experiments(18Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This ability of gyrase to order DNA locally with respect to the site of DNA cleavage during strand passage likely accounts for its supercoiling ability. Both gyrase and Topo IV are targets for the quinolone and coumarin antibiotics(4Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4474-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 5Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74 (4767-4671)Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), yet in E. coli, resistance to these antibiotics arises only via mutation of the gyrase genes (21Ryan M.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Gross W.A. Deitz W.H. Cook T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Staudenbauer W.L.

Thus, although gyrase and Topo IV seem quite similar, their cellular functions are different. We have initiated an investigation into the mechanisms of the Topo IV topoisomerization activities in order to illuminate the structural basis for the differences in gyrase and Topo IV function. We find that unlike gyrase, Topo IV neither wraps DNA about itself nor distorts the path of the helix significantly on binding. Instead, the enzyme appears to bind a region of 34 bp centered about the cleavage site. Again, unlike gyrase, Topo IV prefers to bind supercoiled rather than relaxed DNA. Form I pBSM13 DNA (80 μg, Stratagene) was treated with DNase I (0.13 μg, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min at 30°C in a reaction mixture (400 μl) containing 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6 at 30°C), 125 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation after phenol extraction and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6 at 4°C) and 1 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 23°C), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 26 μM NAD, 10 ng/ml tRNA, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, form II pBSM13 DNA (0.4 μg), and the indicated amounts of either gyrase or Topo IV were incubated at 23°C for 20 min. E. coli DNA ligase (8 ng) was then added, and the reactions were continued for 1 h. EDTA, NaCl, SDS, and proteinase K were then added to 25 mM, 200 mM, 0.07%, and 3 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The DNA samples were then electrophoresed through 1.5% vertical agarose gels at 4 V/cm for 14 h in the presence of 13 μg/ml chloroquine phosphate using 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23°C), 40 mM NaOAc, and 1 mM EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. The DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Photonegatives of the gel were scanned using a Millipore BioImage Densitometer to determine the distribution of topoisomers. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 30°C), 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pBSM13 DNA labeled with 32P by nick translation (60 fmol), and the indicated amounts of either gyrase or Topo IV were incubated at 30°C for 20 min. The indicated amounts of micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K were then added to 50 mM, 0.2%, and 1 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. DNA products were then analyzed by electrophoresis through 7% polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) at 9 V/cm for 3.25 h using 89 mM Tris borate, 89 mM boric acid, and 1 mM EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3 M paper and visualized by autoradiography. The DNA substrate was prepared using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with plasmid pTH101 (25Hill T.M. Pelletier A.J. Tecklenburg M. Kuempel P.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as the template and the oligonucleotide primers KanXho (5′-TCGAGGCCGCGATTAAATTCCAAC-3′) and KanSma (5′-GGGGATCGCAGTGGTGAGTAACCA-3′), one of which was 5′32P-labeled using polynucleotide kinase. The resulting 276-bp DNA fragment, derived from sequences between the XhoI and SmaI cleavage sites in the kanamycin resistance gene on pTH101, spans a strong Topo IV cleavage site. The PCR products were gel purified before use. DNase I footprinting reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing the indicated amount of DNA fragment, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6 at 30°C), 6 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and the indicated amounts of Topo IV were incubated at 30°C for 3 min. The indicated amounts of DNase I (Pharmacia) were then added, and the incubation was continued for 30 s. A stop solution (20 μl) containing 100 mM EDTA and 125 μg/ml pBSM13 DNA was then added to terminate the reaction. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation after extraction with a phenol-CHCl3 mixture (1:1), resuspended in 6 μl of loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol ff) and electrophoresed through a 7% sequencing gel. The gel was dried onto Whatman 3 M paper and visualized by autoradiography. Dideoxy DNA sequence ladders were prepared using the labeled KanXho and KanSma oligonucleotides as primers and pTH101 DNA as template. pBSM13 and [3H]pBR322 form I DNA were purified as described by Marians et al.(26Marians K.J. Soeller W. Zipursky S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5656-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]pBR322 form I‘ and form III (linear) DNAs were prepared by treatment of form I DNA with E. coli Topo I and the EcoRI restriction endonuclease, respectively. EcoRI-linearized pBSM13 DNA was 32P-labeled using polynucleotide kinase for the experiment shown in Fig. 5. DNA binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing the indicated amount of DNA substrate, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6 at 30°C), 20 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated amounts of either gyrase or Topo IV were incubated at 30°C for 20 min. Washing buffer (1 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) was then added, and the reactions were passed through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) at 1 ml/min. The filters were then washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer. The filters were dried, and the radioactivity retained was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. DNA gyrase binds DNA in a very distinctive manner. The enzyme wraps roughly 150 bp of DNA about itself in a positive toroidal supercoil(15Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Three different types of assays were used to detect this. These were (i) assessment of the alteration in the topology of relaxed DNA upon gyrase binding(16Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), (ii) assessment of the extent of DNA protected from micrococcal nuclease digestion as a result of gyrase binding(17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and (iii) DNase I footprinting(17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We used these three assays to probe the mode of binding of Topo IV to DNA. In order to assess whether Topo IV alters the path of the helix in a significant fashion when it is bound to DNA, Topo IV was bound to singly nicked form II DNA. The nick was sealed with DNA ligase, and the DNA was deproteinized and analyzed by electrophoresis through agarose gels. If binding of the enzyme constrains supercoils, they will become locked into the DNA upon covalent closure of the nick. They can then be observed easily by gel electrophoresis. As reported previously for gyrase, binding of this enzyme to DNA resulted in the induction of supercoils after closure of the nick (Fig. 1, lanes 1-3). The photonegative of the stained gel was traced densitometrically to determine the shift in the position, compared with that in the absence of gyrase, of the center of the distribution of the topoisomers formed in the presence of gyrase. In this way, we could calculate that 0.5 superhelical turns were introduced to the DNA per bound gyrase tetramer. This is similar to the stoichiometry determined previously(16Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although not shown here, it has been determined previously that the superhelical turns induced by gyrase binding are positive(16Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The binding of Topo IV to the DNA resulted in a slight shift in the pattern of topoisomers toward a more positive distribution. This corresponded to the induction of 0.06 superhelical turns/Topo IV tetramer (Fig. 1, lanes 4-8). This was the case even at Topo IV to DNA ratios 4-fold higher than the ratio where gyrase-induced supercoiling was very obvious. Thus, it seemed unlikely that Topo IV was wrapping DNA about itself as gyrase does. Instead, it is possible that Topo IV unwinds duplex DNA somewhat upon binding. To confirm that Topo IV was not wrapping DNA about itself, we determined the extent of DNA protected from micrococcal nuclease digestion by Topo IV binding. As established originally for nucleosomes (27Noll M. Nature. 1974; 251: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), micrococcal nuclease will cut only in the spacer region between bound proteins. Thus, if a protein wraps DNA about itself, it should protect a significant region of the DNA from digestion by the nuclease. This is clearly observed for DNA gyrase. As reported previously(17Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), under protein to DNA ratios equivalent to one gyrase tetramer/200 bp of DNA, gyrase protected DNA in the size range of 110-160 bp from micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This is consistent with the ability of gyrase to wrap DNA about itself. No such protection was evident at a similar ratio of Topo IV to DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 3). At 5-fold higher ratios of topoisomerase to DNA, the same pattern of protected DNA was evident for gyrase (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas Topo IV protected a wide range of DNA varying in size between the limit products of the micrococcal nuclease digestion to about 700 bp (Fig. 2B, lane 3). The wide size range of DNA protected by Topo IV under these conditions is most likely indicative of the binding to the DNA of multiple Topo IV tetramers close enough together to exclude access of micrococcal nuclease to the DNA. In order to determine how large a region of DNA was bound by Topo IV, we performed DNase I footprinting. The substrate was a 276-bp DNA fragment made by PCR using plasmid pTH101 as a template. We had determined that this region of DNA had one major Topo IV cleavage site that could be observed in the absence of quinolones (data not shown). By 5′32P labeling each primer separately, we were able to easily observe the Topo IV footprint on each DNA strand. The results of the DNase I footprinting analysis (Fig. 3) showed that like all known type II topoisomerases, the Topo IV cleavage sites on the top (Fig. 3D) and the bottom (Fig. 3D) strands were staggered by 4 nt (Fig. 3C). Topo IV protected from DNase I digestion about 34 nt of DNA on each strand roughly centered about the cleavage site (Fig. 3, A-C). Because the cleavage site is staggered, this results in slightly asymmetric protection of the duplex from nuclease digestion. Thus, it seems that the mode of Topo IV binding to DNA is distinct from that of gyrase and is similar to that of the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases(28Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Lund K. Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The studies described in the previous section indicated that gyrase and Topo IV bound DNA differently. Gyrase binds preferentially to relaxed rather than supercoiled DNA(30Higgins N.P. Cozzarelli N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6833-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), consistent with supercoiling being its primary function. Because Topo IV has no supercoiling activity, it seemed likely that the enzyme would bind supercoiled DNA preferentially. This was investigated using nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Topo IV binding to supercoiled (form I), relaxed (form I′), and linear (form III) pBR322 DNAs was compared (Fig. 4). The form I‘ DNA was prepared by treatment of form I DNA with E. coli Topo I. The resultant preparation contained no detectable form I DNA and about 5% form II (nicked) DNA. The form III DNA was prepared by digestion of form I DNA with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease. KD was calculated according to Riggs et al.(31Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Topo IV bound to form I, I‘, and III DNAs with KD values of 0.6 nM, 3.3. nM, and 9.3 nM, respectively. Because these DNAs were topological isomers, the different affinities of Topo IV for them can only be attributed to their different topological states. Thus, as predicted, unlike gyrase, Topo IV clearly bound supercoiled DNA preferentially to relaxed DNA. This was confirmed by a competition binding experiment. Topo IV binding to form III 5′ [32P]pBSM13 DNA was competed by either unlabeled form I or form III pBSM13 DNA (Fig. 5A). Calculation of the amount of competitor needed to reduce binding to the [32P]-labeled DNA by 50% (Fig. 5, B and C) showed that an 18-fold higher molar excess of linear compared with supercoiled DNA was required. This was in good agreement with the nearly 16-fold difference in KD determined for binding of Topo IV to form I and III DNAs (Fig. 4). Whereas it was clear that Topo IV bound supercoiled DNA better than relaxed DNA, it also seemed that of the two types of relaxed DNA used in the binding experiments, Topo IV bound form I‘ DNA roughly 3-fold better that form III DNA. Because the only difference between these two DNA forms is that the latter has ends and the former does not, we considered whether the difference in binding affinities could be accounted for as a result of Topo IV molecules sliding off the linear form. A similar explanation was raised to account for the reduced binding affinity of the Drosophila type II enzyme to form III DNA compared with form I DNA(32Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments from Wang's lab (33Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) suggest that the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are possessed of an annular DNA binding site, and Sekiguchi and Shuman (35Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the vaccinia type I enzyme binds DNA circumferentially. Thus, we prepared [35S]Topo IV and measured its binding to form I‘ and form III DNAs by gel filtration. At very low concentrations of Topo IV (<5 nM), we observed 50% more Topo IV bound to form I‘ compared with form III. However, this difference was lost at higher concentrations (data not shown). Thus, whereas sliding of Topo IV off of form III DNA may account for some of the observed binding differences, it cannot account for the full effect. It is of course possible that the EcoRI cleavage used to generate the form III DNA disrupted a high affinity biding site. E. coli has two type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and the recently discovered Topo IV. Even though these enzymes share considerable amino acid sequence similarity(6Kato J. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), they support different reactions during DNA replication in vitro(8Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and appear to behave distinctively in vivo(9Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Both enzymes can support nascent chain elongation during oriC DNA replication reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins(8Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although only Topo IV can support the terminal stages of replication, processing of the late intermediate2 and decatenation of the linked daughter molecules(8Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Gyrase, but not Topo IV, has been implicated as the enzyme responsible for supporting chain elongation in vivo(36Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although conclusions based on the effects on DNA replication of the quinolone antibiotics (36Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) must now be considered questionable because both gyrase (4Gellert M. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

New Biol. 1991; 3: 687-697PubMed Google Scholar) and incompletely segregated nucleoids have been observed in gyrB mutant strains at the nonpermissive temperature(13Steck T.R. Drlica K. Cell. 1984; 36: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Adams et al.(9Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) demonstrated that catenated pBR322 daughter molecules arise at the nonpermissive temperature only in parC and parE strains, not in gyrA or gyrB strains. In order to better appreciate the basis for the differential action of these two topoisomerases, we have investigated the interaction between Topo IV and DNA. Binding of gyrase to DNA is distinctive. The enzyme wraps roughly 150 bp of DNA about itself in a positive toroidal supercoil(15Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this ordering of the DNA across the surface of the DNA cleavage site facilitates the vectorial strand passage required for supercoiling(42Morrison A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA bound to Topo IV in a manner more reflective of a eukaryotic type II topoisomerase than of gyrase. Topo IV protected a small region of 34 bp from attack by DNase I when bound to DNA. Given that the Stokes radius of Topo IV is 65 Å(11Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that the enzyme wraps DNA about itself. This is supported by the observation that the binding of Topo IV to DNA followed by the subsequent closure of the DNA into a ring did not result in the induction of positive supercoils, as was the case for gyrase(16Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, the size of the binding site of Topo IV on DNA is similar to that of the eukaryotic type II enzyme, which has an identical Stokes radius and protects 25-28 bp of DNA from nuclease digestion(28Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In spite of the different mode of binding to DNA, Topo IV and gyrase binding sites appear to be dictated by similar sequence features because they overlap considerably(11Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the different modes of DNA binding accounts for the observed difference in site preference(11Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filter binding studies showed that Topo IV bound supercoiled DNA preferentially compared with relaxed. This is opposite to the preference shown by DNA gyrase (30Higgins N.P. Cozzarelli N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6833-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but similar to the preference shown by the eukaryotic enzyme (32Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is in keeping with the inability of Topo IV to supercoil DNA. Thus, the net result of the interaction between closed circular DNA and Topo IV is the removal of turns of the duplex about itself. This, not surprisingly, has apparently resulted in the evolution of an enzyme that preferentially binds its substrate. The difference in binding site size between Topo IV and gyrase and the preferential binding of Topo IV to superhelical DNA helps to explain their differential action during the terminal stages of oriC plasmid DNA replication in vitro. The inability of gyrase to process the late intermediate or to decatenate the linked daughter molecules may derive partially from its large DNA binding site and preference for relaxed DNA. Gyrase is probably excluded from binding ahead of the replication forks in the late intermediate where there is only about 200 bp of unreplicated parental DNA available. This exclusionary feature would be considerably less severe for Topo IV. Likewise, because the intermolecular linkages between catenated daughter molecules are similar to supercoils in that they impart writhe to the helix(43Wasserman S.A. White J.H. Cozzarelli N.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10362-10368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Topo IV binding to these replication products should be considerably more stable than that of DNA gyrase. Interestingly, the difference in substrate binding preference exhibited between Topo IV and gyrase confounds an explanation for the observation that in laboratory strains of E. coli, resistance to nalidixic acid maps only to gyrA(22Gross W.A. Deitz W.H. Cook T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Staudenbauer W.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and gyrB(24Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because the chromosome is supercoiled, one might expect Topo IV rather than gyrase to be bound preferentially and to serve as the primary target for the drug. Thus, it is clear that considerable genetic and biochemical analysis of these two topoisomerases is required in order to understand the complex interactions between them and their role in the cell.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that mammals express multiple isoforms of RPRs. We screened a mouse genomic library using a PCR-amplified mouse RPR sequence as the probe. Three new genes encoding homologues of RNase P RNA (RPRH) were isolated and sequenced. All of these encode RNA molecules with a high degree of sequence identity to the human and mouse RPR genes published previously(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S.

Transcripts derived from one or more of these novel genes are expressed in murine cells, and multiple sizes of RPR-related transcripts are expressed in other mammalian species. The 305 base pairs of mouse RPR coding region was PCR-amplified with two primers (RP5′, ATAGGGCGGAGGAAGCTCATCA, and RP3′, ACCAAAAATGGGCGGAGGAGAGTAGTC) synthesized from the human RPR sequence(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 97-103Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). An 129SV mouse genomic library (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using the primer-extended RPR probe(20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Duplicate nylon membrane filters were lifted from the λ phage library plates, hybridized to the mouse RPR probe in 2 × PIPES/0.5% SDS/100 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml, and washed at low and high stringencies (i.e. 0.1 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate)/0.1% SDS at 57 or 62°C). The purified clones were further evaluated by a PCR-based assay using the RPR primers, RP5′ and RP3′. The λ clones that were positive by plaque hybridization but negative in a PCR assay (no amplification of a 305-base pair RPR fragment) were chosen for detailed analysis. DNA was prepared from those λ clones (21Grossberger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blot hybridization. DNA fragments containing RPRH sequences were subcloned into pBluescript or pUC18 vectors and sequenced using an automatic sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The sequencing data were compiled using DNASTAR (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI) and GCG programs (Genetic Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Total RNAs were isolated from cultured cells or animal tissues by CsCl gradient precipitation following direct lysis in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0(22Sambrook J.

The RNA samples were denatured in 50% formamide at 85°C, electrophoresed through 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 1 × TBE buffer (0.89 M Tris boric acid, 0.02 M EDTA, pH 8.3) and 8 M urea, electroblotted onto nylon membranes in 0.5 × TBE at 25 volts for 1 h using an electrotransferring apparatus (PROTEAN II, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and hybridized with RPR or RPRH cDNA probes as described previously (23Torroni A. Stepien G. Hodge J.A. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20589-20593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse Sol 8 myogenic cells, rat and rabbit kidney, and human WI-38 cells (a diploid cell line), digested with restriction enzymes, and electrophoresed through 0.8% agarose gels. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer as Northern blot hybridization. Filters were washed in 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS at various temperatures. Single-stranded DNA probes were prepared from the RPRH4 gene using a unique EcoRI site for end labeling. The probe for 5′ end mapping was made from a PCR fragment encompassing the RPRH4 gene, which was digested with EcoRI and labeled at the 5′ end by T4 kinase. The antisense DNA strand extending from nt 207 to nt 417 (numbered as in Fig. 2) was purified through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The probe for 3′ end mapping was made from a 950-base pair PvuII fragment containing the RPRH4 gene, which was used as the template for unidirectional PCR with an M13 forward primer. The antisense strand of the DNA fragment was replaced by the newly synthesized PCR strand that is 70 nucleotides shorter than the other strand. This DNA fragment with a 3′ protruding end was digested with EcoRI and labeled at 3′ ends using Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP. The 3′ labeled antisense strand DNA spanning the 3′ region of RPRH4 (nt 416-700) was purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. S1 nuclease mapping was performed following published methods(24Greene J.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.S. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 4.6.1-4.6.13Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA probes (105 cpm) were hybridized overnight with 30-40 μg of total cellular RNA in 5 μl of buffer containing 2 × PIPES/0.4 M NaCl/80% formamide at 30°C. The hybridization mixture was diluted and subjected to S1 nuclease digestion at 30°C for 1 h. The protected DNA fragments were resolved on sequencing gels. To assess the possibility that the mouse genome includes multiple genes homologous to RNase P RNA, we performed genomic Southern blot hybridization under various stringencies. Following digestion with each of several restriction enzymes, multiple bands remained after washing under high stringency conditions (Fig. 1). Because the cleavage sites of the restriction enzymes used in Fig. 1 are not present in the mouse 305-nt RPR sequence(19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we estimated, based on the number and intensity of the bands, that the mouse genome was likely to contain at least four RPR isogenes. Eight λ phage clones were isolated by screening a mouse genomic library. Restriction mapping and Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated that these λ clones contained murine DNA inserts that could be grouped into four nonoverlapping genomic sequences. Three of these clones included BamHI fragments of 0.95, 2.3, and 5.2 kilobase pairs, respectively (data not shown), identical in size to genomic BamHI fragments seen in the original Southern blots (Fig. 1). Approximately 1 kilobase pair from each of these three clones (termed RPRH2, RPRH3, and RPRH4) were sequenced in both orientations. A portion of the sequence data is shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, all three RPRH genes include a putative RNA coding region that is closely related to human and mouse RNase P RNA(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 97-103Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The putative RPRH transcripts start immediately following a TATA-like motif and end at a putative termination signal (TTTT) for transcription by RNA polymerase III. The predicted sizes of the transcribed products of these genes are 239 nt for RPRH2 and 238 nt for RPRH3 and RPRH4, as compared with 305 nt for the published RPR gene. Within the regions predicted to be transcribed, the three RPRH genes and RNase P RNA share 88-92% homology to each other. RPRH3 and RPRH4 are very closely related, not only throughout the RNA coding region but in the 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences as well. The RPRH2 gene only partially resembles RPRH3 and RPRH4 in the 5′ flanking region; the sequence similarity collapses entirely at positions more than 261 nt upstream from the putative transcriptional start site (Fig. 2). Proximal and distal enhancer elements characteristic of small RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (25Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Murphy S. Moorefield B. Pieler T. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and present in the human RPR gene(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 97-103Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Hannon G.J. Chubb A. Maroney P.A. Hannon G. Altman S. Nilsen T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22796-22799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could not be identified in any of the three RPRH genes, suggesting that expression of these genes may be controlled in a distinctive manner. Northern blot hybridization of total RNAs isolated from mouse tissues showed three major RNA species estimated to be 305, 248, and 238 nucleotides in length, respectively (Fig. 3). The largest RNA species matches the size of the published mouse RNase P RNA and uniformly gave the strongest hybridization signal. The 238-nt RNA species is coincident to the size predicted for transcript(s) encoded by one or more of the novel RPRH genes we have identified. The third RNA species (248 nt) is slightly larger than that predicted for RPRH gene transcripts but may arise from variations in the transcriptional start or termination sites. Other, smaller, RNA bands are inconsistently present and are likely to represent degradation products. Quantitation of the hybridization signals indicates that the 238- and 248-nt RNAs are at least 3-fold more abundant in kidney and liver than in heart and skeletal muscle, whereas the 305-nt RNA is expressed at relatively high levels in all tissues. To verify that the 238- and 248-nt RNAs are indeed transcribed from RPRH gene(s) and not generated by partial degradation of the 305 nt of RNase P RNA, we performed S1 nuclease protection mapping using two single-stranded antisense DNA probes prepared from the RPRH4 gene (Fig. 4). The 5′ end protection probe, extending 210 nucleotides upstream from the EcoRI site, detected two transcription start sites (Fig. 4A). One of the start sites is located at 127/126 nt upstream from the EcoRI site, a position that corresponds to the 5′ end of the 238-nt RNA transcript predicted from the RPRH4 gene. The other start site is located 135-138 nt from the EcoRI site, corresponding to the 5′ end of a 248-nt RNA transcript predicted from RPRH4 gene. The 3′ end protection probe, extending 347 nucleotides downstream from the EcoRI site, detected a RNA transcript ending 112 nt downstream from the EcoRI site (Fig. 4B), consistent with the predicted 3′ end of RPRH4 transcript. These fragments of probes based on the RPRH4 gene, when bound to their complementary RNA sequences from murine cells, were resistant to high concentrations of S1 nuclease, providing evidence that the 238- and 248-nt RNA species are not degradation products of the 305-nt RPR transcript but bona fide products of the RPRH4 gene. The 3′ end analysis further supports this conclusion in that the predicted hybridization product formed between the RPRH4 probe, and the 305-nt RPR transcript (115 nt) is present and abundant at low concentrations of S1 nuclease (Fig. 4B) but disappears at the higher concentrations of S1 nuclease necessary to digest single base mismatches with the probe. Spatial relationships between these probes and transcripts derived from the RPR and RPRH4 genes are summarized in Fig. 4C. To investigate the distribution of the RPR-homologous genes in other mammalian species, we performed genomic Southern blot hybridization by using restriction enzymes that do not cut the published RPR sequences(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 97-103Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses demonstrated that multiple bands are present in rat and rabbit DNAs digested by various enzymes (Fig. 5, A and B). We estimate that rat, like mouse, has four RPR isogenes and that rabbit has at least two RPR isogenes. The human RPR cDNA detected at least two bands (Fig. 5C): a strong band corresponding to the RNase P RNA gene and a weak band that may represent a RPR-related gene. Northern blot hybridization using the mouse and human RPR sequence to probe RNAs isolated from rat, rabbit, and human cells also revealed at least two major RPR isoforms in each of these mammalian species: a larger RPR that corresponds to the 305 nt form in the mouse, and a smaller and less abundant form that corresponds to the RPRH transcripts we have identified in murine cells (Fig. 6). When human RNA and genomic DNA were probed with the mouse, instead of human, RPR sequence, only the RNase P RNA but not the RPR homologues was detected (data not shown), suggesting that the human RPRH is more diverged from the RNase P RNA than those in mouse, rat, and rabbit. In summary, these data indicate that most, if not all, mammalian species contain and express multiple genes encoding isoforms of RNase P RNA. Genes encoding an RNase P RNA were cloned previously from human and mouse and encode transcripts ranging from 305 nt in mice to 341 nt in humans(18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 97-103Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have cloned three new murine genes homologous to the published RPR sequence but predicted to generate shorter RNA transcripts. Each of these RPRH genes includes a segment almost identical (88-92%) to the 5′ region of the previously described mouse RPR sequence but truncated by the presence of a transcriptional termination signal at a position corresponding approximately to nt 240 of the 305-nt RPR. Two lines of evidence rule out the possibility that these genes are derived from a cloning artifact. First, BamHI fragments of λ clones that contain RPRH genes are matched in size to BamHI fragments detected in a mouse genomic Southern blot. Second, two of the novel RPRH gene sequences (RPRH2 and RPRH4) were present in two or more independent λ clones containing overlapping mouse genomic DNA fragments and an identical RPRH sequence. Other data demonstrate that the RPRH sequences that we have identified are not pseudogenes. Transcripts corresponding in size to the products predicted from RPRH genes are present in murine cells, and nuclease protection experiments confirm that the shorter forms of RPR-homologous RNA observed in Northern blots are not degradation products of the 305-nt RPR. Short forms of RPR-homologous RNA also are present in rat, rabbit, and human cells. The structure and function of RNase P RNAs have been studied by computer modeling(28Westhof E. Altman S. Proc.

Although the size and sequence of RNase P RNAs have diverged considerably during evolution, a similar three-dimensional structure appears to be conserved(1Altman S. Meister A. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 1-35Google Scholar, 2Darr S.C. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Trends Biochem.

The 305-nt mouse RPR is predicted to have the core structure common to other RNase P RNAs, which includes three major rings formed by internal base pairing(19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure is established through base pairing between the rings(19Altman S. Welsolowski D. Puranam R.S. Genomics. 1993; 18: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because of their shorter length, mouse RPRH transcripts may form only two of the three rings of the common RNase P RNA core structure. The functional properties of RPRH transcripts in mammalian cells have not yet been determined. Truncated forms of human RPRs retain enzymatic activity in reconstitution assays in vitro(35Gold H.A. Altman S. Cell. 1986; 44: 243-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that RPRH transcripts potentially serve as functional components of holoenzyme complexes. An interesting alternative possibility is that these naturally occurring truncated forms of RNase P RNA may be capable of binding to the apoprotein constituents of RNase P ribonucleoprotein complexes but are enzymatically inactive due to the disruption of the RNA tertiary structure. In this way, RPRH gene products could function as negative regulators of RNase P. It should be possible, in future studies, to assess the functional characteristics of the RPRH gene products that we have identified, as well as their protein subunit and subcellular distribution. Because yeast expresses different forms of RNase P RNA in mitochondria and the nucleus(4Miller D.L. Martin N.C. Cell. 1983; 34: 911-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Lee J. Engelke D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2536-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.-Y. Rohlman C.E. Molony L.A. Engelke D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 21-30Google Scholar), perhaps one or more of the RPRH transcripts will have a similarly compartmentalized function. Comparison of the primary sequences of the previously defined mouse RPR gene and the new RPRH genes also suggests certain interesting possibilities concerning their evolutionary origins. An analysis using a Jotun Hein alignment method (DNASTAR), as shown in Table 1, indicates that all three RPRH genes are clearly related to each other but diverge considerably from the RPR gene downstream of their 3′ transcriptional termination signals. Within the group of RPRH genes, RPRH2 has diverged from the RPRH3 and RPRH4 genes both within the transcribed regions and within flanking sequences, whereas the latter two genes are almost identical throughout the entire 1-kilobase pair region we sequenced. These comparisons suggest that the present diversity within this gene family has arisen from sequential gene duplication events.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In summary, three novel genes encoding sequences homologous to RNase P RNA have been isolated from a mouse genomic library. Transcripts derived from one or more of these RPRH genes are expressed in murine cells, and multiple sizes of RPR-related transcripts are present in other mammalian species as well. We conclude that higher vertebrates express multiple isoforms of RNase P RNA."
