https://openalex.org/W2041191257,"Margaret Goodell, Wei Li and colleagues report conditional ablation of the Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferase in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice. They show that Dnmt3a is critical for epigenetic silencing of HSC regulatory genes and for HSC differentiation. Loss of the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in embryonic stem cells obstructs differentiation; however, the role of these enzymes in somatic stem cells is largely unknown. Using conditional ablation, we show that Dnmt3a loss progressively impairs hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation over serial transplantation, while simultaneously expanding HSC numbers in the bone marrow. Dnmt3a-null HSCs show both increased and decreased methylation at distinct loci, including substantial CpG island hypermethylation. Dnmt3a-null HSCs upregulate HSC multipotency genes and downregulate differentiation factors, and their progeny exhibit global hypomethylation and incomplete repression of HSC-specific genes. These data establish Dnmt3a as a critical participant in the epigenetic silencing of HSC regulatory genes, thereby enabling efficient differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2016364569,"Despite tremendous efforts, development of an effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has proved an elusive goal. Recently, however, numerous antibodies have been identified that are capable of neutralizing most circulating HIV strains. These antibodies all exhibit an unusually high level of somatic mutation, presumably owing to extensive affinity maturation over the course of continuous exposure to an evolving antigen. Although substantial effort has focused on the design of immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies de novo that would target similar epitopes, it remains uncertain whether a conventional vaccine will be able to elicit analogues of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies. As an alternative to immunization, vector-mediated gene transfer could be used to engineer secretion of the existing broadly neutralizing antibodies into the circulation. Here we describe a practical implementation of this approach, which we call vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), which in mice induces lifelong expression of these monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations from a single intramuscular injection. This is achieved using a specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized for the production of full-length antibody from muscle tissue. We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2171396537,"Hakon Hakonarson and colleagues report a genome-wide copy number variation study in 3,506 cases of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The authors identify a statistically significant enrichment of CNVs impacting metabotropic glutamate receptor genes. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, heritable neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology. We performed a whole-genome copy number variation (CNV) study on 1,013 cases with ADHD and 4,105 healthy children of European ancestry using 550,000 SNPs. We evaluated statistically significant findings in multiple independent cohorts, with a total of 2,493 cases with ADHD and 9,222 controls of European ancestry, using matched platforms. CNVs affecting metabotropic glutamate receptor genes were enriched across all cohorts (P = 2.1 × 10−9). We saw GRM5 (encoding glutamate receptor, metabotropic 5) deletions in ten cases and one control (P = 1.36 × 10−6). We saw GRM7 deletions in six cases, and we saw GRM8 deletions in eight cases and no controls. GRM1 was duplicated in eight cases. We experimentally validated the observed variants using quantitative RT-PCR. A gene network analysis showed that genes interacting with the genes in the GRM family are enriched for CNVs in ∼10% of the cases (P = 4.38 × 10−10) after correction for occurrence in the controls. We identified rare recurrent CNVs affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission genes that were overrepresented in multiple ADHD cohorts."

https://openalex.org/W2004095656,"Len Pennacchio, Axel Visel and colleagues use an epigenomic approach to identify a large number of candidate enhancers from human heart tissue. This work will facilitate further studies into the role of enhancers in human cardiac development and disease. Development and function of the human heart depend on the dynamic control of tissue-specific gene expression by distant-acting transcriptional enhancers. To generate an accurate genome-wide map of human heart enhancers, we used an epigenomic enhancer discovery approach and identified ∼6,200 candidate enhancer sequences directly from fetal and adult human heart tissue. Consistent with their predicted function, these elements were markedly enriched near genes implicated in heart development, function and disease. To further validate their in vivo enhancer activity, we tested 65 of these human sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay and observed that 43 (66%) drove reproducible reporter gene expression in the heart. These results support the discovery of a genome-wide set of noncoding sequences highly enriched in human heart enhancers that is likely to facilitate downstream studies of the role of enhancers in development and pathological conditions of the heart."

https://openalex.org/W2016596781,"Discriminating among sensory stimuli is critical for animal survival. This discrimination is particularly essential when evaluating whether a stimulus is noxious or innocuous. From insects to humans, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are key transducers of thermal, chemical and other sensory cues. Many TRPs are multimodal receptors that respond to diverse stimuli, but how animals distinguish sensory inputs activating the same TRP is largely unknown. Here we determine how stimuli activating Drosophila TRPA1 are discriminated. Although Drosophila TRPA1 responds to both noxious chemicals and innocuous warming, we find that TRPA1-expressing chemosensory neurons respond to chemicals but not warmth, a specificity conferred by a chemosensory-specific TRPA1 isoform with reduced thermosensitivity compared to the previously described isoform. At the molecular level, this reduction results from a unique region that robustly reduces the channel's thermosensitivity. Cell-type segregation of TRPA1 activity is critical: when the thermosensory isoform is expressed in chemosensors, flies respond to innocuous warming with regurgitation, a nocifensive response. TRPA1 isoform diversity is conserved in malaria mosquitoes, indicating that similar mechanisms may allow discrimination of host-derived warmth--an attractant--from chemical repellents. These findings indicate that reducing thermosensitivity can be critical for TRP channel functional diversification, facilitating their use in contexts in which thermal sensitivity can be maladaptive."
https://openalex.org/W2007222284,"Historically, the completeness of quantum theory has been questioned using the concept of bipartite continuous variable entanglement. The non-classical correlations (entanglement) between the two subsystems imply that the observables of one subsystem are determined by the measurement choice on the other, regardless of their distance. Nowadays, continuous variable entanglement is regarded as an essential resource allowing for quantum enhanced measurement resolution, the realization of quantum teleportation and quantum memories, or the demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. These applications rely on techniques to manipulate and detect coherences of quantum fields, the quadratures. While in optics coherent homodyne detection of quadratures is a standard technique, for massive particles a corresponding method was missing. Here we report on the realization of an atomic analog to homodyne detection for the measurement of matter-wave quadratures. The application of this technique to a quantum state produced by spin-changing collisions in a Bose-Einstein condensate reveals continuous variable entanglement, as well as the twin-atom character of the state. With that we present a new system in which continuous variable entanglement of massive particles is demonstrated. The direct detection of atomic quadratures has applications not only in experimental quantum atom optics but also for the measurement of fields in many-body systems of massive particles."

https://openalex.org/W2020536272,"Herein we describe a high-throughput fluorescence and HPLC-based methodology for global profiling of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in biological systems. The combined use of HPLC and fluorescence detection is key to successful implementation and validation of this methodology. Included here are methods to specifically detect and quantitate the products formed from interaction between the ROS/RNS species and the fluorogenic probes, as follows: superoxide using hydroethidine, peroxynitrite using boronate-based probes, nitric oxide-derived nitrosating species with 4,5-diaminofluorescein, and hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants using 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex® Red) with and without horseradish peroxidase, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate real-time monitoring of ROS/RNS in activated macrophages using high-throughput fluorescence and HPLC methods. This global profiling approach, simultaneous detection of multiple ROS/RNS products of fluorescent probes, developed in this study will be useful in unraveling the complex role of ROS/RNS in redox regulation, cell signaling, and cellular oxidative processes and in high-throughput screening of anti-inflammatory antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2081978376,"Sustaining a high growth rate requires tumors to exploit resources in their microenvironment. One example of this is the extensive angiogenesis that is a typical feature of high-grade gliomas. Here, we show that expression of the constitutively active mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, ΔEGFR (EGFRvIII, EGFR*, de2-7EGFR) is associated with significantly higher expression levels of the pro-angiogenic factor interleukin (IL)-8 in human glioma specimens and glioma stem cells. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of ΔEGFR in different glioma cell lines caused up to 60-fold increases in the secretion of IL-8. Xenografts of these cells exhibit increased neovascularization, which is not elicited by cells overexpressing wild-type (wt)EGFR or ΔEGFR with an additional kinase domain mutation. Analysis of the regulation of IL-8 by site-directed mutagenesis of its promoter showed that ΔEGFR regulates its expression through the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-κB, activator protein 1 (AP-1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Glioma cells overexpressing ΔEGFR showed constitutive activation and DNA binding of NF-κB, overexpression of c-Jun and activation of its upstream kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and overexpression of C/EBPβ. Selective pharmacological or genetic targeting of the NF-κB or AP-1 pathways efficiently blocked promoter activity and secretion of IL-8. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of either IL-8 or the NF-κB subunit p65, in ΔEGFR-expressing cells attenuated their ability to form tumors and to induce angiogenesis when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. On the contrary, the overexpression of IL-8 in glioma cells lacking ΔEGFR potently enhanced their tumorigenicity and produced highly vascularized tumors, suggesting the importance of this cytokine and its transcription regulators in promoting glioma angiogenesis and tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W2000499608,"High-conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels function in many physiological processes that link cell membrane voltage and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, including neuronal electrical activity, skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, and hair cell tuning. Like other voltage-dependent K(+) channels, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels open when the cell membrane depolarizes, but in contrast to other voltage-dependent K(+) channels, they also open when intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations rise. Channel opening by Ca(2+) is made possible by a structure called the gating ring, which is located in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have defined the Ca(2+)-free, closed, conformation of the gating ring, but the Ca(2+)-bound, open, conformation is not yet known. Here we present the Ca(2+)-bound conformation of the gating ring. This structure shows how one layer of the gating ring, in response to the binding of Ca(2+), opens like the petals of a flower. The degree to which it opens explains how Ca(2+) binding can open the transmembrane pore. These findings present a molecular basis for Ca(2+) activation of K(+) channels and suggest new possibilities for targeting the gating ring to treat conditions such as asthma and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2050599698,"We reveal a novel pro-survival role for mammalian p38α in response to H2O2, which involves an up-regulation of antioxidant defenses. The presence of p38α increases basal and H2O2-induced expression of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide-dismutase 1 (SOD-1), SOD-2, and catalase through different mechanisms, which protects from reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and prevents cell death. p38α was found to regulate (i) H2O2-induced SOD-2 expression through a direct regulation of transcription mediated by activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and (ii) H2O2-induced catalase expression through regulation of protein stability and mRNA expression and/or stabilization. As a consequence, SOD and catalase activities are higher in WT MEFs. We also found that this p38α-dependent antioxidant response allows WT cells to maintain an efficient activation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Accordingly, the loss of p38α leads to ROS accumulation in response to H2O2, which causes cell death and inactivation of mTOR/p70S6K signaling. This can be rescued by either p38α re-expression or treatment with the antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine, or exogenously added catalase.

This activation leads to a great variety of biological responses, including cell death or survival. Hence, although the stress MAP kinases can induce apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

In fact, it is well known that p38α MAPK plays an important role in mediating apoptosis (4Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M.

Initially, stress signaling mechanisms are pro-survival systems because they tend to repair damage before committing cells to death or senescence. Interestingly, p38α can mediate survival upon activation with H2O2 (10Gutiérrez-Uzquiza A. Arechederra M. Molina I. Baños R. Maia V. Benito M. Guerrero C. Porras A.

Models, mechanisms and clinical evidence for cancer dormancy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms by which p38 signaling achieves cell survival are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that Akt activity is negatively regulated by p38α (15Zuluaga S.

Negative regulation of Akt activity by p38α MAP kinase in cardiomyocytes involves membrane localization of PP2A through interaction with caveolin-1.Cell.

Akt determines replicative senescence and oxidative or oncogenic premature senescence and sensitizes cells to oxidative apoptosis.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 458-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) showed that Akt activation sensitized cells to oxidative stress through down-regulation of ROS scavengers leading to the accumulation of intracellular ROS and cell death. Therefore, we hypothesized that p38α, through inhibition of Akt, might allow a proper expression of antioxidant genes and cell survival. Thus, we analyzed the precise function of p38α in the regulation of the cell fate using nontransformed WT and p38α−/− MEFs exposed to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms involved in the regulation of antioxidant responses, in the context of Akt/mTOR signaling, as well as other pathways linked to ROS level regulation. WT and p38α-deficient MEFs, immortalized either by passages or by LTAg (Large T Antigen) expression, were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For signaling experiments, confluent cells were stimulated with 0.1–1 mm H2O2 for 20 min. For cell death analysis, growing cells were treated with 0.1–1 mm H2O2 for 6–24 h. The mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin was used at a concentration of 1–10 μm. The cells were treated with the following antioxidants to decrease intracellular levels of ROS and/or to metabolize H2O2: 50 units/ml of catalase (Sigma; C-1345) and 2.5 mm N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma; A-9165). The antioxidants were added 1 h before H2O2 treatment. To inhibit transcription, the cells were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma; A9415) at 5 μg/ml. To block proteasome-dependent proteins degradation cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at 1 μm. To re-express p38α MAPK in p38α−/− MEFs or to express WT and constitutive active p70S6K, transient transfections were performed using Metafectene-Pro and the following constructs containing: (i) human p38α cDNA cloned into the EcoRI site of the pEFmlink expression vector (4Porras A. Zuluaga S. Black E. Valladares A. Alvarez A.M. Ambrosino C. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by different stimuli.Mol. Biol.

Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Multiple independent inputs are required for activation of the p70 S6 kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The protocol supplied by the manufacturer was followed using 7 μl/1 μg of DNA/dish (20.000 cells). The cell assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Transfections of cells with siRNA targeting ATF-2 (Cell Signaling; 6433) or a control scrambled siRNA (Ambion) diluted in medium without serum at a final concentration of 50 nm were performed using siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Trypsinized cells were resuspended and overlaid onto the transfection complexes. After 24 h under normal cell culture conditions, protein and RNA was isolated, or cell viability was quantified. To assess SOD-2 promoter activity upon H2O2 treatment in WT and p38α−/− MEFs, the cells were cotransfected with a construct containing the SOD-2 promoter coupled to luciferase reporter (kindly provided by Daret St. Clair, Kentucky University) and a plasmid-encoding Renilla luciferase (Clontech) (100–500 ng). Then cells were treated with H2O2 0.5 mm for 4 and 8 h and lysed using the passive lysis buffer from Promega. Luciferase activity was detected with a luminometer (Molecular Devices Spectramax M5E) using a dual luciferase reporter kit from Promega following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Western blot analysis was carried out as previously described using total cell extracts (15Zuluaga S. Alvarez-Barrientos A.

Negative regulation of Akt activity by p38α MAP kinase in cardiomyocytes involves membrane localization of PP2A through interaction with caveolin-1.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis using Anderson gels (or SDS-PAGE gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were probed with the following antibodies: Akt (Cell Signaling; 9272), catalase (Sigma; C-0979), p70S6K (Cell Signaling; 9202), p38α (Santa Cruz; sc-535), phospho-acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (Cell Signaling; 3661), phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling; 9271), phospho-AMPK (Cell Signaling; 2531), phospho-MKK3/6 (Cell Signaling; 9231), SOD-2 (Upstate Biotech; 06-984), TSC-1 (Cell Signaling; 4906), phospho-TSC-2 (Cell Signaling; 3615), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling; 9211), phospho-p70S6K (Cell Signaling; 4376), anti-HA Clone 16 B12 (Covance; MMS-101P), phospho-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling; 9221), ATF-2 (Cell Signaling; 9226), and α-tubulin (Sigma; T-5168). Catalase activity was measured by quantification of peroxide decomposition in a 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7 containing 3 mm H2O2. This was monitored spectrophotometrically at 240 nm. SOD activity from cell extracts was quantified using a kit (BioVision, reference number K335-100), where WST-1 (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4-disulfo-phenyl)-2H tetrazolium, monosodium salt) is the substrate. WST-1 produces a water-soluble formazan dye upon its reduction with superoxide anion, which can be monitored spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. The rate of the reduction is linearly related to the xanthine oxidase activity and inhibited by SOD, so the IC50 of SOD is determined as a measure of SOD activity. After the isolation of total RNA with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen; 74104), 1–3 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScrip III RT kit (Qiagen; 18080) to generate cDNA. Then PCR analysis was performed using specific primers: for SOD-1: forward, 5′GATGAAGAGAGGCATGTTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCAATGATGCAATGGTCTCC-3′ (n141–n160 and n554–n573, respectively; accession number 000082.5); and for SOD-2: forward, 5′TGGGGCTGGCTTGGCTTCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′GCGTGCTCCCACACGTCAAT-3′ (n646–n665 and n751–n770, respectively; accession number 000083.5). The amplified bands were normalized using internal control: GAPDH, forward, 5′-CATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGT TGG-3′ in the same PCR. The conditions for the PCR were: 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. Quantitative analysis of catalase mRNA levels was performed by real time PCR using SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science) and the following specific primers: forward, 5′-GTCACCGGCACATGAATGGCT-3′ (n738–n759), and reverse, 5′-TGATGCCCTGGTCGGTCTTGT-3′ (n817–n839) using GAPDH primers (referred above) to normalize. ChIP assay was performed essentially as described previously (18Ferreiro I. Barragan M. Gubern A. Ballestar E. Joaquin M. Posas F. The p38 SAPK is recruited to chromatin via its interaction with transcription factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31819-31828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (3 × 106) were fixed in 1% formaldehyde solution (15 min) to cross-link DNA with associated proteins. The cross-linking reaction was finished by the addition of 125 mm glycine (5 min), and cells were washed and harvested in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The pelleted cells were lysed on ice in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Then cells were sonicated 10 seconds × 6 (at level 4 and 40% of potency). DNA was fragmented in a range of 200–600 bp. Equal amounts of chromatin were diluted in ChIP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a P-ATF-2 antibody or a rabbit IgG (negative control), followed by 1 h of incubation with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads. 10% of the sample was kept as an input. Then samples were centrifuged, and protein A-agarose beads pellets were sequentially washed with a low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl); a high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl); a LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1); and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Protein-DNA complexes were eluted in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. Then cross-linking was reversed by incubation in 200 mm NaCl for 4 h at 65 °C followed by incubation in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 20 μg of proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C to eliminate proteins. DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and analyzed by PCR using primers for AP-1 site (positions 844–853) from mouse SOD-2 promoter: forward, 5′-GCAAGCAGCAGAACTCGCAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGCACTCAGGAGGCAGAGGCA-3′. Inputs were also analyzed by PCR. Cell viability was assayed through staining of adhered (viable) cells with crystal violet. The cells were washed with PBS, incubated with a crystal violet solution (0.2%, w/v) for 20 min, washed, and dried. Stained cells were lysed in 1% SDS, and absorbance at 560 nm was measured. Apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle. The cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed with cold ethanol (70% v/v). Then they were washed, resuspended in PBS, and incubated with RNase (25 μg/106 cells) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 0.05% propidium iodide, the cells were analyzed in the cytometer. The percentage of cells in sub-G1 was determined and considered as apoptotic. To analyze condensed and fragmented nuclei, characteristic of apoptosis, they were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m EDTA supplemented with 5 μg/ml RNase) (19del Castillo G.

Apoptotic indices were calculated after counting 500–1,000 cells/treatment in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon). The cells were incubated with 5 μm 2′,7′-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH) (Sigma; 35845) in PBS for 30–60 min and then treated with H2O2 (0.1–1 mm) for 15 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and analyzed in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE300; Nikon). The data are represented as the means ± S.E. The comparisons were made between two experimental groups. An unpaired Student's t test was used, and alternatively, an analysis of variance test was carried out for comparisons of more than two experimental groups. We first tested viability of WT and p38α Knock-out MEFs in response to a level of oxidative stress able to generate damage but not massive toxicity. As shown in Fig. 1A, WT MEFs exhibited a higher resistance to H2O2 (0.1–0.5 mm) than p38α-deficient MEFs. This suggests that p38α allows cells to survive under mild levels of oxidative stress. This was confirmed by p38α reconstitution in p38α−/− cells, which increased cell viability in response to H2O2 up to the levels observed in WT cells (Fig. 1B). The morphological analysis of nuclei showed a significantly higher number of condensed and/or fragmented nuclei in p38α-deficient MEFs than in WT cells upon H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1C), which suggests that cells would be dying by apoptosis. These data demonstrate that p38α protects from low levels of H2O2-induced cell death. Akt is involved in the activation of mTORC1 through the phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC-2, which inhibits mTOR through inhibition of Rheb (20Dann S.G. Selvaraj A.

Med. 2007; 13: 252-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 21Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Akt activity is negatively regulated by p38α (15Zuluaga S. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Gutiérrez-Uzquiza A. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Negative regulation of Akt activity by p38α MAP kinase in cardiomyocytes involves membrane localization of PP2A through interaction with caveolin-1.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), so that Akt is hyperactivated in p38α−/− cells, leading to increased survival in response to serum deprivation (15Zuluaga S. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Gutiérrez-Uzquiza A. Benito M. Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Negative regulation of Akt activity by p38α MAP kinase in cardiomyocytes involves membrane localization of PP2A through interaction with caveolin-1.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, whether this has any effect on ROS sensitivity remains unknown. Recently, Nogueira et al. (16Nogueira V. Park Y. Chen C.C. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Tonic I. Unterman T. Hay N. Akt determines replicative senescence and oxidative or oncogenic premature senescence and sensitizes cells to oxidative apoptosis.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 458-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) showed that Akt activation sensitized cells to oxidative stress through down-regulation of ROS scavengers, which increased intracellular ROS. This led us to hypothesize that p38α, through inhibition of Akt, might allow a proper expression of antioxidant genes. Thus, we next tested the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in response to H2O2 in WT and p38α-deficient MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2A, Akt phosphorylation in response to H2O2 (0.1–1 mm) was higher (particularly, at 0.5 mm) in p38α−/− than in WT MEFs. Surprisingly, this activation was uncoupled from mTOR-mediated p70S6K phosphorylation in Thr-389, because phosphorylation at this site was markedly reduced in p38α-deficient cells. Under these conditions, p38α was activated by H2O2 in WT cells, whereas in p38α−/− MEFs another p38 isoform with a higher mobility was slightly activated (Fig. 2A). Therefore, these data suggest that in the absence of p38α, mTOR/p70S6K pathway activation becomes uncoupled from that of Akt and is impaired in response to H2O2 treatment. This was confirmed by p38α reconstitution in p38α−/− cells, which rescued the levels of p70S6K activation (see Thr(P)-389-p70S6K levels; Fig. 2B), reaching a level comparable with WT cells treated with H2O2. To gain further insight into the mechanisms involved in the regulation of mTOR/p70S6K pathway by p38α, we analyzed whether the regulators of mTORC1 were differentially modulated in the absence of p38α. As shown in Fig. 2C, the high level of Akt phosphorylation in p38α-deficient cells was correlated with Akt-mediated TSC-2 phosphorylation in Ser-939 (an inhibitory site) in response to H2O2, whereas TSC-1 and TSC-2 levels remained unchanged in all cases. Nevertheless, this did not result in a high activation of mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Hence, we measured activation of AMPK, an inhibitor of mTORC1 pathway. However, phosphorylation of AMPK (in Thr-172) and its substrate, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase in response to H2O2 was enhanced in WT MEFs (Fig. 2C). As a consequence, these changes in AMPK activity in WT and p38α-deficient cells did not explain the higher activation of mTOR/p706SK in WT cells exposed to oxidative stress. Therefore, neither TSC-1/2 nor AMPK appear to mediate the inhibition of mTOR signaling observed in p38α−/− cells, which indicates that other mechanisms might be involved. However, it is clear that Akt and AMPK signaling is uncoupled from mTOR/p70S6K activation under these conditions. We considered the possibility that the higher mTOR/p70S6K activation in cells expressing p38α could be responsible for the increased survival in response to H2O2. Thus, we inhibited this pathway with rapamycin to evaluate it. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with rapamycin completely abolished p70S6K phosphorylation by mTOR in response to H2O2. However, rapamycin did not sensitize WT cells to ROS-induced cell death (Fig. 3B). Thus, the higher activation of mTOR/p70S6K appears not to be responsible for the p38α-mediated increased survival. Nevertheless, rapamycin was able to decrease cell size in WT cells but not in those deficient in p38α (data not shown), suggesting a potential function for the p38α-mTOR pathway promoting and/or maintaining cell size and homeostasis under oxidative stress conditions. This is in agreement with recent published results (22Cully M. Genevet A. Warne P. Treins C. Liu T. Bastien J. Baum B. Tapon N. Leevers S.J. Downward J. A role for p38 stress-activated protein kinase in regulation of cell growth via TORC1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfection of either an active p70S6K (p70Δ29–46 ΔCT104 mutant) or a WT p70S6K construct did not increase the cell viability of p38α-deficient MEFs treated with H2O2 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, basal viability was slightly reduced upon expression of these p70S6K constructs. On the other hand, Akt inhibition with the specific chemical inhibitor, A443354 (23Han E.K. Leverson J.D. McGonigal T. Shah O.J. Woods K.W. Hunter T. Giranda V.L. Luo Y. Akt inhibitor A-443654 induces rapid Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation independent of mTORC1 inhibition.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5655-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) had no effect on H2O2-induced cell death, either in WT or p38α−/− MEFs (supplemental Fig. S1), which suggests that the Akt pathway does not play a major role in p38α-mediated survival. We also tested other pathways that could be potentially involved in cell death, such as JNKs. We found a higher JNK activation in p38α−/− MEFs in response to H2O2 and under basal conditions (supplemental Fig. S2). However, JNK inhibition with SP600125 did not decrease cell death, which indicates that JNK is not responsible for the enhanced cell death observed in p38α-deficient cells. We next explored alternative mechanisms by which p38α might protect cells from ROS damage, allowing cell survival. Although p38α MAPK is known to mediate cell death in response to oxidative stress (5Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H.

Raha S. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) upregulates catalase levels in response to low dose H2O2 treatment through enhancement of mRNA stability.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4402-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Aggeli I.K.

This led us to hypothesize that p38α through the regulation of the antioxidant response might maintain low ROS intracellular levels, leading to cell survival. As shown in Fig. 4, the percentage of cells with detectable levels of ROS (positive for DCFH) was slightly higher in untreated p38α-deficient cells and was highly increased upon treatment with H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that upon treatment with H2O2, p38α−/− cells are unable to scavenge ROS, leading to a high and progressive accumulation of ROS (Fig. 4B). This high ROS accumulation in p38α-deficient cells could be a consequence of a deficiency in the activation of antioxidant mechanisms. Thus, we analyzed the expression of relevant antioxidant enzymes such as SOD or catalase. As shown in Fig. 5A, p38α−/− cells expressed lower protein levels of SOD-2 and catalase than WT cells under basal conditions. Moreover, upon treatment with H2O2, these cells were either unable to efficiently induce the expression of these enzymes, as observed fo"
https://openalex.org/W2165298439,"Xenopus retinal ganglion cells show a switch in sensitivity to the guidance cue Sema3A during development. In this study, the authors show that the timing of this switch is determined by a mechanism in which miR-124 regulates the expression of Neuropilin-1 through modulation of the transcription-repressing cofactor CoREST. During axon pathfinding, growth cones commonly show changes in sensitivity to guidance cues that follow a cell-intrinsic timetable. The cellular timer mechanisms that regulate such changes are, however, poorly understood. Here we have investigated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the timing control of sensitivity to the semaphorin Sema3A in Xenopus laevis retinal ganglion cell (RGC) growth cones. A developmental profiling screen identified miR-124 as a candidate timer. Loss of miR-124 delayed the onset of Sema3A sensitivity and concomitant neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor expression and caused cell-autonomous pathfinding errors. CoREST, a cofactor of a NRP1 repressor, was newly identified as a target and mediator of miR-124 for this highly specific temporal aspect of RGC growth cone responsiveness. Our findings indicate that miR-124 is important in regulating the intrinsic temporal changes in RGC growth cone sensitivity and suggest that miRNAs may act broadly as linear timers in vertebrate neuronal development."

https://openalex.org/W2066592814,"Mechanisms of epithelial cell renewal remain poorly understood in the mammalian kidney, particularly in the glomerulus, a site of cellular damage in chronic kidney disease. Within the glomerulus, podocytes--differentiated epithelial cells crucial for filtration--are thought to lack substantial capacity for regeneration. Here we show that podocytes rapidly lose differentiation markers and enter the cell cycle in adult mice in which the telomerase protein component TERT is conditionally expressed. Transgenic TERT expression in mice induces marked upregulation of Wnt signaling and disrupts glomerular structure, resulting in a collapsing glomerulopathy resembling those in human disease, including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Human and mouse HIVAN kidneys show increased expression of TERT and activation of Wnt signaling, indicating that these are general features of collapsing glomerulopathies. Silencing transgenic TERT expression or inhibiting Wnt signaling through systemic expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 in either TERT transgenic mice or in a mouse model of HIVAN results in marked normalization of podocytes, including rapid cell-cycle exit, re-expression of differentiation markers and improved filtration barrier function. These data reveal an unexpected capacity of podocytes to reversibly enter the cell cycle, suggest that podocyte renewal may contribute to glomerular homeostasis and implicate the telomerase and Wnt-β-catenin pathways in podocyte proliferation and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1980079641,"Inflammation has an important role in cancer development through various mechanisms. It has been shown that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors contributes to tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between inflammation and cancer-related miRNA expression in tumorigenesis has not yet been fully understood. Using K19-C2mE and Gan mouse models that develop gastritis and gastritis-associated tumors, respectively, we found that 21 miRNAs were upregulated, and that 29 miRNAs were downregulated in gastric tumors in an inflammation-dependent manner. Among these miRNAs, the expression of miR-7, a possible tumor suppressor, significantly decreased in both gastritis and gastric tumors. Moreover, the expression of miR-7 in human gastric cancer was inversely correlated with the levels of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, suggesting that miR-7 downregulation is related to the severity of inflammatory responses. In the normal mouse stomach, miR-7 expression was at a basal level in undifferentiated gastric epithelial cells, and was induced during differentiation. Moreover, transfection of a miR-7 precursor into gastric cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and soft agar colony formation. These results suggest that suppression of miR-7 expression is important for maintaining the undifferentiated status of gastric epithelial cells, and thus contributes to gastric tumorigenesis. Although epigenetic changes were not found in the CpG islands around miR-7-1 of gastritis and gastric tumor cells, we found that activated macrophage-derived small molecule(s) (<3 kDa) are responsible for miR-7 repression in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the miR-7 expression level significantly decreased in the inflamed gastric mucosa of Helicobacter-infected mice, whereas it increased in the stomach of germfree K19-C2mE and Gan mice wherein inflammatory responses were suppressed. Taken together, these results indicate that downregulation of tumor suppressor miR-7 is a novel mechanism by which the inflammatory response promotes gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068487087,"The pore-forming gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) has a short (1-3 h) half-life in cells in tissue culture and in whole tissues. Although critical for cellular function in all tissues, the process of gap junction turnover is not well understood because treatment of cells with a proteasomal inhibitor results in larger gap junctions but little change in total Cx43 protein whereas lysosomal inhibitors increase total, mostly nonjunctional Cx43. To better understand turnover and identify potential sites of Cx43 ubiquitination, we prepared constructs of Cx43 with different lysines converted to arginines. However, when transfected into cells, a mutant version of Cx43 with all lysines converted to arginines behaved similarly to wild type in the presence of proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors, indicating that ubiquitination of Cx43 did not appear to be playing a role in gap junction stability. Through the use of inhibitors and dominant negative constructs, we found that Akt (protein kinase B) activity controlled gap junction stability and was necessary to form larger stable gap junctions. Akt activation was increased upon proteasomal inhibition and resulted in phosphorylation of Cx43 at Akt phosphorylation consensus sites. Thus, we conclude that Cx43 ubiquitination is not necessary for the regulation of Cx43 turnover; rather, Akt activity, probably through direct phosphorylation of Cx43, controls gap junction stability. This linkage of a kinase involved in controlling cell survival and growth to gap junction stability may mechanistically explain how gap junctions and Akt play similar regulatory roles."
https://openalex.org/W2053304050,"A clearer definition of the molecular determinants that drive the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is urgently needed. Efforts to map recurrent somatic deletions in the tumor genome, especially homozygous deletions (HODs), have provided important positional information in the search for cancer-causing genes. Analyzing HODs in the tumors of 244 patients from two independent cohorts and 22 PCa xenografts using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, herein we report the identification of CHD1, a chromatin remodeler, as one of the most frequently homozygously deleted genes in PCa, second only to PTEN in this regard. The HODs observed in CHD1, including deletions affecting only internal exons of CHD1, were found to completely extinguish the expression of mRNA of this gene in PCa xenografts. Loss of this chromatin remodeler in clinical specimens is significantly associated with an increased number of additional chromosomal deletions, both hemi- and homozygous, especially on 2q, 5q and 6q. Together with the deletions observed in HEK293 cells stably transfected with CHD1 small hairpin RNA, these data suggest a causal relationship. Downregulation of Chd1 in mouse prostate epithelial cells caused dramatic morphological changes indicative of increased invasiveness, but did not result in transformation. Indicating a new role of CHD1, these findings collectively suggest that distinct CHD1-associated alterations of genomic structure evolve during and are required for the development of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2037170170,"Previous studies have demonstrated that high mobility group A proteins have a critical role on the onset of human pituitary adenomas. Indeed, both high mobility group A (HMGA) genes are overexpressed in pituitary adenomas, and consistently transgenic mice overexpressing either the Hmga1 or the Hmga2 gene develop mixed growth hormone/prolactin (GH-PRL)-secreting pituitary adenomas. Trisomy of chromosome 12, where HMGA2 is located, and/or amplification of the HMGA2 gene locus account for the HMGA2 overexpression in most human prolactinomas. Conversely, HMGA1 overexpression is not associated to any rearrangement or amplification of the HMGA1 locus. We have first identified micro RNAs (miRNAs) able to target both HMGA1 and HMGA2 messenger RNAs. Then, all of these miRNAs have been found downregulated in pituitary adenomas of different histotypes, compared with normal pituitary. Interestingly, their downregulation was also observed in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas where HMGA2 overexpression is not associated to any alteration of the HMGA2 locus. Functional studies show that all these HMGA-targeting miRNAs inhibit the proliferation of the rat pituitary adenoma cell line GH3. Therefore, these results indicate that the downregulation of the miRNAs able to target the HMGA genes could contribute to increase HMGA protein levels in human pituitary adenomas, and then to pituitary tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2132039625,"Genetic alterations of 16q21-q22, the locus of a 6-cadherin cluster, are frequently involved in multiple tumors, suggesting the presence of critical tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Using 1 Mb array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), we refined a small hemizygous deletion (~1 Mb) at 16q21-22.1, which contains a single gene Cadherin-11 (CDH11, OB-cadherin). CDH11 was broadly expressed in human normal adult and fetal tissues, while its silencing and promoter CpG methylation were frequently detected in tumor cell lines, but not in immortalized normal epithelial cells. Aberrant methylation was also frequently detected in multiple primary tumors. CDH11 silencing could be reversed by pharmacologic or genetic demethylation, indicating an epigenetic mechanism. Ectopic expression of CDH11 strongly suppressed tumorigenecity and induced tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, CDH11 was found to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin and AKT/Rho A signaling, as well as actin stress fiber formation, thus further inhibiting tumor cell migration and invasion. CDH11 also inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and downregulated stem cell markers. Thus, our work identifies CDH11 as a functional tumor suppressor and an important antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin and AKT/Rho A signaling, with frequent epigenetic inactivation in common carcinomas."

Although increased numbers of tumor-associated macrophages are linked to poor prognosis in lung cancer patients, little is known regarding the transcriptional mechanisms controlling recruitment of macrophages during lung tumorigenesis. Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1) transcription factor is induced in multiple cell types within tumor lesions and its increased expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinomas. To determine the role of Foxm1 in recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages, a mouse line with macrophage-specific Foxm1 deletion was generated (macFoxm1(-/-)). Lung tumorigenesis was induced using a 3-methylcholanthrene/butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene) tumor initiation/promotion protocol. Ablation of Foxm1 in macrophages reduced the number and size of lung tumors in macFoxm1(-/-) mice. Decreased tumorigenesis was associated with diminished proliferation of tumor cells and decreased recruitment of macrophages during the early stages of tumor formation. The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory genes iNOS, Cox-2, interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and IL-6, as well as the migration-related genes macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1α), MIP-2 and MMP-12, were decreased in macrophages isolated from macFoxm1(-/-) mice. Migration of Foxm1-deficient macrophages was reduced in vitro. The chemokine receptors responsible for monocyte recruitment to the lung, CX(3)CR1 and CXCR4, were decreased in Foxm1-deficient monocytes. In co-transfection experiments, Foxm1 directly bound to and transcriptionally activated the CX(3)CR1 promoter. Adoptive transfer of wild-type monocytes to macFoxm1(-/-) mice restored BHT-induced pulmonary inflammation to the levels observed in control mice. Expression of Foxm1 in macrophages is required for pulmonary inflammation, recruitment of macrophages into tumor sites and lung tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W1973096044,"Germline variants in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of cancer genes disrupting microRNA (miRNA) regulation have recently been associated with cancer risk. A variant in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS variant, is associated with both cancer risk and altered tumor biology. Here, we test the hypothesis that the KRAS variant can act as a biomarker of outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the cause of altered outcome in KRAS variant-positive EOC patients. As this variant seems to be associated with tumor biology, we additionally test the hypothesis that this variant can be directly targeted to impact cell survival. EOC patients with complete clinical data were genotyped for the KRAS variant and analyzed for outcome (n=536), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=125) and platinum resistance (n=306). Outcome was separately analyzed for women with known BRCA mutations (n=79). Gene expression was analyzed on a subset of tumors with available tissue. Cell lines were used to confirm altered sensitivity to chemotherapy associated with the KRAS variant. Finally, the KRAS variant was directly targeted through small-interfering RNA/miRNA oligonucleotides in cell lines and survival was measured. Postmenopausal EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to die of ovarian cancer by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio=1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.57, P=0.019, n=279). Perhaps explaining this finding, EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to be platinum resistant (odds ratio=3.18, confidence interval: 1.31-7.72, P=0.0106, n=291). In addition, direct targeting of the KRAS variant led to a significant reduction in EOC cell growth and survival in vitro. These findings confirm the importance of the KRAS variant in EOC, and indicate that the KRAS variant is a biomarker of poor outcome in EOC likely due to platinum resistance. In addition, this study supports the hypothesis that these tumors have continued dependence on such 3'UTR lesions, and that direct targeting may be a viable future treatment approach."
https://openalex.org/W1989425374,"N-cadherin is a homophilic adhesion protein that remains expressed at mature excitatory synapses beyond its developmental role in synapse formation. We investigated the trans-synaptic activity of N-cadherin in regulating synapse function in rodent cultured hippocampal neurons using optical methods and electrophysiology. Interfering with N-cadherin in postsynaptic neurons reduced basal release probability (p(r)) at inputs to the neuron, and this trans-synaptic impairment of release accompanied impaired vesicle endocytosis. Moreover, loss of the GluA2 AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit, which decreased p(r) by itself, occluded the interference with postsynaptic N-cadherin. The loss of postsynaptic N-cadherin activity, however, did not affect the compensatory upregulation of p(r) induced by chronic activity silencing, whereas postsynaptic β-catenin deletion blocked this presynaptic homeostatic adaptation. Our findings suggest that postsynaptic N-cadherin helps link basal pre- and postsynaptic strengths to control the p(r) offset, whereas the p(r) gain adjustment requires a distinct trans-synaptic pathway involving β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2082934066,"Analysis of patient tumors suggests that multiple MAP3 kinases (MAP3Ks) are critical for growth and metastasis of cancer cells. MAP3Ks selectively control the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and ERK5 in response to receptor tyrosine kinases and GTPases. We used MDA-MB-231 cells because of their ability to metastasize from the breast fat pad to distant lymph nodes for an orthotopic xenograft model to screen the function of seven MAP3Ks in controlling tumor growth and metastasis. Stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown was used to inhibit the expression of each of the seven MAP3Ks, which were selected for their differential regulation of the MAPK network. The screen identified two MAP3Ks, MEKK2 and MLK3, whose shRNA knockdown caused significant inhibition of both tumor growth and metastasis. Neither MEKK2 nor MLK3 have been previously shown to regulate tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These results demonstrated that MAP3Ks, which differentially activate JNK, p38 and ERK5, are necessary for xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 tumors. The requirement for MAP3Ks signaling through multiple MAPK pathways explains why several members of the MAPK network are activated in cancer. MEKK2 was required for epidermal growth factor receptor and Her2/Neu activation of ERK5, with ERK5 being required for metastasis. Loss of MLK3 expression increased mitotic infidelity and apoptosis in vitro. Knockdown of MEKK2 and MLK3 resulted in increased apoptosis in orthotopic xenografts relative to control tumors in mice, inhibiting both tumor growth and metastasis; MEKK2 and MLK3 represent untargeted kinases in tumor biology for potential therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2086341539,"New methods for analyzing ligand-receptor binding under physiologic conditions in cell-based assays and living animals are much needed for the testing and validation of candidate therapeutic agents targeting ligand-receptor binding. Here, Kathryn Luker and her colleagues developed a molecular imaging assay for ligand-receptor binding based on Gaussia luciferase complementation, focusing on chemokine CXCL12 and its chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7, although the assay could be applied more broadly to any receptor with a protein ligand. Studies of ligand-receptor binding and the development of receptor antagonists would benefit greatly from imaging techniques that translate directly from cell-based assays to living animals. We used Gaussia luciferase protein fragment complementation to quantify the binding of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) to chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and CXCR7. Studies established that small-molecule inhibitors of CXCR4 or CXCR7 specifically blocked CXCL12 binding in cell-based assays and revealed differences in kinetics of inhibiting chemokine binding to each receptor. Bioluminescence imaging showed CXCL12-CXCR7 binding in primary and metastatic tumors in a mouse model of breast cancer. We used this imaging technique to quantify drug-mediated inhibition of CXCL12-CXCR4 binding in living mice. We expect this imaging technology to advance research in areas such as ligand-receptor interactions and the development of new therapeutic agents in cell-based assays and small animals."

TLRs are composed of an extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats for ligand recognition, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic part with a Toll-IL-1R (TIR) domain.

The BB loops in this dimer interact with the reciprocal BB loop and αC helix, explaining how BB loop peptides and peptidomimetics can inhibit TIR-TIR interactions (15Nyman T. Stenmark P. Flodin S.

Common interaction surfaces of the toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain stimulate multiple nuclear targets.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) published an alanine scan mutagenesis study of the TLR4 TIR domain. Mapping of the mutations on a TLR4 TIR homology model revealed the importance of at least two surface patches, corresponding to the BB loop and to the DD loop and residues in the αC′ helix. Interestingly, none of the mutations in this study showed specificity in their effects for any of the different pathways. This led to the suggestion that pathways diverge downstream of the adapters or that different adapters all bind to the same TLR4 TIR-binding sites.The mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) technique allows studying TIR-TIR interactions in detail in situ in intact living cells (26Ulrichts P. Peelman F. Beyaert R. Tavernier J. MAPPIT analysis of TLR adapter complexes.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we use this method plus NF-κB and IRF-3 reporter assays in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and homology modeling to determine the specific interaction sites for dimerization or oligomerization and adapter recruitment in the TLR4 TIR domain. We developed an assay in which we can specifically detect the TLR4-TLR4, TLR4-MAL, and TLR4-TRAM TIR-TIR interactions. Mutations in two binding sites simultaneously affect all three interactions. We propose a model based on the TLR10 TIR domain structure, in which TLR TIR dimerization is required for formation of an extended binding platform for both the MAL and TRAM adapters.DISCUSSIONA crucial event in TLR signaling is the complex formation between the TIR domains of the dimerized or oligomerized receptor and the TIR domain-containing adapter proteins. The structures of different TIR domains have been determined, and the importance of different structural elements as the BB-loop has been demonstrated (1Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Structure and function of Toll receptors and their ligands.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 39Monie T.P. Moncrieffe M.C. Gay N.J. Structure and regulation of cytoplasmic adapter proteins involved in innate immune signaling.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Different models for TIR-TIR interactions have been proposed, either based on structural data or on signaling data. However, the structure of a TLR-adapter complex has not been reported, and the architecture of TLR complexes is not yet completely understood. MAPPIT allows studying the separate TIR-TIR interactions, which makes it possible to detect residues or regions that affect one of the interactions. We established MAPPIT assays to detect TLR4ic-TLR4ic, TLR4ic-MAL, and TLR4ic-TRAM interactions, and we were able to show that mutations specifically involved in one of the interactions disturb the MAPPIT signal. Based on homology modeling, sequence conservation, and the results of an alanine scanning experiment of Ronni et al. (25Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Common interaction surfaces of the toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain stimulate multiple nuclear targets.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we selected three possible binding sites in the TLR4 TIR domain.Mutations in all three possible binding sites abrogate TLR4 TIR-TLR4 TIR interactions, whereas adapter binding is only affected by mutations in binding site I and II. Only potential binding sites I and II in the TLR4 TIR domain are critical for LPS-induced NF-κB signaling, whereas an IRF3/GAL4-based assay suggests that binding site III may be important for IRF-3 activation. Binding site I contains residues of the αA and αB helix and of the BB and BC loop. Binding site II contains residues of the BB loop, DD loop, and αC helix.Binding site II approximately corresponds with the interface found in the dimer of the TLR10 TIR domain crystal structure (15Nyman T. Stenmark P. Flodin S. Johansson I. Hammarström M. Nordlund P. The crystal structure of the human toll-like receptor 10 cytoplasmic domain reveals a putative signaling dimer.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11861-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which was proposed as a good model for TLR TIR dimerization (15Nyman T. Stenmark P. Flodin S. Johansson I. Hammarström M. Nordlund P. The crystal structure of the human toll-like receptor 10 cytoplasmic domain reveals a putative signaling dimer.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11861-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In a model for a TLR4 dimer based on this structure, binding site II forms the interface between two TLR4 TIR domains. The BB loops of two TLR TIR domains interact at the TLR TIR interface but are at the same time exposed, forming a possible interaction site for adapter recruitment (15Nyman T. Stenmark P. Flodin S. Johansson I. Hammarström M. Nordlund P. The crystal structure of the human toll-like receptor 10 cytoplasmic domain reveals a putative signaling dimer.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11861-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The exposed BB loops are part of the adjacent binding sites I of both TLR4 TIR domains. These adjacent binding sites I form a more extended platform, which may be important for adapter binding. An important role for this platform in TLR4 signaling is supported by our MAPPIT data, by residue conservation, and by the alanine scan data of Ronni et al. (25Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Common interaction surfaces of the toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain stimulate multiple nuclear targets.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9).This extended platform may allow binding of two adapter molecules. This would be consistent with the existence of three types of interfaces, as postulated by Xu et al. (12Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Structural basis for signal transduction by the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains.Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), when reporting the first TIR domain crystal structures. Binding site II between two TLR4 TIR domains would correspond to the “R” face. The extended platform formed by two binding sites I of TLR4 forms the “S” face between the TIR domains of the TLR and the adapters. These adapter molecules presumably bind as dimers that interact via the “A” face (Fig. 9G).Núñez Miguel l et al. (38Núñez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. A dimer of the Toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain provides a specific scaffold for the recruitment of signaling adapter proteins.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) presented a similar TLR4 TIR model based on the dimer structure of the TLR10 TIR domain. These authors used in silico protein-protein docking of homology models to predict the binding site for the adapters TRAM and MAL on this TLR4 dimer. Both adapters were predicted to bind at symmetry-related sites at the TLR4 dimer interface indicated in Fig. 9, D and F. These predicted docking sites are not particularly conserved, and mutations at these sites do not affect adapter binding in our MAPPIT assays nor any of the tested TLR4 signaling pathways in the study of Ronni et al. (25Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Common interaction surfaces of the toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain stimulate multiple nuclear targets.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore favor a model with two adjacent binding sites I as binding sites for MAL and TRAM.The MAPPIT technique allows detecting mutations that affect binding specificity for different interaction partners. Nevertheless, in this study, we did not find mutations that specifically affect adapter recruitment. Instead, we find that mutations in binding site I and II affect both the TLR4-TLR4 and TLR4-adapter interactions in MAPPIT and AlphaScreenTM assays. This indicates that the TLR4 TIR domain needs to dimerize to allow recruitment of MAL and TRAM. Conversely, we were able to show that overexpression of TRAM enhances dimerization of the intracellular TLR4 domain. This suggests that binding of MAL or TRAM can stabilize the TLR4 TIR dimerization in our MAPPIT assays. This cooperativity between TLR4 TIR dimerization and adapter recruitment can explain why we did not detect any mutation that affects adapter-receptor TIR-TIR interaction without affecting receptor-receptor TIR-TIR interaction. Interestingly, the chemical compound TAK-242 specifically targets Cys-747 in binding site II in TLR4 and inhibits the MyD88-dependent and -independent TLR4 signaling pathways (40Takashima K. Matsunaga N. Yoshimatsu M. Hazeki K. Kaisho T. Uekata M. Hazeki O. Akira S. Iizawa Y. Ii M. Analysis of binding site for the novel small molecule TLR4 signal transduction inhibitor TAK-242 and its therapeutic effect on mouse sepsis model.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We suggest that this compound inhibits TLR4 TIR dimerization and therefore adapter recruitment.All mutations that affect MAL binding also affect TRAM binding in our MAPPIT assays, and our data suggest that the binding sites for MAL and TRAM on TLR4 strongly overlap. In line with this, thorough alanine scanning analysis of the TLR4 TIR domain by Ronni et al. (25Ronni T. Agarwal V. Haykinson M. Haberland M.E. Cheng G. Smale S.T. Common interaction surfaces of the toll-like receptor 4 cytoplasmic domain stimulate multiple nuclear targets.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) did not find any mutations that affect specific signal transduction pathways. In our MAPPIT assays, MAL and TRAM seem to compete for this common or overlapping binding site, which in our model is formed by the adjacent binding sites I. It is unclear whether this competition plays a role in TLR4 signal transduction, as the MAL/MyD88 signaling pathway starts at the plasma membrane, whereas the TRAM/TRIF-dependent pathway requires endocytosis (6Kagan J.C.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar).The model presented here for TLR TIR domain dimerization and adapter recruitment may apply for most if not all TLR TIR domains. Analysis of conservation of a TLR2 and TLR10 dimer for example shows a similar conserved binding site I platform (data not shown). Interestingly, TLR1 acquires the ability to bind MyD88 after mutation of residue 672 in its box1 motif (41Brown V. Brown R.A. Ozinsky A. Hesselberth J.R. Fields S. Binding specificity of Toll-like receptor cytoplasmic domains.Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 742-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This residue corresponds to residue Asp-711 in binding site I of TLR4. Mutation of Arg-748, Phe-749, Leu-752, and Arg-753 in the DD loop and αD helix of TLR2 decreases TLR2/TLR1 signaling (42Gautam J.K. Ashish Comeau L.D. Krueger J.K. Smith Jr., M.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 30132-30142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These residues are in or at the edge of the predicted binding site II, which may form the TLR-TLR TIR-TIR interface in TLR2-mediated signaling.Although mutations in predicted binding site I and II in this work affect all tested aspects of TLR4 signal transduction, we find that mutations in binding site III only affect the TLR4 TIR-TLR4 TIR interaction in our MAPPIT assay. Most mutations in binding site III did not strongly affect TLR4-induced NF-κB signaling or MAL or TRAM recruitment. Interestingly, our data suggest that binding site III may be specifically involved in IRF-3 activation. This is probably not a consequence of defective TRAM binding, but it may be related to the effect of binding site III mutations on the TLR4-TLR4 interaction as observed via MAPPIT. The inhibitory effect of the site III mutations on TLR4ic-TLR4ic interaction could be rescued by overexpression of TRAM. This probably means that binding site III mutations only affect the weak interaction between isolated TLR4ic domains. The mutations lose their effect when this interaction is stabilized or enhanced by overexpression of TRAM or by additional interactions in the activated full-length TLR4 receptor complex. We cannot rule out a role for this area of the TIR domain for receptor oligomerization. The higher order MyD88-IRAK4 “myddosome” complexes suggest that TLR4 may indeed form oligomers upon activation (4Gay N.J. Gangloff M. O'Neill L.A. What the Myddosome structure tells us about the initiation of innate immunity.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 104-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).It is unclear whether equivalents of the binding sites defined in this work are present in the adapters MAL, MyD88, TRAM, and TRIF. The inhibitory effect of BB loop mutations on adapter functionality suggests that they may use similar type I- and II-binding sites for interaction via the “S interfaces” and “A interfaces” as defined above. Ohnishi et al. (16Ohnishi H. Tochio H. Kato Z. Orii K.E. Li A. Kimura T. Hiroaki H. Kondo N. Shirakawa M.

Binding sites II and III in this study were reported to mediate interaction with MAL. Superposition and alignment of the MyD88 and TLR4 structures and sequences show that these sites correspond to our binding sites I and III. Mutations of MAL at position Asp-198 inhibit TLR2 and TLR4 signaling and affect its interaction with TLR4 and MyD88 (43Ulrichts P. Bovijn C. Lievens S. Beyaert R. Tavernier J. Peelman F.

Asp-198 is found in a position that overlaps with the binding site III as defined in this study (43Ulrichts P. Bovijn C. Lievens S. Beyaert R. Tavernier J. Peelman F.

Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we demonstrated the importance of two binding sites in TLR4 adapter binding and signaling. Our data support a model of TLR4 TIR domain dimerization as found in the TLR10 TIR domain crystal structure. This dimerization is required for formation of a large conserved platform that contains the BB loop and box 1 motifs and that forms a potential binding site for the adapters MAL and TRAM. MAL and TRAM both bind to this platform, and adapter binding stabilizes the complex. It remains to be determined how MAL and TRAM interact with this binding site and how this leads to recruitment of MyD88. The MAPPIT method allows the detection of TLR4-MAL, TLR4-TRAM, MAL-MAL, and MAL-MyD88 interactions. A strategy that combines MAPPIT with mutagenesis of the adapter proteins as applied in this study can help to further define the interfaces in the TLR-adapter complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2017958614,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer (PCa) growth, with androgen deprivation or AR down-regulation causing cell-cycle arrest and accumulation of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The molecular basis for this AR regulation of cell-cycle progression remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that androgen can rapidly reduce p27 protein in PCa cells by increasing its proteasome-mediated degradation. This rapid androgen-stimulated p27 degradation was mediated by AKT through the phosphorylation of p27 T157. Significantly, androgen increased TORC2-mediated AKT S473 phosphorylation without affecting the PDK1-mediated AKT T308 phosphorylation or TORC1 activity. The TORC2 activation was further supported by enhanced mTOR/RICTOR association and increased phosphorylation of additional TORC2 substrates, SGK1 and PKCα. The androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of AR was associated with markedly-increased nuclear SIN1, a critical component of TORC2. Finally, the androgen-mediated TORC2/AKT activation targets a subset of AKT substrates including p27 and FOXO1, but not PRAS40. This study reveals a pathway linking AR to a selective activation of TORC2, the subsequent activation of AKT, and phosphorylation of a discrete set of AKT substrates that regulate cellular proliferation and survival. These findings establish that TORC2 can function as a central regulator of growth in response to signals that are distinct from those regulating TORC1, and support efforts to target TORC2 for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2040534118,"Developmental stage-specific regulation of BCL2 occurs during B-cell maturation and has a role in normal immunity. CD40 signaling promotes proliferation and rescues B-cells from apoptosis, partly through induction of BCL2L1 and BCL2A1 and repression of BCL2. We previously showed that a stromal cell/CD40 ligand (CD154) culture system reproduced this switch in survival protein expression in primary human leukemic B-cells and we employed this model system to investigate BCL2 repression. BCL2 was post-transcriptionally regulated and the repressed BCL2 mRNA was associated with non-polysomal, but dense fractions on sucrose density gradients. Microarrays identified a set of miRNA that were induced by culture conditions and potentially able to bind to the BCL2 3'-UTR. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-125b and miR-155 repressed BCL2 mRNA but while stromal cell contact alone was sufficient to induce strongly miR-125b this did not cause BCL2 repression. miR-155, which is the most abundant miRNA under basal conditions, specifically required CD154 for further induction above a threshold to exert its full repressive effects. Anti-miR-125b and anti-miR-155 prevented CD154-mediated repression of BCL2 and reduced CD154-mediated proliferation in the MEC1 B-cell line. We suggest that miR-155 and miR-125b, which are induced by CD154 and stromal cell signals, contribute to regulating proliferation and that BCL2 is one of their target mRNAs."

To display fast gliding motility, the parasite uses a high turnover of actin polymerization and adhesion sites. Paradoxically, only a few classic actin regulatory proteins appear to be encoded in the Plasmodium genome. Small heat shock proteins have been associated with cytoskeleton modulation in various biological processes. In this study, we identify HSP20 as a novel player in Plasmodium motility and provide molecular genetics evidence for a critical role of a small heat shock protein in cell traction and motility. We demonstrate that HSP20 ablation profoundly affects sporozoite-substrate adhesion, which translates into aberrant speed and directionality in vitro. Loss of HSP20 function impairs migration in the host, an important sporozoite trait required to find a blood vessel and reach the liver after being deposited in the skin by the mosquito. Our study also shows that fast locomotion of sporozoites is crucial during natural malaria transmission."

An intrinsic defect in the intestinal epithelial barrier has been proposed to be one of several factors that contribute to the inappropriate immune response to the commensal microbiota that underlies inflammatory bowel disease. Matriptase is a membrane-anchored serine protease encoded by Suppression of Tumorigenicity-14 (ST14) that strengthens the intestinal epithelial barrier by promoting tight junction formation. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial-specific ablation of St14 in mice causes formation of colon adenocarcinoma with very early onset and high penetrance. Neoplastic progression is preceded by a chronic inflammation of the colon that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease and is promoted by the commensal microbiota. This study demonstrates that inflammation-associated colon carcinogenesis can be initiated and promoted solely by an intrinsic intestinal permeability barrier perturbation, establishes St14 as a critical tumor-suppressor gene in the mouse gastrointestinal tract and adds matriptase to the expanding list of pericellular proteases with tumor-suppressive functions."

In this study, we have investigated the role of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor on type I collagen expression in adult normal human (ANF) and scleroderma (SF) fibroblasts. We demonstrated that NF-κB, a master transcription factor playing a major role in immune response/apoptosis, down-regulates COL1A1 expression by a transcriptional control involving the −112/−61 bp sequence. This 51-bp region mediates the action of two zinc fingers, Sp1 (specific protein-1) and Sp3, acting as trans-activators of type I collagen expression in ANF and SF. Knockdown of each one of these trans factors by siRNA confirmed the trans-activating effect of Sp1/Sp3 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB trans-inhibiting effect on COL1A1 expression. Despite no existing κB consensus sequence in the COL1A1 promoter, we found that Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and NF-κB bind and/or are recruited on the proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Attempts to elucidate whether interactions between Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox and p65 are necessary to mediate the NF-κB inhibitory effect on COL1A1 in ANF and SF were carried out; in this regard, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that they interact, and this was validated by re-ChIP. Finally, the knockdown of Sp1/Sp3/c-Krox prevents the p65 inhibitory effect on COL1A1 transcription in ANF, whereas only the siRNAs targeting Sp3 and c-Krox provoked the same effect in SF, suggesting that particular interactions are characteristic of the scleroderma phenotype. In conclusion, our findings highlight a new mechanism for COL1A1 transcriptional regulation by NF-κB, and these data could allow the development of new antifibrotic strategies.

Both the presence of DSBs and a decreased end joining activity have been reported in AD brains, but the molecular player causing DNA repair dysfunction is still undetermined. β-Amyloid (Aβ), a potential proximate effector of neurotoxicity in AD, might exert cytotoxic effects by reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress induction, which may then cause DNA damage. Here, we show that in PC12 cells sublethal concentrations of aggregated Aβ(25–35) inhibit DNA-PK kinase activity, compromising DSB repair and sensitizing cells to nonlethal oxidative injury. The inhibition of DNA-PK activity is associated with down-regulation of the catalytic subunit DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) protein levels, caused by oxidative stress and reversed by antioxidant treatment. Moreover, we show that sublethal doses of Aβ(1–42) oligomers enter the nucleus of PC12 cells, accumulate as insoluble oligomeric species, and reduce DNA-PK kinase activity, although in the absence of oxidative stress. Overall, these findings suggest that Aβ mediates inhibition of the DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end joining pathway contributing to the accumulation of DSBs that, if not efficiently repaired, may lead to the neuronal loss observed in AD.

Here, we show that the transcriptional coactivators Megakaryoblastic Leukemia 1 and 2 (MKL1/2) are constitutively localized to the nucleus in hepatocellular and mammary carcinoma cells that lack DLC1. Moreover, DLC1 loss and MKL1 nuclear localization correlate in primary human hepatocellular carcinoma. Nuclear accumulation of MKL1 in DLC1-deficient cancer cells is accomplished by activation of the RhoA/actin signaling pathway and concomitant impairment of MKL1 phosphorylation, which results in constitutive activation of MKL1/2 target genes. We provide evidence that MKL1/2 mediates cancerous transformation in DLC1-deficient hepatocellular and mammary carcinoma cells. Depletion of MKL1/2 suppresses cell migration, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth induced by DLC1 loss."

Cooperation between IbpA and IbpB is crucial for prevention of the irreversible aggregation of proteins. In this study, we investigated the importance of the N- and C-terminal regions of IbpA for self-oligomerization and chaperone functions. Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal region of IbpA resulted in a defect in the IbpA fibril formation process. The deletions also impaired IbpA chaperone function, defined as the ability to stabilize, in cooperation with IbpB, protein aggregates in a disaggregation-competent state. Our results show that the defect in chaperone function, observed in truncated versions of IbpA, is due to the inability of these proteins to interact with substrate proteins and consequently to change the properties of aggregates. At the same time, these versions of IbpA interact with IbpB similarly to the wild type protein. Competition experiments performed with the pC peptide, which corresponds to the IbpA C terminus, suggested the importance of IbpA intermolecular interactions in the stabilization of aggregates in a state competent for disaggregation.

HER2-overexpressing cells grown in extracellular matrix formed filled spheroids, which protruded outgrowths upon growth factor stimulation. Our transcriptome analyses imply a two-hit model for invasive growth: HER2-induced proliferation and evasion from anoikis generate filled structures, which are morphologically and transcriptionally analogous to preinvasive patients’ lesions. In the second hit, EGF escalates signaling and transcriptional responses leading to invasive growth. Consistent with clinical relevance, a gene expression signature based on the HER2/EGF-activated transcriptional program can predict poorer prognosis of a subgroup of HER2-overexpressing patients.

Although our understanding of the cellular context in which MCPH1 operates continues to develop, a structural understanding of the C-terminal tandem BRCT domains of MCPH1 remains unexplored. Here, we identify cell division cycle protein 27 (Cdc27), a component of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), as a novel interacting partner of MCPH1. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the C-terminal tandem BRCT domains of MCPH1 (C-BRCTs) bind Cdc27 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To characterize this interaction further, we determined the structure of MCPH1 C-BRCTs in complex with a phosphorylated Cdc27 peptide (pCdc27) using x-ray crystallography. Based on this structure, we identified single amino acid mutations targeted at the binding interface that disrupted the MCPH1-pCdc27 interaction.

To understand the substrate specificity and kinetic mechanism of these enzymes we have determined high resolution, single crystal, x-ray crystallographic structures of inactive Selenomonas ruminantium PhyA in complex with myo-inositol hexa- and pentakisphosphate. These structures provide the first glimpse of a myo-inositol polyphosphatase-ligand complex consistent with its known specificity and reveal novel features of the kinetic mechanism. To complement the structural studies, fluorescent binding assays have been developed and demonstrate that the Kd for this enzyme is several orders of magnitude lower than the Km. Together with rapid kinetics data, these results suggest that the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like inositol polyphosphatases have a two-step, substrate-binding mechanism that facilitates catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W1982200931,"Personalized medicine requires the identification of unambiguous prognostic and predictive biomarkers to inform therapeutic decisions. Within this context, the management of lymph node-negative breast cancer is the subject of much debate with particular emphasis on the requirement for adjuvant chemotherapy. The identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this group of patients is crucial. Here, we demonstrate by tissue microarray and automated image analysis that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is expressed in primary and metastatic breast cancer and is an independent poor prognostic factor in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, lymph node-negative tumors in two separate breast cancer cohorts (n=690; P=0.002, 0.013). We also show that CART increases the transcriptional activity of ERα in a ligand-independent manner via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that CART stimulates an autocrine/paracrine loop within tumor cells to amplify the CART signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that CART expression in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines protects against tamoxifen-mediated cell death and that high CART expression predicts disease outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients in vivo in three independent breast cancer cohorts. We believe that CART profiling will help facilitate stratification of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients into high- and low-risk categories and allow for the personalization of therapy."
