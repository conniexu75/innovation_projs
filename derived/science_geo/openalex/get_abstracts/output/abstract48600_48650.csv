https://openalex.org/W2028694464,"The immune system is regulated by the gonadal steroids estrogen, androgen, and progesterone, but the circulating levels of these steroids can also be affected by immune system function. Such interactions appear to be mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-thymic axis and depend on pituitary luteinizing hormone released by thymic factors under the control of the gonadal steroids."
https://openalex.org/W2071394393,"The interleukins, which have a regulatory role in immune function, may also mediate inflammation associated with injury to the brain. In experiments to determine the effect of these peptide hormones on glial cell proliferation in culture, interleukin-1 was a potent mitogen for astroglia but had no effect on oligodendroglia. Interleukin-2 did not alter the growth of either type of glial cell. Activity similar to that of interleukin-1 was detected in brains of adult rats 10 days after the brains had been injured. These findings suggest that interleukin-1, released by inflammatory cells, may promote the formation of scars by astroglia in the damaged mammalian brain."

https://openalex.org/W1971917670,"The time constant of the decay of slow-phase eye velocity of postrotatory nystagmus or optokinetic after-nystagmus is reduced during exposure to a stationary visual surround (visual suppression). It is also reduced after tilting the head (tilt suppression). A ""dump"" mechanism in the vestibulo-ocular reflex has been proposed to rapidly discharge activity from the central vestibular system during both types of suppression. Monkeys lost this mechanism after lesions of the nodulus and uvula. They also lost the ability to habituate the time constant of nystagmus on repeated exposure to optokinetic and vestibular stimuli. Periodic alternating nystagmus, which is believed to represent an instability in the vestibulo-ocular reflex, was observed in two of three monkeys. These data indicate that the nodulus and uvula play an important role in suppressing, habituating, and stabilizing the vestibulo-ocular reflex."

https://openalex.org/W2076354748,"Human factor VIII—von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large, multimeric glycoprotein that plays a central role in the blood coagulation system, serving both as a carrier for factor VIIIC (antihemophilic factor) and as a major mediator of platelet-vessel wall interaction. Diminished or abnormal vWF activity results in von Willebrand's disease (vWD), a common and complex hereditary bleeding disorder. Overlapping vWF cDNA clones that span 8.2 kilobases of the vWF messenger RNA have been obtained. vWF accounts for approximately 0.3 percent of endothelial cell messenger RNA and was undetectable in several other tissues examined. A large single copy gene for vWF is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p12 → 12pter). No gross gene rearrangement or deletion was detected in the DNA of two patients with severe vWD."
https://openalex.org/W2041546036,The polypeptide interleukin-1 mediates many host responses to infection and inflammation. A method was developed for studying interleukin-1 levels in human plasma from febrile patients. Interleukin-1 activity was also consistently found in plasma samples from women in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. This activity was neutralized by a specific antiserum to human interleukin-1 and was low in plasma from healthy men and preovulatory women. Thus interleukin-1 appears to have a role in normal physiological conditions as well as in disease states.
https://openalex.org/W2008384204,The T cell surface glycoproteins T4 and T8 are thought to mediate efficient cell-cell interactions in the immune system and in this way may be responsible for the appropriate targeting of subpopulations of T cells. We have used gene transfer combined with subtractive hybridization to isolate both cDNA and functional genomic clones encoding the T8 protein. The sequence of the cDNA reveals that T8 is a transmembrane protein with an N-terminal domain which shares significant homology to immunoglobulin variable region light chains. This immunoglobulin-like structure is likely to be important in the function of T8 during differentiation and in the course of the immune response.
https://openalex.org/W2005413201,"The thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease and certain forms of goiter contain infiltrating activated T lymphocytes and, unlike cells of normal glands, the epithelial follicular cells strongly express histocompatibility antigens of the HLA-DR type. In a study of such autoimmune disorders, the infiltrating T cells from the thyroid glands of two patients with Graves' disease were cloned in mitogen-free interleukin-2 (T-cell growth factor). The clones were expanded and their specificity was tested. Three types of clones were found. One group, of T4 phenotype, specifically recognized autologous thyroid cells. Another, also of T4 phenotype, recognized autologous thyroid or blood cells and thus responded positively in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. Other clones derived from cells that were activated in vivo were of no known specificity. These clones provide a model of a human autoimmune disease and their analysis should clarify mechanisms of pathogenesis and provide clues to abrogating these undesirable immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W2072418891,"Bifunctional cross-linking reagents DSP, DSS, and BSOCOES were used to cross-link 125I-surface-labeled viable T lymphocytes. The cross-linked cells were solubilized in Nonidet-P40, immunoprecipitated with anti-Ti (monoclonal antibody T40/25) or anti-T3 (monoclonal antibodies UCHT-1 or OKT3), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. With all three cross-linkers, the intact cross-linked products obtained with monoclonal antibody T40/25 from HPB-ALL cells were 20–30 kd heavier than the Ti dimer (Mr 80,000). When the DSP cross-linked product was isolated using either anti-Ti or anti-T3 monoclonal antibodies and then cleaved, bands having molecular weights identical with both the Ti and T3 subunits were obtained. The two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (nonreducing followed by reducing conditions) of the DSS and BSOCOES cross-linked products revealed the specifically cross-linked bands to have Mr 40,000 and Mr 28,000. These data indicate that the Ti molecule and the T3 molecule are spatially associated on the cell surface and suggest the predominant association is between the Ti β subunit (Mr 40,000) and the T3 heavy subunit (Mr 28,000)."

https://openalex.org/W2018168876,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) is thought to play an etiologic role in the development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In this study the serologic characterization of a new simian retrovirus that is related to HTLV-III is described. This new virus, here referred to as STLV-III, was isolated from sick macaques at the New England Regional Primate Research Center. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed STLV-III-specific proteins of 160, 120, 55, and 24 kilodaltons, all similar in size to the major gag and env proteins of HTLV-III. These antigens were recognized by representative macaque serum samples and human reference serum samples positive for HTLV-III antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies directed to p24, the major core protein of HTLV-III, also immunoprecipitated a 24-kilodalton species in lysates of cells infected with the macaque virus. This HTLV-III-related virus, which naturally infects a nonhuman primate species, may provide a useful model for the study of HTLV-III and the pathogenesis of AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1490215484,"Isolation of a full- or nearly full-length cDNA clone for the type B isozyme of barley alpha-amylase is described. The coding region has a high GC content and an unusual codon bias similar to that described for the type A isozyme cDNA previously characterized by our laboratory. The theoretical secondary structure for the 5' end of this type B mRNA, as well as that for the two previously identified type A transcripts, is unusual in that the AUG initiation codon is enclosed in each instance by a very stable hairpin loop. Results of primer extension experiments utilizing probes for the 5' coding regions of both types of mRNA are consistent with some of the features of these predicted structures. Primer extension experiments utilizing a probe specific for the type B 5' coding region identified only one type of extension products, and these had 5' untranslated region sequences identical to that of the type B cDNA. Thus there appears to be only one major type of type B gene transcribed. Hybridization experiments utilizing 5' probes specific for type A and for the type B mRNA demonstrate different effects of the hormone, gibberellic acid. The type A mRNAs are present in relatively large amounts in unstimulated aleurone cells and increase about 20-fold after stimulation with gibberellic acid. In contrast, the type B mRNA is present at very low levels in unstimulated cells, but increases at least 100-fold after cells are exposed to the hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2019708183,"The amino acid sequences of the human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the human precursor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) show 33 percent identity over a stretch of 400 residues. This region of homologous is encoded by eight contiguous exons in each respective gene. Of the nine introns that separate these exons, five are located in identical positions in the two protein sequences. This finding suggests that the homologous region may have resulted from a duplication of an ancestral gene and that the two genes evolved further by recruitment of exons from other genes, which provided the specific functional domains of the LDL receptor and the EGF precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1998753515,"We have identified a 2.4 kb partial cDNA clone (pDL34) for human von Willebrand factor (vWf) mRNA. pDL34 was selected by screening an endothelial cell cDNA library with a radiolabeled reverse transcript of mRNA obtained by specific immunoisolation of vWf polysomes from endothelial cells. pDL34 selectively hybridized to an endothelial cell-associated 9.5 kb mRNA. To confirm its identity, SP6 RNA polymerase was used to generate in vitro transcripts of the cDNA. This synthetic RNA, truncated at its 5' end, directed the synthesis of several unique polypeptides in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. These polypeptides were immunoprecipitated by polyclonal and monoclonal anti-vWf antibodies. These results indicate that pDL34 contains an authentic partial copy of vWf mRNA. In vitro transcription of partial cDNA clones and translation of the resulting RNAs may be a useful general method of verifying the identity of various cDNA clones in circumstances where antibodies are available and protein sequence is not."

The complementary DNA sequence of the human insulin receptor is similar to those of the EGF receptor (erbB oncogene) and products of the src family of oncogenes. With in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA, the human insulin receptor gene was mapped to the distal short arm of chromosome 19 (bands p13.2----p13.3), a site involved in a nonrandom translocation in pre-B-cell acute leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1519781060,"Abstract Using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter, nonglycosylated human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, representing 10% of the soluble cell protein, has been synthesized in yeast. Two forms of this protein were isolated with one being analogous to the human plasma protein and the other having the amino acid valine replacing methionine at position 358 (the P1 position). Both proteins were more sensitive to heat inactivation than the plasma form, and both had shorter half-lives in rabbits. These differences were presumably due to the absence of carbohydrate. Each protein could bind neutrophil elastase at a rate only slightly slower than that of human plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. However, the valine variant was stable to oxidation, while the P1 methionine-containing protein was readily inactivated. The specificity of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (methionine) was identical to that of the plasma form; however, the valine form could only effectively bind to neutrophil or pancreatic elastase, trypsin-like serine proteinases not being inactivated at all. These data indicate the potential importance of mutant forms of proteinase inhibitors, produced by recombinant DNA technology, as therapeutic agents for the inactivation of excess proteinases of a specific type in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1509410528,"The ductus deferens smooth muscle tumor cell line (DDT1MF-2) contains receptors for, and is stimulated by, androgens. Cells cultured in the absence of androgens maintain a basal level of androgen receptors. Following incubation with various concentrations of the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881) for 1-6 h, the concentration of these receptors increased from 6.0 to 12.2 fmol/micrograms of DNA, while the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.5 nM for this steroid remained unchanged. The steroid-induced increase in androgen receptor levels was specific for androgens and dependent upon protein synthesis. The mechanism of receptor augmentation was examined by utilization of isotopically dense amino acids to determine rates of receptor appearance and degradation in the presence or absence of [3H]R1881. In the absence of androgens, the half-life of the androgen receptor was 3.1 h, with a rate constant (kD) of 0.22/h. In the presence of 1 nM [3H]R1881, however, the half-life was 6.6 h, with kD = 0.11/h. The rate constant for receptor synthesis (ks) in the absence or presence of [3H]R1881 was calculated to be 1.35 and 2.23 fmol/micrograms of DNA/h, respectively. Thus, androgen-induced androgen-receptor augmentation is explained by an increase both in receptor half-life and in rates of receptor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1574418401,"Protein phosphorylation of quiescent human skin fibroblasts was analyzed following stimulation by epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, serum, or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. In mitogen-treated cells, a markedly increased phosphorylation of two Mr = 43,000 proteins and two Mr = 41,000 proteins was always detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. More acidic forms were the dominant species and contained phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine, while the basic forms contained phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. The two Mr = 41,000 proteins were structurally related to each other. All mitogens seemed to stimulate the phosphorylation of each protein with the same site specificity. Induction of the same set of phosphoproteins was observed in mitogen-stimulated rat and mouse fibroblasts as well. These stimulated phosphorylations occurred rapidly, were maximal 5 min after exposure of cells to mitogens, and diminished gradually after 30 min. Mitogen-induced phosphorylation of these proteins was correlated to the extent of mitogen-stimulated DNA synthesis. In addition, such increased protein phosphorylation was not observed in exponentially growing cells, nor in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat cells. Thus, phosphorylation of the Mr = 43,000 and 41,000 proteins, which represents a common and specific response of cells to mitogens, could constitute an early event involved in the control of cellular G0----G1 transition."
https://openalex.org/W2025483254,"The dinucleotide CpUOH, when incubated with self-splicing Tetrahymena pre-rRNA in the absence of GTP, functions as a 5' exon. It cleaves the precursor exactly at the 3' splice site and becomes covalently ligated to the 3' exon. Other oligonucleotides with sequences that resemble CUCUCU, the sequence at the 3' end of the 5' exon, can add to the 3' exon in this reaction. Such splicing in trans is most readily explained by a site within the intervening sequence that binds the last few nucleotides of the 5' exon. This binding site functions in splice site recognition and is also part of the active site of the ribozyme. The mechanism by which 5' splice sites are selected in Tetrahymena rRNA and group I mitochondrial RNA splicing is like that used in nuclear mRNA splicing, in that it involves specific pairing of bases adjacent to the splice site with a complementary RNA sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1538521595,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) was analyzed by electron microscopic and quasi-elastic light scattering techniques in order to evaluate the size and shape of this heterogeneous polymeric plasma glycoprotein. Electron micrographs demonstrated that native vWF molecules are flexible, linear polymers, ranging in contour length from 100 to 1300 nm. In their typical configuration, the polymers were coiled upon themselves with maximal diameters ranging from 60 to 200 nm. Individual repeating protomeric subunits were discernible in occasionally noted, uncoiled polymers and measured 100 nm X 1.5-2.0 nm. Quasi-elastic light scattering analysis confirmed that measurements of the size and shape of purified vWF molecules in solution were similar to those obtained with electron microscopic techniques. In addition, the mean Stokes radius and mean radius of gyration assessed by quasielastic light scattering were directly related over a wide range of values, as were the diameter and contour length measured from electron micrographs, suggesting that the overall shape of polymers does not change with increasing size. This study supports the concept that native vWF molecules are flexible, linear polymers. In addition, this study clearly shows that the polymer configuration assessed from electron micrographs is a valid representation of the configuration of the polymer in solution. The data presented also provide the first evidence for a well-defined, repeating protomeric subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1496681906,"The gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes (i) the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, (ii) the synthesis of tetraribonucleotide primers at specific recognition sequences on a DNA template, and (iii) the unwinding of duplex DNA. All three activities depend on binding of gene 4 protein to single-stranded DNA followed by unidirectional 5' to 3' translocation of the protein (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 205-209). Binding of gene 4 protein to single-stranded DNA, assayed by retention of DNA-protein complexes on nitrocellulose filters, is random with regard to DNA sequence. Although gene 4 protein does not bind to duplex DNAs, the presence of a 240-nucleotide-long single-stranded tail on a 7200-base pair duplex DNA molecule is sufficient for gene 4 protein to cause retention of the DNA on a filter. The binding reaction requires, in addition to MgCl2, the presence of a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate, but binding is not dependent on hydrolysis; nucleoside 5'-diphosphate will substitute for nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. Of the eight common nucleoside triphosphates, dTTP promotes optimal binding. The half-life of the gene 4 protein-DNA complex depends on both the secondary structure of the DNA and on whether or not the nucleoside 5'-triphosphate cofactor can be hydrolyzed. Using the nonhydrolyzable nucleoside 5'-triphosphate analog, beta,gamma-methylene dTTP, the half-life of the gene 4 protein-DNA complex is greater than 80 min. In the presence of the hydrolyzable nucleoside 5'-triphosphate, dTTP, the half-life of the gene 4 protein-DNA complex using circular M13 DNA is at least 4 times longer than that observed using linear M13 DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2006154975,The T-cell receptor for antigen (Ti) was purified from the human tumor cell line HPB-ALL. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of an acid-cleaved peptide of the Ti alpha chain showed that it is highly homologous to a putative murine alpha chain recently described. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the Ti beta chain revealed that it shares 50 percent homology with the Ti beta chain amino acid sequences from two other human T-cell tumors. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a complementary DNA clone encoding the Ti beta chain from the HPB-MLT cell line showed that this chain represents a second human constant region gene segment and suggested that it arises from direct joining of the variable and joining gene segments without any intervening D region sequences.

https://openalex.org/W1998270376,"Mouse parotid acinar cells differentiate and proliferate mainly after birth. During the first 3 weeks of age, alpha-amylase mRNA, one of the major gene products of the adult tissue, increases from barely detectable to adult levels (10(4) copies/cell). Run-on transcription experiments show that this increase is transcriptionally regulated. Northern blot hybridization and in situ hybridization results indicate that the two promoters of the alpha-amylase gene Amy-1a are differentially switched on. First, the weaker downstream promoter is activated, and by 2 weeks of age, virtually all acinar cells have accumulated the transcript initiated at this promoter. At this age the strong Amy-1a promoter is utilized in only a minor proportion of acinar cells, while in the adult this promoter appears to be active in all acinar cells. Thus, the progressive accumulation of alpha-amylase mRNA during postnatal parotid differentiation is mainly the consequence of progressive acinar cell commitment to expression of the strong parotid-specific Amy-1a promoter. The pattern of committing cells during differentiation suggests that once an acinar cell has initiated expression of parotid-type alpha-amylase mRNA, this commitment is passed on to its daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157259153,"Osteosarcoma cells grown in normal culture medium secrete bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (BGP, osteocalcin) which is identical with BGP purified from the bone matrix. Two tests indicate that the secreted medium protein contains the full complement of three gamma-carboxyglutamate residues present on BGP purified from the bone matrix. First, the secreted protein from ROS 17/2 and bone matrix BGP have identical isoelectric points (pI = 4.0). Second, they have identical hydroxyapatite binding behavior. If warfarin is added to the culture medium, the secreted protein has a higher isoelectric point (pI = 4.6) and a lower affinity for hydroxyapatite characteristic of thermally decarboxylated or non-gamma-carboxylated BGP. The observed shift in isoelectric point of secreted BGP after warfarin treatment from pH 4.0 to 4.6 is also reflected in the presence of pI = 4.1 and pI = 4.6 species intracellularly. These isoelectric species correspond to fully carboxylated BGP and noncarboxylated BGP, which are in the process of secretion. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml of warfarin causes a specific 47% reduction in secretion rate of BGP, while at the same time, the intracellular BGP concentration increases 3-fold. These phenomena appear related to the interruption by warfarin of the normal sequence of processing of precursor BGP proteins, as a new, immunoreactive species with a higher isoelectric pH not present in control cells appears to be responsible for the increased intracellular antigen within warfarin-treated cells. Our results show that vitamin K-dependent processing is important for normal secretion of BGP from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1516626843,"In order to elucidate the specificity of rabbit muscle peptidylarginine deiminase, which catalyzes the conversion of arginyl to citrullyl residues (Takahara, H., Oikawa, Y., and Sugawara, K. (1983) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 94, 1945-1953), we examined the action of this enzyme on a variety of trypsin inhibitors by assay of residual trypsin-inhibiting activity. The enzyme rapidly abolished the activity of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) (STI) in a process that was pseudo-first order with the rate dependent on enzyme concentration (second order rate constant = 5.0 X 10(4) M-1 S-1), whereas no detectable changes in activity were noted for other inhibitors tested. Inactivation of STI was due to the conversion of 1 arginine to a citrulline residue and was accompanied with a 0.2 unit decrease of the isoelectric point. There was no alteration of the molecular size and overall conformation of STI. Furthermore, analysis of modified STI indicated that arginine 63, known as the reactive site of STI, is the residue modified by peptidylarginine deiminase. Thus, peptidylarginine deiminase selectively catalyzes the deimination of the functional arginine residue of STI."

Using this priming activity as an assay, we have purified the 61 protein to essential homogeneity in milligram amounts. The priming activity was identified with the product of T4 gene 61 by using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to compare all of the T4-induced proteins in wild-type and mutant infections; the purified protein co-migrates with the only detectable protein missing in a 61- mutant infection. The purified 61 protein is shown to bind to the T4 helix-destabilizing protein (gene 32 protein) and to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. We have failed to detect any ribonucleotide polymerizing activity in either the 61 protein or the 41 protein alone; both the 61 and 41 proteins must be present to observe any synthesis of oligoribonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1582933304,"C1-Tetrahydrofolate synthase is a multifunctional enzyme which catalyzes three reactions in 1-carbon metabolism: 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase. A rapid 1-day purification procedure has been developed which gives 40 mg of pure enzyme from 10 rabbit livers. The 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity of this trifunctional enzyme has a specific activity that is 4-fold higher than the enzyme previously purified from rabbit liver. Conditions have been developed for the rapid isolation of a tryptic fragment of the enzyme which contains the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activities. This fragment is a monomer exhibiting a subunit and native molecular weight of 36,000 in most buffers. However, in phosphate buffers the native molecular weight suggests that the fragment is a dimer. Conditions are also given whereby chymotryptic digestion allows the simultaneous isolation from the native enzyme of a large fragment containing the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity and a smaller fragment containing the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities. The large fragment is a dimer with a subunit molecular weight of 66,000. The small fragment retains all of the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities of the native enzyme. The large fragment is unstable but retains most of the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity. Km values of substrates for the two fragments are the same as the values for the native enzyme. The 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity of the native enzyme requires ammonium or potassium ions for expression of full catalytic activity. The effect of these two ions on the catalytic activity of the large chymotryptic fragment is the same as with the native enzyme. We have shown by differential scanning calorimetry that the native enzyme contains two protein domains which show thermal transitions at 47 and 60 degrees C. Evidence is presented that the two domains are related to the two protein fragments generated by proteolysis of the native enzyme. The larger of the two domains contains the active site for the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity while the smaller domain contains the active site which catalyzes the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase reactions. Replacement of sodium ion buffers with either ammonium or potassium ions results in an increase in stability of the large domain of the native enzyme. This change in stability is not accompanied by a change in the quaternary structure of the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1540544639,"Adenosine (Ado), deoxyadenosine (dAdo), and adenine arabinoside (AraA) inhibit the phagocytosis of IgG-coated erythrocytes and zymosan by resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (thio-macrophages) in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. 3-Deazaadenosine (3cAdo) and adenine (Ade) also inhibit the phagocytosis by resident macrophages. Homocysteine thiolactonate (Hcy) potentiates the inhibition by Ado and 3cAdo while erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) potentiates the inhibition by Ado, dAdo and AraA. This inhibition has a very rapid onset and the drugs do not interfere with the binding of IgG-coated erythrocytes to macrophages. The combination of Ado, Hcy and EHNA does not appreciably affect the intracellular level of ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) in thio-macrophages but causes accumulations of Ado and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) up to 135 and 145 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. During phagocytosis reversal, Ado is metabolized within 15 min while AdoHcy decreases log-arithmically with a half-life of 50 min. Carboxymethylation and phospholipid methylation, however, resume about 60-90 min after phagocytosis has recovered, and thus cannot function as transmembrane signals for phagocytosis. Other evidence showing the lack of correlation between phagocytosis and carboxymethylation inhibition include 1) Ado + Hcy inhibit carboxymethylation much better than Ado + EHNA (91 versus 75%) in thio-macrophage, but the two combinations show comparable phagocytosis inhibition potency; 2) Ado + Hcy inhibit carboxymethylation almost as well as Ado + Hcy + EHNA, but the latter is a much more effective drug combination for phagocytosis inhibition; 3) Ade and 3cAdo, although inhibiting resident macrophage phagocytosis as well as Ado + EHNA + Hcy, are much weaker carboxymethylation inhibitors; 4) dAdo and AraA potently inhibit phagocytosis but not carboxymethylation. The difference in the apparent methylation levels is not due to changes in the specific activities of AdoMet, which decrease with a half-life of 88 min. Interestingly, after the initial lag phase of about 90 min after the initiation of inhibition reversal, carboxymethylation and phagocytosis increase in parallel. In a log-log plot of carboxymethylation, phospholipid methylation, or phagocytosis versus the intracellular AdoHcy accumulation, a linear relationship is obtained. It is possible that AdoHcy accumulation is responsible for phagocytosis inhibition but inhibits by a mechanism other than interfering with protein and lipid methylations."

V., and Young, D. A. J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12718-12722). Here we identify 68 heat shock protein inductions among more than 2,500 individual proteins separated on giant two-dimensional gels and further describe their time course of appearance, sensitivity to cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), and reversibility during recovery. Thirty-one changes are detectable within 1 h. Among these early increases, 20 are inhibitable by cordycepin. However, 11 early changes are not affected by cordycepin; all represent proteins found in relatively low abundance. Five of these inductions are rapidly reversible during recovery from heat shock, in contrast to most other heat shock proteins whose synthesis is maintained or enhanced. One protein identified here appears to be increased by recovery per se. Overall, these results provide evidence for two separate classes of heat shock inductions in normal mammalian cells, i.e. a transcriptionally regulated group, not readily reversible during recovery, and a translationally regulated group in which several inductions rapidly revert to normal during recovery."

Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with CDGF, PDGF, and fetal bovine serum for 3 h, with or without dexamethasone, and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on giant gels. Over 3300 proteins could be distinguished; 34 of these were consistently induced more than 3-fold by all three factors, while an additional 30 inductions were variably present. Dexamethasone by itself induced 8 other proteins, and at least 9 growth factor inductions were synergistically enhanced by addition of the hormone. To identify proteins intimately associated with growth control, we looked for inductions that reflected the dexamethasone synergy with CDGF on DNA synthesis and lack of such an effect with PDGF. The induction of only one group of proteins, the Band 1 isoforms (44-46 kDa, pI 6.1-5.9) displayed such selective synergy. The majority of the other growth factor inductions were inhibited by dexamethasone, even in the context of maximal DNA synthesis, implying that their increased synthesis is not required for growth. When 3T3 cells were treated with increasing doses of CDGF with and without dexamethasone, autoradiographic densities of induced proteins varied in a dose-responsive fashion. However, only levels of the Band 1 proteins bore a constant linear relationship to DNA synthesis, suggesting that they play an important role in early control of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1563863728,"Abstract Two azide analogues of ketanserin (6- and 7-azido-3-[2- [4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-2, 4(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione) were synthesized and tested as possible photoaffinity probes for serotonin-S2 and histamine-H1 receptors. In reversible binding experiments, the azides showed high affinity for both receptor types. When membrane preparations were incubated with nanomolar concentrations of 7-azidoketanserin and subsequently irradiated with UV light, both serotonin and histamine receptors became irreversibly blocked. This irreversible binding was dependent on azide concentrations and time of irradiation and did not change in the presence of the scavenger p-aminobenzoic acid. In contrast, irreversible blockade at low concentrations of 6-azidoketanserin was only obtained for histamine receptors. However, this blockade was abolished by addition of the scavenger p-aminobenzoic acid indicating that it was not due to a real photoaffinity mechanism. In the rat prefrontal cortex, irreversible blocking of serotonin receptors with 7-azidoketanserin could be inhibited by serotonin agonists or antagonists but not by histaminergic compounds. On the contrary, in the guinea pig cerebellum, inactivation of histamine receptors could be inhibited by histamine antagonists and histamine itself but not by serotonergic compounds. This provides a way for differential photolabeling of either of these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1561486507,"Numerous biologically active fragments have been described that are derived from the C3 molecule. Recently, a polypeptide (Mr 41,000) generated from the alpha chain of human iC3b by limited proteolysis with plasma kallikrein was shown to exhibit several biological functions. This C3-derived cleavage product, C3d-K, suppresses mitogen- and antigen-induced proliferation of human T-lymphocytes and induces leukocytosis in rabbits. We have identified and synthesized a portion of C3d-K that is associated with the leukocytosis phenomenon. A nonapeptide corresponding to the amino-terminal nine residues of C3d-K was synthesized using conventional Merrifield solid-phase peptide chemistry; the structure of this peptide is Thr-Leu-Asp-Pro-Glu-Arg-Leu-Gly-Arg (TLDPERLGR). At a final concentration of 4 X 10(-6) M, both the nonapeptide and the des-Arg octapeptide (TLDPERLG) were capable of inducing leukocytosis in rabbits. Additionally, both peptides enhance vascular permeability when injected in guinea pig skin. These activities are similar to those previously attributed to a C3 fragment identified as C3e by Ghebrehiwet and Muller-Eberhard (Ghebrehiwet, B., and Muller-Eberhard, H.J. (1979) J. Immunol. 123, 616-621). We conclude that the nonapeptide TLDPERLGR represents the active center of the C3-derived leukocytosis factors C3e and C3d-K. This active synthetic analogue of C3d-K should prove valuable in elucidating the mechanism of action for complement-dependent leukocyte mobilization in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1597989170,"Fluorescence polarization techniques were used to study the rotational dynamics of the C1q subcomponent of human complement. C1q was covalently labeled with dansyl (DNS) chloride. Digestion of either C1q-DNS4.0 or C1q-DNS1.8 conjugates with pepsin showed that about 75% of the DNS probes were attached to the C1q globular heads and that the remainder were on the collagen-like stalk (peptic fragment). C1q-DNS conjugates readily agglutinated IgG-coated latex beads and combined with C1r2C1s2 to form hemolytically active 16 S C1-DNS. Both C1q-DNS and C1-DNS samples displayed steady-state rotational correlation time and fluorescence lifetime transitions near 48 degrees C. Hydrodynamic studies showed that C1q formed soluble aggregates near the transition temperature. In contrast, stalk samples with a DNS probe apparently attached to the large central fibril showed no thermal transitions or aggregation even when heated above 50 degrees C. Nanosecond fluorescence depolarization measurements detected restricted flexible motions of the C1q heads with an associated rotational correlation time, phi s, of about 25 ns. The C1q anisotropy decay was dominated, however, by a long component, phi L, of perhaps 1000 ns. Except for probe wiggle, the stalk-DNS anisotropy profile was essentially flat. The rapid rotations associated with phi s could represent restricted twisting motions of the arm-head segments or wobbling motions of the heads themselves. Such motions may facilitate binding of the C1q heads to immune complexes. Straightforward diffusion calculations indicated that phi L could represent either global tumbling of the entire C1q molecule or wagging motions of the individual arm-head segments, as suggested by electron micrographs. Upon binding of the C1q heads to an activator, some of the C1q segments may be held in a slightly more open or more closed conformation, which in turn may trigger activation of the C1 proenzymes. In conclusion, we suggest a plausible triggering mechanism for C1 activation that is compatible with the flexible properties of its subcomponents."
https://openalex.org/W1589554082,"Activated human factor IX (factor IXa) was treated under mildly acidic conditions with a mixture of formaldehyde and morpholine. This reagent has been shown to react preferentially with gamma-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues and to convert these residues to gamma-methyleneglutamyl residues (Wright, S.F., Bourne, C.D., Hoke, R.A., Koehler, K.A., and Hiskey, R.G. (1984) Anal. Biochem. 139, 82-90). The modified enzyme was evaluated for coagulant activity and calcium-dependent fluorescence quenching. [14C]Formaldehyde was employed to allow quantitation of the modification and to facilitate localization of the modified residues in the primary structure of factor IXa. In the presence of the [14C]formaldehyde/morpholine reagent, factor IXa rapidly lost coagulant activity, which corresponded to incorporation of radiolabel. Examination of the relationship between protein modification (radiolabel incorporation) and the loss of coagulant activity suggested that modification of 1 mol of Gla/mol of factor IXa results in complete loss of factor IXa coagulant activity. Primary structure analysis of the radioactivity labeled factor IXa suggested that modification of any one of 11 Gla residues was responsible for the loss of coagulant activity. In the presence of calcium, modified factor IXa exhibited a smaller Gla-dependent decrease in protein fluorescence than native factor IXa, but the Gla-independent fluorescence change was the same for both proteins. It therefore appears that the Gla domain of factor IXa must be completely intact for the enzyme to undergo a functionally important calcium-dependent conformational change necessary for coagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W1615125135,"Carbonmonoxy indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase from rabbit small intestine exhibited two CO stretch bands at 1953 and 1933 cm-1 with half-band widths (delta v 1/2) of both approximately 15 cm-1. Upon addition of an excess amount of L-tryptophan, the substrate, the spectrum changed into that with an intense single band at 1902 cm-1 with the delta v 1/2 of 15 cm-1. Carbonmonoxy L-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase of Pseudomonas acidovorans in the absence of L-tryptophan showed a fused CO stretch band which consists of two components at 1965 and 1958 cm-1 (delta v 1/2 for the fused band; 25 cm-1), which was converted into a sharp single band at 1968 cm-1 (delta v 1/2; 10 cm-1) upon addition of excess L-tryptophan. On the other hand, CO complex of rat liver L-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase in the absence of L-tryptophan gave a spectrum with a poorly defined peak around 1961 cm-1. By the addition of L-tryptophan, the spectrum changed into that with two distinct bands at 1972 and 1920 cm-1 (delta v 1/2; 6 and 13 cm-1, respectively). These spectra were insensitive to pH in a range where the enzymes were not denatured (neutral to near pH 9). The infrared spectra of the carbonmonoxy enzymes were also affected by the addition of certain effectors such as skatole and alpha-methyl-DL-tryptophan, which facilitate the binding of L-tryptophan to the catalytic site of intestinal and Pseudomonas enzymes, respectively. However, the changes were of different types from those by the saturating amount of L-tryptophan. Possible mechanisms for these phenomena are discussed in relation to the structure of the heme-CO complex in these heme-containing dioxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1561246366,"A severe genetic deficiency of adenosine deaminase is causally associated with an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, while subjects with absent erythrocyte but lymphocyte enzyme activity remain immunocompetent. The genetic expression of adenosine deaminase in B-lymphoblast cell lines derived from four unrelated subjects with the partial enzyme deficiency was examined. Enzymatic activity among these cell lines ranged from 5 to 50% of normal with the level of immunoreactive adenosine deaminase protein either proportional to enzyme activity or elevated in two of the cases. Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe showed that adenosine deaminase mRNA in each of these cell lines was of normal expected size (1.6-1.8 kilobases) and was present in normal to above normal amounts. Rates of enzyme synthesis varied from 165 to 15% of normal. Adenosine deaminase protein degradation rates in these cell lines were 1.5 to almost 3 times faster than normal, consistent with the observed absence of the enzyme in erythrocytes. From these analyses apparent abnormalities in mRNA regulation, translation, and protein degradation can be identified among the partially adenosine deaminase-deficient cell lines studied. Ultimately, it will be essential to determine the nature of the protein mutation and the gene defect to define the structural alterations and functional abnormalities of enzyme variants isolated from subjects with adenosine deaminase deficiency."
