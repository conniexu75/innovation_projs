https://openalex.org/W3176445847,"The substitution of an alkyl electrophile by a nucleophile is a foundational reaction in organic chemistry that enables the efficient and convergent synthesis of organic molecules. Although there has been substantial recent progress in exploiting transition-metal catalysis to expand the scope of nucleophilic substitution reactions to include carbon nucleophiles1-4, there has been limited progress in corresponding reactions with nitrogen nucleophiles5-8. For many substitution reactions, the bond construction itself is not the only challenge, as there is a need to control stereochemistry at the same time. Here we describe a method for the enantioconvergent substitution of unactivated racemic alkyl electrophiles by a ubiquitous nitrogen-containing functional group, an amide. Our method uses a photoinduced catalyst system based on copper, an Earth-abundant metal. This process for asymmetric N-alkylation relies on three distinct ligands-a bisphosphine, a phenoxide and a chiral diamine. The ligands assemble in situ to form two distinct catalysts that act cooperatively: a copper/bisphosphine/phenoxide complex that serves as a photocatalyst, and a chiral copper/diamine complex that catalyses enantioselective C-N bond formation. Our study thus expands enantioselective N-substitution by alkyl electrophiles beyond activated electrophiles (those bearing at least one sp- or sp2-hybridized substituent on the carbon undergoing substitution)8-13 to include unactivated electrophiles."
https://openalex.org/W3174213266,"The impact of individual scientists is commonly quantified using citation-based measures. The most common such measure is the h-index. A scientist's h-index affects hiring, promotion, and funding decisions, and thus shapes the progress of science. Here we report a large-scale study of scientometric measures, analyzing millions of articles and hundreds of millions of citations across four scientific fields and two data platforms. We find that the correlation of the h-index with awards that indicate recognition by the scientific community has substantially declined. These trends are associated with changing authorship patterns. We show that these declines can be mitigated by fractional allocation of citations among authors, which has been discussed in the literature but not implemented at scale. We find that a fractional analogue of the h-index outperforms other measures as a correlate and predictor of scientific awards. Our results suggest that the use of the h-index in ranking scientists should be reconsidered, and that fractional allocation measures such as h-frac provide more robust alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W3173229792,"Inflammation has an important role in the progression of various viral pneumonia, including COVID-19. Circulating biomarkers that can evaluate inflammation and immune status are potentially useful in diagnosing and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even more so when they are a part of the routine evaluation, chest CT could have even higher diagnostic accuracy than RT-PCT alone in a suggestive clinical context. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and eosinophils with the severity of CT lesions in patients with COVID-19. The second objective was to seek a statically significant cut-off value for NLR and PLR that could suggest COVID-19. Correlation of both NLR and PLR with already established inflammatory markers such as CRP, ESR, and those specific for COVID-19 (ferritin, D-dimers, and eosinophils) were also evaluated. One hundred forty-nine patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 149 age-matched control were evaluated through blood tests, and COVID-19 patients had thorax CT performed. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. When NLR value is below 5.04, CT score is lower than 3 with a probability of 94%, while when NLR is higher than 5.04, the probability of severe CT changes is only 50%. For eosinophils, a value of 0.35% corresponds to chest CT severity of 2 (Se = 0.88, Sp = 0.43, AUC = 0.661, 95% CI (0.544; 0.779), p = 0.021. NLR and PLR had significantly higher values in COVID-19 patients. In our study a NLR = 2.90 and PLR = 186 have a good specificity (0.89, p = 0.001, respectively 0.92, p&lt;0.001). Higher levels in NLR, PLR should prompt the clinician to prescribe a thorax CT as it could reveal important lesions that could influence the patient’s future management."
https://openalex.org/W3177308961,"T cell exhaustion plays critical roles in tumor immune evasion. Novel strategies to suppress immune evasion are in urgent need. We aimed to identify potential compounds to target T cell exhaustion and increase response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between tumors with different immune evasion potential by comparing the transcriptome data. DEGs were then analyzed in the Connectivity Map (CMap) platform to identify potential compounds to increase response to ICIs. Gene set enrichment analysis, LDH release assay, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and Co-IP were performed to explore the potential mechanisms in vitro. Patients derived organoids and humanized xenograft mouse model were utilized to validate the finding ex vivo and in vivo. We identified 25 potential compounds that may play critical roles in regulating tumor immune evasion. We further pinpointed a specific compound, dexamethasone, which shows potent anti-tumor effect in multiple cancer cell lines when cocultured with T cells. Dexamethasone can suppress T cell exhaustion by decreasing the activity of two immune checkpoints simultaneously, including PD-L1 and IDO1. Functional study shows dexamethasone can increase the sensitivity of ICIs in coculture system, 3D organoid model and humanized mouse model. Mechanism study shows dexamethasone mediated transcriptional suppression of PD-L1 and IDO1 depends on the nuclear translocation of GR/STAT3 complex. These findings demonstrate dexamethasone can suppress immune evasion by inducing GR/STAT3 mediated downregulation of PD-L1 and IDO1 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3175954494,"This mixed-method study examined the experiences of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic through surveys, experience sampling data collected over two academic quarters (Spring 2019 n 1 = 253; Spring 2020 n 2 = 147), and semi-structured interviews with 27 undergraduate students. There were no marked changes in mean levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, or loneliness between 2019 and 2020, or over the course of the Spring 2020 term. Students in both the 2019 and 2020 cohort who indicated psychosocial vulnerability at the initial assessment showed worse psychosocial functioning throughout the entire Spring term relative to other students. However, rates of distress increased faster in 2020 than in 2019 for these individuals. Across individuals, homogeneity of variance tests and multi-level models revealed significant heterogeneity, suggesting the need to examine not just means but the variations in individuals’ experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews characterizes these varied experiences, describing the contexts for students’ challenges and strategies. This analysis highlights the interweaving of psychosocial and academic distress: Challenges such as isolation from peers, lack of interactivity with instructors, and difficulty adjusting to family needs had both an emotional and academic toll. Strategies for adjusting to this new context included initiating remote study and hangout sessions with peers, as well as self-learning. In these and other strategies, students used technologies in different ways and for different purposes than they had previously. Supporting qualitative insight about adaptive responses were quantitative findings that students who used more problem-focused forms of coping reported fewer mental health symptoms over the course of the pandemic, even though they perceived their stress as more severe. These findings underline the need for interventions oriented towards problem-focused coping and suggest opportunities for peer role modeling."
https://openalex.org/W3174349641,"Differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic masses is based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB). Several imaging techniques (i.e. gray-scale, color Doppler, contrast-enhancement and elastography) are used for differential diagnosis. However, diagnosis remains highly operator dependent. To address this problem, machine learning algorithms (MLA) can generate an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) by analyzing a large number of clinical images in real-time. We aimed to develop a MLA to characterize focal pancreatic masses during the EUS procedure. The study included 65 patients with focal pancreatic masses, with 20 EUS images selected from each patient (grayscale, color Doppler, arterial and venous phase contrast-enhancement and elastography). Images were classified based on cytopathology exam as: chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis (CPP), neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) and ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The MLA is based on a deep learning method which combines convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. 2688 images were used for training and 672 images for testing the deep learning models. The CNN was developed to identify the discriminative features of images, while a LSTM neural network was used to extract the dependencies between images. The model predicted the clinical diagnosis with an area under curve index of 0.98 and an overall accuracy of 98.26%. The negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values and the corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CI) are 96.7%, [94.5, 98.9] and 98.1%, [96.81, 99.4] for PDAC, 96.5%, [94.1, 98.8], and 99.7%, [99.3, 100] for CPP, and 98.9%, [97.5, 100] and 98.3%, [97.1, 99.4] for PNET. Following further validation on a independent test cohort, this method could become an efficient CAD tool to differentiate focal pancreatic masses in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W3174066121,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures adopted by countries globally can lead to stress and anxiety. Investigating the coping strategies to this unprecedented crisis is essential to guide mental health intervention and public health policy. This study examined how people are coping with the COVID-19 crisis in Ghana and identify factors influencing it. Methods This study was part of a multinational online cross-sectional survey on Personal and Family Coping with COVID-19 in the Global South. The study population included adults, ≥18 years and residents in Ghana. Respondents were recruited through different platforms, including social media and phone calls. The questionnaire was composed of different psychometrically validated instruments with coping as the outcome variable measured on the ordinal scale with 3 levels, namely, Not well or worse, Neutral, and Well or better. An ordinal logistic regression model using proportional odds assumption was then applied. Results A total of 811 responses were included in the analysis with 45.2% describing their coping level as well/better, 42.4% as neither worse nor better and 12.4% as worse/not well. Many respondents (46.9%) were between 25–34 years, 50.1% were males while 79.2% lived in urban Ghana. Having pre-existing conditions increased the chances of not coping well (aOR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.15–3.01). Not being concerned about supporting the family financially (aOR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.06–2.68) or having the feeling that life is better during the pandemic (aOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.26–4.62) increased chances of coping well. Praying (aOR: 0.62, 95%CI: 0.43–0.90) or sleeping (aOR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34–0.89) more during the pandemic than before reduces coping. Conclusion In Ghana, during the COVID-19 pandemic, financial security and optimism about the disease increase one’s chances of coping well while having pre-existing medical conditions, praying and sleeping more during the pandemic than before reduces one’s chances of coping well. These findings should be considered in planning mental health and public health intervention/policy."
https://openalex.org/W3176739457,"Class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are Zn2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics to confer resistance in bacteria. Several problematic groups of MBLs belong to subclass B1, including the binuclear New Delhi MBL (NDM), Verona integrin-encoded MBL, and imipenemase-type enzymes, which are responsible for widespread antibiotic resistance. Aspergillomarasmine A (AMA) is a natural aminopolycarboxylic acid that functions as an effective inhibitor of class B1 MBLs. The precise mechanism of action of AMA is not thoroughly understood, but it is known to inactivate MBLs by removing one catalytic Zn2+ cofactor. We investigated the kinetics of MBL inactivation in detail and report that AMA is a selective Zn2+ scavenger that indirectly inactivates NDM-1 by encouraging the dissociation of a metal cofactor. To further investigate the mechanism in living bacteria, we used an active site probe and showed that AMA causes the loss of a Zn2+ ion from a low-affinity binding site of NDM-1. Zn2+-depleted NDM-1 is rapidly degraded, contributing to the efficacy of AMA as a β-lactam potentiator. However, MBLs with higher metal affinity and stability such as NDM-6 and imipenemase-7 exhibit greater tolerance to AMA. These results indicate that the mechanism of AMA is broadly applicable to diverse Zn2+ chelators and highlight that leveraging Zn2+ availability can influence the survival of MBL-producing bacteria when they are exposed to β-lactam antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3176459384,"One of the European gold standard measurement of vascular ageing, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), which requires an experienced operator to measure pulse waves at two sites. In this work, two machine learning pipelines were proposed to estimate cfPWV from the peripheral pulse wave measured at a single site, the radial pressure wave measured by applanation tonometry. The study populations were the Twins UK cohort containing 3,082 subjects aged from 18 to 110 years, and a database containing 4,374 virtual subjects aged from 25 to 75 years. The first pipeline uses Gaussian process regression to estimate cfPWV from features extracted from the radial pressure wave using pulse wave analysis. The mean difference and upper and lower limits of agreement (LOA) of the estimation on the 924 hold-out test subjects from the Twins UK cohort were 0.2 m/s, and 3.75 m/s & -3.34 m/s, respectively. The second pipeline uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to estimate cfPWV from the entire radial pressure wave. The mean difference and upper and lower LOA of the estimation on the 924 hold-out test subjects from the Twins UK cohort were 0.05 m/s, and 3.21 m/s & -3.11m/s, respectively. The percentage error of the RNN estimates on the virtual subjects increased by less than 2% when adding 20% of random noise to the pressure waveform. These results show the possibility of assessing the vascular ageing using a single peripheral pulse wave (e.g. the radial pressure wave), instead of cfPWV. The proposed code for the machine learning pipelines is available from the following online depository (https://github.com/WeiweiJin/Estimate-Cardiovascular-Risk-from-Pulse-Wave-Signal)."
https://openalex.org/W3177389752,"Countries across the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with what might well be the set of biggest state-led mobility and activity restrictions in the history of humankind. But how effective were these measures across countries? Compared to multiple recent studies that document an association between such restrictions and the control of the contagion, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate the causal effect of these restrictions on mobility, and the growth rate of confirmed cases and deaths during the first wave of the pandemic. Using the level of stringency in the rest of the world to predict the level of stringency of the restriction measures in a country, we show while stricter contemporaneous measures affected mobility, stringency in seven to fourteen days mattered most for containing the contagion. Heterogeneity analysis, by various institutional inequalities, reveals that even though the restrictions reduced mobility more in relatively less-developed countries, the causal effect of a reduction in mobility was higher in more developed countries. We propose several explanations. Our results highlight the need to complement mobility and activity restrictions with other health and information measures, especially in less-developed countries, to combat the COVID-19 pandemic effectively."
https://openalex.org/W3175131027,"Accumulation of mutant p53 (mutp53) is crucial for its oncogenic gain of function activity. DNAJA1, a member of J-domain containing proteins or heat shock protein 40, is shown to prevent unfolded mutp53 from proteasomal degradation. However, the biological function of DNAJA1 remains largely unknown. Here we show that DNAJA1 promotes tumor metastasis by accumulating unfolded mutp53. Levels of DNAJA1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues were higher than those in normal tissues. Knockdown of DNAJA1 in HNSCC cell lines carrying unfolded mutp53 significantly decreased the levels of mutp53, filopodia/lamellipodia formation, migratory potential, and active forms of CDC42/RAC1, which were not observed in HNSCC cells with DNA contact mutp53, wild-type p53, or p53 null. Such mutp53-dependent functions of DNAJA1 were supported by the observation that DNAJA1 selectively bound to unfolded mutp53. Moreover, DNAJA1 knockdown in HNSCC cells carrying unfolded mutp53 inhibited primary tumor growth and metastases to the lymph nodes and lungs. Our study suggests that DNAJA1 promotes HNSCC metastasis mainly in a manner dependent on mutp53 status, suggesting DNAJA1 as a potential therapeutic target for HNSCC harboring unfolded mutp53."
https://openalex.org/W3175985288,"Eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role in orchestrating the assembly of the replisome complex, stimulating processive DNA synthesis, and recruiting other regulatory proteins during the DNA damage response. PCNA and its binding partner network are relatively conserved in eukaryotes, and it exhibits extraordinary structural similarity across species. However, despite this structural similarity, the PCNA of a given species is rarely functional in heterologous systems. In this report, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of Neurospora crassa PCNA (NcPCNA) and compared its structure–function relationship with other available PCNA studies to understand this cross-species incompatibility. We found two regions, the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL) and J loop structures, vary significantly among PCNAs. In particular, the J loop deviates in NcPCNA from that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA (ScPCNA) by 7 Å. Differences in the IDCL structures result in varied binding affinities of PCNAs for the subunit Pol32 of DNA polymerase delta and for T2-amino alcohol, a small-molecule inhibitor of human PCNA. To validate that these structural differences are accountable for functional incompatibility in S. cerevisiae, we generated NcPCNA mutants mimicking IDCL and J loop structures of ScPCNA. Our genetic analyses suggested that NcPCNA mutants are fully functional in S. cerevisiae. The susceptibility of the strains harboring ScPCNA mimics of NcPCNA to various genotoxic agents was similar to that in yeast cells expressing ScPCNA. Taken together, we conclude that in addition to the overall architecture of PCNA, structures of the IDCL and J loop of PCNA are critical determinants of interspecies functional compatibility.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role during DNA replication, repair, and recombination processes. Mostly, it acts as a docking platform for several proteins involved in DNA synthesis, DNA damage response, chromatin assembly, cell cycle control, and chromatin remodeling and regulates their activities (1Acharya N.

PCNA is evolutionarily conserved not only in function but also in the structure across eukaryotic species. Despite the variation in amino acid sequences of PCNA from several different organisms, their overall atomic structures are markedly superimposed.

A typical eukaryotic PCNA consists of three protomers to form a toroidal-shaped structure with pseudo-6-fold symmetry that encircles the DNA double helix. Each PCNA protomer consists of two globular topologically identical domains connected by an interdomain connecting loop (IDCL). Considering remarkable PCNA structural and functional similarities, cross-species complementation of PCNA should be seemingly possible. However, it is hardly observed, as the function of a PCNA in a heterologous system mostly depends upon its affinity toward the PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) box motif of cellular proteins involved in replication and repair. The PIP box present in the PCNA-binding partner moors into the hydrophobic cavity formed by the IDCL region. An earlier study classified fungal PCNAs into two compatible groups (11Zamir L. Zaretsky M. Fridman Y. Ner-Gaon H. Rubin E. Aharoni A. Tight coevolution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-partner interaction networks in fungi leads to interspecies network incompatibility.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E406-E414Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Group I includes PCNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida sp., Kluyveromyces waltti, Ashbya gossypii, and Debaryomyces hansenii and group II from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Yarrowia lipolytica, Neurospora crassa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. IDCL and the C-terminal tail of PCNA, which are involved in PCNA–protein interaction, are highly conserved in their respective groups (Fig. S1A). Based on the sequence alignment, human PCNA could also be placed in group II. It was suggested that the interspecies compatibility of PCNAs only exists within the specific group. PCNAs belonging to group II will not functionally replace PCNA in group I species and vice versa (11Zamir L. Zaretsky M. Fridman Y. Ner-Gaon H. Rubin E. Aharoni A.

To understand species specificity of PCNA and its functional compatibility across fungal species in greater detail, we have characterized PCNA from N. crassa and compared it with PCNA from S. cerevisiae, and the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and A. fumigatus (6Manohar K.

Although C. albicans PCNA (CaPCNA) possesses significant IDCL sequence identity and belongs to group I, contrary to the earlier report, CaPCNA is functionally noncompatible in S. cerevisiae (6Manohar K.

Our comparative structural analyses revealed that CaPCNA displayed noticeable structural alterations in the hydrophobic pocket, J loop, and P loop regions (9Sundaram R. Manohar K. Patel S.K. Acharya N. Vasudevan D. Structural analyses of PCNA from the fungal pathogen Candida albicans identify three regions with species-specific conformations.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 1328-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). While the IDCL and J-loop of PCNA are involved in ligand interaction, the P loop plays a regulatory role by undergoing post-translational modifications. Therefore, to understand the precise roles of IDCL and J loop in determining species specificity, herein, we expressed, purified, and determined the crystal structure of N. crassa PCNA (NcPCNA) and characterized its function in S. cerevisiae. Our biochemical and X-ray structure analyses suggested that NcPCNA also forms a homotrimeric ring. The overall three-dimensional architectures of these fungal PCNAs are very similar. However, similar to CaPCNA, NcPCNA also exhibits structural variations in the IDCL and J loop regions. Our genetic analyses suggested that although NcPCNA can rescue the loss of function of S. cerevisiae PCNA (ScPCNA) in S. cerevisiae, it is inefficient in carrying out DNA replication and repair. Our mutational analyses further confirmed that IDCL and J loop structures are critical in determining the functional specificity of PCNA. Taken together, we suggest that PCNA is a highly species-specific protein. Despite similar architecture among PCNAs, certain unique structural elements such as IDCL and J loop determine interspecies compatibility. To identify a putative homologue of ScPCNA in N. crassa, we searched its genome database (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/neurospora/Home.html) by BLAST. The search identified the NcPCNA homologue that corresponds to pcn (Gene I.D.: NCU09239 and Protein I.D.:XP_964674.1) in the database with a score of 4e−86, identity of 47%, and similarity of 69% (Fig. 1). The putative NcPCNA amino acid sequence showed homology with a score of 2e−157, identity of 80%, and similarity of 91%, and homology with a score of 2e−92, identity of 49%, and similarity of 72% with A. fumigatus PCNA (AfPCNA) and CaPCNA sequences, respectively. Interestingly, unlike in other known fungal species, the pcn gene carries two extreme end introns juxtaposed between the exons (Fig. S1C). In the 949 nucleotides of gene sequence, intron 1 and intron 2 are located from 45 to 140 nts and 859 to 931 nts, respectively. The three-dimensional structures are known for the other three fungal PCNAs, but not for NcPCNA. The amino acid sequence alignment suggests that NcPCNA possesses all the critical structural regions such as the central loop, J loop, IDCL, P loop, and the C-terminal tail required for the conserved functions of PCNA. Among these loops, the J loop located in the dimeric interface highly diverges among the PCNA from different species. Similarly, in the IDCL, of 16 residues, four residues (Q123, H125, G/A127, and P129) are different in NcPCNA and AfPCNA, compared with those in ScPCNA (Fig. S1A). The remaining 12 residues of the IDCL are either identical or conserved. Because the IDCL is involved in critical interactions with DNA polymerases and other DNA transaction proteins and the J loop in PCNA trimerization, whether the residue variations in these two loops of NcPCNA will lead to functional differences among the PCNAs made us investigate this protein further. Nevertheless, it is apparent from the sequence alignments that NcPCNA and AfPCNA diverge from ScPCNA and CaPCNA. Therefore, they have been rightly placed in different compatible groups (11Zamir L. Zaretsky M. Fridman Y. Ner-Gaon H. Rubin E. Aharoni A. Tight coevolution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-partner interaction networks in fungi leads to interspecies network incompatibility.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E406-E414Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The J loop is formed by the residues between the β-strands β8 and β9 and plays an important role in intersubunit interactions and stabilization of the homotrimeric architecture of PCNA. Earlier studies on two mutants of ScPCNA (G178S and E113G) with altered J loop conformations revealed that deformation of the J loop weakens the intermolecular interaction and results in monomeric or dimeric PCNA in vitro (12Freudenthal B.D. Ramaswamy S. Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T.

Washington M.T. PCNA trimer instability inhibits translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase eta and by DNA polymerase delta.DNA Repair. 2013; 12: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because we noticed amino acid variations in the J loop region of NcPCNA, to characterize NcPCNA further, the protein was purified using an amino-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tag expression vector from bacterial cells. Similarly, the WT and G178S mutant of ScPCNA were also purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2A). NcPCNA encodes a predicted 28.64-kDa protein composed of 259 amino acids and is one residue longer than ScPCNA (28.9 kDa) at its carboxyl terminus. Surprisingly, despite having almost similar molecular mass, NcPCNA showed abnormal mobility and migrated slower than the WT and G178S mutant of ScPCNAs in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3). However, in a nondenaturating condition where proteins migrate based on their mass and isoelectric point, both NcPCNA (∼29 kDa, pI 4.42) and WT ScPCNA (∼29 kDa, pI 4.51) migrated at a similar position (Fig. 2B, compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3). As reported earlier, the ScPCNA G178S mutant migrates faster than the WT ScPCNA in its monomeric form (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These results suggested that, like ScPCNA, NcPCNA also exists as a homotrimer in the solution. At 2 M urea, ScPCNA trimer destabilizes and breaks down to monomeric forms of PCNA. Interestingly, NcPCNA did not form smaller subunits; instead, it showed aggregation or higher-order oligomerization (Fig. 2C, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). This observation was further supported by analytical size-exclusion chromatography, where NcPCNA eluted differently with and without 2 M urea (Fig. 2D). In the presence of urea, NcPCNA eluted early at ∼1.4 ml elution volume (red line), suggesting higher molecular weight forms of PCNA; however, in the absence of urea, it eluted at ∼1.6-ml elution volume, where trimeric ScPCNA also elutes. Taken together, this result suggested that despite amino acid variation in the J loop, in the native state, NcPCNA exists as a homotrimer. However, in the presence of denaturants such as SDS or 2 M urea, NcPCNA exhibits abnormal property and migrates differently. To understand the structure–function relationship, NcPCNA was purified and crystallized and the crystal structure solved. The NcPCNA crystal belonged to the space group H3, wherein the asymmetric unit (ASU) contained a single monomer of NcPCNA. The structure was solved using molecular replacement with AfPCNA structure as the search model (PDB ID: 5TUP) (10Marshall A.C. Kroker A.J. Murray L.A. Gronthos K. Rajapaksha H. Wegener K.L.

The structure was solved to 1.95 Å resolution, and the structure refinement statistics are given in Table 1.

NcPCNA forms a trimer in crystal structure and also in the solution, which is consistent with other eukaryotic PCNAs (Fig. 3C). The structural superimposition of NcPCNA with AfPCNA, CaPCNA, and ScPCNA revealed that NcPCNA shares a high degree of structural similarity with RMSD values of 0.65 Å, 0.62 Å, and 1.3 Å, respectively. PDBe-PISA web server was used to analyze the interface and the assembly state of NcPCNA. The buried surface area at the interface of NcPCNA is 725 Å2, and that is comparable with the values for CaPCNA (720 Å2), AfPCNA (656 Å2), and ScPCNA (654 Å2). Each NcPCNA protomer consists of two domains, A and B (Fig. 3D). The N-terminal region (residues Met1 to Lys117) forms domain A and is interlinked to domain B (residues Ala134 to Glu259) at the C terminus by a dynamic IDCL made up of residues Leu117 to Tyr133. Domains A (β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-β5-β6-α2-β7-β8-β9) and B (β10-α3-β11-β12-β13-β14-β15-α4-β16-β17-β18) shared nearly an identical topology. The central channel of the NcPCNA revealed a positively charged lining because of the presence of basic residues, mostly lysine and a few arginine residues, probably involved in the interaction with DNA as has been shown in other PCNAs (Fig. S2, A and B). These residues (K13, K14, K20, K77, R80, R146, K210, and K217) are also conserved in PCNAs from other organisms. The function of PCNA is also modulated through post-translational modifications (14Gonzalez-Magana A. Blanco F.J. Human PCNA structure, function and interactions.Biomolecules. 2020; 10: 570Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In many PCNA sequences, Lys117, Lys164, and Lys168 residues that undergo ubiquitination and SUMOylation are conserved and are located at similar positions in their three-dimensional structures. Tyr114 and Tyr211 that undergo phosphorylation in human PCNA are also placed at similar positions in NcPCNA (Fig. S2C). Thus, the overall architecture of PCNA is conserved across fungal species. Because most of the residues that undergo epigenetic modifications are conserved in eukaryotic PCNAs, the modulation of PCNA functions by epigenetic modifications appears to be maintained during evolution. Four major loops in a PCNA structure, such as the central loop (residues Asp41 to Ala46), J loop (residues Ser105 to Arg110), IDCL (residues Leu117 to Tyr133), and P loop (residues Gln184 to Ile195), have functional significance (Fig. 3D). These loops are reported to be involved in recruiting other binding partners directly or through epigenetic modifications. While the IDCL, central, and P loops exhibit higher amino acid sequence homology across different organisms, the residues in the J loop of PCNAs show significant diversity (Fig. 1). Irrespective of sequence homology, the conformations of these loop regions are distinct among different species and could be responsible for species specificity. The IDCL, P loop, and J loop exhibit considerable flexibility and adopt different states (9Sundaram R. Manohar K. Patel S.K. Acharya N. Vasudevan D. Structural analyses of PCNA from the fungal pathogen Candida albicans identify three regions with species-specific conformations.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 1328-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Usually, owing to high flexibility, IDCLs are unstructured in some of the protomers of the various available PCNA trimer structures. Interestingly, in the crystal structure of NcPCNA, the protomer revealed a stable IDCL structure. Upon overlapping with other fungal PCNA structures, we observed noticeable differences in the IDCL conformations (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3A). Only a partial overlapping of the IDCLs was observed. IDCL residues of group I PCNAs (Sc and Ca) are quite different from that of group II PCNAs (Nc and Af), and it could be the reason behind distinct conformations. Because the IDCL acts as a hotspot for protein–protein interactions, these differences may impact the binding affinity of PCNA for its interaction partners, thereby impacting PCNA functions in the cell. Structural alignment of NcPCNA with CaPCNA, AfPCNA, and ScPCNA revealed distinct conformations in the J loop region among the fungal PCNAs (Fig. 4B). The position of the J loop of NcPCNA was found to be displaced 7 Å away from that of the J loop of ScPCNA (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3B). The P loop (residues Gln184 to Ile195) of PCNA is a bona fide site for epigenetic modifications such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination. There are no significant changes in this region between the different fungal PCNA structures (Fig. 4C). At the monomer–monomer interface, the antiparallel β-strands β13 and β9′ are held by extensive hydrogen bonds. The residues involved and the bonding patterns between these β-strands are similar among the different fungal species (Fig. 4D, Table 2). However, the interface formed by the α-helices α3 and α2′ showed some differences in NcPCNA. At this α-helical interface of NcPCNA, Lys77 does not form any hydrogen bond because of its different orientation (Fig. 4E). However, Lys77 forms a hydrogen bond with Ala153, Lys153, and Asn153 residue in AfPCNA, ScPCNA, and CaPCNA, respectively. Similarly, Arg146 makes another unique interaction in NcPCNA. Arg146 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg80 and Ala82 in NcPCNA. In the case of AfPCNA, Glu146 interacts with Asn83, whereas in CaPCNA and ScPCNA, the corresponding Lys146 forms hydrogen bonds with Ser81 and Arg80, respectively. Another differential interaction mode is displayed by Glu143, where it interacts with Arg110 in both ScPCNA and AfPCNA. However, in NcPCNA, the Glu143 forms a hydrogen bond with Asn108 instead of the residue at position 110 (Fig. 4E). Thus, although the overall architecture of PCNA is conserved, structural alterations in the loops and interface exist among the fungal PCNAs that could attribute to stability and functional variations.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterNcPCNAData collection BeamlineRRCAT-PX BL21 Detector typeMAR mosaic 225 mm CCD Wavelength (Å)0.9794 Data collection temperature (K)100 Space groupH3 a, b, c (Å)86.29, 86.29, 91.94 α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120 Resolution (Å)39.15–1.95 (2.0–1.95) Mean I/σ(I)12.5 (1.9) CC1/20.994 (0.602) Completeness (%)99.9 (100) Total number of reflections109,680 (7782) Rp.i.m.0.075 (0.541) Rmerge0.105 (0.750) Rmeas0.129 (0.928) Multiplicity5.9 (5.8) Wilson B-factor (Å2)21.1 Matthew’s coefficient (Å3/Da)2.26 Solvent content (%)45.63 No. of molecules in ASU1Refinement No. of unique reflections18,622 (1336) Twining type/fractionMerohedral/0.192 Twin lawh, -h-k, -l Rwork/Rfree (%)19.6/23.5 Total no. of atoms2123 No. of protein atoms1975 No. of solvent atoms148 Mean B-factor (Å2)29.0 Mean B-factor main chain atoms (Å2)27.18 Mean B-factor side chain atoms (Å2)31.53RMSD Bond lengths (Å)0.01 Bond angles (°)1.138Ramachandran plot (%) Favored region96.85 Allowed region3.15 Outliers0.0 Clash score2.0 MolProbity score1.23 PDB ID7EP8 Open table in a new tab We compared the binding affinities of NcPCNA and ScPCNA with Pol32, the PCNA-binding subunit of replicative DNA polymerase delta and T2-amino alcohol (T2AA) that has been shown to interact with human PCNA by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

https://openalex.org/W3155093542,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (Sgk3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) downstream of growth factor signaling via class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and by class III PI3K/Vps34-mediated PI3P production on endosomes. Upregulation of Sgk3 activity has recently been linked to a number of human cancers; however, the precise mechanism of activation of Sgk3 is unknown. Here, we use a wide range of cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical techniques, including hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, to investigate the mechanism of activation of Sgk3 by PI3P. We show that Sgk3 is regulated by a combination of phosphorylation and allosteric activation. We demonstrate that binding of Sgk3 to PI3P via its regulatory phox homology (PX) domain induces large conformational changes in Sgk3 associated with its activation and that the PI3P-binding pocket of the PX domain of Sgk3 is sequestered in its inactive conformation. Finally, we reconstitute Sgk3 activation via Vps34-mediated PI3P synthesis on phosphatidylinositol liposomes in vitro. In addition to identifying the mechanism of Sgk3 activation by PI3P, our findings open up potential therapeutic avenues in allosteric inhibitor development to target Sgk3 in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3173596797,"Immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (ICB) with antibodies such as anti-PD-1 has revolutionised the treatment of many cancers. Despite its use to treat COVID-19 patients and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on cancer immunotherapy has not been examined. In this study, remarkably, we find that HCQ alone, or in combination with azithromycin (AZ), at doses used to treat patients, decreased the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in cancer immunotherapy. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also impaired the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T cells, FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), thymic subsets, B cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice. This study indicates for the first time that HCQ and HCQ/AZ negatively impact the ability of anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade to promote tumor rejection."

Recent evidence suggests both significant and insignificant ways in which SMS-based agricultural information could affect farming outcomes. It is unclear if variations in the programs' design or the methodological challenges in evaluating the programs cause wide-ranging impacts. Extension hotline services provide rapid, unambiguous information by agricultural experts over the phone, tailored to time- and crop-specific shocks. Using methods from experimental economics, we randomly distributed the hotline number to generate exogenous variation in the access to farming information. We conducted our study among 300 farmers in the South Indian state of Karnataka. Our results show that eliminating informational inefficiencies increases farmers' average yields for a high-stakes pigeon pea crop that faced adverse aggregate shock. The impact on the yield is through the adoption of cost-effective and improved farming practices. However, we do not observe any effect on the crops that were not affected by the shock. Our findings reveal that advisory recommendations customized to time- and crop-specific shocks are associated with a greater impact on agricultural productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3163179326,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally had to impose severe contact restriction measures and social mobility limitations in order to limit the exposure of the population to COVID-19. These public health policy decisions were informed by statistical models for infection rates in national populations. In this work, we are interested in modelling the temporal evolution of national-level infection counts for the United Kingdom (UK—Wales, England, Scotland), Germany (GM), Italy (IT), Spain (SP), Japan (JP), Australia (AU) and the United States (US). We model the national-level infection counts for the period January 2020 to January 2021, thus covering both the pre- and post-vaccine roll-out periods, in order to better understand the most reliable model structure for the COVID-19 epidemic growth curve. We achieve this by exploring a variety of stochastic population growth models and comparing their calibration, with respect to in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, both with and without exposure adjustment, to the most widely used and reported growth model, the Gompertz population model, often referred to in the public health policy discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Model risk as we explore it in this work manifests in the inability to adequately capture the behaviour of the disease progression growth rate curve. Therefore, our concept of model risk is formed relative to the standard reference Gompertz model used by decision-makers, and then we can characterise model risk mathematically as having two components: the dispersion of the observation distribution, and the structure of the intensity function over time for cumulative counts of new infections daily (i.e. the force of infection) attributed directly to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explore how to incorporate in these population models the effect that governmental interventions have had on the number of infected cases. This is achieved through the development of an exposure adjustment to the force of infection comprised of a purpose-built sentiment index, which we construct from various authoritative public health news reporting. The news reporting media we employed were the New York Times, the Guardian, the Telegraph, Reuters global blog, as well as national and international health authorities: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organisation. We find that exposure adjustments that incorporate sentiment are better able to calibrate to early stages of infection spread in all countries under study."
https://openalex.org/W3174409794,"In this paper, the coevolution mechanism of trust-based partner switching among partitioned regions on an adaptive network is studied. We investigate a low-information approach to building trust and cooperation in public goods games. Unlike reputation, trust scores are only given to players by those with whom they have a relationship in the game, depending on the game they play together. A player’s trust score for a certain neighbor is given and known by that player only. Players can adjust their connections to neighbors with low trust scores by switching their partners to other players. When switching partners, players divide other nodes in the network into three regions: immediate neighbors as the known region, indirectly connected second-order neighbors as the intermediate region, and other nodes as the unknown region. Such choices and compartmentalization often occur in global and regional economies. Our results show that preference for switching to partners in the intermediate region is not conducive to spreading cooperation, while random selection has the disadvantage of protecting the cooperator. However, selecting new partners in the remaining two regions based on the average trust score of the known region performs well in both protecting partners and finding potential cooperators. Meanwhile, by analyzing the parameters, we find that the influence of vigilance increasing against unsatisfactory behavior on evolution direction depends on the level of cooperation reward."
https://openalex.org/W3177304573,"The Pseudomonas putida F1 genome contains five genes annotated as encoding 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases. Four are annotated as encoding FabF (3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II) proteins, and the fifth is annotated as encoding a FabB (3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I) protein. Expression of one of the FabF proteins, FabF2, is cryptic in the native host and becomes physiologically important only when the repressor controlling fabF2 transcription is inactivated. When derepressed, FabF2 can functionally replace FabB, and when expressed from a foreign promoter, had weak FabF activity. Complementation of Escherichia coli fabB and fabF mutant strains with high expression showed that P. putida fabF1 restored E. coli fabF function, whereas fabB restored E. coli fabB function and fabF2 restored the functions of both E. coli fabF and fabB. The P. putida ΔfabF1 deletion strain was almost entirely defective in synthesis of cis-vaccenic acid, whereas the ΔfabB strain is an unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) auxotroph that accumulated high levels of spontaneous suppressors in the absence of UFA supplementation. This was due to increased expression of fabF2 that bypasses loss of fabB because of the inactivation of the regulator, Pput_2425, encoded in the same operon as fabF2. Spontaneous suppressor accumulation was decreased by high levels of UFA supplementation, whereas competition by the P. putida β-oxidation pathway gave increased accumulation. The ΔfabB ΔfabF2 strain is a stable UFA auxotroph indicating that suppressor accumulation requires FabF2 function.

Although P. putida and P. aeruginosa have a high level of genomic conservation (85% of the predicted coding regions are shared), P. putida genomes lack key virulence factors including exotoxin A and type III secretion systems (4Nelson K.E.

Therefore, P. putida is considered a safe bacterium for cloning and expression of foreign genes and is a major Pseudomonas research organism (1Timmis K.N.

Fatty acids are the major components of membrane phospholipids (6Spector A.A. Yorek M.A. Membrane lipid composition and cellular function.J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1015-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria use the type II fatty acid synthesis system to produce long-chain fatty acids through a cycle of elongation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction reactions catalyzed by a series of discrete enzymes (7Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis: Targets for antibacterial drug discovery.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). The 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthases catalyze the elongation reactions of fatty acid synthesis (Scheme 1). Escherichia coli has two long-chain 3-ketoacyl ACP synthases: 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase I (FabB) and 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase II (FabF). E. coli FabB is required to elongate cis-3-decenoyl ACP to long-chain unsaturated acyl-ACPs and together with FabA is a key enzyme in unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis (8Kauppinen S. Siggaard-Andersen M. von Wettstein-Knowles P. beta-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase I of Escherichia coli: Nucleotide sequence of the fabB gene and identification of the cerulenin binding residue.Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1988; 53: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). E. coli FabF is responsible for extending saturated acyl ACPs and for conversion of cis-9-hexadecenoyl-ACP (palmitoleoyl-ACP) to cis-11-octadecenoyl-ACP (cis-vaccenoyl-ACP), a reaction regulated by growth temperature (9Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II of Escherichia coli. Evidence for function in the thermal regulation of fatty acid synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3263-3265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although many diverse bacteria encode long-chain 3-ketoacyl ACP synthases similar to E. coli FabB and FabF, there are significant differences. The Haemophilus influenzae genome encodes only fabB and lacks fabF (10Wang H. Cronan J.E. Haemophilus influenzae Rd lacks a stringently conserved fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme and thermal control of membrane lipid composition.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4930-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Clostridium acetobutylicium and Ralstonia solanacearum each have only a single 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase, but these FabF enzymes have both 3-ketoacyl ACP synthetase I (FabB) and II (FabF) activities (11Zhu L. Cheng J. Luo B. Feng S. Lin J. Wang S. Cronan J.E. Wang H.

Microbiol. 2012; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Lactococcus lactis FabF also has both FabB and FabF activities, but upon overexpression, the FabF can replace FabH, the short-chain 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase III (13Lai C.Y. Cronan J.E. Beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) is essential for bacterial fatty acid synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51494-51503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Shewanella oneidensis MR has one fabB and two fabF genes where fabF1 has the functions of both 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase I and II (14Luo Q.X. Li M. Fu H.H. Meng Q. Gao H.C. Shewanella oneidensis FabB: A beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase that works with C16:1-ACP.Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Increased expression of fabF1 can restore the synthesis of UFAs when the pathway is blocked by inactivation of fabB (15Li M. Meng Q. Fu H.H. Luo Q.X. Gao H.C. Suppression of fabB mutation by fabF1 is mediated by transcription read-through in Shewanella oneidensis.J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The genome of P. putida F1 shows complexity in that four fabF genes are annotated: together with a single fabB, only the fabF1 and fabB genes are located with other fatty acid synthesis genes (Fig. S2). Complementation studies using E. coli fabB and fabB(Ts) fabF mutant strains showed that fabF2 has the functions of both E. coli enzymes when highly expressed. In the pseudomonads, fabF2 is ubiquitous and homologous genes are found in other bacteria (see below). In this report, the function of fabF2 and fabB in P. putida F1 was explored. Deletion mutants of fabB were unable to synthesize UFAs, although suppressors accumulated and accumulation required a functional fabF2 gene. We report that ΔfabB suppression required increased expression of fabF2 and this resulted from mutational activation of a repressor gene encoded in the same operon. The P. putida F1 genome contains one gene annotated as fabB, Pput_1693, and four annotated as fabF genes: Pput_3798 (fabF1), Pput_2422 (fabF2), Pput_2974 (fabF3), and Pput_2975 (fabF4) (Fig. S2). Alignments of the protein sequences showed that the residue identities between FabB and FabF2 with E. coli FabB are 66.3% and 34.2%, respectively, whereas the residue identities between FabF1 and FabF2 and E. coli FabF are 66.9% and 45.7%, respectively. The FabF3 and FabF4 identities with E. coli FabF are 25.8% and 33.9%, respectively. E. coli FabB and FabF are the canonical bacterial long-chain 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthetases and contain the characteristic Cys-His-His catalytic triad also found in the five putative P. putida 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthetases (Fig. S3). To test the function of these proteins in fatty acid biosynthesis, the encoding genes were inserted into the high copy number, arabinose-inducible vector pBAD24M, and the resulting plasmids were introduced into E. coli strains CY242 and CY244. The E. coli fabB(Ts) mutant strain CY242 lacks 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I activity at the nonpermissive temperature and is unable to grow at 42 °C (16Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Genetic and biochemical analyses of Escherichia coli mutants altered in the temperature-dependent regulation of membrane lipid composition.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unless supplemented with a UFA (16Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Genetic and biochemical analyses of Escherichia coli mutants altered in the temperature-dependent regulation of membrane lipid composition.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli fabB(Ts) fabF strain CY244 lacks 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II and 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I activity at the nonpermissive temperature. Owing to the lack of saturated fatty acid synthesis, strain CY244 is unable to grow at 42 °C even when supplemented with oleic acid (16Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Genetic and biochemical analyses of Escherichia coli mutants altered in the temperature-dependent regulation of membrane lipid composition.J.

Effects of overproduction of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2098-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complementation studies showed that fabB and fabF2 both restored growth of strains CY242 and CY244 at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas fabF1 restored growth of CY244 (Fig. S4). Growth of the complemented strains was significantly inhibited by overexpression of fabF1 at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. S4). These data indicate that P. putida F1 FabB and FabF2 both have the activity of E. coli FabB, whereas FabF1 has the activity of E. coli FabF. Expression of fabF3 and fabF4 failed to either complement CY242 or CY244 (Fig. S4) or restore the fatty acid composition of the △fabF1ΔfabF2 strain (Table S3), and we conclude that the encoded proteins lack 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity. E. coli fabB strain K1060 is auxotrophic for UFAs at all growth temperatures and was used to confirm the above results at the low temperatures where P. putida F1 grows best. Plasmids expressing P. putida F1 fabB or fabF2 restored growth of strain K1060 in the absence of oleic acid (Fig. 1), further indicating that P. putida fabB and fabF2 have E. coli fabB function. This was confirmed by labeling of cultures with [1-14C]acetate, which showed that both fabB and fabF2 restored UFA synthesis to strain K1060 (Fig. 1). E. coli FabF is required for the elongation of cis-9-hexadecenoyl-ACP to cis-11-octadecenoyl-ACP (9Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E.

To test whether the P. putida F1 fabFs and fabB have E. coli fabF activity, the P. putida F1 fabF and fabB plasmids were transformed into strain CL28. The fatty acid compositions of the resulting strains were obtained by GC-MS. High levels of expression of either P. putida F1 fabF1 or fabF2 increased the cis-11-octadecenoate (cis-vaccenate) content of strain CL28 with fabF1 expression giving the significantly greater response (Table 1). This indicated that fabF1 and fabF2 both have E. coli fabF function and can convert cis-9-hexadecenoyl-ACP to cis-11-octadecenoyl-ACP.Table 1Fatty acid compositions of CL28 complemented strainsFatty acid %CL28/vectorCL28/pfabBCL28/pfabF1CL28/pfabF2CL28/pfabF3CL28/pfabF4C14:04.0 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.13.5 ± 04.3 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.544.3 ± 0.2C16:027.0 ± 0.624.7 ± 0.229.2 ± 1.027.4 ± 1.125.7 ± 1.927.8 ± 0.7C16:164.8 ± 0.467.0 ± 0.348.9 ± 2.161.7 ± 1.367.4 ± 2.065.0 ± 0.9C17:0 cyclo3.0 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.2C18:00.3 ± 0.10.5 ± 02.0 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.1C18:10.9 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.415.3 ± 1.74.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 00.3 ± 0.2These experiments were done using a high copy number plasmid with transcription from the strong arabinose promoter and translation from a strong ribosome-binding site.

Open table in a new tab These experiments were done using a high copy number plasmid with transcription from the strong arabinose promoter and translation from a strong ribosome-binding site. The increase in C18:1 detected in the CL28/pfabF2 strain is the product of high expression. The P. putida F1 FabB and FabF2 proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as described in Experimental procedures. The histidine-tagged fusion proteins were purified by nickel chelate chromatography. As measured by denaturing gel electrophoresis, the purified FabB and FabF2 proteins had monomeric molecular masses of 46 kDa consistent with the values calculated from the sequences of the tagged proteins (Fig. S5). Tryptic peptide mass spectral analyses confirmed the identities of the purified proteins (Fig. S5). To assay the activities of P. putida F1 FabB and FabF2, we used essentially the same methods to purify the E. coli fatty acid biosynthetic proteins, FabB, FabD, FabA, FabG, and FabI plus Vibrio harveyi acyl-ACP synthetase. E. coli holo-ACP was also purified. To test the functions of FabB and FabF2 in vitro, the elongation steps of the fatty acid synthesis reaction were reconstituted, followed by analysis by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis. At both 37 °C and 42 °C, P. putida F1 FabB and FabF2 elongate octanoyl-ACP using malonyl-ACP to generate low levels of long-chain acyl-ACP species (Fig. 2A). We also assayed the UFA synthetic abilities of purified PpFabB and PpFabF2 because this is their primary role in fatty acid synthesis. E. coli FabA converted 3-hydroxydecenoyl-ACP to a mixture of trans-2- and cis-3-decenoyl-ACPs. In the presence of E. coli FabB, cis-3-decenoyl-ACP is elongated with malonyl-ACP to 3-ketododecenoyl-ACP, which is reduced by E. coli FabG to give a new band corresponding to 3-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP. PpFabB and PpFabF2 both produce the same products as E. coli FabB (Fig. 2B) and hence are active in UFA synthesis in vitro. To determine the physiological functions of the P. putida F1 fabF proteins in fatty acid biosynthesis, strains having each fabF gene deleted were constructed by allelic replacement. The fatty acid compositions of the ΔfabF1 and ΔfabF2 strains were determined by [1-14C]acetate labeling (Fig. 3) and GC-MS (Table 2). Relative to the WT strain, the ΔfabF1 strain showed a large decrease in cis-vaccenic acid (C18:1), with a concomitant increase in palmitoleic acid (C16:1). The fatty acid compositions of the fabF2, fabF3, and fabF4 deletion strains were indistinguishable from that of the WT strain. The fatty acid composition of the ΔfabF1 ΔfabF2 double mutant was essentially the same as that of the ΔfabF1 strain (Table S3).Table 2Fatty acid compositions of Pseudomonas putida F1 fabF strainsFatty acid %WTΔfabF1ΔfabF2ΔfabF1 ΔfabF2ΔfabF3ΔfabF4C16:020.8 ± 3.018.6 ± 0.616.3 ± 5.518.9 ± 0.618.0 ± 0.619.6 ± 1.7C16:149.4 ± 4.077.0 ± 0.447.6 ± 5.676.1 ± 1.147.3 ± 3.248.2 ± 4.0C18:00.5 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.10.3 ± 01.2 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.1C18:129.2 ± 1.64.1 ± 0.734.9 ± 0.64.7 ± 0.534.0 ± 1.331.5 ± 2.2 Open table in a new tab The ΔfabF1 and ΔfabF2 strains plus the ΔfabF1 ΔfabF2 double-mutant strain were complemented with plasmids carrying the WT copy of a gene, and the fatty acid compositions of the strains were determined by GC-MS. In the fabF1 complemented strain, the levels of C18:1 sharply increased and the C16:1 level sharply decreased (Table S3). Hence, P. putida F1 FabF1 is responsible for saturated fatty acid (SFA) synthesis and for conversion of C16:1-ACP to C18:1-ACP. Expression of fabF3 or fabF4 failed to remedy defects in C18:1 synthesis because of loss of fabF1, whereas fabF2 had only weak activity (Table S3). A P. putida ΔfabB mutant strain was constructed by replacing the gene with a kanamycin resistance marker. The resulting ΔfabB mutant strain was a UFA (oleic acid) auxotroph demonstrating the importance of the gene in P. putida F1 UFA synthesis (Fig. 4A). However, the ΔfabB strain was unstable and spontaneously accumulated suppressors even at high oleate concentrations. This argued that a mutation that allowed the ΔfabB strain to synthesize UFA gave faster growth than that obtained by oleate supplementation. The dependence on oleate concentration argued that most of the oleate was consumed by β-oxidation, thereby limiting the amount available for phospholipid synthesis. Endogenous synthesis avoids β-oxidation because ACP rather than CoA thioesters are used and the 3-hydroxy thioester intermediates use opposite stereoisomers. The ΔfabB suppressor mutations restored UFA synthesis and allowed growth without oleate (Fig. 4B). The above data indicated that FabF2 has the functions of both E coli FabB and FabF, so it seemed likely that some alteration of fabF2 could explain the accumulation of suppressors. To test this possibility, a ΔfabB ΔfabF2 double-mutant strain was constructed. The ΔfabB ΔfabF2 strain was a UFA auxotroph that failed to form suppressors (Fig. 4C). This indicated that a mechanism requiring fabF2 could replace fabB function. Plasmids encoding fabF2 or fabB complemented the ΔfabB ΔfabF2 strain (Fig. 5). The complemented strains restored growth and UFA synthesis and no longer required oleic acid. The growth phenotypes of the complemented strains indicated that FabB was more active than FabF2 (Fig. 5A). We also tested plasmids encoding fabF1, fabF3, and fabF4 for the ability to restore UFA synthesis in the ΔfabB ΔfabF2 strain by [1-14C]acetate labeling (Fig. 5B) and found no role for these genes in P. putida UFA synthesis per se although FabF1 can elongate 16:1 to 18:1 (Table 1). The failure of fabF2 to complement the P. putida ΔfabF1 strain, although it complements the E. coli ΔfabF strain, seems likely to be poor expression from the pSRK vector promoter in P. putida plus the high levels of expression in E. coli. Note that upon FabB overexpression, significant levels of cis-vaccenate are synthesized in a fabF strain (17de Mendoza D. Klages Ulrich A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Thermal regulation of membrane fluidity in Escherichia coli. Effects of overproduction of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2098-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa PAO1 has three pathways for UFA synthesis (18Ruth K. de Roo G. Egli T. Ren Q. Identification of two acyl-CoA synthetases from Pseudomonas putida GPo1: One is located at the surface of polyhydroxyalkanoates granules.Biomacromolecules. 2008; 9: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas P. putida F1 has only two pathways: the fabA-fabB pathway and the desA desaturase. Although the P. putida desaturase (Pput_0232) has 84% identity to the P. aeruginosa DesA protein, it is unable to support growth of a ΔfabB strain, although it may be responsible for the traces of UFAs seen in the ΔfabB ΔfabF2 strain. To further test the ability of P. putida FabF2 to convert C16:1-ACP to C18:1-ACP, a ΔfabF1 ΔfabF2 ΔdesA triple deletion strain was constructed by homologous recombination. In this triple mutant, the chromosomal fabB gene was replaced by fabF2 (Fig. S6). Therefore, FabF2 was the sole long-chain 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase in this strain. Fatty acid compositions obtained by [1-14C]acetate labeling (Fig. S6) and GC-MS (Table S4) showed that the level of C18:1 increased only slightly (4.4%–6.4%) accompanied by a moderate decrease in the C16:1 level (69.3%–63.4%) relative to the ΔfabF1 ΔfabF2 ΔdesA triple mutant. Hence, in the native host, FabF2 has only a weak ability to convert of C16:1-ACP to C18:1-ACP. A high concentration of oleic acid (5 mM) generally decreased the accumulation of ΔfabB suppressors relative to lower concentrations, suggesting that the suppressor accumulation is related to the concentration of oleic acid (Fig. 6). After entry into the cell, oleic acid becomes activated by an acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD), and most of the acyl-CoA will enter the β-oxidation cycle for degradation to acetyl-CoA. Thus, only a small fraction of the UFA is available for synthesis of membrane phospholipids. FadD1 and FadD2, which are homologs of the P. aeruginosa fadD1 and fadD2 acyl-CoA synthetase genes, have been identified as the major acyl-CoA synthetases in P. putida (18Ruth K. de Roo G. Egli T. Ren Q.

However, the ΔfadD1 ΔfadD2 double mutant remains able to grow with oleic acid as the sole carbon source in minimal medium (20Kang Y. Zarzycki-Siek J. Walton C.B. Norris M.H. Hoang T.T.

Elucidating the Pseudomonas aeruginosa fatty acid degradation pathway: Identification of additional fatty acyl-CoA synthetase homologues.PLoS One. 2013; 8e64554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of other fatty acid activation pathways. We inactivated both fadD genes in a ΔfabB strain and found that oleic acid supplementation remained effective indicating that, as in P. aeruginosa (20Kang Y. Zarzycki-Siek J. Walton C.B. Norris M.H. Hoang T.T. Multiple FadD acyl-CoA synthetases contribute to differential fatty acid degradation and virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS One. 2010; 5e13557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), activation systems other than FadD1 and FadD2 are present in P. putida F1. Alignments with E. coli FadB and FadA indicated that Pput_3606 and Pput_3605 encoded β-oxidation cycle enzymes: enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (FadB) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (FadA), respectively. Inactivation of the β-oxidation cycle enzymes in the ΔfabB strain blocked accumulation of suppressors as did inactivation of FadD1 and FadD2 (Fig. 6), indicating that accumulation of ΔfabB suppressors is closely related to the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. Degradation of most of the oleate supplements limits the supply of oleoyl-CoA available for incorporation into phospholipids and provides a strong selection for accumulation of suppressors. The phenotype of the ΔfabB ΔfadA ΔfadB triple mutant was as expected, whereas the ΔfabB ΔfadD1 ΔfadD2 triple mutant argues that the product of the unknown pathway that activates oleate in this strain somehow avoids β-oxidation. Note that the ΔfabB ΔfadD1 ΔfadD2 and ΔfabB ΔfadA ΔfadB triple mutants grew relatively slowly, arguing that P. putida F1 derives significant carbon and energy from β-oxidation even when grown in a rich medium (Fig. 6). We first suspected that mutations in the fabF2 coding sequence or the upstream promoter region were responsible for suppression of the ΔfabB mutant strain. However, sequencing showed that this was not the case. We then considered Pput_2425, a gene annotated as encoding a putative regulatory protein of the TetR family, which is the first gene in the fabF2 operon (fabF2 is the last gene, the two intervening genes encode an unrelated efflux pump) (Fig. S2). Pput_2425 seemed a good candidate because it appeared to be cotranscribed with fabF2 and several members of the TetR family participate in regulation of fatty acid synthesis (22Ramos J.L. Martinez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Teran W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

To test if the protein encoded by Pput_2425 is involved in ΔfabB suppression, we constructed a ΔfabB ΔPput_2425 double-mutant strain. The double mutant grew stably in LB medium containing 5 mM oleic acid and weakly in the absence of oleic acid with accumulation of suppressors. Given these data, we selected several independent suppressor strains and sequenced their Pput_2425 genes plus the upstream regions and found that all suppressors had mutations within the coding sequence. Five had deletion mutations (two 299(A), 265(C), 50–51(AT), 159(C)) and one had a missense mutation 130(G-C). The frameshifts caused by the 50 to 51(AT), 299(A), and 265(C), respectively, gave extended out-of-frame translation products of 18, 19, and five residues before a termination codon was encountered, whereas the 159(C) mutation directly created a TAA termination codon. These data together with the deletion allele indicate that the regulatory protein encoded by Pput_2425 is a repressor that negatively regulates fabF2 expression. Note that deletion of the putative exporter genes, Pput_2424 and Pput_2423, in the ΔfabB strain failed to alter the phenotype of the ΔfabB strain. These strains remained auxotrophic and accumulated suppressors (data not shown). To test the possible influence of transcriptional polarity, an in-frame deletion allele of Pput_2425 was constructed in the ΔfabB strain. This strain accumulated suppressors in the absence of oleic acid as previously seen for the original ΔfabB strain that contained the prior Pput_242"

Due to large scale, extensive, and unrecorded hybridization in the past 40 years, this vernacular naming convention has become unreliable and inadequate for identifying or selecting strains for clinical research and medicinal production. Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD) dominant strains and balanced strains (or intermediate strains, which have intermediate levels of THC and CBD), are not included in the current classification studies despite the increasing research interest in the therapeutic potential of CBD. This paper is the first in a series of studies proposing that a new classification system be established based on genome-wide variation and supplemented by data on secondary metabolites and morphological characteristics. This study performed a whole-genome sequencing of 23 cannabis strains marketed in Canada, aligned sequences to a reference genome, and, after filtering for minor allele frequency of 10%, identified 137,858 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was applied to these SNPs and further identified 344 structural SNPs, which classified individual strains into five chemotype-aligned groups: one CBD dominant, one balanced, and three THC dominant clusters. These structural SNPs were all multiallelic and were predominantly tri-allelic (339/344). The largest portion of these SNPs (37%) occurred on the same chromosome containing genes for CBD acid synthases (CBDAS) and THC acid synthases (THCAS). The remainder (63%) were located on the other nine chromosomes. These results showed that the genetic differences between modern cannabis strains were at a whole-genome level and not limited to THC or CBD production. These SNPs contained enough genetic variation for classifying individual strains into corresponding chemotypes. In an effort to elucidate the confused genetic backgrounds of commercially available cannabis strains, this classification attempt investigated the utility of DAPC for classifying modern cannabis strains and for identifying structural SNPs."

To establish a hyperspectral prediction model of soil organic matter (SOM) content, this study investigated a forested Eucalyptus plantation in Huangmian Forest Farm, Guangxi, China. The Ranger and Lasso algorithms were used to screen spectral bands. Subsequently, models were established using four algorithms: partial least squares regression, random forest (RF), a support vector machine, and an artificial neural network (ANN). The optimal model was then selected. The results showed that the modeling accuracy was higher when band selection was based on the Ranger algorithm than when it was based on the Lasso algorithm. ANN modeling had the best goodness of fit, and the model established by RF had the most stable modeling results. Based on the above results, a new method is proposed in this study for band selection in the early phase of soil hyperspectral modeling. The Ranger algorithm can be applied to screen the spectral bands, and ANN or RF can then be selected to construct the prediction model based on different datasets, which is applicable to establish the prediction model of SOM content in red soil plantations. This study provides a reference for the remote sensing of soil fertility in forests of different soil types and a theoretical basis for developing portable equipment for the hyperspectral measurement of SOM content in forest habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3176555724,"Whether dietary antioxidants are effective for alleviating oxidative costs associated with energy-demanding life events first requires they are successfully absorbed in the digestive tract and transported to sites associated with reactive species production (e.g. the mitochondria). Flying birds are under high energy and oxidative demands, and although birds commonly ingest dietary antioxidants in the wild, the bioavailability of these consumed antioxidants is poorly understood. We show for the first time that an ingested lipophilic antioxidant, α-tocopherol, reached the mitochondria in the flight muscles of a songbird but only if they regularly exercise (60 min of perch-to-perch flights two times in a day or 8.5 km day-1). Deuterated α-tocopherol was found in the blood of exercise-trained zebra finches within 6.5 hrs and in isolated mitochondria from pectoral muscle within 22.5 hrs, but never reached the mitochondria in caged sedentary control birds. This rapid pace (within a day) and extent of metabolic routing of a dietary antioxidant to muscle mitochondria means that daily consumption of such dietary sources can help to pay the inevitable oxidative costs of flight muscle metabolism, but only when combined with regular exercise."

https://openalex.org/W3173263424,"Trypanosomatid parasites are responsible for various human diseases, such as sleeping sickness, animal trypanosomiasis, or cutaneous and visceral leishmaniases. The few available drugs to fight related parasitic infections are often toxic and present poor efficiency and specificity, and thus, finding new molecular targets is imperative. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential components of the translational machinery as they catalyze the specific attachment of an amino acid onto cognate tRNA(s). In trypanosomatids, one gene encodes both cytosolic- and mitochondrial-targeted aaRSs, with only three exceptions. We identify here a unique specific feature of aaRSs from trypanosomatids, which is that most of them harbor distinct insertion and/or extension sequences. Among the 26 identified aaRSs in the trypanosome Leishmania tarentolae, 14 contain an additional domain or a terminal extension, confirmed in mature mRNAs by direct cDNA nanopore sequencing. Moreover, these RNA-Seq data led us to address the question of aaRS dual localization and to determine splice-site locations and the 5'-UTR lengths for each mature aaRS-encoding mRNA. Altogether, our results provided evidence for at least one specific mechanism responsible for mitochondrial addressing of some L. tarentolae aaRSs. We propose that these newly identified features of trypanosomatid aaRSs could be developed as relevant drug targets to combat the diseases caused by these parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3173379961,"Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and DNA Ligase IIIα (LigIIIα) are key enzymes in single-strand break (SSB) repair. TDP1 removes 3'-tyrosine residues remaining after degradation of DNA topoisomerase (TOP) 1 cleavage complexes trapped by either DNA lesions or TOP1 inhibitors. It is not known how TDP1 is linked to subsequent processing and LigIIIα-catalyzed joining of the SSB. Here we define a direct interaction between the TDP1 catalytic domain and the LigIII DNA-binding domain (DBD) regulated by conformational changes in the unstructured TDP1 N-terminal region induced by phosphorylation and/or alterations in amino acid sequence. Full-length and N-terminally truncated TDP1 are more effective at correcting SSB repair defects in TDP1 null cells compared with full-length TDP1 with amino acid substitutions of an N-terminal serine residue phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. TDP1 forms a stable complex with LigIII170-755, as well as full-length LigIIIα alone or in complex with the DNA repair scaffold protein XRCC1. Small-angle X-ray scattering and negative stain electron microscopy combined with mapping of the interacting regions identified a TDP1/LigIIIα compact dimer of heterodimers in which the two LigIII catalytic cores are positioned in the center, whereas the two TDP1 molecules are located at the edges of the core complex flanked by highly flexible regions that can interact with other repair proteins and SSBs. As TDP1and LigIIIα together repair adducts caused by TOP1 cancer chemotherapy inhibitors, the defined interaction architecture and regulation of this enzyme complex provide insights into a key repair pathway in nonmalignant and cancer cells."

Rodent models haploinsufficent for Trp53 also develop a wide variety of malignancies associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, but BALB/c mice are uniquely susceptible to mammary tumors and is genetically linked to the Suprmam1 locus on chromosome 7. To define mechanisms that interact with deficiencies in p53 to alter susceptibility to mammary tumors, we fine mapped the Suprmam1 locus in females from an N2 backcross of BALB/cMed and C57BL/6J mice. A major modifier was localized within a 10 cM interval on chromosome 7. The effect of the locus on DNA damage responses was examined in the parental strains and mice that are congenic for C57BL/6J alleles on the BALB/cMed background (SM1-Trp53+/-). The mammary epithelium of C57BL/6J-Trp53+/- females exhibited little radiation-induced apoptosis compared to BALB/cMed-Trp53+/- and SM1-Trp53+/- females indicating that the Suprmam1B6/B6 alleles could not rescue repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks mostly relying on non-homologous end joining. In contrast, the Suprmam1B6/B6 alleles in SM1-Trp53+/- mice were sufficient to confer the C57BL/6J-Trp53+/- phenotypes in homology-directed repair and replication fork progression. The Suprmam1B6/B6 alleles in SM1-Trp53+/- mice appear to act in trans to regulate a panel of DNA repair and replication genes which lie outside the locus."

Here we examine the occurrence of bowhead and beluga whale vocalizations in the western Beaufort Sea acquired by acoustic instruments deployed from September 2008-July 2014 and September 2016-October 2018 to examine inter-annual variability of these Arctic endemic species in DBO Region 6. Acoustic data were collected on an oceanographic mooring deployed in the Beaufort shelfbreak jet at ~71.4°N, 152.0°W. Spectrograms of acoustic data files were visually examined for the presence or absence of known signals of bowhead and beluga whales. Weekly averages of whale occurrence were compared with outputs of zooplankton, temperature and sea ice from the BIOMAS model to determine if any of these variables influenced whale occurrence. In addition, the dates of acoustic whale passage in the spring and fall were compared to annual sea ice melt-out and freeze-up dates to examine changes in phenology. Neither bowhead nor beluga whale migration times changed significantly in spring, but bowhead whales migrated significantly later in fall from 2008–2018. There were no clear relationships between bowhead whales and the environmental variables, suggesting that the DBO 6 region is a migratory corridor, but not a feeding hotspot, for this species. Surprisingly, beluga whale acoustic presence was related to zooplankton biomass near the mooring, but this is unlikely to be a direct relationship: there are likely interactions of environmental drivers that result in higher occurrence of both modeled zooplankton and belugas in the DBO 6 region. The environmental triggers that drive the migratory phenology of the two Arctic endemic cetacean species likely extend from Bering Sea transport of heat, nutrients and plankton through the Chukchi and into the Beaufort Sea."
https://openalex.org/W3175945670,"Permeability characteristics of compacted loess is always an important topic in soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering. This study explored the permeability characteristics of compacted loess under different dry densities and wetting-drying cycles, and found that as the dry density increases, the compacted loess surface became denser, the saturation permeability coefficient and saturation infiltration rate decreased. However, the wetting-drying cycle presented the opposite result. Meanwhile, the evolution of the microstructure was investigated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to explain the change of its permeability characteristics. The size of compacted loess aggregates was quantitatively analyzed by Image-Pro Plus (IPP) software. It showed that the size of compacted loess aggregates for different dry densities were concentrated from 10-100 μm, occupying 65.0%, 58.19%, and 51.64% of the total aggregates area respectively. And the interesting finding was that the area occupied by 10-50 μm aggregates remained basically unchanged with the number of wetting-drying cycles increasing. Therefore, the size of 10-50 μm aggregates represented the transition zone of compacted loess. NMR analyses revealed that with increasing dry density, the volume of macropores in the compacted loess rapidly decreased, the volume of mesopores and small pores increased. Meanwhile, the change in micropores was relatively small. The pore volume of the compacted loess after three wetting-drying cycles increased by 8.56%, 8.61%, and 6.15%, respectively. The proportion of macropores in the total pore volume shows the most drastic change. Variations in aggregate size and connection relationships made it easier to form overhead structures between aggregates, and the increased of macropore volume will form more water channels. Therefore, the change in permeability characteristics of compacted loess is determined by aggregate size, loess surface morphology, and the total pore volume occupied by macropores."

Multivariable linear mixed effects models were fit to examine the association between pre-corneal and pre-lens TFS, adjusting for potential confounders and accounting for repeated measures. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to assess the predictive performance of pre-corneal TFS for subsequent pre-lens TFS. TFS was quantified for this analysis as the non-invasive tear breakup time (NITBUT).Pre-corneal NITBUT was significantly related to the pre-lens NITBUT at both 10 min (p<0.001) and 2-6 hrs (p<0.001) post-lens insertion. However, the sensitivities of pre-corneal NITBUT for predicting symptom-associated thresholds of pre-lens NITBUT ranged from 50-65%, and specificities ranged from 57-72%, suggesting poor-to-moderate diagnostic performance.Despite the association of pre-corneal and pre-lens TFS, the inherent lability and sensitivity to environmental exposures of the tear film introduce significant variability into NITBUT measurements. Using pre-corneal NITBUT to identify likely successful contact lens candidates prior to fitting is thus not sufficiently accurate to be relied upon in the clinical setting."

The death domain (DD) of p75NTR is an intracellular signaling hub and has been shown to interact with diverse adaptor proteins. In breast cancer cells, binding of the adaptor protein TRADD to p75NTR depends on nerve growth factor and promotes cell survival. However, the structural mechanism and functional significance of TRADD recruitment in neuronal p75NTR signaling remain poorly understood. Here we report an NMR structure of the p75NTR-DD and TRADD-DD complex and reveal the mechanism of specific recognition of the TRADD-DD by the p75NTR-DD mainly through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, we identified spatiotemporal overlap of p75NTR and TRADD expression in developing cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) at early postnatal stages and discover the physiological relevance of the interaction between TRADD and p75NTR in the regulation of canonical NF-κB signaling and cell survival in CGNs. Our results provide a new structural framework for understanding how the recruitment of TRADD to p75NTR through DD interactions creates a membrane-proximal platform, which can be efficiently regulated by various neurotrophic factors through extracellular domains of p75NTR, to propagate downstream signaling in developing neurons."

https://openalex.org/W3175387238,"The moisture content of municipal sludge is relatively high, which increases the cost of sludge transportation and treatment. To reduce the volume of the sludge, sludge dewatering is needed. This paper proposes the theory of sludge dewatering and facilitates efficient and economical technology of sludge dewatering. Sludge dewatering tests were carried out by using homemade rapid sludge dewatering devices. There were two groups of tests with single- and double-drainage conditions, and all test runs were loaded with a negative vacuum pressure at the bottom. During the experiments, the vacuum degree and the pore water pressure in the sludge were monitored in real time. After the experiments, the data were compared and analyzed. At the initial stage, the sludge dewatering extent and the sludge dewatering velocity for double-drainage conditions were much higher than those for single-drainage conditions. The vacuum occurring for single-drainage conditions lagged behind that for double-drainage conditions in the sludge. The value of vacuum degree for single-drainage conditions was lower than that for double-drainage conditions, and the vacuum attenuation for single-drainage conditions was considerable. The excess pore water pressure for double-drainage conditions dissipated faster than that for single-drainage conditions in the sludge. The pore water pressure for single-drainage conditions at the top and middle of the sludge layer first increased and then decreased in the early loading stage, resembling the Mandel effect. Overall, with a vacuum negative pressure load at the bottom, the sludge dewatering efficiency for double-drainage conditions was much higher than that for single-drainage conditions. This study provides an experimental and theoretical basis for engineering applications in the sludge treatment industry."

https://openalex.org/W3175877216,"Beta regressions are commonly used with responses that assume values in the standard unit interval, such as rates, proportions and concentration indices. Hypothesis testing inferences on the model parameters are typically performed using the likelihood ratio test. It delivers accurate inferences when the sample size is large, but can otherwise lead to unreliable conclusions. It is thus important to develop alternative tests with superior finite sample behavior. We derive the Bartlett correction to the likelihood ratio test under the more general formulation of the beta regression model, i.e. under varying precision. The model contains two submodels, one for the mean response and a separate one for the precision parameter. Our interest lies in performing testing inferences on the parameters that index both submodels. We use three Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio test statistics that are expected to yield superior performance when the sample size is small. We present Monte Carlo simulation evidence on the finite sample behavior of the Bartlett-corrected tests relative to the standard likelihood ratio test and to two improved tests that are based on an alternative approach. The numerical evidence shows that one of the Bartlett-corrected typically delivers accurate inferences even when the sample is quite small.

https://openalex.org/W3176431222,"Across eukaryotes, Rho GTPases such as Rac and Cdc42 play important roles in establishing cell polarity, which is a key feature of cell growth. In mammals and filamentous fungi, Rac targets large protein complexes containing NADPH oxidases (NOX) that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). In comparison, Rho GTPases of unicellular eukaryotes were believed to signal cell polarity without ROS, and it was unclear whether Rho GTPases were required for ROS production in these organisms. We document here the first example of Rho GTPase-mediated post-transcriptional control of ROS in a unicellular microbe. Specifically, Cdc42 is required for ROS production by the NOX Fre8 of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. During morphogenesis to a hyphal form, a filamentous growth state, C. albicans FRE8 mRNA is induced, which leads to a burst in ROS. Fre8-ROS is also induced during morphogenesis when FRE8 is driven by an ectopic promoter; hence, Fre8 ROS production is in addition controlled at the post-transcriptional level. Using fluorescently tagged Fre8, we observe that the majority of the protein is associated with the vacuolar system. Interestingly, much of Fre8 in the vacuolar system appears inactive, and Fre8-induced ROS is only produced at sites near the hyphal tip, where Cdc42 is also localized during morphogenesis. We observe that Cdc42 is necessary to activate Fre8-mediated ROS production during morphogenesis. Cdc42 regulation of Fre8 occurs without the large NOX protein complexes typical of higher eukaryotes and therefore represents a novel form of ROS control by Rho GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W3176609328,"How can we effectively regularize BERT? Although BERT proves its effectiveness in various NLP tasks, it often overfits when there are only a small number of training instances. A promising direction to regularize BERT is based on pruning its attention heads with a proxy score for head importance. However, these methods are usually suboptimal since they resort to arbitrarily determined numbers of attention heads to be pruned and do not directly aim for the performance enhancement. In order to overcome such a limitation, we propose AUBER, an automated BERT regularization method, that leverages reinforcement learning to automatically prune the proper attention heads from BERT. We also minimize the model complexity and the action search space by proposing a low-dimensional state representation and dually-greedy approach for training. Experimental results show that AUBER outperforms existing pruning methods by achieving up to 9.58% better performance. In addition, the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of design choices for AUBER."

The aim of the present study was to explore possible binding conformations of AEA within the binding pocket of the CB1 receptor confirmed in the recently available X-ray crystal structures of the CB1 receptor and predict essential AEA binding domains. We performed long time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of plausible AEA docking poses until its receptor binding interactions became optimally established. Our simulation results revealed that AEA favors to bind to the hydrophobic channel (HC) of the CB1 receptor, suggesting that HC holds essential significance in AEA binding to the CB1 receptor. Our results also suggest that the Helix 2 (H2)/H3 region of the CB1 receptor is an AEA binding subsite privileged over the H7 region."
https://openalex.org/W3173954433,"When the habitat occupied by a specialist species is patchily distributed, limited gene flow between the fragmented populations may allow population differentiation and eventual speciation. 'Sky islands'-montane habitats that form terrestrial islands-have been shown to promote diversification in many taxa through this mechanism. We investigate floral variation in Impatiens lawii, a plant specialized on laterite rich rocky plateaus that form sky islands in the northern Western Ghats mountains of India. We focus on three plateaus separated from each other by ca. 7 to 17 km, and show that floral traits have diverged strongly between these populations. In contrast, floral traits have not diverged in the congeneric I. oppositifolia, which co-occurs with I. lawii in the plateaus, but is a habitat generalist that is also found in the intervening valleys. We conducted common garden experiments to test whether the differences in I. lawii are due to genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity. There were strong differences in floral morphology between experimental plants sourced from the three populations, and the relative divergences between population pairs mirrored that seen in the wild, indicating that the populations are genetically differentiated. Common garden experiments confirmed that there was no differentiation in I. oppositifolia. Field floral visitation surveys indicated that the observed differences in floral traits have consequences for I. lawii populations, by reducing the number of visitors and changing the relative abundance of different floral visitor groups. Our results highlight the role of habitat specialization in diversification, and corroborates the importance of sky islands as centres of diversification."

Unlike previous image dehazing methods, our method uses the unsupervised neural network and the atmospheric multiple scattering model and solves the problem of difficult acquisition of ideal datasets and the effect of multiple scattering on the image. In our method, in order to embed the atmospheric multiple scattering model into the unsupervised dehazing network, the unsupervised dehazing network uses four branches to estimate the scene radiation layer, transmission map layer, blur kernel layer and atmospheric light layer, the hazy image is then synthesized from the four output layers, minimizing the input hazy image and the output hazy image, where the output scene radiation layer is the final dehazing image. In addition, we constructed unsupervised loss functions which applicable to image dehazing by prior knowledge, i.e., color attenuation energy loss and dark channel loss. The method has a wide range of applications, with haze being thick and variable in marine, river and lake scenes, the method can be used to assist ship vision for target detection or forward road recognition in hazy conditions. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images, the proposed method is able to recover the details, structure and texture of the water image better than five advanced dehazing methods."

In the humoral immunity, the total immunoglobulin level was significantly higher in the treatment. In the assessment of cellular immunity, higher significant values were detected in the delayed skin sensitivity to phytohemagglutinine injection after 48 and 72 hours in the treatment. Moreover, higher significant levels were observed in the number and percentage of lymphocytes as well as an increase in the percentage of monocytes in the treatment at 4 hours after the operation. Notably, the cortisol hormone in the treatment was lower than control at 4 hours of the surgery. In conclusion, epidural anaesthesia with lidocaine when added to general anaesthesia with propofol attenuated the suppression of the innate and cellular immune responses produced by anaesthesia and surgery in the dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3176391714,"The substantial improvement in the efficiency of switching filters, intended for the removal of impulsive noise within color images is described. Numerous noisy pixel detection and replacement techniques are evaluated, where the filtering performance for color images and subsequent results are assessed using statistical reasoning. Denoising efficiency for the applied detection and interpolation techniques are assessed when the location of corrupted pixels are identified by noisy pixel detection algorithms and also in the scenario when they are already known. The results show that improvement in objective quality measures can be achieved by using more robust detection techniques, combined with novel methods of corrupted pixel restoration. A significant increase in the image denoising performance is achieved for both pixel detection and interpolation, surpassing current filtering methods especially via the application of a convolutional network. The interpolation techniques used in the image inpainting methods also significantly increased the efficiency of impulsive noise removal."
https://openalex.org/W3176971588,"APOBEC3s are innate single-stranded DNA cytidine-to-uridine deaminases that catalyze mutations in both pathogen and human genomes with significant roles in human disease. However, how APOBEC3s mutate a single-stranded DNA that is available momentarily during DNA transcription or replication in vivo remains relatively unknown. In this study, utilizing hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral mutations, we evaluated the mutational characteristics of individual APOBEC3s with reference to the HBV replication process through HBV whole single-strand (-)-DNA genome mutation analyses. We found that APOBEC3s induced C-to-T mutations from the HBV reverse transcription start site continuing through the whole (-)-DNA transcript to the termination site with variable efficiency, in an order of A3B >> A3G > A3H-II or A3C. A3B had a 3-fold higher mutation efficiency than A3H-II or A3C with up to 65% of all HBV genomic cytidines being converted into uridines in a single mutation event, consistent with the A3B localized hypermutation signature in cancer, namely, kataegis. On the other hand, A3C expression led to a 3-fold higher number of mutation-positive HBV genome clones, although each individual clone had a lower number of C-to-T mutations. Like A3B, A3C preferred both 5'-TC and 5'-CC sequences, but to a lesser degree. The APOBEC3-induced HBV mutations were predominantly detected in the HBV rcDNA but were not detectable in other intermediates including HBV cccDNA and pgRNA by primer extension of their PCR amplification products. These data demonstrate that APOBEC3-induced HBV genome mutations occur predominantly when the HBV RNA genome was reversely transcribed into (-)-DNA in the viral capsid."
https://openalex.org/W3177055689,"To strengthen the coordinating function of general practitioners (GPs) in the German healthcare system, a copayment of €10 was introduced in 2004. Due to a perceived lack of efficacy and a high administrative burden, it was abolished in 2012. The present cohort study investigates characteristics and differences of GP-coordinated and uncoordinated patients in Bavaria, Germany, concerning morbidity and ambulatory specialist costs and whether these differences have changed after the abolition of the copayment. We performed a retrospective routine data analysis, using claims data of the Bavarian Association of the Statutory Health Insurance Physicians during the period 2011–2012 (with copayment) and 2013–2016 (without copayment), covering 24 quarters. Coordinated care was defined as specialist contact only with referral. Multinomial regression modelling, including inverse probability of treatment weighting, was used for the cohort analysis of 500 000 randomly selected patients. Longitudinal regression models were calculated for cost estimation. Coordination of care decreased substantially after the abolition of the copayment, accompanied by increasing proportions of patients with chronic and mental diseases in the uncoordinated group, and a corresponding decrease in the coordinated group. In the presence of the copayment, uncoordinated patients had €21.78 higher specialist costs than coordinated patients, increasing to €24.94 after its abolition. The results indicate that patients incur higher healthcare costs for specialist ambulatory care when their care is uncoordinated. This effect slightly increased after abolition of the copayment. Beyond that, the abolition of the copayment led to a substantial reduction in primary care coordination, particularly affecting vulnerable patients. Therefore, coordination of care in the ambulatory setting should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3177244930,"Sneddon syndrome (SS) is defined by widespread livedo reticularis (LR) and stroke. There is no single diagnostic test for SS and diagnosis can be solely based on clinical features. This cross-sectional case-control study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of skin biopsies in SS patients.We studied skin biopsies from patients with a clinical diagnosis of SS or isolated LR. We also studied controls with vitiligo or normal skin. Biopsies were considered standardized if 3 biopsies were taken from the white centre of the livedo and reached until the dermis-subcutis border. Biopsies were scored for features of an occlusive microangiopathy without knowledge of the clinical features. Sensitivity and specificity of the biopsy findings were calculated with the clinical criteria as the reference standard.We included 34 SS patients, 14 isolated LR patients and 41 control patients. Biopsies of 17 patients with SS (50%), 4 with isolated LR (31%) and 10 control patients (24%) showed at least one artery in the deep dermis with a thickened vessel wall combined with recanalization or neovascularization (sensitivity 50% and specificity 69% with LR as reference). Standardized biopsies increased the sensitivity to 70%. In a post hoc analysis the combination of an occlusive microangiopathy and the presence of a livedo pattern in the superficial dermis increased the specificity to 92%.Standardized skin biopsies can support the clinical diagnosis of SS. An occlusive microangiopathy as the only positive criterion for the diagnosis of SS had insufficient specificity for a definite diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3173476485,"Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is used in equine practice to treat hypomagnesemia, dysrhythmias, neurological disorders, and calcium dysregulation. MgSO4 is also used as a calming agent in equestrian events. Hypercalcemia affects calcium-regulating hormones, as well as plasma and urinary electrolytes; however, the effect of hypermagnesemia on these variables is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hypermagnesemia on blood parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin (CT), ionized calcium (Ca2+), ionized magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-) and their urinary fractional excretion (F) after intravenous administration of MgSO4 in healthy horses. Twelve healthy female horses of 4-18 years of age and 432-600 kg of body weight received a single intravenous dose of MgSO4 (60 mg/kg) over 5 minutes, and blood and urine samples were collected at different time points over 360 minutes. Plasma Mg2+ concentrations increased 3.7-fold over baseline values at 5 minutes and remained elevated for 120 minutes (P < 0.05), Ca2+ concentrations decreased from 30-60 minutes (P < 0.05), but Na+, K+ and Cl- concentrations did not change. Serum PTH concentrations dropped initially to rebound and remain elevated from 30 to 60 minutes, while CT concentrations increased at 5 minutes to return to baseline by 10 minutes (P < 0.05). The FMg, FCa, FNa, FK, and FCl increased, while urine osmolality decreased from 30-60 minutes compared baseline (P < 0.05). Short-term experimental hypermagnesemia alters calcium-regulating hormones (PTH, CT), reduces plasma Ca2+ concentrations, and increases the urinary excretion of Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Cl- in healthy horses. This information has clinical implications for the short-term effects of hypermagnesemia on calcium-regulation, electrolytes, and neuromuscular activity, in particular with increasing use of Mg salts to treat horses with various acute and chronic conditions as well as a calming agent in equestrian events."
https://openalex.org/W3175266660,"To develop a new gangue polymer filling material with low compressive ratio, this paper intends to add high water cementing material to the gangue for backfilling. Uniaxial and tri-axial bearing experiments were conducted to study its bearing characteristics and residual strength. Based on Hock-Brown model theory, it is proposed that friction angle φr can be introduced to substitute model parameter mi, and the degree of cohesion loss can characterize the value of s. So the improved H-B model is established to characterize the residual strength of materials with ductile failure characteristics. The results show that the compressive strength of high water filling material increases linearly corresponding to the rise of confining pressure, and its strength characteristics conform to Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion. The ductile failure characteristics of the sample endow it with high residual strength, which in turn qualifies it for underground filling. After the introduction of cohesion and friction angle, the improved H-B criterion can fit the residual strength curve of the high water filling material more competently. The fitting coefficient of the samples with three water contents is 1.00, 0.99, and 1.00, respectively. The improved H-B model of residual strength demonstrates the change rule of residual strength of the samples corresponding to the change of confining pressure; under tri-axial loading, the angle between fracture surface and axial direction becomes larger as the confining pressure rises; and the failure mode of the material transforms from splitting failure to shear failure."
https://openalex.org/W3176213922,"To investigate the application of ultrasound elastography in monitoring the effects of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway-targeted combination therapy for hepatic fibrosis.1. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeted towards TβR1 were designed, synthesized, and packaged using an adeno-associated virus (AAV), and the effective target shRNA was selected based on transfection results. 2. Fifty rats were randomly allocated (n = 10 per group) to the (A) control group, (B) model group, (C) 0-week therapy group, (D) 4-week therapy group, and (E) combination therapy group. At weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography was used to measure the liver stiffness, inner diameter of the portal vein diameter, and blood velocity; radio frequency ultrasound imaging was used to measure the abdominal aortic elasticity parameter and pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the rats. 3. At week 12, portal vein puncture was performed to measure the portal venous pressure, and rat liver specimens were obtained for the pathological measurement of the degree of hepatic fibrosis.1. An shRNA interference sequence targeted towards TβR1 was successfully designed, screened, and packaged using an AAV, and small-animal imaging results indicated expression of the specific shRNA in the liver. 2. At week 12, the ultrasound elastography results were significantly different between the experimental groups and the control group (p < 0.01); among the experimental groups, differences were significant between the therapy groups and the model group (p < 0.01). For groups C and E, the therapeutic effects on hepatic fibrosis in rats were significant, with the pathological results indicating a significant reduction in the degree of hepatic fibrosis (p < 0.01). The therapeutic effectiveness of group D was less than that of group C (p < 0.05). Significant differences existed between the portal venous pressure of the experimental groups and of the control group (p < 0.01). For the abdominal aortic elasticity parameter measured by radio frequency ultrasound imaging, differences existed between the values obtained from the experimental groups and from that of the control group (p < 0.05), while statistically significant differences were not found among the various experimental groups. 3. Continuous ultrasound examination results indicated that the elasticity value of group A was significantly different from those of the other groups after 2 weeks of model establishment (p < 0.01); after 6 weeks, the elasticity values of groups C and E were significantly different compared with those of groups B and D (p < 0.01). For the abdominal aortic elasticity parameter and pulse wave velocity (PWV), there were no significant differences among the various groups (p > 0.05).CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis can be treated through shRNA silencing of TβR1. Ultrasound ARFI elastography is superior to external force-assisted elastography as it can reflect the degree of fibrosis in moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis and the variations in the degree of fibrosis after treatment. Portal venous pressure was positively correlated with the degree of fibrosis; with early combination therapy, both the degree of fibrosis and portal venous pressure could be effectively reduced."
