Here it is shown that intraperitoneal injection of the 120-kilodalton beta-galactosidase protein, fused to the protein transduction domain from the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein, results in delivery of the biologically active fusion protein to all tissues in mice, including the brain. These results open new possibilities for direct delivery of proteins into patients in the context of protein therapy, as well as for epigenetic experimentation with model organisms."

Only certain wavelength bands are confined and guided down the fiber, each band corresponding to the presence of a full two-dimensional band gap in the photonic crystal cladding. Single-mode vacuum waveguides have a multitude of potential applications from ultrahigh-power transmission to the guiding of cold atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2164267446,"A mevalonate-independent pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis present in Plasmodium falciparum was shown to represent an effective target for chemotherapy of malaria. This pathway includes 1-deoxy- d -xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) as a key metabolite. The presence of two genes encoding the enzymes DOXP synthase and DOXP reductoisomerase suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis in P. falciparum depends on the DOXP pathway. This pathway is probably located in the apicoplast. The recombinant P. falciparum DOXP reductoisomerase was inhibited by fosmidomycin and its derivative, FR-900098. Both drugs suppressed the in vitro growth of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum strains. After therapy with these drugs, mice infected with the rodent malaria parasite P. vinckei were cured."

https://openalex.org/W1983551262,"Scanning tunneling spectroscopy was used to investigate single crystals and thin films of La(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3) (with x of about 0.3), which exhibit colossal magnetoresistance. The different spectroscopic signatures of the insulating (paramagnetic) and metallic (ferromagnetic) phases enable their spatial extent to be imaged down to a lateral scale of the order of 10 nanometers. Above the bulk transition temperature T(c), the images show mostly insulating behavior. Below T(c), a phase separation is observed where inhomogeneous structures of metallic and more insulating areas coexist and are strongly field dependent in their size and structure. Insulating areas are found to persist far below T(c). These results suggest that the transition and the associated magnetoresistance behavior should be viewed as a percolation of metallic ferromagnetic domains."

Crystalline dots 35 nanometers in diameter and arranged in a regular hexagonal lattice were produced on gallium antimonide surfaces. The formation mechanism relies on a natural self-organization mechanism that occurs during the erosion of surfaces, which is based on the interplay between roughening induced by ion sputtering and smoothing due to surface diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2021510303,"A method for improving weather and climate forecast skill has been developed. It is called a superensemble, and it arose from a study of the statistical properties of a low-order spectral model. Multiple regression was used to determine coefficients from multimodel forecasts and observations. The coefficients were then used in the superensemble technique. The superensemble was shown to outperform all model forecasts for multiseasonal, medium-range weather and hurricane forecasts. In addition, the superensemble was shown to have higher skill than forecasts based solely on ensemble averaging."

https://openalex.org/W1969743795,"Photoperiodic responses in plants include flowering that is day-length–dependent. Mutations in the Arabidopsis thaliana GIGANTEA ( GI ) gene cause photoperiod-insensitive flowering and alteration of circadian rhythms. The GI gene encodes a protein containing six putative transmembrane domains. Circadian expression patterns of the GI gene and the clock-associated genes, LHY and CCA1 , are altered in gi mutants, showing that GI is required for maintaining circadian amplitude and appropriate period length of these genes. The gi-1 mutation also affects light signaling to the clock, which suggests that GI participates in a feedback loop of the plant circadian system."
https://openalex.org/W1745458420,"The perception of natural visual scenes that contain many objects poses computational problems that are absent when objects are perceived in isolation. Vision researchers have captured this attribute of real-world perception in the laboratory by using visual search tasks, in which subjects search for a target object in arrays containing varying numbers of non-target distractor objects. Under many conditions, the amount of time required to detect a visual search target increases as the number of objects in the stimulus array increases, and some investigators have proposed that this reflects the serial application of attention to the individual objects in the array. However, other investigators have argued that this pattern of results may instead be due to limitations in the processing capacity of a parallel processing system that identifies multiple objects concurrently. Here we attempt to address this longstanding controversy by using an electrophysiological marker of the moment-by-moment direction of attention-the N2pc component of the event-related potential waveform--to show that attention shifts rapidly among objects during visual search."
https://openalex.org/W1991738330,"ERK5 (also known as BMK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, was known to be activated strongly by oxidant and osmotic stresses. Here we have found that ERK5 is strongly activated by epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor, whose receptors are tyrosine kinases. The activation of ERK5 was inhibited by expression of dominant-negative Ras and induced by expression of active Ras in PC12 cells, indicating a requirement for Ras in ERK5 activation. The epidermal growth factor-induced activation of ERK5 was found to be inhibited by PD98059 and U0126 inhibitors, which were previously thought to act specifically on classical MAPK kinase (also known as MEK1) and readily reversed by CL100 and MKP-3 dual-specificity phosphatases for which classical MAPKs were previously shown to serve as preferred substrates. The reporter assays demonstrated that the serum-induced enhancement of transcription from serum response element was significantly inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative form of MEK5, which was a direct and specific activator for ERK5 and that transcription from serum response element mediated by the Ets-domain transcription factor Sap1a, but not by Elk1, was stimulated by coexpression of ERK5 and active MEK5. In addition, Sap1a was shown to be phosphorylated by ERK5 in vitro and by the activation of the ERK5 pathway in cells. Moreover, the serum-induced c-Fos expression was markedly inhibited by expression of dominant-negative MEK5. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway to the nucleus mediated by ERK5 that functions downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases to induce immediate early genes, in parallel with the classical MAPK cascade.

Several other members of the MAPK family including c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38/MPK2 have been identified. Each member of MAPKs is activated by both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation catalyzed by a distinct upstream kinase, a member of the MAPK kinase family (1Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin.

Classical MAPK has a Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) sequence in the dual phosphorylation motif and is activated by mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors mainly through the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway. JNK and p38, which have Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) and Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) sequences, respectively, respond to a variety of cellular stresses and pro-inflammatory cytokines and may function in apoptosis, immune response, and differentiation. Most recently, ERK5/BMK1 was identified as a novel member of the MAPK family (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 9Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although ERK5 has a TEY sequence in the activation phosphorylation site like classical MAPK, it is strongly activated by stresses such as oxidant and hyperosmolarity, like JNK and p38 (10Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Classical MAPK, JNK, and p38 are known to phosphorylate many of transcription factors to activate their transcriptional activity, which is required for the immediate early gene expression and various cellular responses (11Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 12Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). ERK5 has also been shown to phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Myc and MEF2C, a member of the MADS box transcription factors (13English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The best characterized signaling target of MAPK, JNK, and p38 involves the serum response element (SRE) on the c-fos promoter. At the SRE, the dimer of serum response factor (SRF) forms a ternary complex with a ternary complex factor (TCF) to bring full SRE function. Two TCF proteins, Elk1 and Sap1a, which belong to the Ets transcription factor family, are phosphorylated and activated by classical MAPKs, JNK, and p38 (11Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 15Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has remained unclear, however, whether ERK5 functions at the element, although serum stimulation was shown to induce ERK5 activation (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). MEK5, a member of the MAPKK family, is a direct and specific activator of ERK5 (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It has been reported that ERK5 somehow senses the signals from Src and Ras (13English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, activation of ERK5 by Ras or Raf-1, a downstream target of Ras, has not been demonstrated (13English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling pathways for the MEK5-ERK5 cascade are largely undefined. Here we have shown that ERK5 is strongly activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) through Ras and that the ERK5 pathway is blocked by several inhibitors known as the classical MAPK pathway inhibitors. The reporter gene assays have demonstrated that c-fos SRE is regulated by the MEK5-ERK5 cascade via Sap1a activation. In addition, Sap1a is shown to be phosphorylated by ERK5 in vitro and by the activation of the ERK5 pathway in cells. The serum-induced c-Fos expression is inhibited by expression of dominant-negative MEK5. These findings reveal a novel signaling pathway from the plasma membrane to the nucleus that is mediated by the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. A mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with a 1-kilobase pair-cDNA fragment encoding the kinase domain of the human ERK5/BMK1. Under high stringency washing conditions, a positive clone, mouse ERK5 cDNA, was isolated. The mouse MEK5 cDNA was obtained in a process of the MKK7 cDNA screening (21Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the coding regions was subcloned into pcDL-SRα456 and pSRα-HA1 (22Moriguchi T.

The mutagenic primers (5′-CAGCTGGTGAATGCTATAGCCAAGGTGTATGTTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCCAACATACACCTTGGCTATAGCATTCACCAGCTG-3′) were used to obtain MEK5(A), in which Ser-311 and Thr-315 were replaced by Ala and Val, respectively. The primers (5′-CAGCTGGTGAATGATATAGCCAAGGACTATGTTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCCAACATAGTCCTTGGCTATATCATTCACCAGCTG-3′) were used to obtain MEK5(D), in which Ser-311 and Thr-315 were replaced by Asp as described (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers (5′-CAGCAGGTGGCCATCGATAAGATACCTAATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGTATCTTATCGATGGCCACCTGCTG-3′) were used to obtain a kinase-negative form of ERK5 (ERK5(KN)), in which Lys-84 was replaced by Asp, and the C-terminal half (458–806) of ERK5(KN) was deleted by digestion with Nae I to obtain ERK5(KNΔC). The ERK5(KNΔC) was subcloned into pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RhoA, Rac1, H-Ras, and Cdc42 cDNAs were obtained by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene) and subcloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen). Then PCR-based mutagenesis was performed to obtain the mutant series RhoV14, RhoN19, RacV12, dnRas(N17), and Cdc42V12, which were subcloned into pcDL-SRα456, except Cdc42V12, which was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Elk1 and Sap1a cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene) as a template and subcloned into pcDL-SRα456 and pGEX-6P. Ser-287 and Thr-291 in MKK7 (21Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were replaced by Asp and Glu, respectively, by PCR-based mutagenesis to obtain a constitutively active form of MKK7 (MKK7(DE)). The fragment encoding three copies of the Myc epitope with Bam HI and Bgl II sites was synthesized by PCR, digested with Bam HI and Bgl II, and inserted into the Bgl II cut pcDL-SRα456 to generate pSRα-Myc1.

Other expression plasmids were as follows. pcDL-SRα456-RasV12 was kindly given by S. Hattori, pcDL-SRα456-MKK(A) was used for expression of a dominant-negative form of Xenopus MAPKK (MEK1) (25Gotoh I. Fukuda M. Adachi M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), pSRαHA-MAPK was used for expression of HA-tagged Xenopus MAPK (ERK2) (21Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSRαHA-JNK was used for expression of HA-tagged rat JNK2/SAPKα, pSRαHA-p38 was used for expression of HA-tagged human p38α (21Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSRE-Luc and pSRF-Luc (Stratagene) were used for luciferase assays, and PEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) was used for identification of transfected cells. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Rat PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.35% glucose, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum. All plasmids used in transfection were prepared with QIAGEN-tip 500. 24 h before transfection, 1.5 × 105 COS7 and PC12 cells were plated on a 60-mm dish, and 0.5 × 105 HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were plated on a 35-mm dish. For cell staining, cells were plated onto coverslips. Transfection for COS7, PC12, and NIH3T3 cells was carried out using a LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 4.5-μg total amounts of plasmids on 60-mm dish or 1.5 μg on a 35-mm dish. After 24 h, the complete medium was replaced by a low serum medium consisting of DMEM with 0.5% calf serum for COS7 and NIH3T3 cells or DMEM with 1% heat-inactivated horse serum for PC12 cells. Then the cells were incubated for 24 h further. HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1.5-μg total amounts of plasmids on a 35-mm dish and incubated for 40 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. The transfection efficiency was 8–12% in COS7 cells, 5–10% in PC12 and NIH3T3 cells, and 4–8% in HeLa cells. 48 h after transfection, COS7 or PC12 cells in the low serum medium were treated with or without each stimuli: 30 nm EGF, 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 ng/ml NGF for 5 min and 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid, 1 mmH2O2, 100 ng/ml TPA, 100 J/m2 UV, incubation at 45 °C (heat shock), 100 nm A23187, and 2 μg/ml anisomycin for 30 min. For kinase assays of endogenous ERK5, subconfluent cells on a 100-mm dish in the low serum medium were treated with or without the growth factors as described above. Then the cells were washed once in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline, scraped in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin (200 μl of buffer/60-mm dish or 400 μl of buffer/100-mm dish) and extracted by pipetting 20 times, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 45 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and antibody (10 μl (200 μg/ml) of rabbit anti-HA antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz), 20 μl (100 μg/ml) of goat anti-ERK5 antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz), or 10 μl (200 μg/ml) of mouse anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz)) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complex on beads was washed twice with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Tween 20. Then, the immunoprecipitate was divided into two parts, and one part was used for the kinase assay, and the other was used for immunoblotting. To detect the kinase activity, the immune complex was washed once with a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with the substrate in a buffer (final volume, 15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2 and 100 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μg of GST-ERK5(KNΔC) were used as substrate for ERK5 and MEK5, respectively. The immune complex kinase assays for classical MAPK, JNK, and p38 were carried out using 3 μg of MBP, GST-c-Jun (1–79), or GST-ATF-2 as described (21Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the radioactivity was analyzed with an image analyzer (Bio-Rad). 48 h after transfection, NIH3T3 cells in DMEM with 0.5% calf serum were treated with or without 15% fetal calf serum for 2 h. Then the cells on the coverslip were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min, and then stained with rabbit anti-human c-Fos antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel) for 1 h at room temperature. 40 h after transfection, HeLa cells in DMEM with 0.5% calf serum were treated with or without 15% fetal calf serum and incubated for 8 h. Then the cells were washed once in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline, scraped in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min after vortexing for 15 s. The supernatant was used as a cell extract to detect the luciferase activity. The luciferase assay was carried out using a luciferase assay system (Promega). In brief, 20 μl of the room-temperature cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of room temperature luciferase assay reagent containing the substrate. The reaction was performed and measured in a luminometer (LB9507, Berthold). The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and used for normalization of the luciferase assays. All the experiments were repeated at least three times. For in vitro analysis, GST-Sap1a and GST-Elk1 were prepared by using the expression vector pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vivo phosphorylation, 6 h after transfection of Myc-tagged Sap1a or Elk1, COS7 cells were labeled for 24 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Then, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz). We isolated the ERK5 and MEK5 cDNA clones from mouse brain cDNA library and determined the nucleotide sequences containing their open reading frames (Fig. 1). The mouse ERK5 is deduced to contain 806 amino acids and shows 92% identity with human ERK5 (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The kinase domain, which is located in the N-terminal half is highly conserved, including the dual phosphorylation site (Thr-219 and Tyr-221) in the TEY sequence (Fig.1 A). The mouse MEK5 is predicted to have 448 amino acids and displays 99 and 93% identity with the rat and human sequences, respectively (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The epithelial-like COS7 cells transfected with HA-tagged mouse ERK5 were exposed to various stimuli; EGF, lysophosphatidic acid, serum, phorbol ester TPA, UV, heat shock, A23187 Ca2+ ionophore, and anisomycin. As a control, the cells were stimulated by H2O2, which was previously reported to induce ERK5 activation (10Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The immune complex kinase assays revealed that ERK5 was strongly activated by EGF, TPA, or lysophosphatidic acid as well as by H2O2 (Fig.2 A). Although fetal calf serum (10%) and heat shock at 45 °C activated ERK5 moderately, UV, A23187, or anisomycin did not. In the phaeochromocytoma PC12 cells, ERK5 activation by serum was very weak, whereas the activation by EGF or by NGF was strong (Fig. 2 B). The EGF-induced activation of HA-tagged ERK5 was seen in other cell lines, including C2C12 and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). The EGF-induced activation of ERK5 in PC12 cells peaked at 5 min and then declined rather rapidly (Fig.2 B). The activation by NGF also peaked at about 5 min and persisted longer than that by EGF (Fig. 2 B). The activation of ERK5 by H2O2, TPA, or heat shock was slow and peaked at about 30 min or later (data not shown). We then measured the activity of endogenous ERK5 by an immune complex kinase assay with anti-ERK5 antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz) and found that endogenous ERK5 was activated by EGF in PC12 cells and COS7 cells and by NGF in PC12 cells (Fig. 2 C). The EGF-induced activation of endogenous ERK5 was also observed in NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells (data not shown). Low molecular weight GTPases such as the Ras family and the Rho family proteins have been shown to function in the signaling pathways of growth factors or stress stimuli to activate the downstream kinase cascades (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 12Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 26Marshall C.J.

To test the effect of activation of these GTPases on the activation of ERK5, cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing HA-ERK5 and each of dominant-active forms of GTPases: RhoV14, RacV12, Cdc42V12, or RasV12. The immune complex kinase assay revealed that ERK5 as well as classical MAPK (also known as ERK1 and ERK2, simply called MAPK hereafter) was strongly activated by RasV12 in PC12 cells (Fig.3 A) and in C2C12 cells (data not shown). In agreement with a recent report (13English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), however, ERK5 was not markedly activated by RasV12 in COS7 cells, whereas MAPK was activated (Fig. 3 B). RacV12 and Cdc42V12, which were able to activate JNK in COS7 cells and PC12 cells (data not shown), were not potent activators of ERK5 (Fig. 3, A and B). RhoV14 also failed to activate ERK5. Because activation of Ras was found to be able to induce ERK5 activation, at least in several types of cells including PC12 cells, we next tested the requirement of Ras for ERK5 activation. PC12 cells were cotransfected with HA-ERK5 and dominant-negative Ras (dnRas). After NGF stimulation, the kinase activity of ERK5 was measured by immune complex kinase assay. The NGF-induced activation of ERK5 was inhibited by expression of dnRas (Fig. 3 C, left). The EGF-induced activation of ERK5 in PC12 cells (data not shown) and in COS7 cells (Fig. 3 C, right) was also inhibited by dnRas. Furthermore, to assess the requirement of Ras for endogenous ERK5 activation, we used a PC12 cell line in which dominant negative Ras (N17) was stably expressed (28Li H. Kawasaki H. Nishida E. Hattori S. Nakamura S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the N17Ras-expressing PC12 cell line, the EGF- or NGF-induced activation of endogenous ERK5 was markedly reduced, although the amount of endogenous ERK5 was almost equivalent to that in wild-type PC12 cells (Fig. 3 D). These results, therefore, indicate that Ras is important for the activation of ERK5 induced by NGF and EGF. The growth factor-induced Ras-dependent activation of ERK5 and its having the TEY sequence are the same as the characteristics of MAPK. We tested the effect of some well known inhibitors of the classical MAPK cascade on ERK5 activation. COS7 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of PD98059, a MAPKK/MEK1 inhibitor that does not inhibit the JNK or p38 pathway (29Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), was also tested. The kinase assay showed that PD98059 and U0126 inhibited the EGF-induced ERK5 activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). The inhibitory effect of these drugs on ERK5 activation was similar to, or slightly more potent than, that on MAPK activation (29Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 30Cohen P.

It is assumed that the target of PD98059 and U0126 may be MEK5, analogous to the action of the drugs on the MAPK cascade, because the MEK5-ERK5 cascade and the classical MAPKK-MAPK cascade are analogous but independent. In fact, expression of dominant-negative MAPKK, MKK(A), which inhibited MAPK activation, did not inhibit ERK5 activation. Similarly, the ERK5 activation, but not the activation of MAPK, JNK, or p38, was inhibited by expression of dominant-neg"

In human postnatal hematopoietic tissues, 0.1 to 0.5% of CD34(+) cells expressed vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR). Pluripotent HSCs were restricted to the CD34+KDR+ cell fraction. Conversely, lineage-committed HPCs were in the CD34+KDR- subset. On the basis of limiting dilution analysis, the HSC frequency in the CD34+KDR+ fraction was 20 percent in bone marrow (BM) by mouse xenograft assay and 25 to 42 percent in BM, peripheral blood, and cord blood by 12-week long-term culture (LTC) assay. The latter values rose to 53 to 63 percent in LTC supplemented with VEGF and to greater than 95 percent for the cell subfraction resistant to growth factor starvation. Thus, KDR is a positive functional marker defining stem cells and distinguishing them from progenitors."

Sixteen wine grapes that have long been grown in northeastern France, including 'Chardonnay', 'Gamay noir', 'Aligoté', and 'Melon', have microsatellite genotypes consistent with their being the progeny of a single pair of parents, 'Pinot' and 'Gouais blanc', both of which were widespread in this region in the Middle Ages.

https://openalex.org/W1968420169,"A fundamental question about human memory is which brain structures are involved, and when, in transforming experiences into memories. This experiment sought to identify neural correlates of memory formation with the use of intracerebral electrodes implanted in the brains of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded directly from the medial temporal lobe (MTL) as the patients studied single words. ERPs elicited by words subsequently recalled in a memory test were contrasted with ERPs elicited by unrecalled words. Memory formation was associated with distinct but interrelated ERP differences within the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus, which arose after about 300 and 500 milliseconds, respectively. These findings suggest that declarative memory formation is dissociable into subprocesses and sequentially organized within the MTL."

https://openalex.org/W2003049417,"Activation of the serine kinase protein kinase D (PKD)/PKCμ is controlled by the phosphorylation of two serine residues within its activation loop via a PKC-dependent signaling cascade. In this study we have identified the C-terminal serine 916 residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within active PKD/PKCμ. An antibody that recognized PKD/PKCμ proteins specifically phosphorylated on the serine 916 residue was generated and used to show that phosphorylation of Ser-916 is induced by phorbol ester treatment of cells. Thus, the pS916 antibody is a useful tool to study the regulation of PKD/PKCμ activity in vivo. Antigen receptor ligation of T and B lymphocytes also induced phosphorylation of the serine 916 residue of PKD/PKCμ. Furthermore the regulatory FcγRIIB receptor, which mediates vital negative feedback signals to the B cell antigen receptor complex, inhibited the antigen receptor-induced activation and serine 916 phosphorylation of PKD/PKCμ. The degree of serine 916 phosphorylation during lymphocyte activation and inhibition exactly correlated with the activation status of PKD/PKCμ. Moreover, using different mutants of PKD/PKCμ, we show that serine 916 is not trans-phosphorylated by an upstream kinase but is rather an autophosphorylation event that occurs following activation of PKD/PKCμ."

Coordinating polyols require at least four hydroxy groups, two of which must be in threo configuration, and coordinate to silicon via hydroxy oxygens at chain positions on either side of the threo pair. The remarkable ease by which these simple sugar-like molecules react to form hypervalent silicon complexes in aqueous solution supports a long-standing supposition that such species play a significant role in the biological uptake and transport of silicon and in mineral diagenesis."

SsuA has a putative signal sequence, indicating that it functions as a periplasmic binding protein, and the sequences of SsuB and SsuC are significantly similar to those of ATP-binding proteins and membrane components, respectively, of members of the ABC transporter superfamily. It thus appears that the proteins encoded by ssuABC constitute an uptake system for alkanesulfonates. The ssuD gene product shows 25% sequence identity to a characterized nitrilotriacetate two-component monooxygenase of Chelatobacter heintzii (6Uetz T. Schneider R. Snozzi M. Egli T. J.

Here we report the purification of the SsuD and SsuE proteins, describe their biochemical properties, and demonstrate that SsuD is a monooxygenase that catalyzes the desulfonation of alkanesulfonates and requires reduced FMN, which is provided by the NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase SsuE.

The 672-base pair PCR product was digested with Nde I and Hin dIII and the resulting 655-base pair fragment was ligated in pUC19 (10Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), generating plasmid pME4145. The Nde I-Hin dIII fragment from pME4145 was subsequently cloned in pET-24a(+) resulting in plasmid pME4146. For the production of SsuE as an N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein, the Nde I-Hin dIII SsuE-encoding fragment from plasmid pME4145 was ligated into Nde I-Hin dIII digested pET-28a(+) (Novagen) leading to plasmid pME4287. The ssuE sequence of plasmid pME4287 was sequenced to confirm that no changes had been introduced during PCR amplification. The complete ssuD gene was PCR-amplified with TaqPlus DNA polymerase from genomic DNA prepared from E. coli EC1250 (11Jagura-Burdzy G. Hulanicka D. J.

Finally, the Nde I-Hin dIII fragment from pME4281 was cloned in pET-24a(+), leading to the ssuD expression vector pME4282. Sequencing confirmed that the ssuD sequence of plasmid pME4282 was identical to the wild type E. coli ssuD gene sequence. For the production of SsuE and SsuD, E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the appropriate overexpression plasmid was grown at 30 °C and 180 rpm in a 5-liter Erlenmeyer flask containing 1000 ml of growth medium. To minimize the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, which were observed when protein production was carried out at 30 °C, cultures grown to an A650 of 0.5 were cooled to 16 °C, induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 50 μm and incubated for a further 5 h at 16 °C with constant shaking (180 rpm). Cells were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 5800 ×g and 4 °C, washed in an excess of 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C as frozen pellets until further use. About 4.5 g fresh weight of cells were collected from a 1000-ml culture. For the production of crude extracts containing the histidine-tagged SsuE fusion protein, 1.8 g of induced E. coli BL21(DE3)(pME4287) cells were resuspended in 4 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) supplemented with 25 μg/ml DNase I and disrupted by three passages through a French Pressure cell at 5.5 megapascals. After clarification by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 110,000 × g and 4 °C, the volume of the crude extract was adjusted to 10 ml with binding buffer and supplemented with 10 μl of Nonidet P-40 (Fluka). The crude extract was then loaded at a flow rate of 25 ml/h onto a 2.5-ml HisBind Resin column (Novagen), which had been activated with NiSO4 and equilibrated with binding buffer as described by the manufacturer. The sample was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, followed by washing with 6 column volumes of wash buffer (60 mmimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). An additional wash step with a buffer containing 100 mmimidazole was performed for 6 column volumes prior to SsuE elution with 200 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9. The protein solution was stored at −20 °C until further use.

After clarification by ultracentrifugation (40 min, 110,000 × g, 4 °C), the SsuD enzyme was purified on a BioCAD apparatus using 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing either NaCl or (NH4)2SO4 at the concentrations indicated below. The crude extract was first loaded at a flow rate of 5 ml/min on a 3.5-ml Fractogel EMD SO3−(S) cation exchange column (Merck) equilibrated with 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The sample was washed for 2 column volumes with 70 mm NaCl and SsuD was eluted with 160 mmNaCl. The SsuD fractions were pooled, diluted twice with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and loaded at a flow rate of 4 ml/min on a 4.5-ml Fractogel EMD TMAE (S) anion exchange column (Merck) equilibrated with the same buffer. After a wash step with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, for 2 column volumes followed by washing with 90 mm NaCl (6 column volumes), SsuD was eluted with 150 mm NaCl. In a third step, the pooled SsuD fractions collected from the anion exchange column were diluted twice with 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a 7.5-ml phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow 66 hydrophobic interaction column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and washed with 2 column volumes of 500 mm(NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 500 to 0 mm(NH4)2SO4 in 5 column volumes, followed by washing with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. SsuD eluted between 100 and 0 mm(NH4)2SO4. Appropriate amounts of SsuE were incubated at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (1 ml final volume) containing either 500 μm NADPH and 3 μm FMN, or 1 mm NADH and 0.5 μmFMN in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Reactions were started by addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture; activity was followed online with a Uvikon 900 spectrophotometer. An assay mixture without FMN was used as a blank. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of 1 μmol of NAD(P)H/min at 30 °C under aerobic conditions, calculated from the slope of the absorbance decrease at 340 nm using ε340 = 6.2 mm−1cm−1 for NAD(P)H. When kinetic parameters for FMN and FAD were investigated, reductase activity was followed spectrophotometrically under anaerobic conditions in a reaction mixture containing 1 mm NADH, varying FMN or FAD concentrations and appropriate amounts of SsuE in 20 mmimidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. All reagents and buffers were therefore made anaerobic by at least 10 cycles of alternate flushing with 95% N2, 5% H2 and vacuum evacuating. Reaction mixtures were prepared in an anaerobic chamber and reactions were started by enzyme addition. An assay in which NADH was omitted was used as a blank. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 1 μmol of flavin substrate per minute at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions. Activity was calculated from the slope of the absorbance decrease at 375 nm using ε375 = 9.3 mm−1cm−1 for FAD and ε375 = 10.4 mm−1 cm−1 for FMN. The obtained values were corrected for residual NADH absorption at 375 nm using ε375 = 2.0 mm−1cm−1 for NADH. SsuD activity was routinely assayed with Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) which produces a bright yellow color upon reaction with sulfite (13Johnston J.B. Murray K. Cain R.B. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1975; 41: 493-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1.5 ml final volume) contained 500 μm NADPH, 3 μm FMN, 500 μmsulfonated substrate, SsuE and SsuD to a SsuE/SsuD molar ratio of 3.0, in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1, and was stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 30 °C. Reactions were started by addition of SsuD to the reaction mixture and stopped by the addition of 200-μl samples to a spectrophotometric cuvette containing 100 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (1 mg/ml in 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) to which 700 μl of deionized water was finally added. The colorimetric reaction was allowed to develop at room temperature for 2 min. Sulfite determination with Ellman's reagent was linear up to 250 μm sulfite. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol of sulfite per minute at 30 °C under standard assay conditions, calculated from the slope of absorbance increase at 430 nm with reference to sulfite calibration curves. These were prepared daily from fresh solutions of sodium sulfite in deionized water. When assayed under anaerobic conditions, all reagents were made anaerobic by at least 10 cycles of alternate flushing with 95% N2, 5% H2 and vacuum pulling, reaction mixtures were prepared in an anaerobic chamber and sulfite detection was carried out as described above, but using anaerobized 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The presence of pentaldehyde in reaction mixtures containing pentanesulfonate as substrate for SsuD was detected by gas chromatography analysis using co-chromatography with authentic pentaldehyde (Fluka). A Perkin-Elmer 8700 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used. 10-μl samples of reaction mixture were injected directly and chromatographed on a 180 × 0.2-cm Porapak P (80/100-mesh) column (Supelco) run with nitrogen at 175 °C. The flow rate was 30 ml/min and the detector temperature was 250 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed on a Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad) with 12% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with Bio-Rad reagent dye concentrate, following the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. The native Mr of SsuE was estimated by gel filtration on Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated (2 column volumes) and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The native Mr of SsuD was estimated by gel filtration on Superose 12 HR 10/30 and Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as above but at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Columns were calibrated with appropriate known Mr protein standards: thyroglobulin (670,000), ferritin (440,000), catalase (232,000), aldolase (158,000), apotransferrin (77,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and RNase A (13,700). The wild type SsuE enzyme produced from the overexpression plasmid pME4146 lost its NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reduction activity within 2–3 h in crude extracts, when kept on ice. When partially purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (30–40% cut) and stored at −20 °C with 20% glycerol, activity could be maintained for a few days. However, cation or anion exchange chromatography on Fractogel EMD SO3− (S) and EMD TMAE (S) (Merck) or SP- and Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively, or dye-ligand affinity chromatography on Green A-agarose (Millipore AG) led to significant protein inactivation. Affinity chromatography with FMN-agarose (Sigma) did not lead to any purification of SsuE. Purification of SsuE as an N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein expressed from plasmid pME4287 turned out to be an efficient alternative to conventional chromatography techniques for obtaining pure, active and stable enzyme. The SsuE enzyme was purified in one step with 40% yield (Fig. 1 A) by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The purified histidine-tagged SsuE had a specific activity of 32.4 units/mg (NADPH oxidation) and was stable for several months when stored at −20 °C in elution buffer. Densitometric scanning of lanes 2 and 3 of the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1 A) showed that wild type SsuE represented around 18%, whereas the histidine-tagged SsuE amounted to approximately 13% of the total soluble protein in crude extracts. The relative specific activities calculated as NAD(P)H oxidation rates of both extracts were identical, indicating that the histidine tag had no influence on SsuE activity. Enzyme characterization was therefore done with the histidine-tagged SsuE fusion protein. The effect of pH on NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase activity was investigated over a range from 4.5 to 10.8 using appropriate buffer systems (16Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SsuE activity was maximal in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and 50 mm NaCl. In all other buffer systems used, including acetate, bis-Tris, and glycine-NaOH, SsuE specific activity was less than 5% of the maximal activity. This was also the case when the enzyme was dialyzed or subjected to buffer exchange using PD10 gel filtration columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). It is thus likely that a cofactor essential for activity was lost upon dialysis or gel filtration. The pure SsuE protein showed no typical absorption spectrum of flavin-containing flavoproteins, suggesting that the enzyme does not contain any bound flavin cofactor. Gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 was used to estimate a Mr of 58,400 ± 100 for the native enzyme. The subunit molecular mass calculated from the histidine-tagged SsuE amino acid sequence of 23.7 kDa was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis as 25.4 ± 0.7 kDa. These results therefore suggest a homodimeric structure for the SsuE enzyme. The SsuE enzyme showed a Michaelis-Menten type saturation curve in response to increasing substrate concentrations. NADPH was the best pyrimidinic substrate for SsuE, which was also able to oxidize NADH (Table I). The preference for NADPH was also found in crude extracts of both wild type and histidine-tagged SsuE proteins.Table IKinetic parameters of NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase SsuESubstrateKmVmaxkcat/Kmμmunits/mgmin−1μm−1FMN (0.04–7.2 μm)0.0540.54474.1FAD (0.08–17.3 μm)2.70.9616.9NADPH (7–424 μm)46.032.433.4NADH (32–670 μm)555.51.30.1Determination of Km values for NADPH and NADH was performed under aerobic conditions in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, with NAD(P)H over the concentration range indicated.

Kinetic parameters for flavin substrates were determined under anaerobic conditions with 59 nm SsuE in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, supplemented with 1 mm NADH, and FMN or FAD over the concentration range indicated.

Initial rates were calculated by regression analysis from the slope of flavin substrate reduction. Kinetic parameters were determined from double-reciprocal plots according to Lineweaver-Burk. Each value represents the mean of at least two independent sets of experiments. FMN was the preferred flavin substrate of SsuE, but FAD and riboflavin were also reduced at significant rates, whereas lumiflavin was not (Fig. 2). When NADH was the pyrimidinic substrate, a distinct activity maximum was obtained at an FMN concentration of 0.5 μm, whereas concentrations higher than 2.5 μm led to more than 60% decrease in specific activity. On the contrary, the SsuE specific activity increased with increasing FAD concentrations and reached saturation at 10 to 25 μm FAD. When NADPH was supplied as pyrimidinic substrate, maximal reductase activity was obtained with 2.5–10 μmFMN, while higher FMN concentration led to 15% decrease in SsuE activity. These results showed the necessity of performing the determination of kinetic constants for NADH in reaction mixtures containing only 0.5 μm FMN, whereas 3 μmFMN was used when the kinetic constants for NADPH were investigated. When affinities for FMN or FAD were explored, measurements were done under anaerobic conditions using NADH because a strong abiotic FMN reduction was observed when NADPH was given as pyrimidinic substrate. Table I summarizes the kinetic parameters for SsuE with regard to NADH, NADPH, FMN, and FAD. It can be concluded that SsuE is a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase. The SsuD protein initially produced from an overexpression construct in which the ssuD gene originating from plasmid pME4180 (4van der Ploeg J.R. Iwanicka-Nowicka R. Bykowsky T. Hryniewicz N. Leisinger T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, was not active. Sequencing of the ssuD gene of plasmid pME4180 revealed a single point mutation leading to an arginine to cysteine exchange at position 298 of the SsuD sequence, which was responsible for the complete loss of activity of the enzyme. The SsuD protein was therefore produced from the overexpression plasmid pME4282, which contains the ssuD gene sequence amplified from E. coli EC1250 genomic DNA. Using the three-step procedure summarized in TableII, the ssuD gene product was purified to near homogeneity with a yield of 35% from E. coli BL21(DE3)(pME4282) as shown in Fig. 1 B. The band corresponding to a 32-kDa protein which co-purified with SsuD and which represented less than 2% of the phenyl-Sepharose purified protein preparation could not be removed by any other chromatography technique tested. After an additional purification step on hydroxyapatite, the SsuD protein amounted to only 90% of total protein, and a net increase in intensity of the 32-kDa protein band was observed at the expense of SsuD. After storage for 24 h at −20 °C of the hydroxyapatite-purified protein, SsuD was only 70% of the total protein, the remaining 30% being represented by the 32-kDa protein. We therefore presume that this 32-kDa protein is a degradation product of the native SsuD protein. For this reason, we chose to perform SsuD characterization with the enzyme preparation obtained after phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, in which no further degradation of SsuD was observed. Densitometric scanning indicated that SsuD was over 98% pure (Fig. 1 B, lane 5).Table IIPurification of alkanesulfonate monooxygenase SsuDStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationUnits%mgunits/mg-foldCrude extract516.0144.5100.00.281.0Fractogel EMD SO3− (S)38.464.144.41.676.0Fractogel EMD TMAE (S)26.263.744.02.438.7Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow20.350.835.12.508.9 Open table in a new tab The purified enzyme was stable upon storage at −20 °C in buffer with 15% glycerol and it had a specific activity of 2.5 units/mg. The activity increased slightly during the first 2 to 3 weeks of storage. The effect of the pH on enzyme activity was examined over a range from 4.5 to 10.8 using appropriate buffer systems (16Stoll V.S. Blanchard J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). SsuD showed a distinct activity maximum in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.1. When SsuD activity was assayed in crude extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3)(pME4282) cells that overproduced SsuD, desulfonation was observed even without addition of SsuE, but it was dependent on NAD(P)H and enhanced by addition of FMN. On the contrary, alkanesulfonate desulfonation by pure SsuD was absolutely dependent on the presence of SsuE, NAD(P)H, and FMN. Maximal activity was obtained with 3 μm FMN and 500 μm NADPH and was not inhibited by higher NADPH concentrations. Since the ssuE gene product is present at very low concentration in cells grown under sulfate replete conditions, these results suggest that in crude extracts SsuE activity was provided by other NAD(P)H-dependent flavin reductases. When SsuD was assayed under anaerobic conditions, no sulfite production could be detected. However, when anaerobic reaction mixtures were exposed to air and stirred, sulfite production was observed, showing that alkanesulfonate desulfonation by SsuD was absolutely dependent on oxygen. Gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 and Superose 12 H/R was used to estimate a Mr of 181,000 ± 11,000 for the native enzyme. The calculated subunit molecular mass from the ssuD gene sequence of 41.73 kDa was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis as 41.2 ± 0.7 kDa. The results therefore suggest a homotetrameric structure for the SsuD enzyme. Since the activity of pure SsuD was dependent on the FMN reducing activity of SsuE, the influence of the concentration of SsuE on alkanesulfonate desulfonation at a constant concentration of SsuD was investigated. An increase in SsuD activity with increasing SsuE concentration was observed (Fig. 3). Maximal activity was obtained for SsuE/SsuD molar ratios between 2.1 and 4.2, whereas for higher ratios up to 6.3, SsuD activity decreased to around 2/3 of the activity reached at saturation. Therefore, the characterization of SsuD activity was performed at a SsuE/SsuD molar ratio of 3.0. Maximal desulfona"

The BARD1-CstF-50 interaction inhibits polyadenylation in vitro. BARD1, like CstF-50, also interacts with RNA polymerase II.

https://openalex.org/W2087674871,"In eukaryotes, production of the diverse repertoire of molecular chaperones during normal growth and in response to stress is governed by the heat shock transcription factor HSF. The HSC82 and HSP82 genes, encoding isoforms of the yeast Hsp90 molecular chaperone, were recently identified as targets of the HSF carboxyl-terminal activation domain (CTA), whose expression is required for cell cycle progression during prolonged heat stress conditions. In the present study, we have identified additional target genes of the HSF CTA, which include nearly all of the heat shock-inducible members of the Hsp90 chaperone complex, demonstrating coordinate regulation of these components by HSF. Heat shock induction of SSE1, encoding a member of the Hsp110 family of heat shock proteins, was also dependent on the HSF CTA.

The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, this response is primarily governed at the transcriptional level by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF),1 a highly conserved protein that binds to heat shock elements (HSEs), specific cis-acting sequences upstream of genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps). HSF is a modular protein composed of a highly conserved amino-terminal DNA binding domain followed by a series of hydrophobic heptad repeats that comprise the trimerization interface for the active factor (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In addition, all HSF molecules possess a transcriptional activation domain in the carboxyl terminus that shows low sequence conservation. In higher eukaryotes, multiple distinct HSF isoforms exist that display differential specificity for HSE binding and respond to diverse stimuli. In yeast, however, HSF is encoded by a single essential gene, HSF1, which possesses both an amino-terminal trans-activation domain and a carboxyl-terminal trans-activation domain (CTA) (4Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 5Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The two domains appear to be differentially used for target gene activation, since expression of the copper metallothionein gene CUP1 in response to heat, oxidative stress, or glucose starvation is abolished when the CTA is deleted, while expression of at least three other heat shock genes, SSA1, SSA3, and SSA4, is largely unaffected (6Tamai K.T.

Deletion of either domain alone has little effect at normal growth temperatures, but cells expressing HSF (1–583), a truncated form of HSF lacking the CTA, are temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C (4Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 5Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive phenotype is due to reversible arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a phenotype shared by two other mutant alleles of HSF1, mas3 and hsf1–82 (10Smith B.J.

Both HSF (1–583) and hsf1–82 mutants are defective in expression of the yeast Hsp90 genes HSP82 and HSC82, and temperature-sensitive cell cycle arrest can be partially suppressed by restoring cellular levels of Hsp90, implying a role for this molecular chaperone in cell cycle progression during stress (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Zarzov P. Boucherie H. Mann C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1879-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, depletion of Hsp90 levels during growth at 37 °C in a wild type HSF background results in a mixed population of G1/S and G2/M phase-arrested cells (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the incomplete suppression of HSF (1–583) temperature sensitivity by HSP82, and the different cell cycle arrest phenotypes observed with HSF (1–583) or Hsp90-depleted cells, it was proposed that other HSF gene targets might be required for cell division during heat stress in addition to Hsp90 (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is a ubiquitous and abundant cytosolic chaperone first characterized in the function and regulation of steroid hormone receptors (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Hsp90 associates with a number of proteins required for full chaperone activity, and these individual components are well conserved in eukaryotes (12Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

The Hsp90 chaperone complex is dynamic, with distinct subunits associating at various stages of the folding/chaperoning process for different client proteins (31Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). For example, during maturation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), early complexes form, which include GR, Hsp90, Hsp70, Ydj1, and p60. After hormone binding, the Hsp70/Ydj1 pair dissociate, and p60 is replaced by the cyclophilin Cyp-40, probably through competition for the single tetratricopeptide repeat binding domain in Hsp90 (32Young J.C.

Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In vitro, many of these purified subunits are capable of maintaining substrate proteins in a folding competent state, which requires the action of the Hsp70 and Ydj1 chaperones to achieve the final folded conformation (29Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I.

The Hsp70 superfamily of molecular chaperones is divided into three subgroups based on sequence homology: the DnaK subfamily, the GRP170/Lhs1 subfamily, and the Hsp110/Sse1 subfamily (37Craven R.A. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 277-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All share a high level of homology within their amino termini, which includes the ATP-binding domain essential for catalytic folding activity, but diverge within the carboxyl termini, thought to be responsible for interaction with substrate proteins. The founding members of the Hsp110/Sse1 subfamily are the SSE1 and SSE2 genes from yeast, which show 76% identity with each other but only 30–40% identity with the DnaK group of Hsp70s (38Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The SSE1 and SSE2 genes were first identified as calmodulin-binding proteins (38Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and SSE1 was also isolated independently in a genetic study as MSI3, a multicopy suppressor of the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of Ras-cAMP pathway hyperactivation (39Shirayama M. Kawakami K. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the true functions of Sse1 and Sse2 in yeast are currently unknown. While heat shock-induced proteins of approximately 110 kDa have long been observed in higher eukaryotes, only recently have Hsp110 members from a variety of organisms including human, plant, nematode and fission yeast been cloned and found to share substantial homology (∼40%) to the SSE1/SSE2 genes (40Lee-Yoon D.

Physiol. 1998; 274: F1054-F1061PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike Hsp70, the Hsp110 class of chaperones can maintain heat-denatured proteins such as firefly luciferase in a folding-competent state (46Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 47Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol.

In order to more precisely determine the cause of cell cycle arrest in HSF (1–583) mutant cells, we sought to identify additional gene products whose heat shock-induced expression was abrogated relative to wild type cells. We demonstrate that expression of SSE1 is dependent upon the HSF CTA. In addition, most of the heat shock-inducible components of the Hsp90 chaperone complex were found to share this requirement, suggesting tight coordinate regulation of their expression. Moreover, SSE1 displays synthetic genetic interactions with chaperone genes, is physically associated with purified Hsp90 complexes, and is required for Hsp90 activity in vivo. Together these findings identify Sse1 as a novel member of the Hsp90 chaperone complex. In-frame fusion of the triple hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the amino terminus of the SSE1 gene was accomplished by insertion of annealed oligonucleotides encoding three repeats of the HA epitope 3′ of the initiator ATG codon. The fusion gene was cloned into the HIS3-based pRS313 vector to generate pRS313-HA-SSE1. For disruption of the STI1 gene, the oligonucleotides 5′-GAGCTCTTCACTAAAGCTATTGAAGTTTCTGAAACTCCAAACCATGTTTTATATTCTAACAGGTCCGCCTGTaagcttcgtacgctgcag-3′ and 5′-TTCATGGCCCTTTGATAGGTTTCTTCTGGGGTTTCGTTACTGGTACCAGGTTGGAATCTTTGTTGGCTTGCCggccactagtggatctga-3′ were used to amplify the KanMX2 cassette from the pFA-KanMX2 plasmid (48Wach A.

The PCR-amplified fragment contains 72 base pairs of flanking sequences (both 5′ and 3′) that are homologous to the STI1 gene. Approximately 4 μg of the PCR product was used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and G418-resistant colonies were recovered. The SSE1 gene was similarly disrupted by a PCR product amplified from the pFA-KanMX2 cassette using oligonucleotides 5′-GATGAGTACTCCATTTGGTTTAGATTTAGGTAACAATAACTCTGTCCTTGCCGTTGCTAGAAACAGAGGTATaagcttcgtacgctgcag-3′ and 5′-GACCTTCTGGTAATTGAACACCAGTGATCTCCCAGTTAGCGATTTGTTCTGGAGTGTTTGGTGGTAACTGTGggccactagtggatctga-3′. The resulting strains carrying the appropriate disruptions were G418-resistant and displayed the expected phenotypes as described previously (48Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), and the mutated alleles were verified by PCR. p413GPD-rGR and pYRP-GRElacZ (a kind gift from D. McDonnell, Duke University) expressing rat glucocorticoid receptor and a lacZ reporter construct containing GR-binding elements were as described (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol.

Cells were grown in synthetic complete (SC) medium minus the indicated nutrients (SC-x) at 30 °C to midlog phase (A650 = 0.7–1.4). For growth dilution series assays, saturated liquid cultures were adjusted to approximately 1 × 106 cells/ml, serially diluted, and plated on SC-x agar plates for incubation at 30 °C or 37 °C as indicated. Sensitivity to the benzoquinoid ansamycins macbecin and geldanamycin was assayed on YPD plates made by adding the drugs in Me2SO to melted YPD agar solution to a final concentration of 35 μm. Macbecin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry branch of NCI, National Institutes of Health. Geldanamycin was obtained from Dr. William Pratt (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). sse1Δ HSF (1–583) and sti1Δ HSF (1–583) cells were generated from XLY24 (sse1Δ, GAL1-HSF) and XLY25 (sti1Δ, GAL1-HSF) strains, respectively. XLY24 and XLY25 were transformed with HSF-(1–583)-expressing plasmids and grown to saturation in galactose-containing medium (to allow for expression of GAL1-HSF). The spot dilution assay was carried out as described above using SC agar plates with glucose as sole carbon source to repress GAL1-HSF production, causing HSF-(1–583) to be the only source of HSF. For heat shock treatment, cells were grown at 25 °C to midlog phase, and 5 ml of cells were either kept at 25 °C (control) or at 41 °C (heat shock) for 16 min or 1 h (Fig. 6). Cells were then washed with ice-cold sterile glass-distilled water and stored at −80 °C, prior to extraction of RNA for RNA blotting experiments or proteins for immunoblotting.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainsGenotype (including plasmids)SourceParental strainPS145MAT a ade2–1 trp1 can1–100 leu2–3, -112 his3–11, -15 ura3 hsfΔ∷LEU2 Ycp50-GAL1-HSFRef. 59Sorger P.K.

The cultures were incubated at 23 or 41 °C for 15 min with constant agitation and then transferred to prewarmed Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes each containing 158 μCi of Tran35S-labelTM (ICN, CA). The tubes were further incubated for another 15 min at 23 or 41 °C. Cells were than washed once with ice-cold sterile glass-distilled H2O, and the pellet was frozen at −80 °C. Cell extracts were prepared as described below, and scintillation counting to determine total incorporation of label was carried out on a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Equivalent cpm of extracts were fractionated with SDS-PAGE (8%) using a Hoeffer gel electrophoresis system (SE400 model) at 4 °C. The gel was rinsed in glass-distilled H2O for 15 min, incubated in AutoFluorTM (National Diagnostics, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature, vacuum-dried, and exposed to Kodak BioMax film at −80 °C. A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system was used for quantitative assessment of labeled protein levels. Cell pellets containing between 5 and 15 A650 units of cells were resuspended in HEGN buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) or SDS harvest buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), with the following protease inhibitors added: 1 mm Pefabloc™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin. After the addition of an equal volume of acid-washed sterile glass beads (450–600 μm), the samples were lysed by rapid agitation at 4 °C in a microtube mixer (model MT-360; Tomy Tech, Inc.) at top speed for 2 min for four cycles with 2-min intervals on ice between each round. Extracts were clarified by microcentrifugation at 2500 × g for 6 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. The extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (8%), and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Standard immunoblot procedures were used, followed by protein detection using the ECL chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal antibody recognizing phosphoglycerate kinase was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and the following antibodies were generous gifts from the following sources: Anti-Ssa3/Ssa4 from Elizabeth Craig (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI); anti-hsp90 from Susan Lindquist (University of Chicago); anti-Ydj1 from Avrom Caplan (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine); anti-Sti1 from David Toft (Mayo Graduate School); anti-Cpr7 from Richard Gaber (Northwestern University); anti-Kar2 from James Gaut (University of Michigan Medical School). Lysates were prepared from cells (XLY34 and XLY30) grown to midlog phase in SC-His medium at 30 °C in LyB buffer (25Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using similar procedures as described above for immunoblot analysis. Isolation of His6-Hsp82 and associated polypeptides with nickel affinity chromatography was carried out exactly as described (25Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five ml of cells transformed with p413GPD-rGR and pYRP-GRElacZ were grown to midlog phase in SC-Ura-His medium at 30 °C, and 5 μl of absolute ethanol (control) or 10 mm DOC (deoxycorticosterone; Sigma) dissolved in ethanol were added to the cell culture (final concentration of 10 μm). The cells were further incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 1 h, harvested, washed once with sterile glass-distilled H2O, and resuspended in 700 μl of Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). 50 μl of chloroform and 50 μl of 0.1% SDS were added, and the cell suspension was vortex-mixed at top speed for 10 s followed by incubation at 30 °C for 5 min. 200 μl of 4 mg/ml ONPG in Z buffer was added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 3–7 min. 350 μl of 1 mNa2CO3 was added to stop the reactions. After clarification by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted, and A420 was measured within the linear response range. Specific β-galactosidase activity was calculated as follows: (dilution factor × 1000 ×A420)/(A650 × (volume of cells in ml) × (time of incubation in min)). Data shown are averages of three independent experiments with associated S.D. Previous work has demonstrated that expression of the two yeast Hsp90 genes HSC82 and HSP82 is markedly reduced in a strain expressing the HSF truncation mutant HSF (1–583), which displays a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype characterized by arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (9Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two points, however, suggest that loss of Hsp90 is not the sole determinant of this arrest. First, restoration of Hsp90 levels through introduction of the HSP82 gene on a high copy vector does not lead to growth rates at 37 °C comparable with wild type cells. Second, specific depletion of Hsp90 from cells wild type for HSF results in a mixed population of cells arrested in both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle at 37 °C, in contrast to the fairly uniform G2/M arrest observed in HSF (1–583). Therefore, we reasoned that there must be additional genes under the specific control of the HSF CTA that are required for growth at higher temperatures and that are poorly expressed in HSF-(1–583) cells. To begin to identify these additional targets, SDS-PAGE protein profiles of 35S pulse-labeled HSF and HSF (1–583) cell extracts was conducted under control and heat shock conditions (Fig.1 A). Heat shock induces the synthesis of a number of known Hsps, whose SDS-PAGE migration patterns have been well documented (50Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We were able to faithfully recapitulate these patterns, demonstrating robust heat shock induction of a number of proteins, including Hsp104 and the Hsp70 isoforms Ssa1, Ssa3, and Ssa4. Three proteins whose heat shock inducibility was diminished in HSF (1–583) cells compared with HSF wild type were tentatively identified (Fig. 1 A, bands a–c) by comparison with published heat shock protein profiles (39Shirayama M. Kawakami K."
https://openalex.org/W1967776802,"Targeting of protein modification enzymes is a key biochemical step to achieve specific and effective posttranslational modifications. Two alternatively spliced ZIP1 and ZIP2 proteins are described, which bind to both Kvbeta2 subunits of potassium channel and protein kinase C (PKC) zeta, thereby acting as a physical link in the assembly of PKCzeta-ZIP-potassium channel complexes. ZIP1 and ZIP2 differentially stimulate phosphorylation of Kvbeta2 by PKCzeta. They also interact to form heteromultimers, which allows for a hybrid stimulatory activity to PKCzeta. Finally, ZIP1 and ZIP2 coexist in the same cell type and are elevated differentially by neurotrophic factors. These results provide a mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKCzeta-targeted phosphorylation."

In general, base-base mispairs and a +1 insertion/deletion mispair were recognized better than intermediate sized insertion/deletion mispairs of 2–8 bases. Larger IDL mispairs (>8 bases) were recognized almost as well as the +1 IDL mispair. Recognition of mispairs by MSH2-MSH6 was influenced by sequence context, with the 6-nucleotide region surrounding the mispair being primarily responsible for influencing mispair recognition. Effects of sequences as far away as 15 nucleotides were also observed. Differential effects of ATP on the stability of MSH2-MSH6-mispair complexes suggested that base-base mispairs and the smaller IDL mispairs were recognized by a different binding mode than larger IDL mispairs, consistent with genetic experiments indicating that MSH2-MSH6 functions primarily in the repair of base-base and small IDL mispairs. The interaction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH2-MSH6 complex with mispaired bases was analyzed using gel mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance methods.

There are two basic types of mismatch repair pathways known. One type of mismatch repair recognizes and repairs mispaired bases in DNA that result from chemical damage to DNA and DNA precursors such as A:8-oxoguanine mispairs (reviewed in Ref.1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 367-405Google Scholar). The second type of mismatch repair recognizes and repairs a broad spectrum of mispaired bases in DNA that arise due to errors during DNA replication and as a result of genetic recombination (reviewed in Refs.2Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 4Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev.

The recent observation that genetic defects in the broad spectrum mismatch repair pathways underlie the development of both inherited and sporadic cancers has underscored the importance of understanding the mechanism of eukaryotic mismatch repair (5Peltomaki P.

At this time, the best understood broad spectrum mismatch repair pathway is the Escherichia coli MutHLS mismatch repair pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 367-405Google Scholar and 3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In this case, the methylation state of a GATC site, specifically a hemimethylated GATC site, governs the repair of a mispair such that the mispaired base on the unmethylated strand is repaired (11Laengle-Rouault F. Maenhaut-Michel G. Radman M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2009-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Lahue R.S. Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MutHLS system has been reconstituted using hemimethylated DNA substrates containing mismatches, MutH, MutL, MutS, and UvrD (helicase II) proteins along with DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, DNA ligase, single-strand DNA binding protein, and any one of the single-stranded DNA exonucleases, exo I, exo VII, or RecJ protein (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 4Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 13Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction involves mismatch-dependent nicking of the unmethylated strand at a hemimethylated GATC site by the MutH protein after the MutS protein binds to the site of a mispaired base (14Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No activity has been assigned to MutL, although it interacts with both MutS and UvrD, is required for activation of MutH and UvrD, and may enhance the specificity of MutS for mispaired bases (15Drotschmann K.

Excision initiates at the nick produced by MutH and requires UvrD and one of the single-stranded DNA exonucleases, exo I (3′-exo), exo VII (3′- and 5′-exo), RecJ protein (5′-exo), or possibly other exonucleases, depending on whether the nicked, unmethylated site is 5′ or 3′ to the mispair (18Viswanathan M. Lovett S.T. Genetics. 1998; 149: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once excision has occurred, resynthesis is mediated by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and single-strand DNA binding protein (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 367-405Google Scholar,3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 4Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Many studies of mismatch repair in eukaryotes have focused on the identification of genes encoding homologues of the E. coli MutS and MutL proteins. Six genes encoding MutS homologues, MSH1–6, have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 963-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reenan R.A.G.

Genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae have provided evidence as to the roles of each of these gene products. MSH1 is thought to function in the suppression of mutations in mitochondrial DNA (20Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MSH2, -3, and -6 are thought to function in mismatch repair in the nucleus (20Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D.

Studies characterizing the mutator phenotypes caused by different combinations of mutations in MSH2, -3, and -6 and experiments in which MSH2 was demonstrated to interact with both MSH3 and MSH6 have led to a model for how these three proteins might function in mismatch repair (2Kolodner R.

Mismatch repair was proposed to involve two different heterodimeric complexes, MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6, that have unique but overlapping mispair recognition specificity. These two complexes have been demonstrated in both S. cerevisiae and human cells, and their properties have been partially characterized. Both complexes have been demonstrated to bind to mispaired bases in DNA (30, 36, 43, 47–50, and information is available on the regions of MSH2 and MSH6 that interact and on the effect of nucleotide cofactors on MSH2-MSH6 mispair binding (51Alani E.

Little is known about the specific roles of the different subunits, although it seems possible that MSH3 and MSH6 modify the intrinsic mispair recognition properties of MSH2 (58Alani E. Chi N.W.

Much of what is known about the mispair recognition specificity of the MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6 complexes has been predicted from the analysis of the mutator phenotypes caused by mutations in the S. cerevisiae genes encoding these proteins. These studies predict that the MSH2-MSH6 complex recognizes both base-base and insertion/deletion mispairs, whereas the MSH2-MSH3 complex only recognizes insertion/deletion mispairs (23Marsischky G.T.

A. 1998; 95: 12404-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Studies of the effect of mutations in the MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 genes on the accumulation of mutations in microsatellite sequences as a function of repeat unit length have suggested that the relative role of the MSH2-MSH3 complex in mismatch repair relative to the MSH2-MSH6 complex increases with increasing size of the insertion/deletion mispair (61Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, the ability of mismatch repair to suppress the accumulation of mutations in microsatellite sequences appears to decrease with increasing repeat unit length, suggesting that both complexes may have limited ability to recognize larger insertion/deletion mispairs (61Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The use of mutator phenotypes to predict the mispair recognition specificity of the MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3 complexes is subject to some uncertainty. For example, a high rate of instability was observed in microsatellite instability experiments in wild type yeast cells when larger repeat units were analyzed, and mutations in MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 caused little or no destabilization as the repeat size increased (61Sia E.A. Kokoska R.J. Dominska M. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This could either mean that large insertion/deletion mispairs are not recognized by mismatch repair or that the mutagenic pathway acting on large repeats involves a mechanism that does not produce mispairs. A second point is that analysis of in vivo mutator phenotypes reflects the ability of a specific protein complex to interact with a mixture of substrates produced by replication errors, and under these conditions substrates produced at high levels may compete for the repair proteins with the substrate being analyzed leading to a reduced level of repair, particularly if specific repair proteins are in limiting concentration. Indeed, results from recent in vitro complementation experiments suggest that the MSH2-MSH6 complex might recognize insertion/deletion mispairs having as many as 12 unpaired bases which is larger than predicted from genetic experiments (48Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, in these experiments there was a high level of MSH-independent repair that may have precluded observing MSH2-MSH6- or MSH2-MSH3-dependent repair of the largest insertion/deletion mispair tested that contained 27 unpaired bases. Indeed, there is evidence that insertion/deletion mispairs containing as many as 26 or 38 unpaired bases can be acted on by MSH2-dependent mismatch repair, which is larger than predicted from mutator phenotype analysis (65Kirkpatrick D.T. Petes T.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 66Luhr B. Scheller J. Meyer P. Kramer W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3 complexes have been demonstrated to bind to mispaired bases in DNA; however, there is only a limited amount of information available describing the basic properties of mispair recognition by these complexes. Surprisingly, there is limited information available about the spectrum of mispaired bases recognized by the purified MSH2-MSH6 complex as greater effort has been focused on the mispair recognition properties of the MSH2-MSH3 complex. In the following study, we describe a detailed analysis of the mispair recognition properties of the S. cerevisiae MSH2-MSH6 complex. ATP, ADP, and poly(dI·dC) DNA were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Bovine serum albumin was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Acrylamide was purchased from Schwarz/Mann (ICN) (Cleveland, OH), and bisacrylamide was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. For chromatography, PBE94 and Q-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and ssDNA1 cellulose was made according to the method of Ref. 67Alberts B. Herrick G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 198-217Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar. For BIAcore analysis, P20 surfactant and streptavidin-coated SA sensor chips were obtained from BIAcore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Growth media, including synthetic minimal dropout media, were prepared as described previously (20Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Alani E. Chi N.W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Raffinose and galactose were purchased from Sigma. S. cerevisiae strain RKY2418, a msh2::hisG msh6::hisG derivative of the protease-deficient strain BJ5464, was constructed using hisG-URA3-hisG integration plasmids for MSH2 (pRDK351) and MSH6 (pRDK465), as described previously (47Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae strain RKY2421 was made by transforming RKY2418 with the plasmids pRDK568 and pRDK354. The 2-μm Gal1,10 expression vector pRDK568 (MSH6) was constructed by subcloning the 4.4-kilobase pair Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment containing the Gal1,10 promoter and the complete S. cerevisiae MSH6 coding from pEAE51 (47Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) into pRS425. The 2-μm Gal1,10 expression vector pRDK354 (MSH2), which is also known as pEN11, has been described previously (58Alani E. Chi N.W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). DNA duplexes used in this study were annealed by first heating 200 pmol of each oligonucleotide to 94 °C for 5 min in 100 μl of annealing buffer (0.5m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA) and then slow cooling over 2 h to 25 °C. DNA duplexes were then purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Waters GEN-PAK FAX column (Milford, MA) as described (68Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol.

Dystroglycan was originally characterized in skeletal muscle as an integral component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, which is critical for muscle cell viability. Although the dystroglycan complex has been well characterized in skeletal muscle, there is little information on the structural composition of the dystroglycan complex outside skeletal muscle. Here we have biochemically characterized the dystroglycan complex in lung and kidney. We demonstrate that the presence of sarcoglycans and sarcospan in lung reflects association with dystroglycan in the smooth muscle. The smooth muscle dystroglycan complex in lung, composed of dystroglycan, dystrophin/utrophin, β-, δ-, ε-sarcoglycan, and sarcospan, can be biochemically separated from epithelial dystroglycan, which is not associated with any of the known sarcoglycans or sarcospan. Similarly, dystroglycan in kidney epithelial cells is not associated with any of the sarcoglycans or sarcospan. Thus, our data demonstrate that there are distinct dystroglycan complexes in non-skeletal muscle organs as follows: one from smooth muscle, which is associated with sarcoglycans forming a similar complex as in skeletal muscle, and one from epithelial cells.

These two proteins were originally isolated from skeletal muscle as components of a large oligomeric complex further comprised of dystrophin, the syntrophin, and sarcoglycan complexes and the recently identified protein sarcospan (1Ervasti J.M.

In skeletal muscle, α-dystroglycan binds to the extracellular matrix component laminin α2-chain (6Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13729-13732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the intracellular domain of β-dystroglycan binds to the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin (7Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, dystroglycan is thought to act as a transmembrane link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton, and this linkage seems to be crucial for maintaining normal function (4Lim L.E.

In addition, a defect in any of the sarcoglycans results in specific loss of the sarcoglycan-sarcospan subcomplex, destabilization of α-dystroglycan, and eventually muscle cell death (4Lim L.E. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Many of the dystroglycan-associated proteins found in skeletal and cardiac muscle are also expressed in other tissues. For example, β- and δ-sarcoglycan, sarcospan, and the syntrophins are all at the RNA level expressed in tissues other than skeletal and cardiac muscle (3Froehner S.C. Adams M.E. Peters M.F. Gee S.H.

Dystroglycan is expressed at high levels in many cell types and is particularly prominent on the basal side of epithelial cells facing basement membranes (18Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M.

Moreover, α-dystroglycan binds laminin-1, agrin, and perlecan (24Gee S.H. Blacher R.W. Douville P.J. Provost P.R. Yurchenco P.D. Carbonetto S. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 23: 163-174Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, different dystroglycan complexes may form in different tissues implying that dystroglycan may have important roles outside skeletal muscle. Indeed, dystroglycan has been implicated as a laminin/agrin receptor involved in epithelial cell development, basement membrane formation, and synaptogenesis (19Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Williamson R.A. Henry M.D. Daniels K.J. Hrstka R.F.

Recently, it was also demonstrated that dystroglycan serves as a receptor for both lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (34Cao W. Henry M.D. Borrow P. Yamada H. Elder J.H. Ravkov E.V. Nichol S.T. Compans R.W. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. Science. 1998; 11: 2079-2081Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium leprae (35Rambukkana A. Yamada H. Zanazzi G. Mathus T. Salzer J.L. Yurchenco P. Campbell K.P. Fischetti V.A. Science. 1998; 22: 2076-2079Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The roles of the dystroglycan-associated proteins outside skeletal muscle, however, have remained elusive. To elucidate potential functional roles, a first important step includes the determination of the cellular localization of these proteins. Specifically, are the dystroglycan-associated proteins that are present in non-skeletal muscle organs derived from smooth muscle, epithelial cells, or both? ε-Sarcoglycan, a homologue of α-sarcoglycan, was recently identified and shown to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues including epithelial cells (36Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37McNally E.M. Ly C.T. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ε-Sarcoglycan has also been identified as an integral component of the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex 1V. Straub and K. P. Campbell, unpublished data. and could also be part of an epithelial dystroglycan complex, possibly along with β- and δ-sarcoglycan and sarcospan. Although dystroglycan has been shown to play important roles outside skeletal muscle, the dystroglycan complex from other cell types is only partially characterized. In peripheral nerve, the molecular mass of α-dystroglycan is 120 kDa in contrast to 156 kDa in skeletal muscle (38Yamada H. Shimizu T. Tanaka T. Campbell K.P. Matsumura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of α-dystroglycan in epithelial cells has remained elusive. A 120-kDa band has been identified in lung (18Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether the 120-kDa dystroglycan is derived from epithelial cells or smooth muscle. Moreover, α-dystroglycan is believed to act as a laminin-1 receptor involved in the development of kidney epithelial cells (19Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, a direct association between kidney α-dystroglycan and laminin-1 has not been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of the sarcoglycans and sarcospan in lung reflects association with dystroglycan in the smooth muscle within lung, and we show that epithelial dystroglycan is not associated with any of the known sarcoglycans and can be separated from the smooth muscle dystroglycan complex. Dystroglycan, β-sarcoglycan, δ-sarcoglycan, ε-sarcoglycan, and sarcospan are all part of a smooth muscle complex, whereas neither α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan nor sarcospan are expressed in epithelial cells from lung and kidney. ε-Sarcoglycan, on the other hand, is expressed in epithelial cells (36Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but is not complexed with dystroglycan, as revealed by sucrose gradient fractionation. We have also partially characterized dystroglycan from kidney, an organ mainly composed of epithelial cells. We found that the major part of α-dystroglycan from adult kidney has a molecular mass of 156 kDa, whereas the major part of α-dystroglycan from fetal kidney has a molecular mass of 120 kDa. Both forms were shown to bind laminin-1. Taken together, our results demonstrate a distinct smooth muscle dystroglycan complex and a distinct epithelial dystroglycan complex, and this information will be useful for further investigation of dystroglycan function. New Zealand White rabbits were from Knapp Creek Farms (Amana, IA). Mice (C57BL/10) were bred at the University of Iowa from stocks originally obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). F1B control and BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters were obtained from BioBreeders (Fitchburg, MA). All animals were kept in the animal care unit of the University of Iowa College of Medicine according to the animal care guidelines. Total RNA from rabbit kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle was extracted using RNAzol B (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer's specifications. 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.25% agarose gel containing 5% formaldehyde. Equal loading was verified by ethidium bromide visualization of the RNA, which was subsequently transferred to Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Preparation of KCl-washed membranes from adult rabbit kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle were described previously (45Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Membranes were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 3–12% linear gradients and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (46Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Immunoblot staining was performed as described previously (45Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Tissues (1–5 g) were solubilized in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl containing 1% digitonin in the presence of pepstatin A (0.6 μg/ml), aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), benzamidine (0.75 mm), calpain inhibitor I (5 nm), and calpeptin (5 nm). The solubilized proteins were circulated overnight at 4 °C on an 8-ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose column (Vector Laboratories). The columns were washed with 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin and eluted with 0.3m N-acetylglucosamine in 50 mmTris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin. The WGA eluate was incubated with protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-agarose for 1 h, to remove contaminating immunoglobulins. The protein G beads were spun down, and the supernatant was diluted to 100 mm NaCl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% digitonin and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin. The column was eluted with a gradient of 100–750 mm NaCl buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% digitonin, and 4-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing dystroglycan were pooled and concentrated to 400 μl using Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon). The samples were applied to a 5–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged with a Beckman VTi65.1 vertical rotor at 200,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated into 800-μl fractions, which were immunoblotted as described (45Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mouse EHS laminin (laminin-1) was generously provided by Dr. Hynda K. Kleinman at the National Institutes of Health. Laminin-1 was biotinylated with NHS-biotin (Vector Laboratories) in a molar ratio of 1:750–1000 in reaction buffer 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The reaction was quenched, and unbound biotin was removed by dialysis against Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Dystroglycan containing sucrose gradient fractions were separated on 3–12% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (45Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The blots were blocked in laminin binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.6) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and subsequently washed for 90 min in laminin binding buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TLBB). Blots were incubated in TLBB containing 3% bovine serum albumin and biotinylated laminin-1 for 8 h and washed in TLBB for 20 min. After incubation with ABC reagents (Vector Laboratories), the blots were washed in TLBB for 20 min and developed in 4-chloro-1-naphthol and H2O2. For immunofluorescence analysis, 8-μm cryosections were prepared from C57BL/10 wild type mouse lungs, kidneys, and skeletal muscle, and F1B and BIO 14.6 hamster lungs, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. All procedures were performed at room temperature. Sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated with the primary antibodies for 90 min or overnight. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) for 90 min and then mounted with Vectashield mounting medium and observed under a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope. In order to analyze which proteins are associated with dystroglycan in kidney and lung, we first screened for the presence of sarcoglycan mRNAs in these organs. As expected, the 1.6-kb α-sarcoglycan transcript was only detected in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). The previously characterized 4.4- and 3.0-kb transcripts representing β- sarcoglycan (10Lim L.E.

Pathol. 1998; 153: 1623-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) of 9.5, 4.3, 2.3, and 1.4 kb (Fig. 1). In kidney and lung the 9.5-kb δ-sarcoglycan transcript appeared to be the most prominent. γ-Sarcoglycan mRNAs of 2.5 and 1.7 kb were faintly expressed in kidney, moderately in lung, and strongly in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). Sarcospan mRNA has been shown to be expressed in several organs (5Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and the 4.5-kb transcript could also be detected in kidney and lung (Fig. 1). In contrast to the sarcoglycan and sarcospan mRNAs, which are all more highly expressed in skeletal muscle than kidney and lung, an equal intensity of the 5.8-kb dystroglycan transcript was detected in the three organs (Fig. 1). The 1.8-kb ε-sarcoglycan mRNA was highly expressed in kidney and lung (Fig. 1). ε-Sarcoglycan was also detected in skeletal muscle but at a lower level. Similarly, the 13-kb utrophin transcript was also detected in kidney and lung and at a lower level in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). Because it is possible that transcripts are present in cells without being translated, we next analyzed whether the sarcoglycan protein products were expressed in the kidney and lung. KCl-washed membranes from kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle were screened for protein expression. Although the β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan transcripts were readily expressed in the kidney, we were not able to detect their corresponding polypeptides (Fig. 1). In the lung, however, the 43-kDa β-sarcoglycan, the 35-kDa γ-sarcoglycan, and the 35-kDa δ-sarcoglycans were clearly detectable (Fig. 1). Likewise, the 25-kDa sarcospan was not present in the kidney but was present in the lung (Fig. 1). In contrast, dystroglycan with a molecular mass of 156 kDa, the 46-kDa ε-sarcoglycan, and the 395-kDa utrophin were all readily detected in kidney and lung (Fig. 1). Previous reports have shown that full-length dystrophin is present in the smooth muscle of kidney but not epithelial cells (16Durbeej M. Jung D. Hjalt T. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 47Lidow H.G.W. Kunkel L.M. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1543-1551PubMed Google Scholar). In the lung, dystrophin is exclusively expressed in smooth muscle (48Houzelstein D. Lyons G.E. Chamberlain J.E. Buckingham M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The adult lung is mainly composed of epithelial cells and smooth muscle, whereas the kidney is largely composed of epithelial cells. Thus, the expression data suggest that the presence of dystroglycan, β-sarcoglycan, γ/δ-sarcoglycan, ε-sarcoglycan, sarcospan, and utrophin/dystrophin in lung could represent the dystroglycan complex from smooth muscle. Likewise, the presence of dystroglycan, ε-sarcoglycan, and utrophin in the kidney could represent an epithelial complex. To test that hypothesis we used immunofluorescence analysis and sucrose gradient fractionation to determine whether proteins observed by Western blot we"

In early Xenopus embryos, the transforming growth factor-β member activin induces the gene Mix.2 by stimulating the formation of a multiprotein complex, activin-responsive factor (ARF). This complex contains Smad2 or Smad3, Smad4, and a novel forkhead transcription factor, FAST-1, and binds to an enhancer (activin-responsive element; ARE) that confers activin regulation of Mix.2 transcription. Both FAST-1 and Smads can bind directly to the ARE; we have investigated 1) the role of FAST-1 and Smad DNA binding sites in ARF recognition of the ARE, 2) the contributions of FAST-1 and Smad binding to ARF binding in vitro and to ARE regulation in early Xenopus embryos, 3) the extent to which different Smads can replace Smad4 in regulation of the ARE. We find that ARF binds to ARE through both FAST-1 and Smad binding sites. FAST-1 recognition of the ARE is essential both for ARF binding in vitro and activin regulation in vivo. In contrast, Smad binding of ARE is unnecessary for ARF binding or activin regulation but does enhance the binding and regulatory activity of ARF. Also, Smad3 can partially substitute for Smad4 in the regulation of the ARE. These observations elucidate how broadly expressed signal transducers (Smads) regulate a developmentally specific transcriptional response in conjunction with a temporally restricted transcription factor, FAST-1.

TGF-β factors transduce signals via type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors, and their biological effect is achieved in part by transcriptional regulation of target genes (3Attisano L.

Ligand induces formation of a heteromeric receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor by the type II receptor. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified Smad proteins as intracellular signal transducers of TGF-β signaling (7Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2443-2453Crossref Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Smad proteins contain two conserved domains, the N-terminal MH1 domain and the C-terminal MH2 domain, separated by a divergent, proline-rich linker region. Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by cognate type I receptor in response to activin/TGF-β subfamily members at a carboxyl-terminal SS X S motif in their MH2 domains. The receptor-regulated Smads bring a common signal mediator Smad4 into the nucleus, and the heteromeric complex activates target gene expression (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In early Xenopus embryos, activin, a TGF-β superfamily member, induces an early meso-endodermal response gene, Mix.2 (9Vize P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An activin-induced multiprotein complex, activin-responsive factor (ARF), binds to an enhancer (activin-responsive element; ARE) that confers activin regulation of Mix.2 transcription (10Huang H.C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ARF has been shown to be composed of Smad2, Smad4, and a novel forkhead DNA binding domain transcription factor, FAST-1 (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 11Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 12Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). FAST-1 is a nuclear protein containing an N-terminal forkhead DNA binding domain and a C-terminal Smad interaction domain that is responsible for activin-regulated association with the Smads (12Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Smad3, like Smad2, can interact with the FAST-1 SID (13Weisberg E. Winnier G.E. Chen X. Farnsworth C. Hogan B.L.M. Whitman M. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The extent to which Smad2 or Smad3 participates in ARF complex formation in vivo has not been determined. mRNA expression of Xenopus FAST-1, as well as of a mouse FAST-1 homologue referred to as Fast1 or FAST-2, is restricted to early embryogenesis (11Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 13Weisberg E. Winnier G.E. Chen X. Farnsworth C. Hogan B.L.M. Whitman M. Mech.

FAST expression is essential for activin/TGF-β regulation of the ARE; cells that do not express FAST will not activate an ARE luciferase reporter in response to activin/TGF-β stimulation but will do so when transfected with cDNA encoding either FAST-1 or Fast1/FAST-2 (13Weisberg E. Winnier G.E. Chen X. Farnsworth C. Hogan B.L.M. Whitman M. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a constitutively activated form of FAST-1, in which the SID has been replaced by a VP16 transcriptional activation domain, is sufficient to specifically and directly induce the full range of early mesodermal genes induced by activin. 2M. Watanabe and M. Whitman, submitted for publication. These observations indicate that the DNA binding activity of FAST-1 can specifically recognize a range of activin-responsive promoters in the early embryo. However, overexpression of full-length FAST-1 in the absence of a TGF-β signal does not activate gene expression,2suggesting that FAST-1 either lacks a transcriptional activation domain or that the full-length protein is negatively regulated with respect to DNA binding. Smad4 contains an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain in its C-terminal half. It may, therefore, be recruitment of Smad4 into the ARF complex that makes the complex transcriptionally active (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of Smad4 is necessary to enhance stability of DNA binding by ARF, suggesting a dual role for Smad4 in transcriptional regulation by ARF (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast, the primary role of Smad2 may be interaction with the upstream regulatory apparatus. Smad2 associates with and is phosphorylated by the type I receptor ActRIB (17Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar); this phosphorylation stimulates a direct association of Smad2, through its MH2 domain, with both FAST-1 and Smad4 (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 12Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M.

There is no evidence that Smad4 can associate directly with FAST-1. Smad2 may therefore serve as an adapter, providing a receptor-regulated linkage between Smad4 and FAST-1. Smad3, which has an MH2 domain very similar to that of Smad2, can also participate in the ARF complex (12Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but its functional role in the complex has not been characterized. Recently, intrinsic DNA binding activity has been reported for the MH1 domains of Mad, the Drosophila homologue of Smad1, Smad3, and Smad4 (19Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J.

Smad binding sequences have been identified in the promoter regions of a variety of TGF-β superfamily-responsive genes, including the Dpp-responsive gene vestigial, the TGF-β-responsive PAI-1 and collagenase genes, and the mouse goosecoid gene (14Labbe E.

In general, these sites appear to be necessary for TGF-β responsiveness, although in the case of an element from the collagenase promoter a Smad3/4 binding site is not necessary for TGF-β regulation (21Yingling J. Datto M. Wong C. Frederick J. Liberati N. Wang X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While concatemerized Smad3/4 binding sites have been shown to be sufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness on a reporter (20Zawel L. Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Kern S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 26Vindevoghel L. Lechleidier R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is not clear that Smads act on endogenous promoters in the absence of interaction with additional transcription factors. FAST-1 alone can bind tightly to the ARE; however, a Smad3/Smad4 binding site has also been identified in the ARE (25Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 27Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), raising the question of the relative contribution of FAST-1 and Smads to recognition and activation of the ARE. In Xenopus embryos, FAST-1 and the Smads bind to the ARE as a preformed complex, ARF; we have now investigated the relative importance of FAST-1 and Smad binding in the recognition of ARE by ARF formed in vivo as well as for transcriptional regulation of the ARE by activin in vivo. FAST-1 and Smad4 or Smad3, but not Smad2, bind to distinct sites within the ARE, and ARE binding by the full ARF complex formed in vivo in response to an activin signal accurately reflects the binding activities of its DNA binding components, FAST-1 and Smad4. The FAST-1 binding site is essential for regulation of this element by TGF-β signaling both in cultured cells and in the Xenopus embryo; the Smad binding site enhances responsiveness but is not essential for regulation. The DNA binding activity of Smad4 is localized to the MH1 domain, which appears to have additional functions in ARF stabilization. We also find that high level expression of Smad3 can significantly substitute for Smad4 in the FAST-1-dependent activation of the ARE. Our observations provide a basis for understanding how broadly expressed signal transducers (Smads) participate in the regulation of a developmentally specific transcriptional response in conjunction with a temporally restricted transcription factor, FAST-1. Sequences of upper strands are as follows. ARE is 5′-ACAGACACCT TATCTGCTGC CCTAAAATGT GTATTCCATG GAAATGTCTG CCCTTCTCTC CAGGA-3′ (boldface letters are sequences added to the 50-bp ARE) (10Huang H.C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). mFB-ARE is 5′-ACAGACACCT TATCTGCTGC CCTAAAAT c T GTATTCCATG GAAATGTCTG CCCTTCTCTC CAGGA -3′ (boldface, lowercase letter is a nucleotide substituted from ARE). mSB-ARE is 5′-ACAGACACCT TATCTGCTGC CCTAAAATGT GTATTCCATG GAAAT a T a T a t CCTTCTCTC CAGGA-3′ (boldface, lowercase letters are nucleotides substituted from ARE). ARE-L is 5′-ACAGACACCT TATCTGCTGC CCTAAAATGT GTATTCCATG G-3′. ARE-R is 5′-GTATTCCATG GAAATGTCTG CCCTTCTCTC CAGGA-3′. GST fusion constructs are in pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-Smad2 MH1 contains codons 1–186 of Xenopus Smad2, and GST-Smad3 MH1 contains codons 12–169 of human Smad3. Smad4 fusion constructs contain regions of mouse Smad4. GST-Smad4 MH1 contains codons 4–147, GST-Smad4 MH1 (R100T) contains codons 4–147 with an arginine 100 to threonine missense mutation, GST-Smad4 ΔMH1 contains codons 178–552, and GST-Smad4 contains codons 4–552. GST-FAST-1 FH contains codons 40–365 of Xenopus FAST-1. Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. 0.1–0.25 pm32P-labeled probe was used for each DNA binding assay. DNA binding assays using Xenopus extracts were performed as described previously (10Huang H.C. Murtaugh L.C. Vize P.D. Whitman M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays using GST fusion proteins were performed in binding buffer containing 25 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 35 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml poly(dA-dT)·(dA-dT), and complexes were separated in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE. Methylation interference assays were performed as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 12.3.1-12.3.6Google Scholar). Briefly, ARE oligonucleotide was single end-labeled with 32P and methylated with DMS. After electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), free probes and protein-bound probes were recovered and cleaved with piperidine. Equal cpm of free probes and protein-bound probes were separated in 15% sequencing gels. A luciferase reporter vector was generated by subcloning the luciferase coding region (from Hin dIII to Sal I) of pGL3 promoter (Promega) between Eco RI and Hpa I sites of pBCAT (9Vize P. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ARE luciferase reporter constructs were generated by subcloning a single copy of wild type or mutant ARE oligonucleotides into Hin dIII site of the reporter vector, and the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. All mammalian expression constructs are in pCS2+ or pCS2+MT vectors. Flag-FAST-1 H208 contains codons 61–518 of Xenopus FAST-1. 6Myc-Smad2 and 6Myc-Smad3 contain codons 2–467 and 12–424 of human Smad2 and Smad3, respectively. 6Myc-Smad4 and 6Myc-Smad4 MH2 contain codons 4–552 and codons 233–552 of mouse Smad4, respectively. SW480.7 cells were transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with ARE reporters, Flag-FAST-1 H208, 6Myc-Smads, ActRIB*, pCS2+βGal, and pCS2+ vector to maintain a constant total amount of DNA. Cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h before harvest. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized with β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency. To test the ARE binding by Smad proteins proposed to function in activin/TGF-β signal transduction, bacterial GST fusion proteins containing regions of Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 were generated, and binding of the fusion proteins to double-stranded ARE oligonucleotide probe was examined by EMSA. A Smad4 MH1 domain fusion protein bound to ARE (Fig., 1, lanes 3–5), while a mutant Smad4 MH1 fusion protein with an amino acid substitution of Arg100 to Thr (Smad4 MH1 R100T) or a mutant Smad4 fusion protein missing the MH1 domain (Smad4 ΔMH1) failed to bind to ARE (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8 and 12–14). A full-length Smad4 fusion protein (Smad4) caused retarded migration of ARE; however, the shifted probe did not resolve as a discrete band (Fig. 1, lanes 9–11). Poor resolution of full-length Smad4 fusion protein shifted probe has also been reported for an oligonucleotide containing Smad binding sequence from the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene (23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P.t. Huet S. Gauthier J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). A Smad3 MH1 domain fusion protein (Smad3 MH1) also bound to ARE (Fig. 1, lanes 18–20). A Smad2 MH1 domain fusion protein (Smad2 MH1) and fusion proteins containing different regions of Smad2 (MH1 plus linker, full-length, or linker plus MH2) all failed to bind to ARE (Fig. 1, lanes 15–17, data not shown). The results indicate, consistent with other recent reports (20Zawel L. Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Kern S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P.t. Huet S. Gauthier J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), that the MH1 domains of Smad3 and Smad4, but not Smad2, directly bind to the ARE. DMS methylation interference assays were performed to permit a comparison of the sites on the ARE necessary for binding of purified Smads and FAST-1 with those necessary for binding of ARF formed in response to an activin signal in early embryos. FAST-1 overexpressed in Xenopus embryos bound to ARE probe, and methylation interference identified the sequence ATGTGTATTC as being critical for binding (Fig. 2, A, lanes 1–4, and B). An identical interference pattern was obtained with GST-FAST-1 fusion protein purified from Escherichia coli (data not shown). We refer to this sequence as the FAST-1 binding site. A single base substitution (G to C) in this sequence has previously been shown to eliminate FAST-1 and ARF binding to the ARE (11Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), and this site is consistent with a consensus binding site reported for a human FAST-1 homologue (TGT(G/T)(T/G)ATT) (27Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Methylation interference confirmed the sequence GTCTGCCC as being critical for binding of the Smad4 MH1 fusion protein to ARE probe (Fig.2, A, lanes 5–8, and B). The Smad3 MH1 fusion protein bound to the same sequence (data not shown, summarized in Fig. 2 B). We refer to this sequence as the Smad binding site of the ARE. The binding region for Smads in ARE is generally consistent with the Smad binding sites observed in other vertebrate promoters (GTCT) (21Yingling J. Datto M. Wong C. Frederick J. Liberati N. Wang X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Dijke P.t. Huet S. Gauthier J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ARE recognition by the ARF complex that is formed in embryos in response to activin stimulation reflects the binding specificities of its components, methylation interference analysis of ARF binding to ARE probe was performed. The methylation interference pattern for ARF binding to ARE probe was roughly a composite of the patterns observed for the FAST-1 and the Smad3/4 MH1 domains alone (Fig. 2, A, lanes 9–12, and B), indicating that the complex formed in vivo uses the DNA binding activities of both FAST-1 and Smad3/4 in target site recognition. To assess the relative contributions of DNA binding of Smad and FAST-1 to ARF binding of the ARE, ARE probes mutated in the FAST-1 or Smad binding sites were generated and tested in EMSA (Fig. 3 A, see “Experimental Procedures”). A GST-FAST-1 forkhead domain fusion protein (FAST-1 FH) bound to mutant ARE probes in which the Smad binding site was mutated (mSB-ARE) or deleted (ARE-L) but failed to bind to mutant ARE probes in which the FAST-1 binding site was mutated (mFB-ARE) or deleted (ARE-R) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–10). FAST-1 overexpressed in Xenopus embryos showed the same binding sequence specificity as did the FAST-1 FH fusion protein (data not shown). The Smad4 MH1 fusion protein bound to the FAST-1 binding site altered probes (mFB-ARE and ARE-R) but failed to bind to the Smad binding site altered probes (mSB-ARE and ARE-L) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11–15). The Smad3 MH1 fusion protein showed the same binding sequence specificity as did the Smad4 MH1 fusion protein (data not shown). The results confirm the methylation interference data indicating that FAST-1 and Smad3/4 bind to spatially and functionally separate sites in the ARE. The relative importance of the FAST-1 binding site and the Smad binding site for binding of the ARF complex to the ARE was examined by comparison of ARF binding to wild type and mutant ARE probes. Consistent with previous work (11Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), ARF failed to bind to the mFB-ARE probe, to which FAST-1 also failed to bind (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). ARF also failed to bind to ARE-R probe, which lacks the FAST-1 binding site (Fig. 3 C, lane 10). ARF binding to mSB-ARE or to ARE-L probe was reduced but not completely abolished compared with ARF binding to wild type ARE probe (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6 and 8). ARF binding to mSB-ARE or ARE-L probe was 3- and 5-fold less efficient, respectively, than ARF binding to wild type ARE probe. These results indicate that the FAST-1 binding site is absolutely required for ARF recognition of the ARE and that the Smad binding site enhances this recognition but is not essential. The relative contributions of FAST-1 binding and Smad4/Smad3 binding to the total affinity of ARF for ARE were examined by comparing wild type or mutant AREs as competitors of ARF binding to ARE. ARF binding to wild type ARE probe was competed by ARE, mSB-ARE, and ARE-L competitors (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3–14), while ARE-R oligonucleotide failed to reduce the ARF binding to ARE probe at 50-fold molar excess (Fig. 3 D, lanes 15–18). Binding of the Smad4 MH1 fusion protein to ARE was reduced by ARE-R competitor in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Competition by wild type or mutant AREs was quantitated and is presented in Fig. 3 E. Mutant AREs that lack the Smad binding site or region but contain the FAST-1 binding site (mSB-ARE, ARE-L) compete roughly 5-fold less well than does wild type ARE for ARF binding. This observation indicates that in the context of the ARF complex, Smad binding enhances the affinity of the complex for its target on the order of 5-fold. In the absence of the FAST-1 binding site (ARE-R), competition for ARF binding is not observed, confirming the observations with mutant probes (Fig.3 C) that FAST-1 binding is essential for ARF binding of ARE. We next examined the relative importance of the FAST-1 and Smad binding sites in trans-activation of the ARE in embryos and cultured cells using luciferase reporter constructs. In Xenopus embryos, the response of an ARE-luciferase reporter (ARE-Lux) to activin RNA injection was significantly greater than that of mSB-ARE-Lux (Fig.4 A), indicating that the Smad binding site contributes to the endogenous response to mesoderm-inducing signals, but is not required for this responsiveness. mFB-ARE-Lux did not respond to activin stimulation in embryos, indicating that FAST-1 binding is essential for activin responsiveness in vivo. Similar results were obtained when wild type or mutant ARE-Lux reporter constructs were expressed in isolated animal caps in the presence or absence of activin stimulation (Fig.4 B). We then examined trans-activation of wild type and mutant ARE reporters in the presence and in the absence of FAST-1 and Smad4. Smad4-deficient cell lines SW480.7 and MDA-MB-468 also lack detectable endogenous FAST-like activity. In SW480.7 cells, ARE-Lux did not respond to transfection of ActRIB*, a constitutively active form of activin type IB receptor, or to transfection of Smad4/ActRIB* (data not shown), confirming previous reports that FAST-1 is required for the trans-activation of ARE (8Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 13Weisberg E. Winnier G.E. Chen X. Farnsworth C. Hogan B.L.M. Whitman M. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transfection of FAST-1/Smad4 caused a basal activation of ARE-Lux, and the activation of ARE-Lux was further increased by co-transfection of ActRIB* (Fig. 4 C). Although the level of response was significantly reduced compared with that of ARE-Lux, transfection of FAST-1/Smad4/ActRIB* induced activation of mSB-ARE-Lux. In contrast, mFB-ARE-Lux did not respond to transfection of FAST-1/Smad4/ActRIB*. The increase in response by transfection of FAST-1/Smad4/ActRIB* over the response observed by transfection of FAST-1/ActRIB* was significantly greater with ARE-Lux (80-fold) than with mSB-ARE-Lux (16-fold). The results both from embryos and SW480.7 cells are consistent with the data obtained from in vitro ARE binding assays, indicating that the FAST-1 binding site is absolutely required for trans-activation of the ARE by activin signaling, and Smad DNA binding can enhance this trans-activation. Mutation of the Smad binding site of ARE provides one approach to assessing the role of Smad4 DNA binding in ARF recognition of the ARE. A complementary approach is to eliminate the DNA binding domain of Smad4 and assess how this affects ARF activation of the ARE. Transfection of Smad4 lacking the MH1 domain and much of the linker domain (Smad4 MH2) resulted in activation of ARE-Lux over the control lacking Smad4, but the response of ARE-Lux to expression of Smad4 MH2 was significantly smaller than the response to full-length Smad4 (Fig.4 D). Smad4 MH2 caused a similar -fold activation of ARE-Lux and mSB"

All known HA synthases utilize UDP-sugar precursors. Previous reports describing the HA synthase enzymes from Streptococcus bacteria and mammals, however, did not agree on the molecular directionality of polymer elongation. We show here that a HA synthase, PmHAS, from Gram-negative P. multocida bacteria polymerizes the HA chain by the addition of sugar units to the nonreducing terminus. Recombinant PmHAS will elongate exogenous HA oligosaccharide acceptors to form long polymers in vitro; thus far no other HA synthase has displayed this capability. The directionality of synthesis was established definitively by testing the ability of PmHAS to elongate defined oligosaccharide derivatives. Analysis of the initial stages of synthesis demonstrated that PmHAS added single monosaccharide units sequentially. Apparently the fidelity of the individual sugar transfer reactions is sufficient to generate the authentic repeating structure of HA. Therefore, simultaneous addition of disaccharide block units is not required as hypothesized in some recent models of polysaccharide biosynthesis. PmHAS appears distinct from other known HA synthases based on differences in sequence, topology in the membrane, and putative reaction mechanism.

HA1 is a linear polysaccharide of the glycosaminoglycan class composed of up to thousands of β(1,4)GlcUA-β(1,3)GlcNAc repeats. In vertebrates, HA is a major structural element of the extracellular matrix and plays roles in adhesion and recognition (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). HA has a high negative charge density and numerous hydroxyl groups; therefore, the molecule assumes an extended, hydrated conformation in solution. The viscoelastic properties of cartilage and synovial fluid are in part the result of the physical properties of the HA polysaccharide. HA also interacts with proteins such as CD44, RHAMM, and fibrinogen, thereby influencing many natural processes such as angiogenesis, cancer, cell motility, wound healing, and cell adhesion (2Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). HA is also made by certain microbes. Some bacterial pathogens, namely Gram-negative Pasteurella multocida Type A and Gram-positive Streptococcus Group A and C, produce extracellular HA capsules (3Carter G.R. Annau E. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1953; 14: 475-478PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kass E.H. Seastone C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); this coating protects the microbes from host defenses including complement and phagocytosis (5Harmon B.G. Glisson J.R. Latimer K.S.

A. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) directs the algal host cells to produce a HA surface coating early in infection, but the biological role of HA in the viral life cycle is not yet known (7DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The various HA synthases, the enzymes that polymerize HA, utilize UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc sugar nucleotide precursors in the presence of a divalent Mn2+ or Mg2+ ion (7DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L. Science. 1997; 278: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

The HA synthase activity from all sources is localized in the membrane fraction. The enzymes were all identified by molecular genetic means due to the innate problems of membrane protein purification. In all cases, a single species of polypeptide catalyzes the transfer of two distinct sugars; in contrast, the vast majority of other known glycosyltransferases transfer only one monosaccharide. HasA (or SpHAS) from Group A Streptococcus pyogenes was the first HA synthase to be described at the molecular level (10DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The various vertebrate homologs (Xenopus frog DG42 or XlHAS1; murine and human HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) and the viral enzyme, A98R, are quite similar at the amino acid level to certain regions of the HasA polypeptide chain (∼30% identity overall). At least 7 short motifs (5–9 residues) interspersed throughout these enzymes are identical or quite conserved. The evolutionary relationship among these HA synthases from such dissimilar sources is not clear at present. The enzymes are predicted to have a similar overall topology in the bilayer; membrane-associated regions at the amino and the carboxyl termini flank a large cytoplasmic central domain (∼200 amino acids; reviewed in Ref. 8Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region appears to contain two transmembrane segments, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region appears to contain three to five membrane-associated or transmembrane segments depending on the species. Very little of these HAS polypeptide chains are expected to be exposed to the outside of the cell. With respect to the reaction pathway utilized by this group of enzymes, mixed findings have been reported from indirect experiments. The Group A streptococcal enzyme was reported to add sugars to the nonreducing terminus of the growing chain as determined by selective labeling and degradation studies (11Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, however, two laboratories working with the enzyme preparations from mammalian cells concluded that the new sugars were added to the reducing end of the nascent chain (12Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In comparing these various studies, the analysis of the enzymatically released sugars from the streptococcal system added more rigorous support for their interpretation (11Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another type of experiment, HA made in mammalian cells was reported to have a covalently attached UDP group as measured by an incorporation of low amounts of radioactivity derived from 32P-labeled UDP-sugar into an anionic polymer (14Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These data implied that the last sugar was transferred to the reducing end of the polymer. Thus it remains unclear if these rather similar HAS polypeptides from vertebrates and streptococci actually utilize different reaction pathways. We recently reported the identification and molecular cloning of a unique HA synthase, PmHAS, from the fowl cholera pathogen, Type A P. multocida (15DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression of this single 972-residue protein allowed the Escherichia coli host cells to produce HA capsules in vivo; normally E. coli does not make HA. Overall, the deduced PmHAS sequence is very different from the other known HA synthases. There appear to be only two short potential sequence motifs ((D/N)DGS(S/T); DSD(D/T)Y) in common between PmHAS and Group A HasA. Instead, a portion of the central region of the new enzyme is more homologous to the amino termini of other bacterial glycosyltransferases that produce different capsular polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides. Furthermore, even though PmHAS is about twice as long as any other HAS enzyme, it only has two predicted transmembrane-spanning helices separated by ∼320 residues. Thus at least a third of the polypeptide is predicted not to be in the cytoplasm. In this report, definitive proof is presented that PmHAS adds sugars to the nonreducing end of the growing polymer chain, in contrast to the reports with mammalian enzymes. Furthermore, it is shown that the correct monosaccharides are added sequentially in a stepwise fashion to the nascent chain. This is the first direct demonstration of HA polysaccharide polymerization in such a fashion. All reagents were from Sigma or Fisher unless noted otherwise. Membrane preparations containing recombinant PmHAS (rPmHAS) (GenBank™ numberAF036004) were isolated from E. coli SURE(pPmHAS) as described (15DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Membrane preparations containing native PmHAS were obtained from the P. multocida strain P-1059 (ATCC #15742) as described (9DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol was substituted for thioglycollate throughout the procedure. PmHAS was assayed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 20 mmMnC12, and UDP-sugars (UDP-[14C]GlcUA, 0.3 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products) and UDP-GlcNAc) at 30 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by various chromatographic methods as described below. Membrane preparations containing other recombinant HAS enzymes, Group A streptococcal HasA or Xenopus DG42 produced in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were prepared as described previously (16DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Uronic acid was quantitated by the carbazole method (17Taylor K.A. Buchanan-Smith J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Even-numbered HA oligosaccharides ((GlcNAc-GlcUA)n) were generated by degradation of HA (from Group C Streptococcus) with either ovine testicular hyaluronidase Type V (n = 2–5) or Streptomyces hyaluroniticus HA lyase (n = 2 or 3) in 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at 30 °C overnight. The latter enzyme employs an elimination mechanism to cleave the chain, resulting in an unsaturated ΔGlcUA residue at the nonreducing terminus of each fragment (18Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For further purification and desalting, some preparations were subjected to gel filtration with P-2 resin (Bio-Rad) in 0.2 m ammonium formate and lyophilization. Odd-numbered HA oligosaccharides (GlcNAc(GlcUA-GlcNAc)n) ending in a GlcNAc residue were prepared by mercuric acetate treatment of partial HA digests generated by HA lyase (n = 2–7; gift of Dr. G. Sugumaran; Ref. 19Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meexan E. Roden L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The masses of the HA oligosaccharides were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Sugars in water were mixed with an equal volume of 5 mg/ml 6-azo-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and rapidly air-dried on the target plate. The negative ions produced by pulsed nitrogen laser irradiation were analyzed in linear mode (20-kV acceleration; Perceptive Voyager®). Other oligosaccharides that are structurally similar to HA were also tested in HAS assays. The structure of heparosan pentamer derived from the E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide is (β(1,4)GlcNAc-α(1,4)GlcUA)2-β(1,4)GlcNAc (gift of Dr. G. Sugumaran; Ref. 20Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); this carbohydrate has the same composition as HA, but the glycosidic linkages between the monosaccharides are different. The chitin-derived oligosaccharides, chitotetraose and chitopentaose, are β(1,4)GlcNAc polymers made of 4 or 5 monosaccharides, respectively (gift of Dr. P. Robbins). Various oligosaccharides were radiolabeled by reduction with 4 to 6 equivalents of sodium borotritide (20 mm, NEN Life Science Products; 0.2 Ci/mmol) in 15 mm NaOH at 30 °C for 2 h (21Hall N.A. Patrick A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). [3H]Oligosaccharides were desalted on a P-2 column in 0.2 m ammonium formate to remove unincorporated tritium and lyophilized. Some labeled oligosaccharides were further purified preparatively by paper chromatography with Whatman 1 developed in pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/H2O (5:5:1:3) before use as an acceptor. Paper chromatography with Whatman No. 3M developed in ethanol 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5 (65:35), was used to separate high molecular weight HA product (which remains at the origin) from UDP-sugars and small acceptor oligosaccharides (22DeAngelis P.L Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the conventional HAS assay, radioactive UDP-sugars are polymerized into HA. To obtain the size distribution of the HA polymerization products, some samples were also separated by gel filtration chromatography with Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) columns in 0.2m NaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 8. Columns were calibrated with dextran standards. The identity of the polymer products was assessed by sensitivity to specific HA lyase and the requirement for the simultaneous presence of both UDP-sugar precursors during the reaction. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on high performance silica plates with application zones (Whatman) utilizing butanol/acetic acid/water (1.5:1:1 or 1.25:1:1) development solvent separated3H-labeled oligosaccharides in reaction mixes. Radioactive molecules were visualized after impregnation with EnHance spray (NEN Life Science Products) and fluorography at −80 °C. In our previous report, membrane preparations from recombinant E. coli containing rPmHAS protein had HA synthase activity as judged by incorporation of radiolabel from UDP-[14C]GlcUA into polymer when co-incubated with both UDP-GlcNAc and Mn2+ ion (15DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity at the amino acid level of PmHAS to some lipopolysaccharide transferases, it seemed possible that HA oligosaccharides would serve as acceptors for GlcUA and GlcNAc transfer. The addition of unlabeled even-numbered HA tetramer (from testicular hyaluronidase digests) to reaction mixtures with rPmHAS stimulated incorporation of radiolabel from UDP-[14C]GlcUA into HA polymer by ∼20- to 60-fold in comparison to reactions without oligosaccharides (Fig.1). On the other hand, structurally similar sugars, heparosan pentamer or chitotetraose, did not stimulate incorporation of the radiolabel. The free monosaccharides GlcUA and GlcNAc, either singly or in combination at concentrations of up to 100 mm, did not serve as acceptors; likewise, the β-methyl glycosides of these sugars did not stimulate HAS activity (not shown). The activity of rPmHAS was dependent on the simultaneous incubation with both UDP-sugar precursors and Mn2+ ion. The level of incorporation was dependent on protein concentration, on HA oligosaccharide concentration, and on incubation time (Fig.2). HA synthesized in the presence or the absence of HA oligosaccharides was sensitive to HA lyase (>95% destroyed) and had a molecular weight of ≥1–5 × 104Da (∼50–250 monosaccharides). No requirement for a lipid-linked intermediate was observed as neither bacitracin (0.5 mg/ml) nor tunicamycin (0.2 mg/ml) altered the level of incorporation in comparison to parallel reactions with no inhibitor. Gel filtration chromatography analysis of reactions containing rPmHAS, [3H]HA tetramer, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GlcUA showed that labeled polymers from ∼0.5 to 5 × 104 Da (25–250 monosaccharides) were made (Fig. 3). In a parallel reaction without UDP-GlcNAc, the elution profile of the labeled tetramer was not altered. The activity of the native PmHAS from P. multocida membranes, however, was not stimulated by the addition of HA oligosaccharides under similar conditions (not shown). It is likely that native PmHAS enzyme has an attached or bound nascent HA chain that was initiated in the bacterium before membrane isolation. The recombinant enzyme, on the other hand, is expected to lack a nascent HA chain as the E. coli host does not produce the UDP-GlcUA precursor needed to make HA polysaccharide (10DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the exogenous HA-derived oligosaccharide has access to the active site of rPmHAS and can be elongated. The tetramer from ovine testicular hyaluronidase digests of HA terminates at the nonreducing end with a GlcUA residue; this molecule served as an acceptor for HA elongation by rPmHAS. On the other hand, the Δtetramer and Δhexamer oligosaccharides produced by the action of Streptomyces HA lyase did not stimulate HA polymerization (Fig. 1, unsHA4/6). As a result of the lyase eliminative cleavage, the terminal unsaturated sugar is missing the C4 hydroxyl of GlcUA (18Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), which would normally be extended by the HA synthase. The lack of subsequent polymerization onto this terminal unsaturated sugar is analogous to the case of dideoxynucleotides causing chain termination if present during DNA synthesis. A closed pyranose ring at the reducing terminus was not required by PmHAS, since reduction with borohydride did not effect the ability of the HA tetramer to serve as an acceptor; this finding also allowed the use of borotritide labeling to monitor the fate of oligosaccharides. Neither recombinant Group A HasA nor recombinant DG42 produced in yeast elongated HA-derived oligosaccharides into larger polymers. First, the addition of HA tetramer or a series of longer oligosaccharides neither stimulated nor inhibited the incorporation of radiolabeled UDP-sugar precursors into HA by these enzymes significantly (≥±5% control value). In parallel experiments, the HAS activity of HasA or DG42 were not affected by the addition of chitin-derived oligosaccharides (data not shown). Second, the recombinant enzymes did not elongate radiolabeled HA tetramer in the presence of UDP-sugars (Table I). These same preparations of enzymes, however, were highly active in the conventional HAS assay in which radiolabeled UDP-sugars were polymerized into HA.Table IAcceptor use of various recombinant HA synthasesEnzymeUnits1-apmol of GlcUA transfer/h in the conventional HAS assay.EDTAIncorporation of HA4 into polymer (pmol)rPmHAS61-bMeasured without HA tetramer; 360 units with 100 μm HA tetramer.−240+1.7rHasA9,800−≤0.2+≤0.2rDG4211,500−≤0.1+≤0.3The various recombinant enzymes were tested for their ability to convert HA tetramer into higher molecular weight products.

TLC was utilized to monitor the PmHAS-catalyzed elongation reactions containing 3H-labeled oligosaccharides and various combinations of UDP-sugar nucleotides. Fig.4 A clearly shows that rPmHAS elongated HA-derived tetramer by a single sugar unit if the next appropriate UDP-sugar precursor was available in the reaction mixture. GlcNAc derived from UDP-GlcNAc was added onto the GlcUA residue at the nonreducing terminus of the tetramer acceptor to form a pentamer. On the other hand, inclusion of only UDP-GlcUA did not alter the mobility of the oligosaccharide. If both HA precursors were supplied, then various longer products were made. In parallel reactions, control membranes prepared from host cells with vector plasmid did not alter the mobility of the radiolabeled HA tetramer under any circumstances (not shown). In similar analyses monitored by TLC, rPmHAS did not utilize labeled chitopentaose as an acceptor (Fig. 4 B). HA-derived oligosaccharides with either GlcUA or GlcNAc at the nonreducing terminus served as acceptors for rPmHAS (Fig.5). Within 2 min, 2 to 6 sugar units were added, and after 20 min, 9 to ≥15 units were added. In the experiments with HA tetramer and both sugars at the 20-min time point, a ladder of even- and odd-numbered products is produced. Therefore, in combination with the results of the single UDP-sugar experiments, it appears that PmHAS transfers individual monosaccharides sequentially during the polymerization reaction. The apparent GlcUA transfer rate of PmHAS is faster than the GlcNAc transfer rate, as indicated by buildup of products terminating in GlcUA at the reducing end in experiments with either acceptor at the 2-min time point. This finding may be the result of the higher relative affinity of PmHAS enzyme for the UDP-GlcUA substrate than UDP-GlcNAc, as measured by the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) in previous kinetic analyses (20 μm versus 75 μm, respectively; Ref. 9DeAngelis P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An intrinsic and essential feature of polysaccharide synthesis is the repetitive addition of sugar monomer units to the growing polymer. The glycosyltransferase is expected to remain in association with the nascent chain. This feature is particularly relevant for HA biosynthesis, as the HA polysaccharide product in all known cases is transported out of the cell; if the polymer was released, then the HAS would not have another chance to elongate that particular molecule. Three possible mechanisms for maintaining the growing polymer chain at the active site of the enzyme are immediately obvious. First, the enzyme possesses a carbohydrate polymer binding pocket or cleft. Second, the nascent chain is covalently attached to the enzyme during its synthesis. Third, the enzyme binds to the nucleotide base or the lipid moiety of the precursor while the nascent polymer chain is still covalently attached. Thus far, the molecular details of the vast majority of polysaccharide synthases are lacking. The HAS activity of the native PmHAS enzyme found in P. multocida membrane preparations was not stimulated by addition of HA oligosaccharides; theoretically, the endogenous nascent HA chain initiated in vivo renders the exogenously supplied acceptor unnecessary. However, recombinant PmHAS produced in an E. coli strain that lacks the UDP-GlcUA precursor and, thus, lacks a nascent HA chain, is able to bind and to elongate exogenous HA oligosaccharides. As mentioned above, there are three likely means for a nascent HA chain to be held at or near the active site. In the case of PmHAS, it appears that a HA-binding site exists near or at the sugar transferase catalytic site. Defined oligosaccharides that vary in size and composition may be utilized to discern the nature of the interaction between PmHAS and the sugar chain. For example, it appears that the putative HA polymer-binding pocket of PmHAS will bind and elongate at least an intact HA trisaccharide (reduced tetramer). The monosaccharides GlcUA or GlcNAc, however, even in combination at high concentration, are not effective acceptors. Oligosaccharide binding to PmHAS appears to be quite selective, because the heparosan pentamer, which only differs in the glycosidic linkages from HA-derived oligosaccharides, does not serve as an acceptor. Future studies will further examine the structural requirements for the acceptor molecule as well as the identity of the oligosaccharide-binding site on the PmHAS polypeptide. The recombinant PmHAS enzyme, however, will produce HA chains without the addition of exogenous HA-derived oligosaccharide, albeit at a lower rate. Perhaps chain initiation is the rate-limiting step in HA biosynthesis. Thus the stimulation of sugar incorporation into HA chains observed in the presence of HA-derived acceptors is likely to be due to the circumvention of the initial kinetic obstacle. Previously no HA synthase had been shown to utilize an exogenous acceptor or primer sugar. In an early study of a cell-free HA synthesis system, preparations of native Group A streptococcal HAS were neither inhibited nor stimulated by the addition of various HA oligosaccharides, including the HA tetramer derived from testicular hyaluronidase digests (11Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These membrane preparations were isolated from cultures that were producing copious amounts of HA polysaccharide. The cells were hyaluronidase-treated to facilitate handling. Therefore, it is quite likely that the native streptococcal enzyme was isolated with a small nascent HA chain attached to or bound to the protein much as suspected in the case of native PmHAS. Theoretically, the existing nascent chain formed in vivo would block the entry and subsequent utilization of an exogenous acceptor by the isolated enzyme in vitro. With the advent of molecularly cloned HAS genes, it is possible to prepare virgin enzymes lacking a nascent HA chain if the proper host is utilized for expression. The yeast S. cerevisiae, an organism whose genome has been totally sequenced, does not possess the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase that is required for UDP-GlcUA precursor synthesis. Nonetheless, the virgin yeast-derived recombinant streptococcal or vertebrate enzymes did not utilize HA acceptor oligosaccharides in our experiments in vitro. Possible explanations for this finding are that the enzymes lack an accessible binding site for the HA-derived acceptor chains tested, or the enzymes utilize a different polymer retention mechanism. Recently, it has been postulated that certain vertebrate HAS enzymes, Xenopus DG42 and the Brachydanio zebrafish homolog in particular, can produce chitin oligosaccharides under certain conditions (23Semino C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3498-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another possibility forwarded was that chitin oligosaccharide primers are used to initiate HA chains, and polymerization would occur at the nonreducing terminus (24Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More defined enzyme systems will be needed to address this difficult issue in the vertebrate system. With respect to PmHAS, however, chitotetraose and chitopentaose neither stimulated HA production nor served as acceptors in our experiments. In the case of the biosynthesis of the other glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides, heparin and chondroitin, some details are available (reviewed in Refs. 25Roden L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar and 26Lidholt K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Both heparin and chondroitin are synthesized by the addition of sugar units to the nonreducing end of the polymer chain. In vivo, the glycosyltransferases initiate chain elongation on primer tetrasaccharides (xylose-galactose-galactose-GlcUA) that are attached to serine residues of proteoglycan core molecules. In vitro, enzyme extracts transfer a single sugar to exogenously added heparin or chondroitin oligosaccharides (26Lidholt K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lind T.

Drake R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14399-14403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); unfortunately, the subsequent sugar of the disaccharide unit is usually not added, and processive elongation to longer polymers does not occur. Therefore it is likely that some component is altered or missing in the in vitro system. In the case of heparin biosynthesis, it is postulated that a single enzyme transfers both GlcUA and GlcNAc sugars to the glycosaminoglycan chain based on co-purification or expression studies (27Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recent work with the E. coli K5 KfiC enzyme, which polymerizes heparosan, indicates that a single protein can transfer both sugars to the nonreducing end of acceptor molecules in vitro (30Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Processive elongation, however, was not demonstrated in these experiments; crude cell lysates transferred a single sugar to defined even- or odd-numbered oligosaccharides. However, their initial mutagenesis experiments suggest that at least two independent sites were involved in the transfer of the two monosaccharides (30Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several models describing various facets of the biosynthesis of HA and other polysaccharides have been proposed in the literature, but the lack of purified, stable enzymes and/or the difficulty of monitoring early stages of the reaction have prevented the rigorous testing of these hypotheses. The first theoretical model of HA biosynthesis based on direct logic proposed that two sites transferred the sugars individually from precursors to the nonreducing terminus of the nascent chain in an alternating fashion (31Markovitz A. Cifonelli J.A. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2343-2350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work by this laboratory on the Group A streptococcal HAS enzyme gave corroborating data (11Stoolmiller A.C. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, two other groups concluded that HA was extended by the addition of sugars to the reducing end in experiments with native mammalian HAS preparations (12Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Asplund T. Brinck J. Suzuki M. Briskin M.J. Heldin P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is obvious that direct experiments with defined systems utilizing purified enzyme will be necessary to address these issues. Recently, general mechanistic models have been proposed for β-glycosyltransferases that synthesize polysaccharides (32Saxena I.M. Brown R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The hypotheses were based loosely on the putative mechanism of carbohydrate hydrolases that cleave polymer chains, but in the case of synthesis, the reaction would run in the reverse direction. It was also proposed in both models that three binding sites for sugar-nucleotides and/or sugars are utilized to synthesize the polymer in a processive fashion. The directionality of chain synthesis was undecided until electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction data from cellulose fibrils protruding from Acetobacter bacteria implied that new sugars were added to the nonreducing terminus (33Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In these models, the two monosaccharides of the disaccharide repeat are simultaneously added onto the polymer chain bound to the enzyme. This reaction pathway allows the formation of β-linked bonds from α-linked UDP-sugars by an inversion mechanism and removes the need for the polymer chain or the protein to rotate during the elongation reaction. This latter feature was invoked in part to eliminate topological problems during the formation of insoluble cellulose fibrils (32Saxena I.M. Brown R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The models were then extended further to other β-linked polysaccharide synthases due to the similarities of certain putative domains and/or motifs at the protein sequence level (32Saxena I.M. Brown R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have found that recombinant PmHAS adds single monosaccharides in a sequential fashion to the nonreducing termini of the nascent HA chain. Elongation of HA polymers containing hundreds of sugars was demonstrated in vitro. The simultaneous formation of the disaccharide repeat unit is not necessary for generating the alternating structure of the HA molecule. The intrinsic specificity and fidelity of each half-reaction (e.g. GlcUA added to a GlcNAc residue or vice versa) apparently is sufficient to synthesize authentic HA chains. A great technical benefit resulting from the alternating disaccharide structure of HA is that the reaction may be dissected by controlling the availability of UDP-sugar nucleotides. By omitting or supplying precursors in a reaction mixture, the glycosyltransferase may be stopped and started at different stages of synthesis of the heteropolysaccharide. In contrast, there is no facile way to control in a stepwise fashion the glycosyltransferase enzymes that produce important homopolysaccharides such as chitin, cellulose, starch, and glycogen. The lessons learned with PmHAS in the future, however, may be applicable to the study of other enzyme systems. It has been established that one polypeptide species transfers both GlcUA and GlcNAc during HA biosynthesis in all known cases (7DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. van Etten J.L.

I propose that two distinct classes of enzyme exist based on differences in the amino acid sequences, the predicted polypeptide topology in the membrane bilayer, and the putative reaction pathway. Class I HASs would include the previously described streptococcal, viral, and vertebrate enzymes. At present, P. multocida PmHAS is the only known member of the Class II HA synthase. In the near future, it will be interesting to examine and to compare the reaction mechanisms of the glycosaminoglycan synthases and other β-glycosyltransferases in more detail.

https://openalex.org/W2089269914,"Two putative CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) response elements were identified in the proximal promoter of the human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (<i>StAR</i>) gene, which encodes a key protein-regulating steroid hormone synthesis. Expression of C/EBPα and -β increased StAR promoter activity in COS-1 and HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of C/EBPα or -β and steroidogenic factor 1, a transcription factor required for cAMP regulation of StAR expression, into COS-1 augmented 8-bromoadenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP)-stimulated promoter activity. When the putative C/EBP response elements were mutated, individually or together, a pronounced decline in basal <i>StAR</i> promoter activity in human granulosa-lutein cells resulted, but the fold stimulation of promoter activity by 8-Br-cAMP was unaffected. Recombinant C/EBPα and -β bound to the two identified sequences but not the mutated elements. Human granulosa-lutein cell nuclear extracts also bound these elements but not the mutated sequences. An antibody to C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα, supershifted the nuclear protein complex associated with the more distal element. The complex formed by nuclear extracts with the proximal element was not supershifted by either antibody. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in human granulosa-lutein cell nuclear extracts. C/EBPβ levels were up-regulated 3-fold by 8-Br-cAMP treatment. Our studies demonstrate a role for C/EBPβ as well as yet to be identified proteins, which can bind to C/EBP response elements, in the regulation of <i>StAR</i> gene expression and suggest a mechanism by which C/EBPβ participates in the cAMP regulation of <i>StAR</i> gene transcription."

In this study, the ability of the p125 catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ to engage in protein-protein interactions with PCNA was established by biochemical and genetic methods. p125 and PCNA were shown to co-immunoprecipitate from either calf thymus or HeLa extracts, or when they were ectopically co-expressed in Cos 7 cells. Because pol δ is a multimeric protein, this interaction could be indirect. Thus, rigorous evidence was sought for a direct interaction of the p125 catalytic subunit and PCNA. To do this, the ability of recombinant p125 to interact with PCNA was established by biochemical means. p125 co-expressed with PCNA in Sf9 cells was shown to form a physical complex that can be detected on gel filtration and that can be cross-linked with the bifunctional cross-linking agent Sulfo-EGS (ethylene glycol bis (sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate)). An interaction between p125 and PCNA could also be demonstrated in the yeast two hybrid system. Overlay experiments using biotinylated PCNA showed that the free p125 subunit interacts with PCNA.

Fritzler M.J. Tan E.M. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2228-2234PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown to be a factor that enhanced the processivity of DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) and to have key roles in both DNA replication and repair (2Zeng X.-R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Hao H.

There have been striking recent advances in our understanding of the structure and functions of PCNA (4Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Purification and expression of human recombinant PCNA and its physiochemical characterization established that it was a trimeric protein (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of both yeast and human PCNA have been determined (6Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M.

Like the T4 gene 45 protein and the β subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, PCNA functions as a sliding DNA clamp that forms a closed ring around duplex DNA (8Kelman Z.

The binding of pol δ to PCNA provides an elegant micromechanical solution to the biological need to maintain an extraordinarily high level of processivity during the synthesis of chromosomal DNA (8Kelman Z.

Recently, it has also been found that PCNA has a number of protein partners with which it interacts (4Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Cox L.S.

Pol δ has been shown to be involved not only in DNA replication but also in DNA repair and can be regulated by cell cycle proteins (2Zeng X.-R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Hao H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol.

Thus, an important area of interest is the protein-protein interaction sites of PCNA, because it may be the nexus for multiple protein-protein interactions involved in replication, repair, recombination, and cell cycle regulation. The pol δ core enzyme consists of two subunits, p125 and p50 (14Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory has implicated the p125 subunit in an interaction with PCNA (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide conforming to the N2 region (residues 129–149) was found to inhibit PCNA stimulation of pol δ isolated from calf thymus (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). p125 and PCNA co-expressed in Sf9 cells could be co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody to PCNA, showing that the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ interacted with PCNA (10Zhang S.-J.

However, the recombinant p125 catalytic subunit can only be stimulated by PCNA at most 2–3-fold, and the presence of the p50 subunit is required to restore a significant level of PCNA stimulation of the p125 subunit (15Zhang P.

So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two recent studies of yeast pol δ reported contrary results. No evidence for a direct interaction between the Schizosaccharomyces pombe pol δ p125 subunit and PCNA could be found, either by co-immunoprecipitation experiments after their co-expression in insect cells or by a yeast two hybrid assay (18Tratner I. Piard K. Grenon M. Perederiset M. Baldacci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was concluded that no direct interaction occurs between S. pombe p125 and PCNA. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, similar results were obtained using a PCNA overlay assay. In the latter studies, the interaction of S. cerevisiae p125 and p58, as well as the recently identified third subunit (p55), was studied by a PCNA overlay method. It was shown that only the third subunit (p55) of pol δ interacted with PCNA (19Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the interaction of pol δ with PCNA involved the third subunit, whereas no evidence could be obtained for an interaction of PCNA with either the small second subunit p58 or the catalytic subunit. These findings are in conflict with our previous studies of the p125-PCNA interaction, and they suggest that the binding of PCNA in yeast and human depend on different subunit-PCNA interactions. Alternatively, it is also possible that the interaction of PCNA with pol δ involves multiple interactions with pol δ subunits. For this reason, we have undertaken a rigorous examination of the protein-protein interactions of the p125 subunit of pol δ and PCNA using different biochemical methods. Our studies leave little doubt of the ability of the p125 subunit to interact with PCNA. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were transfected with c-Myc-His-PCNA and pCMV-p125 using the calcium phosphate method. For each 9-cm Petri dish, the transfected DNA consisted of 5 μg of each expression vector and 10 μg of Bluescript SK DNA. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, the lysed cells were spun at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1 ml of extract. The immunoprecipitates were separated on a 5–15% gradient SDS gel and immunoblotted with anti-His antibody (Invitrogen) or pol δ monoclonal antibody. The blot was then detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sf9 cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks to 75% confluence. The cells were dislodged from 25 flasks by pipetting 5 ml of fresh medium into the flasks. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Recombinant baculoviruses containing the human p125 coding sequence, its deletion mutants, or PCNA were as described previously (13Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with either the p125 or the deleted p125 and PCNA at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each recombinant baculovirus. The cells were incubated in the viral inoculum for 2 h with gentle rotation every 15 min and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for another 10 min. The inoculum was removed, and cell pellets were suspended in 150 ml of fresh medium divided into 2 flasks and incubated for another 60 h. The cell lysates from a total of 2 × 108 cells were collected and processed as described previously (13Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One mg of protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 × 100 cm). Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected. The elution of pol δ activity was monitored by its activity on poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as described previously (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol.

Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cross-linked species were identified by Western blotting. Western blot was performed using 78F5 and 38B5 pol δ monoclonal antibodies (13Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prestained protein standards (Sigma) were used as molecular weight markers and also to provide for visual confirmation of efficient transfer. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then incubated with monoclonal antibodies to pol δ for 12 h. at 25 °C. After three 10-min washes in TBST, the blot was incubated with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxide conjugate diluted in TBST (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature with constant rocking. The blot was then washed five times with TBST for 20 min each and developed by chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant PCNA was expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PCNA was labeled with biotin by reaction with biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinamide ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction mixtures contained 0.5 mg of PCNA, 0.5 mg/ml biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinamide ester in a total volume of 0.5 ml in 20 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6. After reaction for 60 min at room temperature, the PCNA was purified on a G25 Sephadex column (5-ml bed volume) equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Samples containing 1–5 μg of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Prestained protein standards (New England Biolabs) were used as molecular weight markers. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 45 min at room temperature followed by three washes of TBST for 10 min each. The blots were then incubated with biotinylated PCNA (1 μg/μl) diluted in TBST (1:900) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were washed five times with TBST for 15 min followed by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted in TBST (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature with constant rocking. The blots were then washed five times with TBST for 20 min each and developed using by chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides to p21 and the N2 region of pol δ p125 were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis Co. The peptides were dissolved in water at a concentration of 5 μg/μl. Five μl of each peptide were dot blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Bovine serum albumin, PCNA, p125 and purified calf thymus pol δ (25 μg) were dot blotted onto the same membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked and blotted with biotinylated PCNA as described above. Plasmids expressing the GAL4 fusions with the coding sequences for p125, p50 and PCNA were constructed in the pAS2–1 and pACT2 vectors (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.). Sequential transformations of Y190 were performed by the lithium acetate method with dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 10%. pAS2–1-p125 and pAS2-p50 were transformed into Y190 and plated onto Trp− plates. Y190 stains transformed with pAS2–1-p125 or pAS2–1-p50 were then transformed with pACT2–50 or pACT2-PCNA. After overnight recovery in Trp−Leu− medium, the transformants were plated on Trp−Leu−His−/3-AT plates to select for histidine prototrophy. For the liquid assay, GAL4 and T antigen/p53 were transformed into Y190 as positive controls. pAS2–1-p50 and pAS2–1-PCNA in Y190 were used as negative controls. One ml of overnight yeast culture in liquid Trp−Leu−His−/SD selection medium was prepared. Four ml of YPD medium (yeast culture medium containing 20 g/liter Difco peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 2% glucose) was added to the overnight culture and incubated for 5 h at room temperature with shaking (230–250 rpm). The A600 of the culture was recorded. One ml of cells was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 s and washed once with 1 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2·7H2O) followed by another centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Z buffer. The cells were disrupted by freeze-thaw (liquid nitrogen for 1 min, thawed at 30 °C for 1 min). Z buffer (0.7 ml) and β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 40 mm was added. O-Nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (160 μl, 2.2 mm in Z buffer) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 3–90 min. (Positive strong interactions were incubated for 3 min and negative interactions for 90 min.) The reactions were terminated by addition of 0.4 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the A420 was recorded. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated. Arbitrary units of activity were calculated as: β-galactosidase units = 1000 ×A420/(t × V ×A600), where t = min of incubation; V = 0.1 ml. Previous studies have demonstrated that human PCNA could be co-immunoprecipitated with the p125 catalytic subunit of pol δ from Sf9 insect cell lysates, under conditions where both proteins were overexpressed as recombinant proteins (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It can be argued that the interactions observed were a consequence of the supranormal concentrations of both proteins under these conditions of overexpression and may not reflect the behavior of the two proteins in a normal cellular context. Studies were therefore performed to establish whether PCNA and p125 could be co-immunoprecipitated from mammalian tissue or cell culture extracts. The results show that p125 and PCNA can be readily co-immunoprecipitated from crude calf thymus extracts that had been partially purified on phenyl agarose, as well as from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 1, A and B). Because of the multisubunit nature of pol δ, these experiments do not show a direct interaction between p125 and PCNA, but they do confirm that an interaction between pol δ and PCNA is readily demonstrated in cell extracts. Next, evidence for an interaction between p125 and PCNA when they are ectopically expressed in mammalian cultured cells was sought. Human PCNA was expressed in Cos 7 cells with dual tags (a hexahistidine tag and a c-Myc tag) together with p125 expressed in the pCMV vector (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Samples of the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using a c-Myc antibody and were Western blotted with pol δ antibody. The results show that p125 is co-immunoprecipitated with c-Myc-His-tagged PCNA (not shown). Control experiments in which the immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-His antibody confirmed that PCNA was present in the immunoprecipitate. These experiments demonstrate that pol δ p125 can be shown to co-immunoprecipitate with PCNA, either when endogenous pol δ is present or when p125 is ectopically co-expressed with PCNA. The experimental results in which p125 co-expressed with PCNA in either baculovirus (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or in mammalian cells (Fig. 1) indicated that p125 is able to interact with PCNA and imply that this interaction is independent of the presence of p50 or other subunits of pol δ. In these experiments, co-immunoprecipitation does not provide rigorous evidence that the p125 subunit directly interacts with PCNA, as it is possible that the p125 that is detected by co-immunoprecipitation is by virtue of an interaction of PCNA with a pol δ heterodimer, i.e., the interactions are mediated by a third polypeptide(s). In order to provide a more rigorous test, Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculovirus vectors for p125 and for PCNA. The Sf9 cell lysates were then subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Fig. 2). Assays for pol δ activity showed that there were two peaks of activity, one with a relative molecular weight of 125,000 and the second with a relative molecular weight of 220,000 (Fig. 2, upper and middle panels). The fractions were analyzed for the presence of p125 and PCNA by Western blotting using specific antibodies. The results show that the 125,000 peak contained only p125, whereas PCNA co-migrated with p125 in the 220,00 molecular weight fractions. Furthermore, no free PCNA was detected in the range where either the dimer or trimer form would be expected to migrate. (In previous studies of the behavior of recombinant PCNA expressed in E. coli, we had shown that PCNA in solution is a mixture of dimers and trimers (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). These results provide the first direct demonstration that free p125 forms a physical complex with PCNA, and moreover, the apparent molecular weight is consistent with a complex of p125 with a trimeric form of PCNA, because previous work showed that the PCNA trimer migrates with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 100,000 on gel filtration (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In order to establish that the co-elution of p125 and PCNA is not due to fortuitous associations with unrelated proteins, cross-linking experiments using bifunctional cross-linking agents were performed to establish a direct p125-PCNA protein-protein interaction in the 220,000 molecular weight complex. Sulfo-EGS was used, as we have previously shown that EGS readily cross-links PCNA (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the peak fractions of the complex of p125 and PCNA obtained on gel filtration were cross-linked with sulfo-EGS, and the formation of cross-linked species monitored by Western blotting with antibodies against p125 (Fig.3 A, left panel) or PCNA (Fig.3 A, right panel), a rapid disappearance of the PCNA monomer and p125 was observed with the concomitant formation of a band of 225 kDa that reacted with both p125 and PCNA antibodies. This is consistent with the presence of p125 in complex with a PCNA trimer. It is noteworthy that no accumulation of species that might represent p125 cross-linked to a PCNA monomer or a PCNA dimer was observed. Control cross-linking experiments with Sf9 cell lysates expressing PCNA or p125 alone were performed. In the case of p125, no cross-linking with sulfo-EGS was observed under the conditions used (not shown). In the case of PCNA, sulfo-EGS gave exactly the same pattern of cross-linking that we had previously found for PCNA cross-linked with EGS (5Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner J.F. Lee M.Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in that the major species of PCNA that were observed after cross-linking were the monomer, the dimer, and a smaller amount of the trimer. In a parallel experiment, a deletion mutant of p125 (Δ2–249) in which the N-terminal 248 residues were removed (13Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Zhu L. Toomey N.L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was co-expressed with PCNA and subjected to cross-linking. In this case, only the monomer, dimer, and trimer species of PCNA were observed, as for PCNA alone, as shown in Fig. 3 C. Blotting with pol δ antibodies also showed that there were no cross-links formed with the N-terminal deletion mutant of pol δ (Fig. 3 C, upper panel). These results are consistent with our previous observations that the N-terminal region of p125 is required for its interaction with PCNA. In order to obtain additional evidence that p125 can interact with PCNA, an overlay technique for blotting of PCNA-binding proteins was used. PCNA was labeled with biotin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pol δ was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blotted with biotinylated PCNA (see under “Experimental Procedures”) and visualized using a chemiluminescence method. A number of experiments were performed; they showed that only the p125 band provided a strong reaction with biotinylated PCNA. When immunoaffinity purified calf thymus pol δ enzyme was blotted with biotinylated PCNA, a strong reaction was seen with the p125 catalytic subunit (Fig. 4 A, left panel). The p50 subunit of pol δ did not interact with PCNA in the overlay experiments (Fig. 4 A, left panel). The inability of the p50 subunit to interact with PCNA was confirmed using purified recombinant p50 subunit (Fig. 4 A, left panel). This experiment was repeated using recombinant pol δ heterodimer produced by overexpression of p125 and p50 in Sf9 cells. The same results were obtained, namely that p125 but not p50 reacted with biotinylated PCNA (Fig. 4 B). Because the overlay depends on an interaction with a polypeptide band separated by SDS-PAGE, this positive interaction demonstrates that the p125 subunit interacts with PCNA in a manner that is independent of the presence of the other subunits of pol δ. In Fig. 4 A, it is noted that the overlay of immunoaffinity purified pol δ with PCNA reveals a doublet of 70 kDa. In other studies, partial protein sequence was obtained of this band, and a BLAST search identified this polypeptide as KIAA0039 (GenBankTM). This was found to be a mammalian counterpart of S. pombe Cdc27. 2J.-Y. Mo and M. Y. W. T. Lee, submitted for publication. We have also examined the Δ2–249 N-terminal deletion mutant of p125, in which the N2 region is absent (13Wu S.-M. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Zhang S.-J. Mo J. Li B.Q. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9561-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), by PCNA overlay. The results (Fig. 5 A) show that this deletion mutant is not recognized by overlay with biotinylated PCNA. In parallel, experiments were performed using deletion mutants Δ186–321, Δ336–715 (core region deleted), Δ675–1107, and Δ778–1047 (C-terminal regions deleted) expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 5 B). All of these deletion mutants, covering essentially the entire p125 sequence from residue 186 (Fig.5 C), interacted with PCNA. These results, taken with the inability of the Δ2–249 deletion mutant to bind to biotinylated PCNA, restricts the binding region on p125 to within the first 186 residues. Human p125, p50 and PCNA coding sequences were inserted into the pAS2–1 and pACT2 vectors and tested for pairwise interactions using the yeast two hybrid system. For these experiments, the yeast co-transformants were grown and the lysates tested for β-galactosidase activity. The results were compared on the basis of relative specific activities (arbitrary units of β-galactosidase activity per unit of cell culture density). The results are shown in Fig. 6. This analysis confirms the biochemical data that p125 and PCNA interact and that p50 and PCNA do not interact. Previous work had identified a region of the N terminus of pol δ, the N2 region (GVTDEGFSVCCHIHGFAPYFY, residues 129–149) as being involved in the interaction of pol δ with PCNA. This was based on the ability of a synthetic peptide with this sequence to inhibit the PCNA stimulation of pol δ (10Zhang S.-J. Zeng X.-R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J.

https://openalex.org/W1974811607,"Biochemical and structural studies of Src and related kinases demonstrate that two intramolecular interactions suppress kinase activity. These interactions involve binding of the SH2 domain to a phosphotyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail and association of the SH3 domain with a polyproline type II helix formed by amino acids linking the SH2 and kinase domains. Recent studies have shown that high affinity interaction of the SH3 domain of Hck with the human immunodeficiency virus type I Nef protein activates Hck tyrosine kinase and biological activities, suggesting a mechanism that involves disruption of the SH3-linker interaction. To test the role of this interaction in the regulation of Hck kinase activity in living cells, we substituted alanines for prolines 225 and 228 in the linker region and observed that the resulting mutant (Hck-2PA) demonstrated strong transforming activity in a Rat-2 fibroblast focus-forming assay. Hck-2PA also exhibited elevated tyrosine kinase activity in terms of autophosphorylation, endogenous substrate phosphorylation, and in an in vitro kinase assay. The transforming and kinase activities of Hck-2PA were remarkably similar to those observed with a Hck mutant activated by Phe substitution of the conserved tail Tyr residue and with wild-type Hck following co-expression with human immunodeficiency virus Nef. Introduction of the 2PA and tail mutations into a single Hck expression construct did not increase kinase or transforming activity relative to the individual mutations. These data provide new evidence that SH3-linker interaction may represent the dominant mechanism controlling Hck tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Biochemical and structural studies of Src and related kinases demonstrate that two intramolecular interactions suppress kinase activity.

These data provide new evidence that SH3-linker interaction may represent the dominant mechanism controlling Hck tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. human immunodeficiency virus glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Hck is a member of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase family and is expressed primarily in granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (1Ziegler S.F.

A. 1987; 84: 8325-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Hck regulates phagocyte differentiation and function. Hck expression is strongly induced by agents that promote macrophage differentiation and priming of the respiratory burst (4Boulet I. Ralph S. Stanley E. Lock P. Dunn A.R. Green S.P. Phillips W.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lichtenberg U. Quintrell N. Bishop J.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 849-858PubMed Google Scholar). Hck also associates with the Fc receptor and is activated following receptor engagement (6Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wang A.V. Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, Hck may couple the Fc receptor to activation of the respiratory burst. Other studies have implicated Hck in hematopoietic cytokine signal transduction. Interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor have all been shown to induce Hck kinase activation (9Linnekin D. Howard O.M.Z. Park L. Farrar W. Ferris D. Longo D.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 94-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Anderson S.M. Jorgensen B. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1660-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Hck has been shown to associate with the common β subunit of the interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (12Burton E.A. Hunter S. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16189-16195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Association occurs through the Hck SH3 and SH2 domains, suggesting that receptor binding may induce Hck activation (see below). Constitutive activation of Hck by gene targeting greatly reduced the leukemia inhibitory factor requirement for suppression of embryonic stem cell differentiation, suggesting a role for Hck in early development (10Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This previous study demonstrated interaction of Hck with gp130, the signal transducing subunit of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor that is also utilized by interleukin-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and other cytokines (13Smithgall T.E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar). Hck exhibits the structural organization characteristic of all Src family kinases, including a unique N-terminal region, SH3, SH2, and kinase domains, and a negative regulatory tail (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region contains sites for Hck myristylation and palmitylation, which promote plasma membrane targeting (15Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The SH3 and SH2 domains bind to proline-rich and phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences, respectively, which drive intermolecular interactions required for substrate recruitment and subcellular localization (16Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). In addition, the SH3 and SH2 domains are essential for negative regulation of Src family tyrosine kinase activity. Both biochemical and structural studies support an intramolecular model of negative regulation in which the SH2 domain interacts with the conserved phosphotyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail. Mutations in the SH2 domain or conversion of the C-terminal tail Tyr residue to Phe release the kinase and transforming activities of Src family members (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Mutations in SH3 also activate Src family tyrosine kinases (17Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G.

Linker residues outside of the polyproline helix also interact with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, and this interaction may be directly responsible for suppression of kinase activity (19Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 22LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Recent work from our laboratory suggests that disruption of the SH3-linker interaction may be sufficient for activation of Hck in vivo (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These studies utilized human immunodeficiency virus type I Nef as a ligand for the Hck SH3 domain, which binds to a conserved proline-rich Nef motif with the highest affinity known for an SH3-mediated interaction (24Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We observed that co-expression of Hck with Nef in Rat-2 fibroblasts stimulates Hck tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in cellular transformation. Transformation correlated with Hck-Nef complex formation and required the proline-rich motif of Nef. These data suggest that activation of Hck by Nef results from displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2-kinase linker and points to a central role for SH3-linker interaction in the negative regulation of Src family kinases in vivo. In the present study, we show that Hck mutants with proline to alanine substitutions in the SH2-kinase linker region exhibit constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and induce transformation of Rat-2 fibroblasts. The Hck linker mutant exhibited similar kinase activity and transforming potential to wild-type Hck following activation by HIV Nef. These data provide new evidence that disruption of SH3-linker interaction is sufficient for Hck kinase activation in vivo and point to SH3 engagement as a general mechanism of Src family kinase activation. The amino acid numbering of all Hck mutants is based on the p59 form of human Hck. Construction of kinase-defective (K269E; Hck-KE) and tail-activated (Y501F; Hck-YF) mutants of Hck as well as the Nef mutant lacking the proline residues essential for SH3 binding (Nef-PA) has been described elsewhere (23Briggs S.D.

The Hck SH2-kinase linker Pro to Ala substitution mutants (P225A single mutant and P225A/P228A double mutant, referred to hereafter as Hck-2PA) were generated using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system from Promega. The Hck linker-tail combination mutant (P225A/P228A/Y501F; Hck-2PAYF) was generated by swapping a unique restriction fragment containing the Hck-YF mutation with the corresponding fragment in Hck-2PA. All Hck proteins were expressed using the retroviral vector pSRαMSVtkneo (26Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). High titer stocks of recombinant retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of 293T cells with the retroviral vectors and an ecotropic packaging vector as described elsewhere (23Briggs S.D.

A negative control retrovirus was produced using the empty pSRα parent vector, which confers resistance to G418 only. Rat-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Transformation of Rat-2 fibroblasts by Hck and Nef was assessed using a focus-forming assay as described previously (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Rat-2 fibroblasts (2 × 104) were plated in each well of a six-well tissue culture plate 1 day prior to infection. The following day, cells were infected with the Nef, Nef-PA, or control retroviruses in a final volume of 5 ml. Polybrene was added to 4 μg/ml, and plates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 4 h at 18 °C to enhance infection efficiency. After infection, the virus was aspirated and replaced with 5 ml of fresh medium. The following day, cells were reinfected with either the wild-type Hck or negative control virus using the same procedure. Two days later, cells were trypsinized and equally divided among four 60-mm dishes, and G418 was added to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml. The selection medium was renewed every 3 days for 14 days, at which time transformed foci were visualized by Wright-Giemsa staining. Parallel cultures were lysed and tested for Nef and Hck protein expression or for Hck kinase activity as described below. To allow for a comparison of the transforming activity of the Hck-Nef combination with that of the activated Hck mutants, the same sequential infection method was used, with the control virus followed by the mutant Hck viruses. Rat-2 cells (confluent 60-mm culture dish) were flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen and lysed by thawing in 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate) or in 1.0 ml of Hck lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100). Both buffers also contained 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 μmNaMoO4. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Pierce). Hck was immunoprecipitated from equivalent amounts of total protein (0.5–1.0 mg) as follows: clarified lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Hck polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with either 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer or 1.0 ml of Hck lysis buffer followed by two washes with 1.0 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase buffer (20 μl) containing 1 μg of the tyrosine kinase substrate p50 (50-kDa GST fusion protein containing residues 331–443 of the Src substrate protein Sam 68 (27Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 28Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were added, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Radiolabeled p50 was visualized by storage phosphor technology using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Hck in vivo, Rat-2 cells expressing Hck proteins were flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen and lysed by thawing in 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer as described previously. Hck was immunoprecipitated from clarified cell lysates, washed three times with 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) or anti-Hck monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that co-expression of Nef and Hck in Rat-2 fibroblasts induces cellular transformation (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This effect correlated with Hck-Nef complex formation and enhanced phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins on tyrosine, strongly suggesting that Hck is activated by Nef in vivo. To investigate whether Hck tyrosine kinase activity is elevated in the presence of Nef in the transformed cells, Hck was immunoprecipitated from populations of Rat-2 cells expressing Hck alone, Nef alone, or the two in combination. The Hck immunoprecipitates were incubated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP and a 50-kDa GST-Sam 68 fusion protein (p50) as substrate. As shown in Fig.1, Hck immunoprecipitates from the Hck-Nef transformants exhibited both strong autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation in vitro. The extent of p50 substrate phosphorylation was consistently 8–10-fold higher than that observed with identical immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Hck alone. The requirement for the Nef SH3-binding motif was investigated by co-expressing Hck with a Nef mutant containing alanine substitutions for the prolines, which are essential for SH3 binding (Nef-PA mutant). Previous work has shown that this Nef mutant is unable to cooperate with Hck in the Rat-2 transformation assay (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Nef-PA did not increase Hck tyrosine kinase activity relative to Hck alone. Control blots show that equivalent amounts of Hck were present in each of the immunoprecipitates and that the Nef proteins were expressed at equivalent levels in each case. These results demonstrate that co-expression with Nef induces Hck activation in Rat-2 fibroblasts and are consistent with our previous transformation data. Results presented in Fig. 1, together with previous transformation data from our laboratory, strongly suggest that Nef activates Hck by binding to its SH3 domain and displacing the negative regulatory interaction with the linker region. These data point to a central role for intramolecular SH3-linker interaction in the negative regulation of Hck and possibly other Src family members. To test this idea more directly, Hck Pro residues 225 and 228, which are critical for the formation of the linker polyproline type II helix, were changed to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant (Hck-2PA) was expressed in Rat-2 fibroblasts and assayed for transforming activity using a focus-forming assay. As shown in Fig.2, the Hck-2PA mutant exhibited strong transforming activity, producing foci similar in number and size to those observed with a Hck mutant lacking the conserved tail tyrosine residue (Tyr-501; Hck-YF mutant). Fig. 2 also shows that Hck-2PA exhibited transforming activity close to that observed with the combination of Hck and Nef. We also investigated whether the combination of the linker and tail mutations led to any additional increase in transforming activity using a Hck mutant bearing both the linker proline to alanine substitutions and the tail Tyr to Phe mutation (Hck-2PAYF mutant). As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of both mutations did not affect overall transforming activity, suggesting that individual mutations within the linker or the tail disrupt the entire negative regulatory apparatus of Hck. Consistent with this finding is our observation that co-expression of Hck-2PA with Nef did not increase transforming activity relative to Hck-2PA alone (data not shown). Thus, the Hck-2PA mutation appears to fully disrupt negative regulation by the SH2-kinase linker region. To determine whether the SH2-kinase linker mutants of Hck demonstrated elevated tyrosine kinase activity, Hck was immunoprecipitated from the retrovirally infected Rat-2 cell populations shown in Fig. 2 and assayed in vitro with the p50 substrate protein and [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.3, Hck-2PA-mediated phosphorylation of p50 was 6-fold higher than that observed with wild-type Hck. This activity level is close to that observed with Hck-YF, which exhibited 8-fold higher activity than wild-type Hck. Finally, the Hck-2PAYF mutant demonstrated kinase activity equivalent to that of Hck-YF. These results are in agreement with the transformation data shown in Fig. 2and demonstrate that proline mutations in the Hck SH2-kinase linker region are sufficient to deregulate Hck kinase activity and induce cellular transformation. Furthermore, the SH2-kinase linker mutants showed transforming and kinase activities very similar to those observed in Rat-2 cells following co-expression of Hck and Nef. These results agree with the idea that displacement of the SH3 domain of Hck from the SH2-kinase linker is sufficient for the activation of Hck in vivo. We also investigated whether mutagenesis of a single proline residue in the Hck SH2-kinase linker region was sufficient to release transforming activity. For these experiments, Ala was substituted for Pro-225, which is conserved among all Src kinase family members. The resulting mutant (Hck-P225A) exhibited less than 10% of the Hck-2PA transforming and tyrosine kinase activities in Rat-2 cells, suggesting that both linker proline residues contribute to negative regulation as predicted by the crystal structure (data not shown). Unlike Hck-2PA, co-expression of Hck-P225A with Nef resulted in enhanced focus-forming activity, providing additional evidence for regulation by the linker despite loss of Pro-225. The presence of two proline residues in the Hck, Lyn, Lck, and Blk linker regions suggests a more dominant role for the linker in kinase regulation relative to Src, Fyn, Yrk, Fgr, and Yes, which contain only a single Pro residue (see “Discussion”). To determine whether the Hck linker mutants also exhibited enhanced autophosphorylation, anti-Hck immunoprecipitates were prepared from infected Rat-2 fibroblasts and probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY20. As shown in Fig.4, immunoprecipitates of all three constitutively activated forms of Hck (2PA, YF, 2PAYF) showed a marked increase in phosphotyrosine content compared with wild-type Hck. A faint anti-phosphotyrosine band was observed with wild-type Hck, which is likely to correspond to the tail-phosphorylated, inactive form of the protein. The kinase-dead form of Hck (Hck-KE) showed no evidence of tyrosine autophosphorylation and serves as a negative control. Aliquots of the Hck immunoprecipitates were also blotted with Hck antibodies to demonstrate that equivalent amounts of Hck were recovered in each case (Fig. 4, bottom panel). These results show that linker mutations are sufficient to promote Hck autophosphorylation and are consistent with the kinase activity assay and transformation results. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated the presence of many endogenous tyrosyl phosphoproteins in fibroblasts transformed by co-expression of Hck and Nef or by the tail mutant of Hck (Hck-YF) (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Most prominent among these was a 40-kDa phosphoprotein (p40). Although the identity of this endogenous Hck substrate is unknown, it serves as a useful transformation-associated tyrosyl phosphoprotein marker. We therefore probed whole cell protein extracts of Rat-2 cells transformed by the SH2-kinase linker mutants with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, transformation by the Hck-2PA mutant is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of a wide array of endogenous proteins, including very potent phosphorylation of p40. The extent of endogenous p40 tyrosine phosphorylation is comparable with that observed with the tail mutant of Hck as well as the linker-tail combination mutant. No detectable endogenous protein phosphorylation was observed in cells infected with a control retrovirus or expressing wild-type or kinase-dead Hck. Previous work from our laboratory established that the SH3-mediated interaction of Nef with Hck is sufficient to induce oncogenic transformation of Rat-2 fibroblasts (23Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This result suggested that Nef constitutively stimulates Hck protein-tyrosine kinase activity in vivo, which is responsible for the transformed phenotype. Here we provide new evidence supporting this model in living cells. Hck isolated from transformed Rat-2 cells co-expressing Nef shows increased autophosphorylation and is highly active toward a substrate protein in vitro. Hck activation is dependent upon the SH3-interaction motif of Nef. Our data are in good agreement with previous work by Moarefi et al. (29Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), which shows that the purified inactive form of Hck is activated by SH3-mediated interaction with Nef in vitro. A likely mechanism of Hck activation by Nef is suggested by the crystal structures of Hck and c-Src (19Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 20Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 21Williams J.C.

The structure reveals that the closed, inactive form of Hck is regulated by intramolecular interactions involving the SH2 and SH3 domains. One involves the binding of the Csk-phosphorylated tail to the SH2 domain, a finding not unexpected given the wealth of mutagenesis data demonstrating the critical role of the conserved tail tyrosine residue in the negative regulation of Src family kinases (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). A second interaction involves the binding of the SH3 domain to a polyproline type II helix formed by the linker region connecting the SH2 and kinase domains. Our results support a mechanism in which Nef binds to the SH3 domain of Hck and disrupts the interaction with the linker region, leading to kinase activation. Such a model implies that SH3-linker interaction is critical to the negative regulation of Hck. In this report, we provide further evidence for this hypothesis. Substitution of alanines for the linker proline residues within the SH2-kinase linker region releases Hck tyrosine kinase activity in vivo, leading to cellular transformation. Mutagenesis of these prolines is likely to contribute to constitutive Hck kinase activation and signaling by two mechanisms. First, loss of these prolines and attendant loss of SH3 interaction is likely to disrupt proper alignment between Trp-260 and other linker residues that contact the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. These interactions have been proposed to mediate suppression of kinase activity (see below). Second, loss of interaction with the linker may expose the SH3 domain, promoting recruitment of substrate proteins essential for transformation signaling. Numerous studies have suggested that Src family kinase SH3 domains have an important role in substrate recruitment (25Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol.

Interaction of Hck with substrate proteins via SH3 may contribute to kinase activation under physiological conditions. Our observation that substitution of Pro residues in the Hck linker release kinase and transforming activities are in agreement with those of Gonfloni et al. (33Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that mutations in the linker region of c-Src resulted in NIH 3T3 cell transformation and endogenous substrate phosphorylation. In contrast to our results, however, this c-Src linker mutant (K249E/P250E) showed much lower focus-forming activity when compared with c-Src activated by mutation of the conserved tail tyrosine residue, despite similar kinase activity. This result led the authors to speculate that the Src linker region may interact with target proteins required for transformation signaling. In the case of Hck, our data suggest that the linker may play a more dominant role in kinase regulation rather than protein-protein interaction, at least in fibroblasts. Another recent study has investigated the role of Trp-260 in the regulation of Hck kinase activity in vitro. This residue is part of the SH2-kinase linker region but lies outside of the polyproline type II helix that interacts with the SH3 domain. The crystal structure shows that Trp-260 contacts the αC-helix in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, and this interaction has been proposed to prevent the kinase from adopting an active conformation. LaFevre-Bernt et al. (22LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) changed this Trp to Ala (Hck-W260A mutant) and observed higher specific activity than wild-type Hck. Interestingly, this mutant was refractory to further activation following ligand binding to either the SH2 or SH3 domain, indicating a central role for Trp-260 in coupling the regulatory domains to kinase activation. We observed that Hck-W260A exhibits focus-forming activity in the Rat-2 transformation assay (data not shown). However, the resulting foci were smaller and fewer in number than those produced by the Hck linker proline and tail mutants or the combination of Hck and Nef. This difference may result from the altered accessability of the Hck-W260A SH2 and SH3 domains to critical transformation-related signaling partners.

This cornification process is tightly associated with a stepwise program of transcriptional regulation and is concurrent with the sequential induction and repression of structural and enzymatic differentiation-specific markers (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This process can be achieved in mouse keratinocytes cultivated in vitro by increasing the Ca2+ concentration from 0.05 to 0.12 mm in the culture medium (2Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), which produces a situation that mimics the endogenous Ca2+ gradient present in the skin (3Menon G.K.

Sargent T.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, ectopic expression of Dlx3 in basal cells is accompanied by the cessation of cell proliferation and the up-regulation of expression of late epidermal differentiation structural genes including profilaggrin (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A potential binding site for Dlx3 has been identified in the profilaggrin gene, suggesting that the observed up-regulation of this gene in the transgenic mice may result from a direct effect of Dlx3 (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data strongly support a role for Dlx3 as a determinant factor in the activation of expression of granular markers during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.During the process of terminal epidermal differentiation, many genes expressed in the keratinocyte are regulated at the transcriptional level (1Fuchs E.

Members of the POU family of transcription factors such as Oct1, Oct2, Oct6, Skn1a, and Skn1i have also been implicated as regulators of epidermal genes (25Blumemberg M Darmon M. Blumemberg M.

Deletional promoter analysis was utilized to delineate the sequences that regulate the transcription of Dlx3 in differentiated and undifferentiated keratinocytes. In turn, these cis-acting elements were used to identify the transcription factors that regulate the Dlx3 promoter. Importantly, we have identified a region residing between +10 and +60 that responds to the Ca2+ shift used to differentiate the keratinocytes in culture.DISCUSSIONThe cascade of events that leads to terminal differentiation can be triggered in primary mouse keratinocytes by the elevation of extracellular Ca2+. The expression of the Dlx3 homeobox gene is restricted to the suprabasal layer of the epidermis (18Morasso M. Jamrich M. Sargent T.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and this expression is dramatically increased in primary mouse keratinocytes induced to differentiate by Ca2+ in vitro. Evidence obtained in transgenic mice suggests the role of Dlx3 as a positive transcriptional activator of differentiation-specific epidermal structural genes. In an attempt to decipher the different stages of the pathway that culminate in terminal differentiation, we have cloned and characterized the upstream promoter sequence of the murine Dlx3 gene, and we determined the regulatory elements necessary for expression of the gene in keratinocytes. By sequence comparison we have found that the region close to the transcription start site of the mouse Dlx3 gene (−110 to +61) has striking homology with that of the Xenopus and human dlx3 genes. In transgenic mice, 470 bp of the Xenopus Dlx3 promoter conferred an expression pattern to the β-galactosidase reporter that was indistinguishable from that of the endogenous gene, including the Ca2+response (46Morasso M.I. Mahon K.A. Sargent T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3968-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be hypothesized that the cis- and trans-regulatory elements important in the regulation of the Dlx3 orthologs have been conserved through evolution and are contained within the proximal promoter region.To understand the mechanism(s) that control the regulation and expression of the Dlx3 promoter during epidermal differentiation, our studies examined the expression of Dlx3 promoter/CAT constructs in primary mouse keratinocytes to identify putative regulatory elements that are required for Dlx3 expression. The data presented here demonstrate the existence of one positive regulatory region in the Dlx3 promoter located between −84 and −34. We determined that the CCAAT box in this region exerts a significant positive influence on the Dlx3 promoter activity in undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. Competition gel shift analysis and supershift analysis further demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-Y is the protein that binds specifically to the CCAAT box motif. Mutation of this motif dramatically reduced transcription of the Dlx3 promoter. Several genes also contain canonical sites for CCAAT-binding proteins that have been described to be important in early functions of preinitiation complex formation (36Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CCAAT boxes are typically located within 100 bp of the transcription start sites, and CCAAT box binding factors include NF-Y (also known as CBF), C/EBP family members, and NF-1 (35Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9117-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NF-Y was originally identified as a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to the Y box motif, defined as an inverted CCAAT box motif in all major histocompatibility complex class II genes (47Glimcher L.H. Kara C.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 13-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). NF-Y is a heterotrimeric transcription factor composed of three subunits (37Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T.

Virology. 1995; 214: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) regulator of transcription. Several studies suggest that NF-Y acts by stabilizing the binding of additional factors to adjacent regulatory elements, such as RFX in the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter (53Hinkley C.

NF-Y also interacts with transcription factors binding upstream elements and basal transcription machinery, such as HNF4 and TAF100 (42Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Recently it was shown that the interaction of NF-Y with cAMP-response element-binding protein may be responsible for the gene-specific transcriptional activity of the insulin cAMP-response element (56Eggers A. Siemann G. Blume R. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18499-18508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and similar results have been reported for the albumin promoter (36Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since the expression of Dlx3 gene is epithelial specific and the activity of the Dlx3 promoter is low in the fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (data not shown), NF-Y and some interacting regulatory factors may be involved in conferring tissue- and differentiation-specific expression to the Dlx3 gene.In this study, we also demonstrate that the Sp1-binding site located between −21 and +2 positively regulates, and contributes to, the basal activity of the Dlx3 promoter in undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. The Sp1 consensus motif is highly GC-rich; therefore, certain Sp1-binding sites can overlap with other GC-rich consensus transcription factor binding motifs such as that for Ap-2. The ratio of Sp1/Ap2 might be determinant in the differentiation-specific gene expression (57Chen T.T. Wu R.L. Castro-Munozledo F. Sun T.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3056-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Many epidermal specific gene promoters contain consensus sites for ubiquitously expressed regulators such as Sp1 family members. The Sp1 family consists of four members (Sp1–Sp4; see Refs. 58Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 59Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Sp1 is involved with tissue/cell type-specific expression of certain genes in epithelial cells. In most of these cases, Sp1 alone does not affect tissue specificity but requires cooperation with other transcription factors, such as Ets in the promoter of human transglutaminase 3 (61Lee J.H.

Fabre S. Veyssiere G. Rombauts W. Jean C.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 132: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).From the family of Sp1-related transcription factors, studies have shown that Sp3 acts as an antagonist to Sp1. The human transcobalamin II gene is controlled by the relative ratios of Sp1 and Sp3 (64Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16104-16111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and activation of the human papilloma virus type 16 promoter correlates with the ratios of Sp1/Sp3 during epithelial differentiation (65Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have shown that the Sp1 consensus motif on the Dlx3 promoter can bind specifically Sp1 and Sp3, providing the possibility of antagonistic effects on transcription depending on the specific levels of each of these factors throughout the terminal differentiation process.An essential aspect of the transcriptional regulation of the Dlx3 promoter is the elucidation of the mechanism for inducing its expression by increases in external Ca2+ during differentiation. Until now, the prevailing evidence points to the involvement of PKC isozymes in the induction of keratinocyte differentiation markers by Ca2+, although the exact mechanism is unclear. In this study we show that the region located between +10 and +60 is important for Ca2+ inducibility of the Dlx3 gene. By mutational and gel shift analysis of the +30/+60 sequence, we found that the crucial element responsible for Ca2+ inducibility is located between +42 and +45 (CGAC) and that nuclear factor(s) are involved in the up-regulation of Dlx3 expression by Ca2+. It has been reported that the AP1 and Ets transcription factors are involved in the regulation of the human SPRR1A keratinocyte terminal differentiation marker (45Sark M.W.J. Fisher D.F. de Meijer E. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24683-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the Dlx3 gene, the AP1 transcription factor does not bind to the +42/+45 or +46/+52 sequences, which strongly supports that it is not the determinant for the Ca2+ inducibility of Dlx3. Future work will determine the specific nature of the nuclear factor(s) involved in the binding to this regulatory element. The identification of a Ca2+ response element in the Dlx3 gene is the first link between the extracellular signal and the transcriptional control of a regulatory gene involved in keratinocyte differentiation, and represents an important step in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental program. During epidermal differentiation, mitotically active basal keratinocytes cease to proliferate, detach from the basement membrane, and migrate through the spinous and granular layers to the outermost terminally differentiated cornified layer of the skin. This cornification process is tightly associated with a stepwise program of transcriptional regulation and is concurrent with the sequential induction and repression of structural and enzymatic differentiation-specific markers (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This process can be achieved in mouse keratinocytes cultivated in vitro by increasing the Ca2+ concentration from 0.05 to 0.12 mm in the culture medium (2Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), which produces a situation that mimics the endogenous Ca2+ gradient present in the skin (3Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ signaling differentiation pathway is associated with increased phospholipase C activity (4Punnonen K. Denning M. Lee E. Li L. Rhee S.G. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 719-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC)1 (5Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated an essential role of PKC signaling in the late stages of epidermal differentiation. Activation of PKC has been shown to be necessary for expression of late differentiation markers loricrin and profilaggrin and for the suppression of the spinous-specific markers K1 and K10 (6Dlugosz A.A.

This inherited autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by defects in ectodermal derivatives such as hair and teeth and craniofacial bone abnormalities (14Price J.A. Bowden D.W. Wright J.T. Pettenati M.J. Hart T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Dlx3 is expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis and in the hair matrix cells of the hair follicle (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J.

Dev. 1994; 48: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and there is evidence strongly supporting the critical role of the Dlx3 homeoprotein in the regulation of expression of late epidermal differentiation genes (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that Dlx3 binds to an AT-rich region and acts as a positive transcriptional regulator (17Feledy J. Morasso M.I. Jang S.-I. Sargent T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is activated during the Ca2+ shift in keratinocytes induced to differentiate in culture (18Morasso M. Jamrich M. Sargent T.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, ectopic expression of Dlx3 in basal cells is accompanied by the cessation of cell proliferation and the up-regulation of expression of late epidermal differentiation structural genes including profilaggrin (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A potential binding site for Dlx3 has been identified in the profilaggrin gene, suggesting that the observed up-regulation of this gene in the transgenic mice may result from a direct effect of Dlx3 (15Morasso M.I. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data strongly support a role for Dlx3 as a determinant factor in the activation of expression of granular markers during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.

A molar ratio of two l-Glu(γ)HXM molecules to one vanadium ion was most effective. Unlike other vanadium ligands that potentiate the insulinomimetic actions of vanadium,l-Glu(γ)HXM partially activated lipogenesis in rat adipocytes in the absence of exogenous vanadium. This effect was not manifested by d-Glu(γ)HXM. At 10–20 μml-Glu(γ)HXM, lipogenesis was activated 9–21%. This effect was approximately 9-fold higher (140 ± 15% of maximal insulin response) in adipocytes derived from rats that had been treated with vanadium for several days. Titration of vanadium(IV) withl-Glu(γ)HXM led to a rapid decrease in the absorbance of vanadium(IV) at 765 nm, and 51V NMR spectroscopy revealed that the chemical shift of vanadium(IV) at −490 ppm disappeared with the appearance of a signal characteristic to vanadium(V) (−530 ppm) upon adding one equivalent of l-Glu(γ)HXM. In summary,l-Glu(γ)HXM is highly active in potentiating vanadium-activated glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo and facilitating glucose metabolism in rat adipocytes in the absence of exogenous vanadium probably through conversion of trace intracellular vanadium into an active insulinomimetic compound. We propose that the active species is either a 1:1 or 2:1l-Glu(γ)HXM vanadium complex in which the endogenous vanadium(IV) has been altered to vanadium(V). Finally we demonstrate that l-Glu(γ)HXM- andl-Glu(γ)HXM·vanadium-evoked lipogenesis is arrested by wortmannin and that activation of glucose uptake in rat adipocytes is because of enhanced translocation of GLUT4 from low density microsomes to the plasma membrane.

Vanadium salts are seriously considered as a possible treatment for diabetes, and several clinical studies have already been performed. In those studies, because of its toxicity, only low doses of vanadium (2 mg/kg/day) were used. Although ∼20-fold lower than doses used in most animal studies, several beneficial effects were observed and documented (24Goldfine A.B. Simonson D.C. Folli F. Patti M.E. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

Similarly, chelated vanadium compounds such as bis(maltolato)oxovanadium and bis(picolinato)oxovanadium are more effective than free vanadium in reducing circulating glucose levels in hyperglycemic streptozocin-treated rats (30McNeill J.H.

Of special interest to us were vanadium chelators that synergize with vanadium both in vivo (i.e. in streptozocin rats) and in vitro (i.e. in isolated rat adipocytes) and therefore enable us to gain insight into the basic mechanism(s) by which such compounds potentiate the insulinomimetic activity of vanadium. Specifically, we have studied hydroxamic acid derivatives. These compounds are involved in the microbial transport of iron and are therefore applied therapeutically in conditions of iron deficiency (34Fishbein W.N. Strecter C.L. Daly J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Collagenase type I (134 units/mg) was obtained from Worthington. Porcine insulin was purchased from Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Phloretin, 2-deoxyglucose,l-glutamic acid(γ)-monohydroxamate,l-aspartic acid(β)monohydroxamate, glycine hydroxamate,l-isoleucine(α)hydroxamate, andl-tyrosine(α)hydroxamate were purchased from Sigma. RL-252 was prepared and characterized as described earlier (28Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Lazar R. Libman J. Shanzer A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2063-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (pH 7.4) contained 110 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mmMgSO4. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES (KRBH) buffer (pH 7.4) consisted of 117 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 4 mmKH2PO4, 30 mm HEPES. All other chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade. Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of a freshly prepared solution of streptozocin (55 mg/kg body weight) in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5 (9Meyerovitch J. Rothenberg P. Shechter Y. Bonner-Weir S. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The effect of the l-Glu(γ)HXM·vanadium complex on blood glucose level was determined 8 days after induction of diabetes by streptozocin. Rat adipocytes were prepared from the fat pads of male Wistar rats (130–150 g) by collagenase digestion according to the method of Rodbell (37Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell preparations showed more than 95% viability by Trypan blue exclusion at least 3 h after digestion. All bioassays were performed as described in figure legends. Glucose transport was carried out using 2-deoxy-d-[G-3H]glucose uptake (38Whitesell R.R. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5276-5283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lipogenesis (the incorporation of U-14C-labeled glucose into lipids) was performed according to Moody et al. (39Moody A.J. Stan M.A. Stan M. Glieman J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 6: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared rat adipocytes were suspended in KRBH, 0.7% BSA buffer and divided into about 50 plastic vials. Each vial contained 0.5 ml of adipocyte suspension (about 1.5 × 105 cells). These were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2 with 0.16 mm [U-14C]glucose. Each assay contained vials with and without 17 nm insulin and the various test compounds. Lipogenesis was terminated by adding toluene-based scintillation fluid, and the extracted lipids were counted (39Moody A.J. Stan M.A. Stan M. Glieman J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 6: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as a percent of maximal insulin response. Only assays in which insulin activated lipogenesis 5–6-fold above basal (basal ∼4000 cpm/1.5 × 105 cells/2 h, Vinsulin = 20,000–24,000 cpm/1.5 × 105 cells/2 h) were taken into consideration. Insulin activated lipogenesis in this assay at an ED50 value of 33 ± 3 pm. A concentration of 0.3 nminsulin and above already facilitated maximal (100%) response (i.e. Ref. 16Shisheva A. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8059-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Adipocytes prepared from 6-week-old rats were incubated with and without insulin and withl-Glu(γ)HXM alone and complexed with vanadate as specified in the figure. Cells were then homogenized and fractionated to low density microsomal membrane (LDM) and plasma membrane (PM) fractions by differential ultracentrifugation according to Ref. 40Hissin P.J. Foley J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Simpson I.A. Salans L., B. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Membrane proteins were then solubilized in sample buffer for 30 min at 25 °C, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and immunoblotted with anti-GLUT4 antisera (41Armoni M. Harel C. Burvin R. Karnieli E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Visualization was performed by phosphoimaging. The relative intensity of bands corresponding to GLUT4 was quantitated using MacBas 1000. The 51V NMR spectra were recorded on a 200-MHz Bruker WPS4 (4.7T) spectrometer. Spectrum width of 16,000 H3, a 90o pulse angle, and an accumulation time of 0.28 were used. The chemical shifts are reported relative to the external reference standard VOCl2(−490 ppm). In this set of experiments, rat adipocytes were incubated for 10–20 min with submaximal concentrations of vanadate (10–30 μm),l-Glu(γ)HXM (10–30 μm), or an equimolar combination of them. The capacity to activate lipogenesis relative to insulin was then determined. As shown in Fig.1, the combination was highly synergistic. For example, at 10 μm vanadate orl-Glu(γ)HXM, lipogenesis was 17 ± 3 and 9 ± 2%, respectively, whereas the combination produced a marked incredible 93 ± 4% activation of maximal insulin response. At 20 μm, the extent of lipogenesis was 37 ± 3, 20 ± 3, and 121 ± 7%, and at 30 μm, it was 42 ± 4, 23 ± 4, and 143 ± 7% of maximal. Wortmannin (100 nm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, fully blocked the activating effects of vanadate, l-Glu(γ)HXM, and its combination with vanadate (Fig. 1, right columns). Thus l-Glu(γ)HXM potentiated vanadate-evoked lipogenesis about 3.5–5-fold; the higher concentrations reached a level that is about 140% of that achieved by saturating concentrations of insulin or vanadate. A finding of significant interest to us was the ability ofl-Glu(γ)HXM to partially activate lipogenesis even in the absence of exogenous vanadium (Fig. 1). This finding is examined in great detail in connection with Fig. 6.Figure 6Activation of lipogenesis byl-Glu(γ)HXM in the absence of exogenous vanadium. Comparison to other amino acid(α)hydroxamates and ineffectiveness of the d-isomer and of chemically modified l-Glu(γ)HXM derivatives. Freshly prepared adipocytes (3 × 105 cells/ml) suspended in KRB buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.7% BSA were preincubated for 10 min with the indicated concentrations of the various test compounds. The cells were then supplemented with [U-14C]glucose (final concentration 0.16 mm), and lipogenesis was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Radioactivity incorporated into extracted lipids was then determined. Maximal response (100%) is that obtained in the presence of 17 nminsulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 2, lipogenesis in rat adipocytes was evaluated at a fixed, low concentration of vanadate (5 μm) with increasing concentrations ofl-Glu(γ)HXM. Lipogenesis was negligible at 5 μm vanadate or l-Glu(γ)HXM alone (4–6% of maximal insulin effect) but is augmented to 27.0 ± 3% when they were given in combination (at a molar stoichiometry of 1:1). At 2:1 and 3:1 Glu(γ)HXM·vanadium molar stoichiometry, lipogenesis expanded to 43 and 57%, respectively, of maximal response. Thus a substantial synergistic effect is obtained at a 1:1 molar ratio and is increased further at a 2:1 molar stoichiometry and even higher, though much less pronounced, at a 3:1 molar ratio (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows activation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by low concentrations of vanadate (20 μm), l-Glu(γ)HXM (40 μm), and by the 2:1 molar combination, of them. 2-Deoxyglucose undergoes insulin- or vanadate-evoked influx into the cell via the same transporters as glucose and is phosphorylated in situ to 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate with no further metabolism (42Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 43McLean P. Brown J. Greenbaum A.L. Dickens F. Whelan W.J. Randle P.J. Handbook of Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1968Google Scholar). Therefore, this measurement reflects an effect on glucose entry into the cell in a manner largely independent of the metabolism of the endogenous saccharide. Vanadate (20 μm) andl-Glu(γ)HXM (40 μm) affected 2-deoxyglucose uptake of 7 ± 0.7 and 31 ± 4% of maximal insulin effect, respectively. Together they caused 2-deoxyglucose uptake 117 ± 9% of maximal insulin response (Fig. 3). Incubation of rat adipocytes with l-Glu(γ)HXM andl-Glu(γ)HXM·vanadate led to a decrease in the content of GLUT4 in the LDM fraction and an increase in the PM fraction (Fig.4). The decrease in GLUT4 content in the low density lipoprotein fraction amounted to 32 ± 3, 3 ± 1, and 68 ± 5% of maximal insulin response upon incubating the cells with l-Glu(γ)HXM (40 μm), vanadate (20 μm, not shown), and the combination, respectively (calculated from Fig. 4). Under similar experimental conditions,l-Glu(γ)HXM, vanadate, and the combination activated 2-deoxyglucose uptake to an extent of 31 ± 4, 7 ± 0.7, and 117 ± 9% of maximal insulin response (Fig. 3), suggesting a contributing effect of the complex to glucose influx in addition to its effect in recruiting GLUT4 transporters from the low density lipoprotein to the PM fraction. 2I. Goldwaser, J. Li, E. Gershonov, M. Armoni, E. Karnieli, M. Fridkin, and Y. Shechter, manuscript in preparation. In the experiments summarized in Fig. 5, streptozocin-treated rats received intraperitoneally sodium metavanadate (0.05 mmol/kg body weight), l-Glu(γ)HXM (0.1 mmol/kg body weight), or a combination of the two compounds 8 days after the induction of diabetes. As shown in the figure, vanadate andl-Glu(γ)HXM, at these concentrations, had a rather minor effect in reducing the high circulating glucose levels characterizing these hyperglycemic rats. The combination, however, was highly efficient at normalizing blood glucose levels. Normoglycemia was evident 1 day after the first administration and remained so following two more administrations. The glucose levels then remained close to normal for the next 3 days (Fig. 5). l-glutamic acid(γ)HXM also activated lipogenesis in the absence of added vanadium, and this effect was studied in detail (Fig. 6). The dose-response curve (Fig. 6 A) indicates that activation is already evident at 5 μml-Glu(γ)HXM and that higher concentrations reach a level of 40 ± 7% of maximal insulin response (median effective dose = 35 ± 4 μm). Other amino acid hydroxamates such asl-Tyr(α)HXM, Gly(α)HXM, and l-Ile(α)HXM also activated lipogenesis, but they were considerably less potent (ED50 = 250 ± 30 μm, 40 ± 5% of maximal insulin effect). l-Aspartic acid β-monohydroxamate showed higher lipogenic activity compared with the α-amino acid hydroxamates and was slightly less potent thanl-Glu(γ)HXM (ED50 = 45 ± 7 μm, Fig. 6 B).N-acetyl-l-Glu(γ)HXM andl-Glu(γ)HXM-α-methyl ester were virtually ineffective, indicating the need for a free α-amino and, to a somewhat lesser extent, a free α-carboxyl moiety for the activation of lipogenesis byl-Glu(γ)HXM in the rat adipose cell (Fig. 6 C). Stereospecificity appears crucial as well, because thed-isomer of Glu(γ)HXM was ineffective. All these findings indicate that activation of lipogenesis by l-Glu(γ)HXM depends on a specific entry of this l-amino acid analog into the adipose cell. Further investigation has led us to suggest thatl-Glu(γ)HXM enters the adipose cell primarily through the non-Na+-dependent glutamine transport system.2 Several organic chelators, which potentiate the insulinomimetic activity of vanadium either in vitro or in vivo, have been documented. These include acetylacetonate (29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), maltol (30McNeill J.H. Yuen V.G. Hoveyda H.R.

Biochem. 1995; 153: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), picolinate (32Sakurai H. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 3: 35-36Google Scholar, 33Sakurai H. Fujii K. Watanabe H. Tamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and RL-252 (28Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Lazar R. Libman J. Shanzer A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2063-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6 D, we have examined whether they are capable of activating lipogenesis in the absence of exogenous vanadium. Unlike l-Glu(γ)HXM, none of these agents were able to activate lipogenesis in the rat adipose cell at concentrations of 100 μm (Fig. 6 D) or lower (not shown). The findings presented in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 have taught us that l-Glu(γ)HXM potentiates the insulinomimetic potency of vanadium and that activation of lipogenesis byl-Glu(γ)HXM alone never exceeds 40 ± 7% of maximal insulin effect (Fig. 6). To examine whetherl-Glu(γ)HXM-evoked lipogenesis can be affected by the level of intracellular vanadium, a group of male Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous administrations of vanadate (0.1 mmol/kg/day) over a period of 5 days to raise the level of endogenous vanadium. Rats were then sacrificed 7 h after the last administration. Adipocytes were prepared, and the effect of l-Glu(γ)HXM on lipogenesis was compared with that in nontreated freshly prepared adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 7, vanadium-enriched adipocytes became dramatically sensitive tol-Glu(γ)HXM-evoked lipogenesis. This was valid both in terms of a leftward shift in the dose-response curve tol-Glu(γ)HXM (ED50 = 6.4 ± 0.3 μm versus ED50 = 35 ± 4 μm in control adipocytes) and in terms of the degree of lipogenesis (145 ± 15 versus 40 ± 7% of maximal insulin response, i.e. Fig. 6). At 10 μm,l-Glu(γ)HXM already stimulated lipogenesis and amounted to 120% of maximal insulin effect in the vanadium-enriched adipose cells (as opposed to only 8.0 ± 1.5% in control adipocytes) (Fig. 7). Previously we found in cell-free experiments that vanadium(IV), at neutral pH values, undergoes slow spontaneous oxidation to vanadium(V). This occurs similarly in the presence of 10 mm reduced glutathione, an ineffectual reductant of vanadium(V), at neutral pH values with a t12 value of 1 ± 0.1 h at 25 °C (29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The results summarized in Fig.8 show the V51 NMR spectra of vanadium dichloride(IV) at pH 7.0 prior to and after the addition ofl-Glu(γ)HXM. Vanadium dichloride(IV) appeared as a single peak with a chemical shift of −490 ppm in its 51V spectrum, indicating one main species present at >95% purity. Upon the addition of l-Glu(γ)HXM (1 equivalent), the chemical shift of vanadium(IV) at −490 ppm disappeared within minutes and the principal chemical shift characterizing vanadium(V) at −530 ppm appeared (Fig. 8). Vanadium(IV) (i.e. vanadyl sulphate or VOCl2) has a characteristic “blue” absorbance with ε765 nm = 14 ± 0.3, whereas vanadium(V) does not absorb at all at this wavelength (29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The addition of 2–3 equivalents ofl-Glu(γ)HXM to VOCl2(IV) (50 mmat pH 7.5) led rapidly to a near total decrease in vanadium(IV) absorbance at 765 nm (Fig. 9). Fig.8 B depicts complex formation as a function of the pH in the range of pH 2–9. Decrease is minimal at pH 4.0, quite significant at pH 5.0, half-maximal at pH 5.7, and reaches a stable plateau at pH range 7–9 (Fig. 9 B). It has been consistently observed that chelated vanadium compounds are more potent than the free metaloxide in facilitating the metabolic actions of insulin. This was demonstrated in vitro with systems like rat adipocytes, as well as in diabetic rodents such as streptozocin-treated hyperglycemic rats (28Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Lazar R. Libman J. Shanzer A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2063-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y.

Chem. 1994; 37: 876-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because of the variations in the experimental models used, the oxidation state of vanadium applied, and the different administration modes, the basis for the higher insulinomimetic potencies of complexed vanadium remained rather speculative. Because this topic has immediate therapeutic relevance, we looked for new vanadium chelators characterized by: (a) higher synergistic potencies than previously documented for vanadium chelators with respect to vanadium-evoked glucose uptake and glucose metabolism both in vitro and in diabetic rats in vivo, (b) low indices of toxicity, and (c) reasonable solubility in aqueous, neutral media after complexation with vanadium. In this study, we have introduced the l-isomer of glutamic acid(γ)monohydroxamate as it satisfactorily fulfilled the above criteria. It potentiated vanadium-activated hexose uptake, glucose metabolism, and recruitment of GLUT4 transporters from LDM to PM fractions (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In vivo it potentiated the efficacy of vanadium to lower blood glucose levels in streptozocin rats (Fig.5). This amino acid analog has negligible toxicity in mammals.2 Both l-Glu(γ)HXM alone and its complexes with vanadium are fairly soluble in aqueous media at neutral pH values. An important finding was that l-Glu(γ)HXM alone, in the absence of exogenous vanadium, showed a reasonable amount of insulinomimetic activity in that it activated glucose uptake and glucose metabolism in the rat adipose cell (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Further investigation revealed that this activating effect is unique to thel-isomer of Glu(γ)HXM but is not facilitated by thed-isomer. Nonmodified α-amino and α-carboxyl moieties appear essential. This intrinsic activity is exclusive tol-Glu(γ)HXM not being shared by any of the other vanadium chelators that potentiate the actions of vanadium in vivo or in vitro (Fig. 6, A–D, and Refs. 28Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Lazar R. Libman J. Shanzer A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2063-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y.

Our assumption that l-Glu(γ)HXM permeates into the cell interior and transforms the “dormant” intracellular vanadium pool into an insulinomimetic-activated species gains credence from the dramatic sensitization of vanadium-enriched adipocytes tol-Glu(γ)HXM-evoked lipogenesis (Fig. 7). It should be mentioned at this point that because of the extreme complexity of aqueous vanadium chemistry (reviewed in Refs. 46Macara J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 47Crans D.C. Comm. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 16: 1-33Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 48Crans D.C. Mahroof Tahir M. Keramidas A.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 153: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 49Dekoch R.J. West D.J. Cannon J.C. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4347-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the intracellular milieu of the mammalian cell is still “a black box” with respect to the state and the form of entered vanadium. With the endogenously present vanadium pool, experiments have shown that it exists mostly as vanadium(IV), though some researchers may wonder even about this experimental finding because vanadium in its IV oxidation state is only stable at acidic pH values (pH < 3.0) and readily oxidizes to vanadium(V) at neutral pH even in the presence of high glutathione concentrations (28Shechter Y. Shisheva A. Lazar R. Libman J. Shanzer A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2063-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 46Macara J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The intracellular vanadium pool, however, can be preserved in its IV oxidation form at neutral pH values if it is chelated by ascorbic acid (not shown) or to endogenous proteins (50Casteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. II. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar, 51Crans D.C. Bunch R.L. Theisen L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7607Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At the low physiological level of intracellular vanadium, the cell should have the capacity to chelate all the endogenous vanadium. Our experimental findings that l-Glu(γ)HXM alone enhances glucose uptake and glucose metabolism (Figs. 1 and 2) together with the apparent rapid conversion of vanadium(IV) to vanadium(V) upon complexation (Figs. 8 and 9) strongly support the contention that vanadium(V) rather than vanadium(IV), and in a chelated form, is the active insulinomimetic species that facilitates the activation of glucose uptake and its metabolism in rat adipocytes. Although most of our previous cell-free experiments support this conclusion, we were not fully convinced prior to the completion of this study. This is because protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases (with p- nitrophenylphosphate as a substrate) are inhibited by both vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V), free or chelated, at nearly the same concentrations (see Ref. 52Li J. Elberg G. Sekar N. bin He Z. Shechter Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2274-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, adipose nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, whether cytosolic or membranal, are with one exception activated by vanadium(V) but not at all by vanadium(IV) (22Elberg G. Li J. Shechter Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9521-9527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Elberg G. He Z. Li J. Sekar N. Shechter Y. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1684-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have only observed vanadium(IV)-evoked activation of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases when membranal protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases were extracted with Triton X-100 and added to the cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinase fraction (29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These experimental conditions, however, are not likely to occur in the intact cell system. For example, broken plasma membrane fragments (or deoxycholate-treated membranal fragments) did not support activation of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases in the presence of vanadium(IV) (29Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In summary, l-Glu(γ)HXM appears superior to previously documented organic chelators of vanadium in potentiating its activation of glucose uptake and glucose metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Taken together with earlier studies, this may be attributed to one or more of the following: (a) increased efficiency of this specific combination to permeate into cells or tissues; (b) a favorable 5-coordinated, rather than octahedral topography of this complex in an aqueous, neutral environment (Ref. 50Casteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. II. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar);2 and/or (c) higher intracellular stability of the l-Glu(γ)HXM-vanadium complex. Finally, we have recently observed that vanadate does not inhibit alkaline phosphatase in the presence ofl-Glu(γ)HXM.2 This inhibitory effect of vanadate (53Lopez V. Stevens T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) is undesirable from our point of view as it may contribute to vanadium toxicity in mammals, but not to the efficacy of vanadium to manifest the metabolic actions of insulin (reviewed in Ref.54Elberg E. Li J. Shechter Y. Nriagu J.O. Vanadium in the Environment. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 277-296Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1976017223,"Two invariant tryptophan residues on the N-terminal extracellular region of the rat α1 subunit, Trp-69 and Trp-94, are critical for the assembly of the GABAA(γ-aminobutyric acid, type A) receptor into a pentamer. These tryptophans are common not only to all GABAA receptor subunits, but also to all ligand-gated ion channel subunits. Converting each Trp residue to Phe and Gly by site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to study the role of these invariant tryptophan residues. Mutant α1 subunits, coexpressed with β2 subunits in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, displayed high affinity binding to [3H]muscimol, a GABA site ligand, but no binding to [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate, a ligand for the receptor-associated ion channel. Neither [3H]muscimol binding to intact cells nor immunostaining of nonpermeabilized cells gave evidence of surface expression of the receptor. When expressed with β2 and γ2 polypeptides, the mutant α1 polypeptides did not form [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites though wild-type α1 polypeptides did. The distribution of the mutant receptors on sucrose gradients suggests that the effects on ligand binding result from the inability of the mutant α1 subunits to form pentamers. We conclude that Trp-69 and Trp-94 participate in the formation of the interface between α and β subunits, but not of the GABA binding site. Two invariant tryptophan residues on the N-terminal extracellular region of the rat α1 subunit, Trp-69 and Trp-94, are critical for the assembly of the GABAA(γ-aminobutyric acid, type A) receptor into a pentamer. These tryptophans are common not only to all GABAA receptor subunits, but also to all ligand-gated ion channel subunits.

Along with the nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine, and serotonin (5HT3) receptors, the GABAA receptor belongs to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, all of which share significant sequence and structural features (1Barnard E.A.

Molecular cloning has led to the identification of nine genes that encode distinct GABAA receptor polypeptides, including six α, four β, three γ, one δ, three ρ, one ε, and one π polypeptides. Several splice variants are also known, suggesting that a large number of heteropentameric isoforms could form (4Tyndale R.F. Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels.

The actual diversity of GABAA receptors in the brain depends on the precise processes of receptor assembly. The N-terminal segments of the receptor subunits contain signals for subunit oligomerization (13Hackam A.S. Wang T.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the specific domains responsible for receptor assembly are not yet known. Extensive mutagenesis studies performed on GABAA receptors have led to the identification of specific residues responsible for GABA binding on the interface of the α and β subunits and for benzodiazepine binding on the interface of the γ and α subunits (14Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol.

Two of these residues, Phe-64 and His-101 on the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor, were also identified by photoaffinity labeling studies using [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam to contribute to the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites, respectively (15Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 17Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although these residues apparently contribute to separate binding pockets for the receptor agonist and allosteric modulator respectively, they are separated by only 37 amino acid residues, and as indicated in Fig. 1, four of these residues are identical not only among all GABAA receptor subunits, but also among all ligand-gated ion channel subunits. This constancy suggests selective value, and we reasoned that these residues are likely to play a critical role in GABAA receptor function. In particular, Smith and Olsen (15Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that the two tryptophan residues, Trp-69 and Trp-94, because of their bulky and unique structure, may define a functional domain that is critical for channel opening. Galzi and Changeux (16Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have proposed that both these invariant Trp residues behave as “structural canonical residues” that constrain the folding of the loops. If indeed this is the case, mutating the Trp residues could affect the folding of the loops and alter the conformational characteristics of the receptor. We have tested this hypothesis by mutating Trp-69 and Trp-94 into Phe and Gly and then studying the effects of each of these mutations on the binding characteristics and assembly of the GABAA receptor. The epitope tag and point mutations were introduced in the cDNA for the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor using the Altered Sites® II in vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega, Madison, WI). First, the entire coding region of the α1 subunit was subcloned into pALTER, and a 10-amino acid 9E10 epitope (EQKLISEEDL) from c-Myc was introduced between residues 4 and 5 of the mature peptide as described in the manual using the mutagenic oligonucleotide, GTCCTTAAGTTCATCTAGATCTTCTTCTGATATTAGCTTT TGTTCTTGGGAGGGCTGTC. Specific point mutations were incorporated in a second round of mutagenesis performed on the epitope-tagged α1 subunit construct using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: W94F, AAATGTATCTGGAGTAAAGATTTTACTGGCCAT; W94G, AAATGTATCTGGAGTCCCGATTTTACTGGCCAT; W69F, TAATCTTTCATCCTTAAAGCTTTGGCGGAAAAA; W69G, TAATCTTTCATCCTTCCCGCTTTGGCGGAAAA. Positive clones were identified by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. Sf9 cells (Pharmingen, San Diego CA) were maintained in serum-free XL-400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) in shaking culture at 26 °C as described previously (19O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). cDNAs for the β2 and either wild-type or mutant α1 subunits were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer plasmid, pAcAB3, under the control of the p10 and polh promoters, respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed by homologous recombination between the transfer vector and linearized BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) using a liposome-mediated transfection protocol. After 5 days, the supernatant was collected to harvest recombinant viruses, which were then amplified to produce a high titer stock (0.5–1 × 108 plaque-forming unit/ml). GABAA receptors were produced by infecting Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus (containing cDNAs for both subunits) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. In experiments testing for [3H]flunitrazepam binding, cells were coinfected with a recombinant γ2 virus in addition to the virus encoding the wild-type or mutant α1 and β2 subunits. Infected cells were harvested at 60 h post-infection by pelleting the cells at 1000 ×g for 10 min. Cell pellets were stored at −20 °C until ready to use. Membranes of Sf9 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant α1 along with β2 subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the polyclonal anti-myc tag antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radioligand binding assays were performed either on lysed cell membranes or on intact cells. Cell membranes were prepared by homogenizing the cell pellet for 10 s in membrane wash buffer (20 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer with 50 mm KCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% NaN3, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine chloride, 0.1 mm benzethonium chloride, 50 units/ml bacitracin, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor). The membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and used for the binding assays. For whole cell binding, the frozen cell pellet was thawed, resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer with 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5, to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and used for the binding assays. Binding assays were carried out using an appropriate concentration of the radioligand in 10 mm phosphate buffer with 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5, and 100 μg of total membrane protein in a total volume of 250 μl. Triplicate samples were incubated with either 20 nm [3H]muscimol, 10 nm[3H]flunitrazepam, or 5 nm[35S]TBPS at 4 °C for 30 min ([3H]muscimol) or 60 min ([3H]flunitrazepam) or at room temperature for 90 min ([35S]TBPS). The reaction mixtures were diluted with 4 ml of assay buffer and filtered under vacuum over Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed twice with 4 ml of assay buffer and counted for radioactivity. Undisplaceable background was estimated in the presence of 100 μm GABA, 10 μm diazepam, or 100 μm picrotoxin, respectively, and was subtracted from total binding to compute specific binding. GABA displacement assays were conducted using 20 nm [3H]muscimol and nonradioactive GABA concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 0.1 mm. Dose-response profiles were generated by fitting the data to a three-parameter Hill equation. Sf9 cells were seeded on each well of poly-d-lysine-treated eight-well chamber slides. The cells were infected with appropriate baculovirus constructs and incubated at 26 °C for 60 h. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed three times with 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and blocked using 3% fetal calf serum. Incubations with the polyclonal anti-myc tag antibodies at a dilution of 1:250 were carried out overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed extensively and treated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:200 for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed extensively and examined using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 310). Membranes were prepared from infected cells as described for the binding assays. An equal volume of 2× solubilization buffer (20 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 2% Triton X-100, 200 mm KCl, containing 0.02% NaN3, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and various protease inhibitors as described for the membrane preparation) was added, and the homogenate was solubilized during magnetic stirring at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and concentrated to about one-fifth of its original volume in Centriprep-30 concentrators. The concentrated solubilized protein solution was layered on top of a 3–30% sucrose gradient made of solubilization buffer containing only 0.1% Triton X-100. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 40 h at 34,500 rpm. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the top of the tube, precipitated following a chloroform-methanol protocol (20Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar), and analyzed by Western blots using the anti-myc tag antibody as described earlier. The intensity of the bands was quantitated by densitometry. Cytochrome c (1.9 S), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.4 S), and catalase (11.4 S) were run as standards, in parallel in a separate tube. The positions of the standards in the gradient were determined by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of several GABAA receptor subunits and some examples of ligand-gated ion channels in a region flanked by the [3H]muscimol-photoaffinity-labeled peptide, Tyr-59 to Gln-67 (17Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the [3H]flunitrazepam-labeled peptide, Trp-94 to Asn-102 (15Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 18Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M. J. Biol.

This region shows high sequence identity, not only among the GABAA receptor subunits, but also among all ligand-gated ion channels. To explore the role of Trp-69 and Trp-94 in α1 polypeptides, we mutated these residues to Phe (to retain the hydrophobicity) and Gly (to eliminate steric factors). After expressing the mutant α1 polypeptides either with β2 alone or with β2 and γ2 polypeptides, we examined the binding characteristics and assembly of the mutant receptors. GABAA receptors expressed in Sf9 and in mammalian cells showed appropriate binding and functional characteristics. Co-expression of α1 and β2 polypeptides produced GABAA receptors that bound [3H]muscimol and [35S]TBPS and that also showed GABA-activated chloride currents. Individual α1 or β2 polypeptides did not bind either ligand and did not show any GABA-activated currents. Co-expression of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits formed functional receptors, which also showed [3H]flunitrazepam binding and GABA-activated currents that were enhanced by benzodiazepines 2Presented as a poster at the Society of Neuroscience Meeting, November 1994, Miami Beach, FL (29Hales T.G.

Channels. 1996; 4: 179-195PubMed Google Scholar). To aid in the biochemical analyses and subcellular localization of the α1 subunits of the GABAA receptor, we introduced a 9E10 epitope tag at the N-terminal of the mature wild-type α1 peptide, and we expressed this construct along with the β2 subunit in Sf9 cells. The epitope tag had no effect on either GABA affinity in Sf9 cells (data not shown) or on the functional characteristics of the receptor expressed in A293 cells (23Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We incorporated all four mutations into the epitope-tagged α1 polypeptide to facilitate detection by Western blots and subcellular localization. All mutant α1 subunits were expressed and could be detected by antibodies that recognized the myc epitope tag on Western blots (Fig. 2). The antibody did not recognize the untagged α1 subunit or the β2 subunit. Homogenates of cells expressing the four mutant α1 subunits (Trp-69 and Trp-94 each converted to Phe and Gly) along with β2 subunits showed binding to [3H]muscimol, a GABA site ligand (Fig. 3 A). This result was reproducible in many experiments, with different batches of viruses. The density of [3H]muscimol binding sites varied between batches of cells and viruses and reflects differences in the Bmax values of the expressed receptor. We determined the affinity of the mutant receptors for GABA by GABA displacement of [3H]muscimol binding (TableI). There was no significant change in the GABA affinity of the [3H]muscimol binding sites formed by the Trp-94 mutants. The Trp-69 mutants, however, showed a slight increase in GABA affinity. Taken together, these data suggest the formation of a relatively normal GABA binding site despite the mutation of the α1 subunit near α1F64, a residue implicated in GABA binding.Table IIC50 for GABA inhibition of [3H]muscimol binding to α1W69 and α1W94 mutants when expressed with β2 subunitsIC50μmα193.2 ± 25α19E1064.8 ± 8.5W94F77.9 ± 6.4W94G60.3 ± 8W69F14.0 ± 1.2W69G36.6 ± 11Increasing concentrations of GABA were used to displace [3H]muscimol binding to membranes of Sf9 cells expressing wild-type or mutant α1 subunits along with β2 subunits.

Open table in a new tab Increasing concentrations of GABA were used to displace [3H]muscimol binding to membranes of Sf9 cells expressing wild-type or mutant α1 subunits along with β2 subunits. The IC50 was the concentration of GABA required to displace 50% of control binding. IC50 values represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments in triplicates. Interestingly, the α1W69 and α1W94 mutants behaved differently from the wild-type α1 subunits with respect to three other binding characteristics. When expressed with β2 subunits, all α1 mutants could not bind [35S]TBPS, a ligand that recognizes the chloride channel (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore no significant [3H]muscimol binding was detected on the surfaces of intact cells coexpressing mutant α1 and β2 subunits (Fig.3 B). Finally, expression of the Trp-69 and Trp-94 mutant α1 subunits with β2 and γ2 subunits yielded no [3H]flunitrazepam binding (Fig. 3 C). When α1 and β2 subunits are expressed independently in cells, they are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but when they are expressed simultaneously, both subunits are targeted to the cell surface (23Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of mutant α1 subunits to target to the cell surface with an antibody that recognizes the myc epitope tag, 9E10. Surface expression was detected by immunostaining nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 4, panels A1–H1). We confirmed that the Sf9 cells were expressing the appropriate peptide by processing permeabilized cells in parallel (Fig. 4, panels A2–H2). In cells that express only epitope-tagged α1 (α19E10), we found epitope-tagged peptide only in permeabilized cells (Fig. 4, panel A1) and not in the nonpermeabilized sample (Fig. 4, panel A2). This result confirmed that expression of the α1 polypeptide alone resulted in an intracellular localization of the α1 subunit. As expected, the anti-myc antibody did not recognize the β2 subunit (Fig. 4, panels B1 and B2) or the untagged α1 subunit (Fig. 4, panels C1 and C2). Cells that simultaneously expressed wild-type α19E10 and β2 subunits showed antibody staining even in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 4, panels D1 and D2), confirming surface expression. Similar results were observed using bd17, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the β2 subunit (data not shown). Fig. 4, panels E1 through H1 and E2 through H2, show the localization of the α1W69 and α1W94 mutants expressed with the β2 subunits. In all cases, no immunostaining was observed in nonpermeabilized cells indicating that the mutant α1 subunits were deficient in their targeting to the cell surface. Peptide expression, as well as antibody reaction, was confirmed by positive staining in permeabilized cells (Fig. 4, panels E1–H1). Similar results were observed with bd17, which recognizes the β2 subunit (data not shown). To identify the oligomeric species formed by the mutant α1 polypeptides, we solubilized Sf9 cells that produced α19E10β2, α19E10(W69G)β2 and α19E10(W94G)β2 receptors and loaded the solubilized extracts on to sucrose gradients. We analyzed sucrose gradient fractions collected by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody (Fig.5). The α1W94G and α1W69G polypeptides formed oligomers that were most concentrated in fraction 8, while wild-type α19E10β2 receptor was most concentrated in fraction 13. Based on the sedimentation velocity of known markers, the sedimentation coefficients of polypeptides in these fractions were 5.3 and 8.7 S. Similar results were obtained by monitoring the migration of the β2 subunits using the monoclonal antibody, bd17 (data not shown). Knight et al. (24Knight A.R. Hartnett C. Marks C. Brown M. Gallager D. Tallman J. Ramabhadran T.V. Recept. Channels. 1998; 6: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar) have identified a pentameric species of GABAA receptors expressed in Sf9 cells that migrates at about 8.8 S. Thus, the α19E10β2 receptors probably migrated as pentamers. The receptors that contain the α1W69 and α1W94 mutations did not have the same sedimentation coefficient as the pentameric α19E10β2 receptor. Instead, they formed smaller oligomers, probably dimers, which may be the [3H]muscimol binding species. [3H]Muscimol binding was lost on solubilization of cells coexpressing the mutant α1 and β2 subunits, preventing us from monitoring the [3H]muscimol binding species on the sucrose gradient. The GABAA receptor gene family forms a subset of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. At least 19 genes encode distinct GABAA receptor subunits, which can form a large number of heteropentamers (4Tyndale R.F. Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. North R.A. Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 265-305Google Scholar). Since the channel characteristics and pharmacology of the receptor depend on its subunit composition (25Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 26Luddens H. Korpi E.R. Seeburg P.H. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar), a major challenge to understanding the physiological and pharmacological diversity of GABAA receptors is determining the control of receptor assembly. Our data suggest the identity of a domain on the α1 subunit that is necessary for the formation of an interface between the α1 and the β2 subunits. We designed mutations to probe the role of two invariant tryptophan residues, Trp-69 and Trp-94, on the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor. These residues are close to α1F64 and α1H101, the residues photolabeled by [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, respectively. To facilitate immunodetection, we introduced all these mutations into an epitope-tagged α1 subunit, α19E10. When expressed with β2 subunits, the Trp-69 and Trp-94 mutant α1 subunits formed a normal GABA binding site, which bound [3H]muscimol with normal affinity (Table I). But the mutants were completely unable to bind [35S]TBPS, a ligand that binds the chloride ionophore (Fig. 3 A). The mutant α1 polypeptides, when expressed with β2 and γ2 polypeptides, were unable to bind the benzodiazepine ligand, [3H]flunitrazepam (Fig. 3 C). Analysis of the oligomer sizes by velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients of detergent-solubilized membranes indicated that the mutant polypeptides did not form pentamers (Fig. 5). Mutant α1 subunits associate with β2 subunits to form a species that is smaller than pentamers and binds [3H]muscimol but not [35S]TBPS, and when expressed with β2 and γ2 subunits, this species cannot bind [3H]flunitrazepam, suggesting that [35S]TBPS and [3H]flunitrazepam only recognize pentameric species, while [3H]muscimol will bind to smaller intermediates. These results are consistent with the studies of Im et al. (12Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which showed that a tandem construct of α6 and β2 subunits expressed in HEK293 cells could not by itself form pentamers (channels), although it retained the ability to bind muscimol. The Trp-69 and Trp-94 mutations compromised the ability of the α1 polypeptides to assemble with β2 or β2 and γ2 polypeptides to form a pentamer. For GABAA receptors, only the α1β2 and α1β2γ2 combinations were detected on the surface of cells. Monomers, or α1γ2 and β2γ2 combinations remained in the endoplasmic reticulum (23Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these were the only combinations that could form pentamers (9Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that only fully assembled pentameric GABAA receptors are capable of surface expression. The α1W69 and α1W94 mutants showed no cell surface binding (Fig. 3 C) or immunostaining (Fig. 4) when expressed with β2 subunits, consistent with their inability to assemble to form pentamers as confirmed by sucrose gradients (Fig. 5). Since the GABA binding site lies on the interface of the α and β subunits, and since the mutant α1 subunits expressed with the β2 subunits bind [3H]muscimol, the GABA binding interface is unaffected by the Trp-69 and Trp-94 mutations. The failure of these subunits to assemble into pentamers suggests that the other interface involving β-α interactions must not have formed. If we call the interface on which the GABA binding site lies the “α → β interface,” the α1W69 and α1W94 mutations prevent the assembly of the subunits into pentamers by interfering with the formation of the “β → α interface” (Fig. 6 A). Fig.6 B shows one possible scheme for the assembly of a receptor composed of two α and three β subunits and the point at which assembly of the receptor into a pentamer can be blocked by the mutant α1 subunits. A receptor composed of three α and two β subunits would not assemble into pentamers by a similar mechanism. The γ subunit is unable to rescue the altered α1 subunits created by the Trp-94 mutations, since mutant α1 subunits are unable to form [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites when expressed with β2 and γ2 subunits. This can be attributed to one of two reasons: (i) they are unable to form a γ → α interface, or (ii) the α1 mutants are unable to form pentamers due to a compromised β → α interface. In either case, no [3H]flunitrazepam binding can be detected due to the absence of a pentamer. Several recent reports in the literature have identified critical Trp residues involved in protein-protein interactions (28Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Our inference that mutations in α1W69 and α1W94 disrupt subunit interactions in the GABAA receptor is consistent with the known roles of tryptophan in protein-protein interactions. Trp-69 and Trp-94 may both lie at the β → α interface, although the Trp-69 residue more probably lies in close proximity to the α → β interface. Alternately, these residues may demarcate a region necessary for appropriate interactions of the α1 subunit at the β → α interface. These residues could play a structural role and the lack of assembly of the subunits could be the result of misfolding of the protein in this region flanked by Trp-69 and Trp-94. If the mutant α1 peptides are folded improperly, however, the disruption is likely to be local, since the α1 peptide is still able to form a normal [3H]muscimol binding site. The only detectable difference in the effect of the mutagenesis of the two W residues was in the affinity of the [3H]muscimol binding species for GABA (Table I). The α1W69 mutants expressed with β2 had a higher affinity for GABA than the wild-type receptors, as well as the α1W94 mutants. This change in affinity may be evidence of the role of Trp-69 in conformational coupling, an effect that is masked by the more dramatic effect of preventing the assembly of the subunits into pentamers. Residues Trp-69 and Trp-94 are invariant, not only in all GABAA receptor subunits, but also among all ligand-gated ion channel subunits (Fig. 1). If the two Trp residues perform the same function in all these proteins, as is suggested by their constancy, then this region may contribute to the assembly of all members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. This model is consistent with the proposal of Galzi and Changeux (16Galzi J.-L. Changeux J.-P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 554-565Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) that these two tryptophan residues are structural canonical residues, suggesting that they play the same role in all ligand-gated ion channel receptor subunits. In conclusion, α1W69 and α1W94 either directly contribute to or demarcate a region of the α1 subunit forming the β → α interface and possibly also the γ → α interface. Mutagenesis of these residues destroys the β → α or γ → α interface and prevents the assembly of the mutant α1 subunit into pentamers. Homologous regions on other GABAA receptor subunits are also likely to perform the same function."

Substrate recognition requires two helical turns of an A-form RNA helix, and processing occurs with a consensus 2-nucleotide, 3′-recessive, staggered cut creating 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini (11Dunn J.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15, Part B. Academic Press, New York1982: 485-499Google Scholar, 12Robertson H.D. Cell. 1982; 30: 669-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The E. coli RNase III holoenzyme is a homodimer of 52 kDa that binds dsRNA1 in a quasi-symmetrical fashion concentrical of the scissile phosphodiester bonds (13Li H. Nicholson A.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RNase III binding is dependent on a conserved dsRNA-binding motif present in the C-terminal end that forms an α-β-β-β-α fold (14Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Binding of dsRNA is believed to occur primarily via non-electrostatic interactions with a helical arrangement of 2′-hydroxyl groups in the minor groove as described for the dsRNA-binding motif binding of the mammalian dsRNA-activated protein kinase, PKR (15Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 33: 9983-9994Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, a lysine residue may be required for dsRNA binding, similar to what has been observed for the staufen protein from Drosophila (16Bycroft M. Grünert S. Murzin A.G. Proctor M. Johnston D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and PKR (17Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 18Green S.R.

Binding of the dsRBD of RNA-binding protein A from Xenopus laevis to dsRNA has shown that two regions of the dsRBD contact successive minor grooves on the same face of the double-stranded RNA helix, whereas a third region contacts the spanning major groove (20Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the recent finding of binding sequence anti-determinants in dsRNA that abolish RNase III cleavage in vitro (21Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) emphasizes the subtleties of substrate recognition by RNase III and may explain why certain dsRNA sequences like the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 TAR RNA hairpin are inherently refractory to processing (4Rotondo G. Huang J.Y. Frendewey D. RNA. 1997; 3: 1182-1193PubMed Google Scholar). Complete or partial duplexes of ≥20 bp formed between antisense RNAs and their target RNAs are efficiently processed by RNase III (22Krinke L. Wulff D.L.

Franch T. Pedersen K. Mikkelsen N.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) exists in three forms with alternative configurations and translational capacities (28Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sok antisense RNA consists of an 11-nucleotide 5′-single-stranded tail that is responsible for the initial interaction with hok mRNA and a hairpin that functions as a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator (Fig.1 A). Sok RNA represses hok translation by forming a 63-bp duplex with hok mRNA (Fig. 1 C). The duplex is cleaved by RNase III in vivo and in vitro (26Gerdes K. Nielsen A.K. Thorsted P. Wagner E.G.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since formation of RNA/RNA binding intermediates could be faster than the formation of a full duplex between Sok RNA and hok mRNA, inactivation of the target RNA could occur prior to complete duplex formation, as in the cases of several other antisense RNA-regulated gene systems (29Brantl S. Wagner E.G.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test this, we constructed a chimeric antisense RNA (CA-RNA) consisting of the 13-nucleotide 5′-tail of Sok fused to the terminator hairpin of PndB, an antisense RNA from plasmid R483 that is homologous to Sok (Fig. 1 B). CA-RNA forms a 13-base pair duplex with hok mRNA, thereby resulting in the generation of a three-way junction (Fig. 1 D, left panel). This complex mimics the naturally occurring binding intermediate between hok mRNA and Sok antisense RNA (Fig. 1 D, right panel). Surprisingly, CA-RNA was able to inhibit hok expression in vivo, 2T. Thisted, unpublished data.2T. Thisted, unpublished data. thus questioning the actual mechanism of hok target inactivation by Sok RNA. Here, we have compared the effect of Sok RNA and CA-RNA on hok mRNA metabolism in rnc + and rnc − strains. Complexes between antisense and target RNAs that correspond to the RNA complexes observed in vivo were assayed for RNase III binding and processing in vitro. Intriguingly, all data support a model in which RNase III recognizes and cleaves coaxially stacked RNA helices. Uniformly labeled RNAs ([α-32P]CTP or [α-3H]CTP) were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and polymerase chain reaction-generated templates (30Thisted T. Sørensen N.S. Wagner E.G.H. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 5′-32P-Labeled RNAs were prepared with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), T4 kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and [γ-32P]ATP using standard techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring, NY1989Google Scholar). RNAs were purified as described (30Thisted T. Sørensen N.S. Wagner E.G.H. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The hok − /sok + and hok − /sok − constructs described previously (32Thisted T. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were inserted in the Bam HI-Eco RI restriction sites of the low-copy number mini-R1 test plasmid pMH82 (KanR). Thus, pTF821(hok −/sok +) carries a hok/sok system with an amber codon in the hok gene, whereas pTF821(hok −/sok −) carries an additional point mutation that inactivates the sok promoter. These mutations do not influence the stability or processing patterns of hok mRNA (30Thisted T. Sørensen N.S. Wagner E.G.H. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pTF322 to pTF324 plasmid series was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments inserted into the Eco RI-Bam HI restriction sites of pBR322 using the following primers: pTF322: T7-1 (5′-CGGGATCCTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGCTTGAGGCTTTCTGCCTCATG-3′) and Hok5 (5′-CCCCGAATTCACAACATCAGCAAGGAGAAA-3′) on a pPR633 template carrying a wild-type hok/sok system; pTF323: Hok5 and T7-AN1 (5′-CGGGATCCTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGCTTGAGGCTGTATGCCGAAAG-3′) on a pTT33 template carrying a pnd-hok hybrid system2; and pTF324: T7-AN1 and Pnd611 (5′-CCCCGAATTCGCAAAGGCATTCGGCTGGAG-3′) using pAN2 carrying a wild-type pnd system from plasmid R483. Northern analysis was carried out as described (26Gerdes K. Nielsen A.K. Thorsted P. Wagner E.G.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using the W3110 (rnc +) and HT115 (rnc −) E. coli strains grown in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for retainment of the mini-R1 test plasmid and pBR322 antisense RNA-donating plasmid, respectively. 10 μg/ml tetracycline was added to the HT115 strain. 5′-End-labeled CA-RNA or hok38 RNA was incubated either alone or in complex with an excess (1 pmol) of partner RNA in a buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmKCl) supplemented with 5 μg of tRNA in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Lead(II) acetate (2.5 μl) dissolved in H2O immediately prior to use was added to a final concentration of 0, 5, or 10 mm and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 40 mm. The RNA was precipitated, washed twice, resuspended in formamide dye, and subsequently resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and 1× Tris borate/EDTA. 5 nm RNA was incubated in the presence or absence of an 10-fold excess of various complementary partner RNAs in 1× TMK-glutamate buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 200 mmpotassium glutamate) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 μg of tRNA in a reaction volume of 20 μl. 50 nmN-terminal His6-tagged RNase III was added, and samples were withdrawn to formamide dye on ice at the time points indicated and subsequently loaded on 5.5 or 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. RNase III and E117A RNase III, both carrying N-terminal His6 tags, were purified from strains W3110 and HT115, respectively, as described (33Li H. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. A gene encoding wild-type N-terminal His6-tagged RNase III was cloned in the Eco RI-Bam HI sites of pUHE24-2 (obtained from Herman Bujard, University of Heidelberg) by polymerase chain reaction using primers rnc-histagN (5′-CCCTTGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAACCCCATCGTAATTAATCGGCTTCAACGG-3′) and rnc-Bam HI (5′-CCCTTTGGATCCCGATGCTCATTCCAGCTCCAGTTTTTTC-3′), resulting in pTF600. The E117A amino acid substitution was introduced by double polymerase chain reaction using the above primers and rnc-E117A-1 (5′-CCGACACCGTCGCAGCATTAATTGG-3′) and rnc-E117A-2 (5′-CCAATTAATGCTGCGACGGTGTCGG-3′), generating pTF601. LacI was expressed from the co-resident plasmid pMS421, which carries lacI q and a gene conferring spectinomycin resistance (34Graña D.T. Gardella T. Susskind M.M. Genetics. 1988; 120: 319-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial affinity purification was accomplished by protein binding to TALONTM resin in 1× binding buffer (4% (NH4)2SO4 and 30 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Three wash steps in 1× binding buffer were followed by a wash in 1× binding buffer supplemented with 5 mm imidazole as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Proteins were eluted in 1 mNH4Cl with 150 mm imidazole and loaded directly onto a pre-equilibrated poly(I)·poly(C) AG column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (33Li H. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Eluted protein was dialyzed against 1× TMK-glutamate buffer supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol. One nm5′-32P-labeled CA-RNA alone or in complex with 10 nm3H-labeled hok13 was incubated with 0, 1, or 2.5 μm E117A RNase III in 1× TMK-glutamate buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μg of tRNA in a 20-μl reaction volume at room temperature. 0.1 unit of cobra venom nuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for 5 min, and reactions were quenched by addition of 80 μl of phenol. RNA samples were precipitated, washed, resuspended in formamide dye, and resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Km and kcat calculations were made by a double-reciprocal plot of 1/V (initial velocity)versus 1/S (substrate concentration) as described (33Li H. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 7.5 nm N-terminal His6-tagged RNase III dimer was incubated with 62–1000 nm preformed complexes between32P-labeled antisense RNA and equimolar3H-labeled target RNA in a 10-μl reaction volume using TMK-glutamate buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol (see above). Samples were quenched after 2 min by addition of formamide dye loading buffer. RNAs were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. To test the effect of natural and artificial antisense RNAs on the level of hok mRNA in vivo, a hok/sok system with abolished Sok RNA expression was constructed and cloned into a low-copy number mini-R1 plasmid (pTF821). To avoid detrimental expression of the Hok toxin, this construct carries an amber stop codon mutation in the hok gene (hok −). Northern analysis showed that wild-type E. coli cells (strain W3110, rnc +) carrying pTF821 contain three hok mRNA species (Fig.2, left panel, lane 2). We have shown previously that hok mRNA-1 and -2 are full-length mRNAs that are translationally inactive and bind Sok RNA inefficiently, whereas the third RNA is a 3′-truncated species (denoted Tr. in Fig. 2) that is translationally active and binds Sok RNA avidly (28Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). hok mRNA-2 is an RNase III cleavage product of RNA-1 (Fig. 2, compare left and right panels). This latter cleavage removes the 3′-terminal hairpin of RNA-1 and does not influence the analyses presented here (26Gerdes K. Nielsen A.K. Thorsted P. Wagner E.G.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTF820 is the isogenic sok + derivative of pTF821 that produces wild-type Sok RNA in cis. Wild-type cells carrying pTF820 do not contain detectable amounts of the 3′-truncated mRNA due to its rapid interaction with Sok RNA and subsequent rapid cleavage by RNase III (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 1) (26Gerdes K. Nielsen A.K. Thorsted P. Wagner E.G.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the truncated RNA appears in cells devoid of RNase III (Fig. 2, right panel, lane 1). We examined the effect of three antisense RNAs expressed in trans from pBR322-derived plasmids on the hok mRNA band pattern in rnc + and rnc − cells (Fig. 2). The pBR322 control plasmid did not affect the hok mRNA band pattern (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 3). In trans expression of wild-type Sok RNA from pTF322 resulted in the disappearance of the truncated mRNA (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 4). The high level of Sok RNA production also resulted in a modest reduction in hok mRNA-1 and -2, presumably due to antisense RNA binding to hok mRNA during its synthesis (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 4). Interestingly, expression of CA-RNA also caused the disappearance of truncated hok mRNA (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 5), an effect similar to that of Sok RNA. In contrast, wild-type PndB antisense RNA (pTF324) from plasmid R483 had no effect on hok mRNA (Fig. 2, left panel, lane 6). When we examined the hok mRNA in an rnc − strain, neither Sok RNA nor CA-RNA affected the metabolism of truncated hok mRNA (Fig. 2, right panel). Thus, CA-RNA, which carries 13 nucleotides that are complementary to hok mRNA, is sufficient to target the truncated hok mRNA for degradation in the rnc + strain. These results indicate that CA-RNA and the truncated hok mRNA form a partial duplex (i.e. the TWJ; see below) that is adequate for RNase III-mediated hydrolysis in vivo. hok38 RNA constitutes the antisense target stem-loop structure in hok mRNA shown schematically in Fig. 1 D. We tested the in vitro complex formed between CA-RNA and hok38 RNA by lead(II) acetate probing of 5′-end-labeled CA-RNA (Fig.3 A, left panel) or hok38 (Fig. 3 A, right panel) either alone or in complex with hok38 or CA-RNA, respectively. The interpretation of the RNA probing is shown in Fig. 3 B. Single strand-specific lead(II) acetate cleavages were observed in the 5′-tail and in the top stem and loop region of the unpaired CA-RNA. Binding of hok38 to 32P-labeled CA-RNA resulted in repression of cleavages at the tail nucleotides only, whereas cleavages at other sites were unaffected (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Probing of unpaired hok38 resulted in cleavages in the loop and in the top stem region (Fig.3 A, right panel). Binding of CA-RNA specifically protected the nucleotides that are complementary to the bases in the tail of CA-RNA. Although binding of CA-RNA caused a modest enhancement of cleavages in the bottom stem of hok38 (Fig.3 A, right part of the left panel), the probing supports the formation of the three-way junction, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Different antisense RNA/target RNA combinations were tested for their ability to function as RNase III-processing signals in vitro using purified histidine-tagged RNase III (Fig. 4). The cleavage reactions were performed at high stringency (i.e. at a high concentration of monovalent salt). As expected, truncated hok mRNA alone was not affected by RNase III (Fig.4 A, left panel), consistent with the extraordinary stability of this mRNA in vivo (28Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Addition of Sok RNA resulted in a major cleavage product in addition to multiple consecutive cleavage fragments (MCF; Fig.4 A, middle panel). In contrast, addition of CA-RNA to truncated hok mRNA yielded two well defined cleavage products, indicative of a single specific cleavage site. Consistently, the longest cleavage fragments in the two reactions were of similar sizes (Fig. 4 A). We also examined RNase III cleavage of labeled wild-type Sok RNA (Fig.4 B) and CA-RNA (Fig. 4 C). Alone, both RNAs were resistant to RNase III processing. The lack of cleavage is consistent with the presence of upper stem helix irregularities that may act to protect the RNAs from RNase III cleavage. Such stem irregularities are known to prevent RNase III cleavage (35Hjalt T.Å.H. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Addition of truncated hok mRNA resulted in multiple cleavages of Sok RNA (Fig.4 B, middle panel) and a single cleavage of CA-RNA (Fig. 4 C, middle panel), consistent with the cleavage pattern observed for hok mRNA in Fig.4 A. These results show that all RNase III cleavages described here reflect coordinated double-strand scissions. Furthermore, primer-extension analysis showed that all double-strand cleavages occurred at the phosphodiester bond between nucleotides +13 and +14 of the antisense 5′-tail and the corresponding phosphodiester bond in hok mRNA, resulting in a 2-nucleotide 3′-overhang according to consensus RNase III processing (data not shown). This cleavage site is designated position 13/11 below. As implied by the in vivo and in vitro RNase III processing experiments, a partial duplex between the CA-RNA antisense RNA and the hok mRNA seems to be sufficient for RNase III processing. A 14-nucleotide fragment (hok13) of hok mRNA sequence that is complementary to the 13-nucleotide 5′-tail of Sok RNA and CA-RNA was synthesized (the fragment carried an additional 5′-G for efficient transcription by T7 RNA polymerase). Addition of hok13 to Sok RNA or CA-RNA resulted in single specific RNase III cleavages (Fig. 4, B and C, right panels) at the same processing site at position 13/11 described above (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the in vivo processing data and confirm that a partial antisense RNA/target RNA duplex comprising 13 bp of interstrand pairing is adequate for RNase III processing. To test if all 13 bp of the duplex were required for processing, we examined 3′-end-shortened hok mRNA fragments of 7 (hok7) and 10 (hok10) nucleotides for RNase III-mediated CA-RNA cleavage (Fig. 4 D). hok7 failed to sustain cleavage (Fig. 4 D, left panel), whereas partial cleavage was observed with hok10 (middle panel). Thus, all 13 base pairs are required for optimal enzyme binding or processing. In addition, the cleavage observed with hok10 occurred at the site at position 13/11 described above, implying that binding and/or cleavage is fixed at a unique position and does not change with the 5′-end border of the partial duplex (data not shown). The kinetic parameters for RNase III processing of Sok RNA in duplex with hok13 and CA-RNA in duplexes with hok13 and hok38 are shown in Table I. The kcat and Km values for RNase III processing of all three complexes are similar to the values calculated for the R1.1 substrate from bacteriophage T7 using wild-type RNase III (33Li H. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the formation of a TWJ in the CA-RNA·hok38 complex does not impair affinity or cleavage rate compared with the Sok RNA·hok13 and CA-RNA·hok13 complexes. Thus, the in vitro kinetic parameters for RNase III processing of the partial duplexes clearly support the ability of this substrate to compete for RNase III binding and cleavage in vivo.Table IKinetic parameters for RNase III processing of minimal RNA substratesRNA complexkcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1nm1/min ×mSok RNA ·hok136.42602.5 × 107CA-RNA · hok136.62352.8 × 107CA-RNA · hok386.42452.6 × 107kcat and Km calculations were carried out as described (33Li H.

S.D. values were <20% in all experiments. Complexes formed between uniformly 32P-labeled hok13 and Sok RNA, CA-RNA, or Sok13, which corresponds to the 13 nucleotides of the 5′-tail sequence of Sok RNA (and CA-RNA) were examined for accurate RNase III cleavage (Fig. 5). Binding of either Sok RNA or CA-RNA resulted in RNase III cleavage at the specific site in hok13. In contrast, RNase III failed to perform accurate processing of the hok13·Sok13 complex. Hence, the 13 base pair interstrand RNA duplex is not a substrate for RNase III. These results show that the transcriptional terminator hairpins of Sok RNA and CA-RNA are necessary for RNase III processing. The cleavage sites at position 13/11 suggest that the 13 bp of antisense RNA/target RNA duplexes and the bottom stem of the antisense RNA transcriptional terminator hairpins each constitute RNase III monomer half-sites. RNase III binding was examined using an RNase III derivative carrying an E117A amino acid substitution. This protein shows binding properties identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, but is impaired in substrate cleavage (13Li H. Nicholson A.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 32P-5′-End-labeled CA-RNA was incubated either alone or with hok13 in the presence or absence of E117A RNase III (Fig.6 A). As the substrates tested contained almost exclusively double-stranded or stacked nucleotides, we used cobra venom nuclease to monitor substrate binding (Fig.6 B). At both concentrations of E117A RNase III, the unpaired CA-RNA was not protected from cobra venom nuclease cleavages. Adding the hok13 fragment resulted in E117A RNase III-mediated protection of the 5′-tail and bottom hairpin at both the 5′- and 3′-sides. These data are consistent with a symmetrical binding of E117A RNase III coaxially stacked helices that comprise the bottom part of the CA-RNA transcriptional terminator hairpin stacked on the 13 bp of the interstrand CA-RNA/hok13 duplex. A structural model showing the protection of the CA-RNA·hok13 complex by E117A RNase III is presented in Fig. 6 B. Protection extends roughly 10–12 bp on each side of the cleavage sites, which are located in the hinge region of the stacked helices (Fig. 6 A). Many antisense RNAs target their complementary transcripts for RNase III-mediated degradation. Although the antisense RNAs of the Sok RNA family can form complete duplexes with their target RNAs, our data show that a pairing intermediate of 13 base pairs that forms a TWJ is sufficient for RNase III-mediated degradation in vivo. Intriguingly, substrates corresponding to the transcripts examined in vivo were cleaved by purified RNase III at a single specific site in both strands of the antisense RNA/target RNA duplexes. Our data support a minimal substrate that consists of the antisense RNA transcriptional terminator hairpin and the 13 nucleotides of the 5′-tail engaged in RNA interstrand pairing. However, RNase III processing normally requires at least two helical turns of RNA duplex (2Court D. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 71-116Crossref Google Scholar, 3Nicholson A.W. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the 13 bp of duplex are necessary, yet insufficient for RNase III cleavage (Fig. 4). E117A RNase III protein footprinting supports enzyme binding at the 13 bp of interstrand duplex and at the bottom 10–12 bp of the antisense RNA hairpin stem. This substrate most likely forms a rigid coaxially stacked structure that constitutes more than two helical turns of RNA helix, thus being reminiscent of more conventional RNase III substrates. The observation that RNase III is unable to perform any cleavage on the 13-bp duplex substrate suggests either of the following. (i ) Simultaneous contact between the substrate half-sites and the dsRNA-binding motifs of each RNase III subunit is required to confer catalytic activity to the enzyme. This could occur by structural transitions of the enzyme upon substrate binding, perhaps to attain the transition state. (ii) Binding of a single monomer subunit to the RNA complex provides insufficient binding energy to sustain substrate cleavage. Consistent with the above-described conclusions, the footprinting experiment showed that binding of the dimeric E117A RNase III requires both monomer half-sites of the CA-RNA·hok13 complex (Fig.6). The absence of protection of the monomer half-site in CA-RNA suggests that the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between the RNase III dsRBD and the half-site is significantly higher than 2.5 μm. A low binding affinity for such a monomer/half-site interaction is expected to increase the stringency in substrate binding and to prevent titration of RNase III by dsRNA elements that are not RNase III substrates. The Kmand kcat values for CA-RNA in partial duplex with hok13 and hok38 and for Sok RNA in complex with hok13 are similar to the values previously reported for RNase III processing (33Li H. Chelladurai B.S. Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1919-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and concur with the observation that the CA-RNA·hok mRNA substrate is efficiently processed in vivo. Thus, formation of the TWJ in the CA-RNA·hok mRNA complex (Figs. 1 D and 3) does not impede RNase III processing (Figs. 2 and 4 and Table I), which could suggest that the enzyme does not form a tightly closed complex surrounding the cleavage site since the extra RNA stem is accommodated by the catalytic site without affecting kcat. Several RNase III substrates have structural irregularities (i.e. bulges, mismatches, and internal loops) (2Court D. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 71-116Crossref Google Scholar) around the scissile bonds, including the Sok RNA·hok13 and CA-RNA·hok13 complexes and the R1.1 substrate of bacteriophage T7. However, data obtained with the native R1.1 substrate of bacteriophage T7 and an engineered version with perfect helicity showed similar equilibrium dissociation constants, suggesting that little or no discrimination on substrate binding is conferred by the catalytic site (13Li H. Nicholson A.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Instead, the recent finding of RNase III binding anti-determinants implies that the stringency of processing is on the level of enzyme binding exclusively (21Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consistent with the efficient processing, none of the substrates tested here convey the RNase III binding anti-determinants. Alignment of RNase III-processing signals from E. coli has identified a preference for a C-G base pair at position +6/+4 relative to the scissile bonds (21Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Krinke L. Wulff D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4809-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CA-RNA·hok mRNA complex contains one C-G base pair in the tail/target duplex and one C-G base pair in the terminator hairpin of CA-RNA located symmetrically (disregarding the bulged-out U) at position +6/+4 (Fig. 6 B). The crystal structure of the dsRBD of the dsRNA-binding protein A of X. laevis in complex with dsRNA revealed a single sequence-specific contact between a backbone carbonyl group and the exocyclic amine of G in the minor groove of a C-G base pair (20Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Thus, a similar interaction could be important for RNase III binding of its substrates and may in some cases specify the cleavage site location. This is supported by the fixed cleavage site at position 13/11 observed here for RNase III processing of the CA-RNA·hok10 complex, for which the end of the interstrand duplex has been juxtaposed, compared with the CA-RNA·hok mRNA and CA-RNA·hok13 complexes. The fact that the family of RNase III enzymes shows at least partial interspecies substrate specificity (4Rotondo G. Huang J.Y. Frendewey D. RNA. 1997; 3: 1182-1193PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that coaxially stacked helices could function as processing signals for RNase III enzymes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Recently, an RNase III-processing signal composed of noncontiguous helices was suggested for the small nuclear R40 precursor of S. cerevisiae (10Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, for this substrate, the junction of the RNA helices is positioned 6–8 base pairs from the scissile phosphodiester bonds, most likely displaced from the catalytic site. Intriguingly, binding of coaxially stacked dsRNA by two copies of the double dsRBD may apply to a diverse set of proteins with unrelated function. In a recent experiment, the dsRBD of PKR was shown to bind in vitro selected RNA with noncontiguous and most likely coaxially stacked RNA helices (38Bevilacqua P.C. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6303-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that enzymes like PKR and ADAR (adenine deaminase that acts on RNA) that carry multiple copies of the dsRBD can bind coaxially stacked RNA stems in a fashion similar to RNase III and thereby trigger such diverse cellular responses as apoptosis, the interferon-induced viral response (39Der S.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2140-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The processing of coaxially stacked RNA helices reported here shows that RNase III substrates are more versatile than previously assumed. This novel substrate specificity could have a more general implication on the metabolism of diverse RNAs. We thank E. G. H. Wagner for critical reading of the manuscript."

In this study, we characterized a silencer element in the human interleukin-3 gene promoter that is responsible for the cell-specific expression of interleukin-3.

In this study, we have identified two nuclear factors that are responsible for the silencer activity in T cells.

Formation of this ASRF complex is required for the NIP silencer function, as mutation of the ASRF-binding site abrogated the silencer activity. Complex B contains the nuclear factor YY1 (Yin-Yang 1), whose function is to down-regulate ASRF activity in the silencer. YY1 activity is supported by data from mutation and cotransfection analyses.

Interestingly, there is a cell type-specific silencer element at positions −267 to −242 that binds a protein complex designated as the nuclear inhibitory protein (NIP) (8Mathey-Prevot B. Andrews N.C.

In this study, we focused on the characterization of transcription factors associated with this silencer element.

Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two transcription factors interact with the IFN-γ silencer: 1) YY1 (Yin-Yang 1), a ubiquitous nuclear factor involved in the negative regulation of many mammalian genes (23Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar); and 2) an AP2-like protein that shares DNA-binding specificity, but not antigenicity, with the transcription factor AP2. Simultaneous binding of both nuclear factors is required for the inhibitory activity of the IFN-γ BE element (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we observed that the NIP element shares a striking similarity with the IFN-γ BE silencer in protein-binding activities. Both YY1 and an AP2-like protein are found in DNA-protein complexes formed by NIP and T cell nuclear protein. However, the function of YY1 is totally different in NIP compared with the BE element. In the NIP element, the AP2 sequence-recognizing factor (ASRF) is required for the silencer function, and interestingly, YY1 acts an inhibitor of ASRF activity. This finding provides evidence that YY1 may act as a positive regulator in the IL-3 gene promoter, and more important, this extends the functional role of YY1 in regulating cytokine gene expression. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method on an Applied Biosystems Model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The synthesized oligonucleotides were deprotected at 50 °C overnight. Complementary strands were denatured at 80 °C for 5 min and annealed at room temperature. The double-stranded probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Klenow fragment (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are as follow: a YY1-binding site in the Moloney murine leukemia virus gene (4Young H.A. Hardy K.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), 5′-TGCCTTGCAAAATGGCGTTACTGCAG-3′; and an AP2-binding site in the SV40 virus (24Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M.

Antibodies against nuclear proteins YY1 and AP2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Jurkat cells (human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (complete medium). Fresh human peripheral blood total T cells were purified by the nylon wool method, and purity was monitored by CD3 staining (CD3+ > 95%). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Jurkat cells (2 × 106) were treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μg/ml) for different times as indicated in the figure legends. Total mRNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. IL-3 mRNA levels were determined by the ribonuclease protection assay using a RiboQuant multiprobe ribonuclease protection assay system (human cytokine/chemokine-4, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107) were treated with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm dithiothreitol) on ice for 4 min. After 1 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was saved as a cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei were washed once with the same volume of buffer without Nonidet P-40, put into a 300-μl volume of extraction buffer (500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol with the same concentrations of Hepes, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, and dithiothreitol as lysis buffer), and pipetted several times. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was harvested as the nuclear protein extract and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The DNA-protein binding reaction was conducted in a 24-μl reaction mixture that included 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma), 3 μg of nuclear protein extract, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 12 μl of 2× reaction buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 8% Ficoll 400, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). In some cases, the indicated amount of double-stranded oligonucleotide was added as an unlabeled competitor. This mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min without or for 20 min with antibody in the absence of radiolabeled probe and then for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of radiolabeled probe. After incubation, the reaction mixture was resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA) that had been prerun at 110 V for 1 h with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The loaded gel was run at 210 V for 90 min, dried, and placed on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The film was developed after overnight exposure at −70 °C. Five plasmid vectors were used in this study: 1) The IL-3/pCAT plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. L. R. Gottschalk, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL (7Gottschalk L.R. Giannola D.M. Emerson S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); in this reporter vector, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene is controlled by the human IL-3 gene promoter (−175)); 2) the IFN-γ/β-galactosidase expression vector (25Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), in which the β-galactosidase gene is controlled by the human IFN-γ gene promoter (−108); 3) the pBCTKp/CAT reporter vector (26Clark A.R. Boam D.S. Docherty K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), in which the CAT gene is controlled by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter (−105)); 4) the pGL2 control vector, a luciferase expression vector containing the SV40 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI; this vector was used for monitoring transfection efficiency in transfection experiments); and 5) the CMV-YY1 expression vector and its control pCEP vector (gifts from Dr. Keiko Ozato, Laboratory of Developmental and Molecular Immunity, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (27Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). Jurkat T cells were grown in complete medium as described above. Cells (5 × 106) were transiently transfected with 5–10 μg of the reporter plasmid DNA with DEAE-dextran (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The pGL2 control luciferase expression vector (0.5 μg) was used as an internal control. After transfection, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline solution and cultured in 10 ml of complete medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μg/ml) for 12 h, harvested, and disrupted by freezing-thawing three times. The cell lysate was used for the reporter gene assay. The CAT, β-galactosidase, and luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (21Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The CAT and β-galactosidase activities were normalized by protein concentration and luciferase activity for each transfection, and a mean value from three individual experiments was analyzed by Student's t test with a confidence level of p < 0.05–0.001. In this study, Jurkat cells (a human CD4+ T lymphoma) were used for characterization of the IL-3 silencer NIP. This cell line is able to express IL-3 mRNA upon activation by a combined stimulation of PMA plus ionomycin, which mimics signals of the activated T cell receptor. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the induced IL-3 mRNA was observed at 2 h following stimulation (lane 4), and the mRNA level kept increasing up to 8 h (lanes 5 and 6). In the absence of stimulation, the IL-3 mRNA was not detectable (lane 1). This indicates that the IL-3 gene promoter was induced by a stimulation of PMA plus ionomycin in Jurkat cells. In the rest of study when the IL-3 promoter was assayed, the stimulation of PMA plus ionomycin was used to induce promoter activity. Generally, silencer activities are dependent on promoter type and DNA orientation. To examine whether NIP has these features, the function of NIP was tested in different gene promoters and in the reverse orientation. Three promoters were employed to test the promoter specificity. They are the human IL-3 gene promoter (−175), the human IFN-γ gene promoter (−108), and the thymidine kinase promoter. Both the IL-3 (10-fold) and IFN-γ (6-fold) promoters were induced by stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Without stimulation, the percent acetylation from the IL-3/pCAT reporter was 5%; with stimulation, the percent acetylation was increased to 55%. Similarly, the IFN-γ/β-galactosidase reporter was induced from 64- to 384-fold following stimulation. In contrast, the thymidine kinase/CAT reporter was not induced upon stimulation. Its percent acetylation was ∼15% before or after stimulation. To analyze NIP activity, NIP was inserted into the promoters. The results show that in the IL-3 promoter (IL-3p), NIP reduced promoter activity by 60% (Fig.1 C), confirming the silencer function of NIP in the context of the IL-3 promoter. This also demonstrates that this IL-3 promoter construct is sufficient for characterization of the NIP function. In contrast, NIP did not show a silencer activity in either the IFN-γ promoter (IFNp) or the thymidine kinase promoter (TKp) (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that NIP activity appears to be specific for the human IL-3 promoter. The reporters with a reversed NIP element were used to study DNA orientation dependence. The results show that NIP functioned only in the proper orientation (Fig. 1 D, NIPp). In the reverse orientation (NIPr), NIP failed to inhibit the IL-3 promoter activity (Fig. 1 D). This indicates that NIP is also orientation-specific in its function. In the absence of stimulation, the IL-3 gene promoter activity is too weak to be used for studying NIP activity; thus, only the induced promoter activity was employed in this study. Position effect on NIP activity in the IFN-γ promoter was also examined. This was done by inserting a small DNA fragment of different lengths at the junction point between the NIP silencer and the IFN-γ promoter. These inserts can make the silencer fragment into a half-turn or full turn in the DNA α-helices. We also tested the NIP silencer activity in a longer IFN-γ promoter (−560). All the results indicate that the NIP silencer cannot repress a heterologous gene (IFN-γ) promoter (data not shown). To explore the mechanism of NIP function, the DNA-protein interaction between NIP and the nuclear proteins of Jurkat cells was investigated with EMSA. A radiolabeled double-stranded NIP oligonucleotide was used as a probe in the assay, and unlabeled NIP or Sp1 oligonucleotides (in micrograms) were used as competitors. The results are shown in Fig.2. The NIP DNA formed four major complexes with a Jurkat nuclear extract (complexes A–D) (lane 1). All four complexes were reduced by the specific competitor (unlabeled NIP) in a dose-dependent pattern (lanes 2–5). Complexes C and D were reduced significantly by the nonspecific competitor Sp1 probe (lane 6). These results suggest that among the four complexes, A and B result from a specific interaction between the NIP probe and the Jurkat nuclear proteins. Complexes C and D result from a nonspecific interaction. It is interesting to note that when the level of complex A was reduced by 20 μg of unlabeled NIP (lane 2), the level of complex B was enhanced. When complexes C and D were reduced by the Sp1 probe, complex B was also enhanced (lane 6). There was a fast migrating band close to the free probe. This band also exhibited specific binding activity. Our later analysis suggests that this band is a derivative of complex B since it can be removed with unlabeled YY1 probe or antibody (Fig. 6). Complexes C and D appear to be nonspecific complexes, and mutation analysis of complexes C and D did not indicate any function of these two complexes (data not shown). Therefore, the rest of this study was focused on complexes A and B.Figure 6Complex B contains the nuclear protein YY1. Oligonucleotide competition and antibody supershift experiments were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, complex B is specifically competed by an authentic YY1-binding oligonucleotide. 100 μg of competitor oligonucleotide was used in the EMSA. B, supershift analysis with anti-YY1 antibody (sc-281, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Complex B was formed by incubating the NIP probe and Jurkat nuclear protein (lanes 1–3). 4 μg of anti-YY1 antibody or anti-AP2 antibody (as a control) was used as indicated at the top of each lane. Authentic YY1 complex was formed by the radiolabeled YY1-binding oligonucleotide and the Jurkat nuclear proteins (lanes 4 and 5). The supershifted bands are marked by an arrow in lanes 2 and 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A search into the DNA-binding sequences of known transcription factors revealed that a binding site for the nuclear factor AP2 was present in the NIP oligonucleotide (boxed in Fig. 4 A). To investigate if any of the complexes contains AP2, we carried out both an oligonucleotide competition assay and an antibody supershift assay (Fig. 3). In this experiment, an authentic SV40 AP2-binding oligonucleotide was used as a competitor against the NIP probe. The formation of complex A was inhibited by the AP2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). In the assay, the AP2 oligonucleotide competed with the NIP probe as efficiently as unlabeled NIP in complex A (lane 2). The AP2 oligonucleotide did not compete with the NIP probe in complexes B–D (compare lanes 2 and 3). This suggests that the protein in complex A, but not in complex B, shares DNA-binding specificity with the nuclear factor AP2. However, complex A was not supershifted or removed by the anti-AP2 antibody (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). This antibody was able to remove an authentic AP2 complex formed by the AP2 oligonucleotide probe and Jurkat nuclear protein (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2). These results imply that the protein in complex A is not AP2 or that the AP2 epitopes are masked by protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the mobilities of complex A and the authentic AP2 complex are totally different. Since the protein in complex A resembles AP2 in its DNA-binding specificity, but does not appear to be AP2, we designated it as ASRF.Figure 3Complex A is formed by an AP2-like nuclear protein. Oligonucleotide competition and antibody supershift experiments were conducted in gel shift assays to characterize complex A. A, complex A is specifically competed by an authentic AP2-binding oligonucleotide. 100 μg of competitor oligonucleotide was used in the reaction. B, supershift analysis with an antibody against the AP2 protein (sc-184, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). 4 μg of antibody was used in the reaction. C, authentic AP2 complex formed by the radiolabeled AP2-binding oligonucleotide and the PMA/ionomycin-activated Jurkat nuclear proteins. The same anti-AP2 antibody (4 μg) was used to remove the AP2 complex as in described for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DNA-binding sequence of ASRF was mapped out by a series of base substitutions in the NIP sequence (data not shown). A 3-base pair substitution in the AP2-like binding site was sufficient to delete ASRF-binding activity in the NIP element (oligonucleotide M1) (Fig.4 A). The protein-binding activity of M1 was tested in the gel shift assay directly using radiolabeled M1 as the oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 4 B) or indirectly using unlabeled M1 as a competitor (Fig. 4 C). The results show that M1 does not form complex A, but does form complexes B–D (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). In the absence of complex A, the intensity of complex B was enhanced compared with the control (lane 2 versus lane 1). These data again support the hypothesis that there may be a competition between ASRF and complex B in the NIP element. Complexes C and D were reduced after mutation of the ASRF-binding site (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). This suggests that formation of complexes C and D may somehow be modulated by the formation of the ASRF complex. In the competition experiment (Fig. 4 C), M1 did not compete with the NIP probe in forming complex A, confirming that M1 cannot bind to ASRF (Fig. 4 C, compare lanes 1 and 2). The function of M1 in the IL-3 promoter was examined by inserting one copy of M1 into the IL-3/CAT reporter vector (Fig.5, M1). In this experiment, the IL-3/CAT vector and the NIP vector (containing one copy of wild-type NIP in the IL-3/CAT reporter vector) were used as controls (Fig. 5, Control and NIP, respectively). The results demonstrate that in contrast to the NIP element, M1 has no silencer function at all. Since the only difference between M1 and NIP is the binding activity of ASRF, these data indicate that ASRF mediates the silencer function of NIP. The search of transcription factor-binding sequences in the NIP element also revealed that there are two potential binding sites for the transcription factor YY1. One site overlaps with the AP2-like binding site, and the other is located at the 3′-end of NIP (under the YY1 consensus sequence in Fig.7 A). To investigate if YY1 is involved in the formation of any NIP complexes, an authentic YY1-binding oligonucleotide and an anti-YY1 antibody were utilized in the gel shift assay with the NIP probe (Fig. 6). The results from the oligonucleotide competition experiment show that complex B may contain YY1 because the authentic YY1 oligonucleotide efficiently competed the formation of complex B (Fig. 6 A, lane 3 versus lane 2). In the antibody supershift assay, part of complex B was supershifted by the anti-YY1 antibody (Fig.6 B, lane 2), but was not affected by a control antibody (lane 3). To confirm the activity of the anti-YY1 antibody, a supershift experiment was performed with a YY1 complex formed by the radiolabeled YY1 oligonucleotide probe and Jurkat nuclear protein (lanes 4–6). The results show that the authentic YY1 complex migrated at the same position as complex B, and more important, it was supershifted to an identical level (labeled as Shifted Bands) as complex B by the anti-YY1 antibody (lane 5). These data strongly suggest that the transcription factor YY1 is involved in the formation of complex B. We next analyzed the function of the YY1 complex by mutation and cotransfection in Jurkat cells. Oligonucleotide M2 contains a 3-base pair substitution at the second YY1 homology site located at the 3′-end of the NIP oligonucleotide (Fig. 7 A). The protein-binding activity of M2 was examined in the same way as described for M1. A radiolabeled M2 oligonucleotide was used as a probe in EMSA with Jurkat nuclear protein. The results of this experiment show that M2 lost YY1-binding activity (complex B) (Fig. 7 B, lane 2), but retained the ability to form the other three complexes. Complexes C and D were reduced after mutation of the YY1-binding site (lane 2), suggesting there are certain interactions among these three complexes. However, this result indicates that the second YY1 homology sequence (mutated in M2) is responsible for the formation of the YY1 complex (complex B). The first YY1 homology sequence, which overlaps with the ASRF site, is not involved in the formation of the YY1 complex because M2 failed to demonstrate YY1-binding activity. The same conclusion can be drawn from the competition assay, in which unlabeled M2 was used as a competitor against the NIP probe (Fig. 7 C). In Jurkat cells, modulation of YY1-binding activity by PMA plus ionomycin is not significant. This might be due to a high basal level of YY1 in Jurkat cells. To explore the question of inducibility of YY1, purified human peripheral T cells were employed. The total T cells were separated from the human peripheral blood by the nylon wool method and treated with PMA plus ionomycin. This stimulation is sufficient to induce activation of the IL-3 gene in the T cells. After a 2-h treatment, the nuclear protein was extracted and examined in the gel shift assay. The results show that the basal level of YY1 (band B) in the T cells is low (Fig. 7 C, lane 1), but its binding activity is inducible by stimulation (lane 2). There are four major complexes formed by the nuclear protein of unstimulated fresh T cells (lane 1). After PMA/ionomycin stimulation, three of the four complexes were induced, and one of them was reduced. If the reduced band was used to normalize the induced bands, the induction of the YY1 band would become even stronger. This suggests that activation of the DNA-binding activity of YY1 correlates with activation of IL-3 gene transcription in the T cells. To test the functional activity of a change in the 3′-YY1 site, one copy of M2 was linked to the IL-3 promoter, and the reporter vector was transfected into Jurkat cells. The results of this experiment demonstrate that mutation of the YY1 site resulted in a silencer activity even stronger than that of wild-type NIP in the IL-3 promoter (Fig. 8 A). Instead of the 60% inhibition of IL-3 promoter activity caused by NIP, >80% of the IL-3 promoter activity was lost in the presence of M2. This result suggests that the YY1 protein may play an opposite role to ASRF when binding to the NIP element. To test this hypothesis, a YY1 expression vector was cotransfected with the IL-3 promoter constructs. Overexpression of YY1 had no effect on the IL-3 promoter in the absence of the NIP element. In the presence of NIP, overexpression of YY1 enhanced promoter activity by 100%. The relative promoter activity was increased from 40% (NIP) to 80% (NIP + YY1) (Fig. 8 B). These results provide functional evidence that YY1 inhibits ASRF in the IL-3 gene promoter. In previous studies, we identified a regulatory activity of the transcription factor YY1 in the human IFN-γ gene promoter (21Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter (28Ye J. Young H.A. Ortaldo J.R. Ghosh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5672-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the IFN-γ promoter, YY1 acts as a repressor protein through two mechanisms. In the silencer (BE) region, YY1 cooperates with another protein, which also shares DNA-binding specificity with AP2, to mediate the silencer function (21Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, binding of both YY1 and the AP2-like protein is required for the silencer function. We also observed that YY1 inhibited AP1 activity at an AP1-YY1-binding site in the IFN-γ promoter. YY1 competed with AP1 for the overlapping region in an AP1-YY1-binding site, leading to inhibition of the AP1 enhancer function (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoter, YY1 repressed AP1 activity and an Sp1-like activity through a similar competition in the CAT enhancer element (28Ye J. Young H.A. Ortaldo J.R. Ghosh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5672-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, in the IFN-γ and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene promoters, competition with an activator is the common mechanism by which YY1 inhibits cytokine gene promoter activity. The results from this study indicate that the NIP silencer is a promoter-specific cis-acting element (Fig. 1). This conclusion is different from a previous report in which that NIP activity is claimed as a nonspecific silencer for the IL-3 promoter (10Engeland K. Andrews N.C. Mathey-Prevot B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24572-24579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This difference might be due to the experimental systems. In that study, the human IL-3 silencer activity was characterized in the gibbon T cell line MLA 144. The IL-3 cDNA was used as a reporter of the IL-3 promoter, and RNase protection assay was used to monitor reporter activity. The limitations of that system include the following. (a) Gibbon T cells may be different from human T cells, and this may result in a different activity of the NIP silencer. (b) In the reporter assay, reporter activity was not normalized by an internal control. It is widely accepted that a difference in transfection efficiency could result in a totally distinct conclusion. (c) Additionally, a result from only one reporter assay, not a mean value of multiple experiments, was shown in that report. In our study, the IL-3 silencer activity was characterized in the human Jurkat T cell line, and all the reporter (CAT or β-galactosidase) activities were normalized by an internal control. Moreover, a mean value of three experiments was used to show reporter activity. Position effect was examined in the IFN-γ promoter by adjusting the distance between the NIP element and the IFN-γ promoter. The results did not support a possibility that position plays a role in the NIP silencer activity in the heterologous promoter. This study demonstrates that YY1 regulates the human IL-3 gene promoter through competition with ASRF activity in the NIP silencer element. We confirmed that Jurkat cells expresses IL-3 mRNA upon stimulation of PMA/ionomycin. Under the same condition, the IL-3 gene promoter exhibited a dramatic inducible activity, indicating that our experimental system is closely relevant to the physiological condition under which IL-3 expression is regulated. In the four specific DNA-protein complexes formed by the NIP oligonucleotide and Jurkat nuclear extracts (Fig. 2), only complexes A and B appear to be functional. Complex A is responsible for the silencer activity, and its activity is regulated by complex B. Protein analysis revealed that complex A contains a nuclear protein that shares DNA-binding specificity with AP2 (ASRF) (Fig. 3), and complex B contains the transcription factor YY1 (Fig. 6). It has been documented that a consensus YY1-binding sequence contains 9 base pairs ((C/G/A)(G/T)(D/T/A)CATN(T/A)(T/G/C)) (23Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that the core sequence for YY1 binding can be reduced to 5 base pairs of CCATT. This has been verified by mutation analysis of the YY1-binding sites in the promoters of human IFN-γ (21Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (28Ye J. Young H.A. Ortaldo J.R. Ghosh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5672-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An extra flanking sequence is not required for YY1 protein binding. In the NIP element, this was again verified. In the IL-3 gene promoter, YY1 functions by regulating ASRF activity through competition for DNA binding. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence. (a) In the competition assay, when the binding of ASRF was reduced by the competition of an AP2 oligonucleotide, YY1 binding was enhanced (Fig. 3 A). (b) In the mutation analysis, when ASRF-binding activity was abrogated in the NIP element by mutation, YY1-binding activity was increased (Fig. 4 B). (c) In the functional analysis, loss of YY1 activity was associated with an increased silencer activity, indicating that ASRF activity was increased in the absence of YY1 (Fig. 8 A). (d) In a cotransfection assay, overexpression of YY1 resulted in reduction of the silencer activity (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that YY1 inhibited the AP2-like activity. This study provides evidence for a new model of cytokine gene regulation by YY1. On the basis of previous data, two models by which YY1 regulates cytokine gene transcription have been suggested. In the first model, YY1 cooperates with an AP2-like protein in mediating silencer activity (21Ye J. Ghosh P. Cippitelli M. Subleski J. Hardy K.J. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the second model, YY1 inhibits the activity of an activator protein through competition for DNA binding (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This model has also been proposed for regulation of non-cytokine genes. In the α-actin gene, YY1 inhibits the activity of the serum response factor through competition (30Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the rat serum amyloid A1 gene, YY1 antagonizes NF-κB activity by competition (31Lu S.Y. Rodriguez M. Liao W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6253-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these two models, YY1 plays a negative role in gene regulation. Since the DNA-binding activity of YY1 preexists in the resting cells, these two models can explain the tight control of gene transcription of some cytokines such as IFN-γ (22Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we suggest a third model in which YY1 antagonizes the activity of a repressor protein through competition for DNA binding. In this model, YY1 plays a positive role in cytokine gene transcription. This finding may explain why the Jurkat cells used in this study can produce IL-3, but not IFN-γ. Jurkat T cells have a strong endogenous YY1 activity compared with natural killer cell lines (YT or NK3.3). In the IFN-γ promoter, YY1 acts as a repressor, whereas in the IL-3 promoter, YY1 acts as a derepressor. It is reasonable to suggest that in the Jurkat cells, the endogenous YY1 activity prevents activation of the IFN-γ promoter and facilitates activation of the IL-3 gene promoter. The AP2-like activity in the IFN-γ silencer element (BE) and the ASRF activity in the IL-3 silencer element (NIP) might be different members of a novel transcription factor family. The common features of the two AP2-like activities are as follows. (a) Both proteins recognize a similar DNA sequence. (b) Both proteins mediate the silencer activities in the respective promoters. (c) Their activities are promoter-dependent, and the DNA is orientation-dependent. The differences in the two proteins include the following. (a) The ASRF complex migrates slower than the IFN-γ AP2-like protein-DNA complex (data not shown). (b) ASRF is sufficient to mediate the silencer activity, whereas the IFN-γ AP2-like protein needs cooperation with YY1 to mediate the silencer activity. Interestingly, a protein with a similar DNA-binding specificity may also play a role in the TNF-α silencer. A silencer element (−254 to −230) in the TNF-α promoter has been identified (14Fong C.L. Siddiqui A.H. Mark D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and it represses TNF-α transcription in U937 cells. This 25-base pair TNF-α repressor site contains a 10-base pair sequence homologous to the binding site of nuclear factor AP2, but it does not bind the AP2 protein (32Fong C.W. Siddiqui A.H. Mark D.F. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 887-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, this information suggests that these proteins may represent a novel family of transcription factors that function as repressors in the transcriptional regulation of cytokine gene expression. In summary, we report here that the transcription factor YY1 and ASRF regulate the activity of the IL-3 NIP silencer element. ASRF activity is required for the silencer function, including promoter specificity and orientation dependence. In contrast, YY1 plays a role in the positive regulation of the human IL-3 gene promoter. This activity may be mediated by a direct competition with ASRF activity for DNA binding in the NIP element. These data support that a cell type-specific silencer activity might be determined by a unique profile of ubiquitous transcription factors. We thank Della Reynolds for carrying out the mRNA assay. We appreciate the generous support of Dr. L. R. Gottschalk, who provided the IL-3 reporter plasmid (−175)."
https://openalex.org/W2016014870,"The development of chemical modification agents that reduce the tendency of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) to aggregate represents an important chemotherapeutic goal. Methyl acetylphosphate (MAP) has been reported to bind to the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) binding site of hemoglobin, where it selectively acetylates residues, resulting in increased solubility of HbS. We have prepared [1-13C]MAP and evaluated the adduct formation with hemoglobin using 1H-13C HMQC and HSQC NMR studies. These spectra of the acetylated hemoglobin adducts showed 10–11 well resolved adduct peaks, indicating that the acetylation was not highly residue specific. The chemical shift pattern observed is in general similar to that obtained recently using [1′-13C]aspirin as the acetylating agent (Xu, A. S. L., Macdonald, J. M., Labotka, R. J., and London, R. E. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1432, 333–349). Blocking the 2,3-DPG binding site with inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) resulted in a selective reduction in intensity of adduct resonances, presumably corresponding to residues located in the 2,3-DPG binding cleft. The pattern of residue protection appeared to be identical to that observed in our previous study using IHP and labeled aspirin. Pre-acetylation of hemoglobin using unlabeled MAP, followed by acetylation with [1′-13C]aspirin indicated a general protective effect, with the greatest reduction of intensity for resonances corresponding to acetylated residues in the 2,3-DPG binding site. These studies indicated that both MAP and aspirin exhibit similar, although not identical, acetylation profiles and target primarily the βLys-82 residue in the 2,3-DPG binding site, as well as sites such as βLys-59 and αLys-90, which are not located in the β-cleft of hemoglobin.

The latter approach remains a potentially important therapeutic strategy, which has been under exploration by a number of groups (2Klotz I.M. Tam J.W.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 76: 159-247Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although to date no agents of this class have been successfully developed for clinical use. Since the first report of hemoglobin carbamylation by cyanate as a potentially effective anti-sickling agent (7Cerami A. Manning J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1971; 68: 1180-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), a number of other agents have been designed, and their suitability as anti-sickling drugs has been investigated (e.g. Refs. 5Ueno H.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among these reagents is methyl acetylphosphate (MAP), an acetylating agent that was first designed as an inhibitor ofd-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (9Kluger R. Tsui W.-C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the investigation of the modification reaction using conventional protein chemistry techniques, MAP was reported to target residues in the 2,3-DPG binding site: βLys-144, βLys-82, and βVal-1 (Refs. 10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and11Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12344-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). No residues of the α-chain were reported modified in the same study (10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The modification of HbS by MAP was reported to yield adduct hemoglobin with oxygen affinity similar to that of hemoglobin A but with a reduced gelation tendency. The decrease in the affinity of 2,3-DPG and in gelation tendency is thought to result from the MAP selective acetylation of amino groups located in the β-cleft to which 2,3-DPG binds. Among the set of criteria first proposed by Walder et al. (3Walder J.A. Zaugg R.H. Walder R.Y. Steele J.M. Klotz I.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 18: 4265-4270Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) for a suitable anti-sickling agent, specificity for selected target residues of hemoglobin is of critical importance in order to limit the introduction of undesired structural and functional changes of the hemoglobin as well as the toxicity of the agent resulting from modifications of other proteins. Multidimensional NMR in conjunction with isotopically labeled agents has been shown to be an effective approach for studying chemical modification of hemoglobin (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and ubiquitin (13Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmcol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We report here our NMR study of the sites/residues of human hemoglobin acetylated by MAP. Results from this study are important for evaluating the effects of MAP acetylation on hemoglobin and hence are useful for the evaluation of this compound as a possible anti-sickling agent. Inositol hexaphosphate sodium salt (IHP) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; salicylic acid was from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY); and Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis membrane cassettes (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa) were obtained from Pierce. Centriprep and Centricon membrane concentrators were from Amicon (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Human hemoglobin A was prepared using the protocol reported in our previous study (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). [1′-13C]Aspirin was synthesized using the procedures reported elsewhere (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmcol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). [1-13C]Methyl acetylphosphate was prepared by a reported synthesis procedure (14Kluger R. Tsui W.-C. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 2723-2724Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using [1-13C]acetyl bromide as the precursor for isotopic labeling. The acetylation of the ε-NH2 of lysine and α-NH2 of N-terminal residues of hemoglobin by [1-13C]MAP was carried out under the following conditions: hemogobin (typically 2 mm) in either carbonmonoxy (COHbA) or oxy form (OxyHbA) where indicated was allowed to react with a 10-fold molar excess of MAP in phosphate-buffered saline (PBK; ∼35 mm phosphate, 140 mm KCl, pH 7) at 37 °C for 1 h. At the completion of the incubation, the hemoglobin sample was dialyzed immediately against a 1000-fold excess volume of cold PBK (20 mm phosphate) at 4 °C overnight, with two to three changes of buffer to quench the reaction and to remove the unreacted MAP and acetate. The dialyzed hemoglobin adduct solutions were then reconcentrated for the NMR experiments using a Slide-A-Lyzer membrane microconcentrator. Total hemoglobin concentration was determined by measuring the concentration of cyanomethemoglobin (CNHbA) using the Total Hemoglobin kit from Sigma. Acetylation of hemoglobin by aspirin was achieved under similar conditions except that the reaction was allowed to proceed for 12 h prior to dialysis. The HMQC (15Summers M.F. Marzilli L.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4285-4294Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar) and HSQC (16Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114 (, 1992): 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2432) Google Scholar) experiments were adapted to acquire the spectra of the chemically modified hemoglobin adducts. Details of spectral acquisition, processing, and analysis are reported elsewhere (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, 1-13C-labeled methyl acetylphosphate was synthesized and used to acetylate human hemoglobin. The presence of the isotopic label allowed detection of the adduct resonances of large proteins such as hemoglobin using 1H-13C HMQC or HSQC spectroscopy. Detection utilizing the relatively weak polarization transfer between the carbonyl 13C and methyl protons of the acetyl group was facilitated by the high mobility of the acetyllysine side chains, and the carbonyl resonances were found to yield greater shift dispersion than the methyl resonances observed using [2-13C]acetyl-labeled precursors. The1H-13C HMQC spectrum of COHbA acetylated using a 10-fold molar excess of [1-13C]MAP is shown in Fig.1 A. Approximately 10–11 well resolved peaks were apparent in the spectrum, indicating only a moderate residue specificity of acetylation. A small and relatively sharp peak labeled “Ace” arises from free [1-13C]acetate in the sample, possibly present as a result of incomplete removal by dialysis. A similar adduct spectrum was acquired for OxyHbA modified in HEPES buffer under the conditions used by Manning and co-workers (10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). In general, we have avoided the use of HEPES and other amino group-containing buffers, which are readily acetylated, leading to a loss of buffering capacity and to the release of amino protons upon formation of amidated buffer. To investigate the relative level of COHbA modification as a function of MAP concentration, a series of HSQC spectra was acquired on the COHbA modified with increasing molar ratios of [1-13C]MAP:COHbA. The spectral intensities are shown as a function of the ratio of [1-13C]MAP:COHbA in Fig.2. In this figure, we have plotted the sum of the intensities of resonances 5, 6, and 9 for the reasons discussed below. Subject to some scatter, the intensities of the adduct peaks are roughly proportional to the MAP:COHbA ratio, as expected. In particular, it does not appear that the most highly reactive sites become fully acetylated before significant modification of less reactive sites. Hence, these data also indicate that although there is significant variation in the rates of acetylation of the various hemoglobin residues, these differences are not sufficient to achieve a high degree of residue selectivity. Assignment of the adduct resonances in acetylated hemoglobin represents a difficult problem. We have recently performed extensive studies on hemoglobin acetylated with [1′-13C]aspirin (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and assigned the resonances using a broad range of approaches. These included protection of the 2,3-DPG binding site with both covalent and non-covalent agents, modification of βCys-93 with a spin label, the use of site-directed hemoglobin mutants, and prediction of dipolar shifts in paramagnetic CNHbA. These studies have allowed assignments of a number of the adduct resonances and also demonstrate that the most highly modified residue is βLys-82 rather than βLys-144 as previously reported (17Shamsuddin M. Mason R.G. Ritchey J.M. Honig G.E. Klotz I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The acetyl βLys-82 adduct has been shown to give rise to several resonances (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The latter phenomenon occurs in more highly modified hemoglobin, apparently as a result of the additional modification of nearby residues leading to a chemical shift inequivalence (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In general, the HMQC spectra of hemoglobin acetylated using [1′-13C]aspirin or [1-13C]MAP were fairly similar, indicating that [1′-13C]aspirin and [1-13C]MAP share major acetylation sites. Indeed, our recent studies (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and investigations by Manning and co-workers (Ref. 10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and reference therein) show that both agents acetylate βLys-82 in the 2,3-DPG binding pocket (10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on this spectral comparison and in light of our recent study of asprin acetylation (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we assign resonances 1, 3, and 6 to acetyl βLys-59, acetyl αLys-90, and acetyl βLys-82, respectively. Resonance 8 is tentatively assigned to acetyl βLys-144. Further, as in the aspirin study, it is likely that resonance 9 arises from hemoglobin molecules acetylated at both the βLys-82 and βLys-82′ on the second β-chain, because the latter represents the potential acetylation site nearest to βLys-82. Resonance 5 may also arise from acetyl βLys-82 in hemoglobin, which is additionally acetylated at other nearby or interacting sites. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence, particularly the identical shifts observed for resonances 6 and 9 in acetylated paramagnetic cyanomethemoglobin (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To confirm the assignment of acetyl βLys-82 and other adduct residues in the 2,3-DPG pocket, acetylation of hemoglobin with [1-13C]MAP was carried out in the presence of a 1–4-fold molar excess of IHP. IHP was utilized to block access to the 2,3-DPG binding site of COHbA because of its greater affinity for this site (KD = 10−4m)(18Brygier J. De Bruin S.H. Van Hoof P.M.K.B. Rollema H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), compared with 2,3-DPG (KD = 2.4 × 10−3m) (19Labotka R.J. Schwab C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The binding of IHP resulted in a substantial decrease in intensity for peaks 6, 8, and 9 (Fig.3), consistent with the assignment of these resonances to acetyl βLys-82 and acetyl βLys-144 in the 2,3-DPG binding pocket. However, no significant decreases of the intensities of peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 11 were observed, indicating the high selectivity of the protective effect of IHP against subsequent acetylation by [1-13C] MAP. Thus, the lack of a significant reduction in the intensities of peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 11 (Fig. 3) indicates that the corresponding residues are located outside of the 2,3-DPG binding pocket. This result appears to be in direct contrast to the early report by Manning and co-workers (Ref. 10Ueno H. Pospischil M.A. Manning J.M. Kluger R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholarand references therein), according to which no acetylation of residues outside the 2,3-DPG binding site was noted. To further compare the specificities of aspirin and MAP as acetylating agents, COHbA was exposed initially to a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled MAP, which was followed by exposure to [1′-13C]aspirin. The HMQC spectra of COHbA acetylated with and without prior exposure to unlabeled MAP are shown in Fig. 4. The adduct spectrum corresponding to [1′-13C]aspirin-acetylated COHbA (Fig.4 A) has been labeled with primes to distinguish the resonances from the adduct spectra derived from [1-13C]MAP treatment of the hemoglobin. A comparison of Figs. 1 A and 4 A indicates that very similar adduct species were generated, as discussed above. A comparison of Fig.4, panels A and B, reveals a substantial decrease in intensity of the adduct resonances 5′, 6′, 9′, and 8′ as a result of the pre-exposure to MAP, in addition to smaller decreases in intensity for the other adduct resonances, which is consistent with the greater intensities for [1-13C]MAP adduct peaks 5, 6, 9, and 8 shown in Fig. 2. These results indicate that both acetylating agents appear to be capable of targeting a similar group of residues, and both show a similar preference for acetylation of βLys-82, located in the β-cleft involved in the binding of 2,3-DPG. In summary, acetylation of oxyHbA or COHbA with methyl acetylphosphate under the conditions used in previously reported studies (4Ueno H. Manning J.M. Am. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 1988; 10: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 5Ueno H. Bai Y. Manning J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 565: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Manning J.M.

Liss, Inc., New York1987: 105-110Google Scholar), as well as in a phosphate buffer, yields HMQC spectra with 10–11 adduct resonances. In general, the pattern of acetylation appears to be similar to that obtained using [1′-13C]aspirin (12Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Observation of the resonance intensities at various MAP:COHbA ratios indicates a preference for acetylation of βLys-82, as well as a significant degree of acetylation of the βLys-59 and αLys-90 residues, which are also acetylated by aspirin. Hence the acetylation profile obtained using MAP is qualitatively similar to that obtained using aspirin, with MAP acetylating a number of residues located outside of the 2,3-DPG binding pocket. Further, we have recently found that exposure of human serum albumin to MAP results in the formation of multiple adduct resonances (results not shown here). The broad reactivity of methyl acetylphosphate with various residues of hemoglobin outside of the 2,3-DPG binding site, as well as with human serum albumin, indicates that this compound would not be a suitable therapeutic agent for treatment of sickle cell disease as has been previously suggested (Ref. 4Ueno H. Manning J.M. Am. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 1988; 10: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and references therein). Based on the reported selectivity of methyl acetylphosphate for residues in the 2,3-DPG binding pocket, Jones et al. (8Jones R.T. Head C.G. Fujita T.S. Shih D.T.-B. Wodzinska J. Kluger R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have evaluated a series of bis(methyl phosphate) cross-linking agents that stabilize the hemoglobin tetramer. These agents were reported to be highly selective in cross-linking the amino-containing residues of the 2,3-DPG binding cleft (βVal-1 and βLys-82) as well as acylating αVal-1 and αLys-99. Some of the same cross-linked adducts have previously been reported for bis(salicylate) derivatives (22Walder J.A. Zaugg R.H. Walder R.Y. Steele J.M. Klotz I.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4265-4270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chatterjee R. Welty E.V. Walder R.Y. Pruitt S.L. Rogers P.L. Arnone A. Walder J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9929-9937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies call into question how much more selective the bis(methyl phosphate) cross-linking agents actually are. A comparative study, utilizing the same conditions, for the analogous bis(methyl phosphate) and bis(salicylate) agents would appear to be desirable to address this question. We thank Dr. Eugene DeRose for assistance with some of the NMR experiments."

We find that, on average, only three rounds of abortive initiation precede the formation of each elongation complex and that nearly all pol III molecules escape the abortive initiation phase of transcription without significant pausing or arrest. However, when elongation is limited to 5 nucleotides, the intrinsic exoribonuclease activity of pol III cleaves 5-mer RNA at a rate considerably faster than product release or reinitiation.

TFIIIB is assembled upstream of the start site of transcription by its assembly factor TFIIIC, whose binding site lies in the transcribed DNA sequence. Once assembled, TFIIIB forms a highly stable complex on DNA and alone suffices for recruiting pol III for multiple rounds of transcription (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Geiduschek E.P.

Only recently has emphasis been placed on the steps that occur between the recruitment of pol III into the complex and the formation of a productive, stable elongation complex. What is known is reminiscent of the pathway that bacterial RNA polymerases follow in forming a productive elongation complex. Pol III assembles onto a TFIIIB-DNA complex at the start site of transcription at 0 °C to form a relatively stable closed complex (i.e. without melting DNA) (13Kassavetis G.A. Blanco J.A. Johnson T.E. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Closed promoter complexes specified by ς54-containing Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme are likewise stable, in contrast to the generally unstable closed promoter complexes specified by the ς70-holoenzyme (14Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DNA melting by pol III is a temperature-dependent process that initially occurs upstream of the start site of transcription and then extends downstream (13Kassavetis G.A. Blanco J.A. Johnson T.E. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as has been noted subsequently for open complex formation formed by bacterial RNA polymerases (e.g. Refs. 16Chen Y.F. Helmann J.D.

Recent experiments point to an active participation of TFIIIB in open complex formation by pol III (19Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following open complex formation, both bacterial RNA polymerases and RNA polymerase II (pol II) of higher eukaryotes enter an abortive initiation phase of templated reiterative synthesis, yielding short ribooligonucleotide products, usually ranging between 2 and 10 nt in length (21Carpousis A.J.

A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the case of the bacterial RNA polymerase, the number of abortive products generated per productive elongation complex can be high (exceeding 50; Refs. 21Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and 24Munson L.M. Reznikoff W.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) The relative frequency of abortive to productive initiation is influenced both by the promoter and by the initially transcribed sequence and can be rate-limiting for gene expression (30Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The transition from abortive initiation to productive elongation is made irreversible by the release of ς70 and movement of RNA polymerase away from the promoter (22Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Hansen U.M. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9564-9570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Krummel B.

Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pol II also undergoes a transition from an abortive phase to a productive complex after synthesis of a 9-nt transcript and concurrent reclosure of the transcription bubble upstream of the start site of transcription (28Holstege F.C. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both initiation and escape from the abortive phase at the adenovirus major late promoter are facilitated by TFIIE and TFIIH (29Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the absence of TFIIH, pol II arrests 10–17 nt downstream of the start site of transcription (29Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The presence of TFIIE, TFIIH, and ATP greatly diminishes this arrest and also diminishes the production of short abortive transcripts. Both the elongation factor elongin and the VP16 transcriptional activator further diminish this arrest (29Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Moreland R.J. Hanas J.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26610-26617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Pol II is also subject to an additional promoter-proximal block to transcript elongation that is likely to be mechanistically distinctive. RNA chain elongation arrests within the first 50 bp of many pol II transcription units in the absence of gene-specific activators (Refs.36Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Li B. Weber J.A. Chen Y. Greenleaf A.L. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell.

Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), which may function to facilitate the mediator-elongator exchange phase of the transcription cycle (41Mason Jr., P.B. Lis J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33227-33233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The activity of pol III can also be limited at this stage of abortive initiation; a defect in the transition to productive transcription of poly(dA-dT):poly(dA-dT) by a pol III C160 subunit mutant has been noted (9Thuillier V. Brun I. Sentenac A. Werner M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 618-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The production of repetitive sequence RNA by “slippage” at low concentrations of initiating nucleotides also implies the existence of an abortive phase of transcription on natural pol III templates (5Dieci G. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Lukhtanov E. Thuriaux P. Werner M. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3766-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,43Zecherle G.N. Whelen S. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5801-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have been interested in whether the escape from abortive initiation might significantly limit the overall rate of pol III transcription. This appears plausible; pol III forms a stable complex with TFIIIB on DNA even in the absence of promoter opening, and promoter clearance is likely to necessitate the breaking of this protein-protein contact. The affinity of bacterial RNA polymerase for the promoter and of the core enzyme for ς can also govern the duration of the abortive phase of initiation and the sizes of abortive transcripts (44Tintut Y. Wang J.T. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24392-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The rapidity (generally less than 3–5 s) with which pol III completes the elongation phase on its short (generally less than 110-bp) transcription units also suggests that the abortive phase of transcription might be rate-limiting. The stability of the pol III-TFIIIB-DNA complex suggests that a signature of pol III breaking away from TFIIIB might be discerned among the abortive transcripts, either through extended repetitive abortive initiation (as observed with bacterial RNA polymerase) or through start site-proximal pausing or arrest (as observed for pol II). In the experiments that are reported here, we have examined abortive initiation and post- initiation steps leading to the formation of a stable, productive elongation complex. We find that nearly all pol III-promoter complexes that are capable of undergoing abortive initiation are also capable of generating a productive elongation complex. The number of abortive initiation events on the pathway to formation of a productive elongation complex is small; moreover, no hold-up points in extending an RNA chain from 5 to 18 nt are detected. Curiously, however, we observe a relatively efficient process of transcription start-proximal hydrolytic retraction of nascent RNA chains; under conditions limiting transcription to the formation of the 5-nt transcript, the latter is rapidly cleaved by the intrinsic ribonuclease activity of pol III. TFIIIC, pol III, recombinant TBP, Brf, and B"" were purified and assayed as described previously or cited (46Kassavetis G.A. Nguyen S.T. Kobayashi R. Kumar A. Geiduschek E.P. Pisano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9786-9790Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DNA template for transcription, pTA-30 (47Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), contains a 6-bp TATA box placed within a GC-rich sequence context 30 bp upstream of the transcription start of the wild type SUP4 tRNA gene (Fig. 1 A). Oligoribonucleotides ApApC, ApApCpA, and ApApCpApA, dinucleoside monophosphates, ribonuclease A, ribonuclease U2, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, [α-32P]CTP, unlabeled ribonucleotides, and 3′-O-methyl-GTP (3′O-MeGTP) were purchased. Transcription complexes were formed for 1 h at 21 °C with 50 fmol of pTA-30, 100 fmol of TBP, 75 fmol of B"", 30 fmol of Brf, 37 fmol of TFIIIC, and 8 fmol of pol III in 8 μl of a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% (v/v) glycerol, and 120 mm NaCl. Transcription was initiated by adding 2 μl of a nucleotide mixture providing 25 μm[α-32P]ATP (30 cpm/fmol), 25 μm CTP, 25 μm UTP, and 100 μm 3′O-MeGTP, as indicated in the figures. Reactions were terminated after 0.5–30 min at 21 °C by plunging reaction tubes into a 100 °C bath for 3 min. Samples were then cooled to room temperature, and 1 unit of shrimp alkaline phosphatase was added for 15 min at 37 °C to release radioactive orthophosphate from [α-32P]ATP and from the 5′-ends of transcripts. Reaction mixtures were then transferred to tubes containing a quantity of (dry) urea providing 6 m final concentration, heated at 100 °C for 3 min, resolved by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide (22:3 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel containing 8 m urea, and quantified by phosphor image analysis. Stable ternary transcription complexes were isolated by chromato- graphy on Sepharose CL2B (48Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, reaction mixtures were formed as above, but on a 5-fold larger scale, and RNA synthesis was terminated after 15 min at 21 °C by adding EDTA to 10 mm. The reaction mixture was then chromatographed on Sepharose CL2B in transcription buffer lacking MgCl2 but containing 0.01% Tween 20, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Plasmid DNA-containing fractions in the excluded volume were pooled; where indicated, MgCl2 to 7 mm; ATP, CTP, and UTP to 25 μm; and 3′O-MeGTP to 100 μm were added for 15 min at 21 °C. Reactions were terminated by heating to 100 °C followed by digestion with alkaline phosphatase and electrophoretic analysis, as described above. Short oligoribonucleotides generated by pol III in the presence of ATP, ATP plus CTP, or ATP plus CTP plus UTP after 30 min of synthesis were identified by passive elution of radioactive material from slices (“bands”) excised from electrophoresis gels (Fig. 1 B) into 200 μl of 100 mm NH4 acetate, 1 mm EDTA. The eluted oligonucleotides were treated with ribonuclease A, ribonuclease U2, or alkaline phosphatase and analyzed by chromatography on polyethyleneimine thin layers with 0.16, 0.3, and 0.5 m LiCl as solvent (49Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12: 323-347Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar) in conjunction with appropriate unlabeled mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide markers. An example of the analysis is shown in Fig. 1 C. Band I of Fig. 1 B (from the ATP-only reaction of Fig. 2 A) was identified as ApA, since it was synthesized in reactions containing only ATP, the product co-migrated on thin layers with ApA, it failed to be cleaved by ribonuclease U2 (which cleaves ApApA, but ApA cleavage is fairly resistant; Ref. 50Brownlee G.G. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1972: 199-200Google Scholar), and its migration on thin layers was unaffected by alkaline phosphatase. Band II from the ATP plus CTP reaction was also identified as ApA by the same criteria. In comparable ways, band III was identified as CpA, and band V was identified as ApApCpApA. Band III co-migrated with CpA and not ApC on thin layers; it was cleaved by RNase A, generating 32P-labeled 3′-CMP (Fig.1 C). Band V co-migrated with ApApCpApA on thin layers. Band IV was identified as predominately ApApC but contained trace amounts of what most probably is ApApCpA (but conceivably could be ApCpApA). The major and trace products that were resolved on thin layer chromatography co-migrated with ApApC and ApApCpA, respectively; the major product was not cleaved by RNase A or affected by alkaline phosphatase but was cleaved by RNase U2, generating a product co-migrating with ApAp on thin layers. (The latter product was synthesized by pol III with ApA and [α-32P]CTP on the SUP4 (pTA-30) template, followed by cleavage with RNase U2.) Bands VI and X (presumed to be due to incomplete dephosphorylation prior to gel electrophoresis) were not consistently observed; their contents migrated on polyethyleneimine thin layers ahead of the dinucleoside monophosphates and were not further identified. Bands VII and VIII were identified as ApA and CpA, respectively, by the same criteria applied to bands II and III. Although the band IX product migrates on polyacrylamide gels with band IV, it was found to contain only trace ApApC (as evidenced by its co-migration with an ApApC marker on polyethyleneimine thin layers) and no detectable ApApCpA. Most of this material appears to be UpA; it co-migrated with UpA on thin layers, was cleaved by RNase A generating 32P-nucleoside monophosphate, and was not cleaved by alkaline phosphatase or RNase U2. It has been shown previously that pol III forms a highly stable ternary elongation complex with a 17-nt nascent RNA chain when it initiates transcription on the SUP4 tRNA gene with a nucleotide mixture lacking GTP. Elongation of the nascent RNA resumes promptly and quantitatively upon subsequent provision of GTP (51Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 52Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether there is a kinetically significant phase of abortive initiation prior to the formation of this stable elongation complex or whether there are sites of pausing on the way to forming the 17-mer. In a crude cell-free extract, pol III initiates transcription exclusively at bp +1 in the sequence shown in Fig.1 A. However, with highly purified components derived entirely from yeast or with purified pol III, TFIIIC, and recombinant TFIIIB, somewhat heterogeneous placement of TFIIIB by TFIIIC onto the AT-rich sequence upstream of the transcriptional start of the SUP4 tRNA gene generates additional start sites at bp +4 and +8 (Refs. 47Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 53Léveillard T. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data not shown). In order to specify the site of transcriptional initiation more precisely, plasmid pTA-30 was chosen as template. Its 6-bp TATA box in a GC-rich sequence context upstream of the SUP4 tRNA gene has been designed to retain TFIIIC dependence for TFIIIB assembly while forcing a unique positioning of TFIIIB that specifies initiation at bp +1 (47Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A displays a time course of the accumulation of abortive and productive transcripts following the addition to preformed TFIIIC-TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes of 25 μm [α-32P]ATP, 25 μm[α-32P]ATP and CTP, or 25 μm[α-32P]ATP, CTP, and UTP, with 100 μm3′O-MeGTP present to prevent elongation past G18 (due to the presence of trace ITP). It can be seen readily that short oligonucletotide products accumulate with time in the presence of ATP or ATP plus CTP but that their abundance diminishes greatly when UTP is also present. The same products were also generated when a 270-bp restriction fragment containing the TA-30 variant of the SUP4 tRNA gene replaced the entire plasmid as DNA template; synthesis of these small products was absolutely dependent on the presence of both TFIIIB and TFIIIC (data not shown); both findings indicate that these products were derived from specific initiation at the SUP4 gene. The expected product from the reaction containing only ATP is ApA (after removal of 5′-terminal phosphates with alkaline phosphatase). We were therefore surprised that reaction mixtures containing ATP- and CTP-generated products that migrated ahead of the presumed ApA product on 20% polyacrylamide gels. The products generated after 30 min of synthesis were eluted from their gels and further analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting identifications are summarized in Fig. 1 B and in the right side of Fig. 2 A. Only ApA was synthesized in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 A) and accumulated at a constant rate for 30 min (Fig. 3 A). There was no evidence of slippage generating products containing more than two A residues (5Dieci G. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Lukhtanov E. Thuriaux P. Werner M. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3766-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the presence of both ATP and CTP, pol III also synthesized ApA, which accumulated in a linear fashion over a 30-min period at approximately 80% of the ATP-alone rate (Figs. 2 A and3 A). The next most abundant product proved to be CpA, which accumulated at one-third the rate of ApA (Figs. 2 A and3 A). This was perplexing, since no full-length SUP4 transcripts or ternary transcription complexes arrested at C17 can be ascribed to initiation occurring at either bp −1 or bp +3 (5Dieci G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas productive initiation at bp −1 is allowed when transcription is primed with the dinucleotide CpA (Ref.53Léveillard T. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; data for the pTA-30 template not shown). We argue below that the CpA product results from exonucleolytic retraction during abortive initiation. A barely resolved doublet of bands below CpA was identified as ApApC and ApApCpApA (Fig. 2 A; a trace, but negligible, amount of ApApCpA was also contained in the ApApC band). ApApC and ApApCpApA accumulated linearly for 30 min at ∼5 and ∼1.3% of the rate of ApA, respectively (Fig. 3 A), but their initial rates of accumulation during the first minute of synthesis were approximately 4-fold higher (Fig. 3 A, inset). The addition of UTP and 3′O-MeGTP to allow pol III to extend an RNA chain to G18 greatly reduced abortive initiation and generated the expected G18 ternary transcription complex (Fig. 2 A). However, we also observed bands corresponding in size to transcripts with 3′-ends at U16 and U14 that had not been seen previously in reactions lacking 3′O-MeGTP (48Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). (Weaker bands corresponding to C17, C15, and C13 could also be detected in the original autoradiogram.) The accumulation of all of the ≥14-nt RNA chains ceased after 4 min of synthesis; each displayed a half-time of formation of 1–2 min. We consider each of these transcripts to be productive, since they are not synthesized reiteratively with time. Accordingly, their yields have been summed in Fig. 3 B. ApA and CpA continued to be synthesized reiteratively for 30 min but at one-eighth the rate of the initial minute (Fig. 3 B). Upon further analysis, the product co-migrating with ApApC in the ATP plus CTP plus UTP plus 3′O-MeGTP reaction (Fig. 2 A) proved to be UpA; only negligible levels of ApApC were present in this band (see “Materials and Methods”). If this band is derived from the initial SUP4 transcript, it must be generated by nucleolytic retraction, either from nt 8 to nt 6 or from nt 12 to nt 10. Production of UpA was linear for 30 min, at about 60% of the rate of ApA synthesis in the same reaction (analysis not shown). The presence and reiterative synthesis of UpA suggested that the U16 and U14 productive transcripts may be derived from nucleolytic retraction from G18 in dinucleotide increments (10Bobkova E.V.

To explore retraction under the conditions of the time course analysis shown in Fig. 2 A, RNA synthesis with 25 μm[α-32P]ATP, CTP, and UTP and 100 μm3′O-MeGTP was terminated after 15 min b"
