https://openalex.org/W2917035942,"This paper demonstrates the application of aerial multispectral images in cotton plant phenotyping. Four phenotypic traits (plant height, canopy cover, vegetation index, and flower) were measured from multispectral images captured by a multispectral camera on an unmanned aerial system. Data were collected on eight different days from two fields. Ortho-mosaic and digital elevation models (DEM) were constructed from the raw images using the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm. A data processing pipeline was developed to calculate plant height using the ortho-mosaic and DEM. Six ground calibration targets (GCTs) were used to correct the error of the calculated plant height caused by the georeferencing error of the DEM. Plant heights were measured manually to validate the heights predicted from the imaging method. The error in estimation of the maximum height of each plot ranged from -40.4 to 13.5 cm among six datasets, all of which showed strong linear relationships with the manual measurement (R2 > 0.89). Plot canopy was separated from the soil based on the DEM and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Canopy cover and mean canopy NDVI were calculated to show canopy growth over time and the correlation between the two indices was investigated. The spectral responses of the ground, leaves, cotton flower, and ground shade were analyzed and detection of cotton flowers was satisfactory using a support vector machine (SVM). This study demonstrated the potential of using aerial multispectral images for high throughput phenotyping of important cotton phenotypic traits in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2917843922,"Introduction Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly being considered as an important measure of how disease affects patients’ lives, especially for long-term diseases like chronic kidney disease (CKD). Even though there is no statistically significant association between stages of CKD and QoL, it is decreased in patients with early stages of the disease. Hence, this study aimed to assess QoL and its predictors among patients with CKD at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). Methods A cross sectional study was conducted at the nephrology clinic of TASH. A total of 256 patients were recruited through systematic random sampling. Data were collected using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Items (SF-36). The data were entered into Epi Info 7.2.2.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software. Descriptive statistics like frequency, percent, mean and standard deviation were used to summarize patients’ baseline characteristics. Student’s unpaired t-test and ANOVA were conducted to compare two groups and more than two groups in the analysis of QoL, respectively. Multivariable linear regression was employed to investigate the potential predictors of QoL. Results Quality of life was decreased in all stages of CKD. A reduction in physical functioning (p = 0.03), bodily pain (p = 0.004), vitality (p = 0.019) and social functioning (p = 0.002) was observed progressively across stages of CKD. High income status and greater than 11g/dl hemoglobin level were found to be predictors of all high score SF-36 domains. High family income (β 15.33; 95%CI: 11.33–19.33, p<0.001), higher educational status (β 7.9; 95%CI: 4.10–11.66, p<0.001), and hemoglobin ≥11g/dl (β 8.36; 95%CI: 6.31–10.41, p<0.001) were predictors of better QoL in the physical component summary, whereas absence of CKD complications (β 2.75; 95%CI: 0.56–4.94, p = 0.014), high family income (β 10.10; 95%CI: 5.10–15.10, p<0.001) and hemoglobin ≥11g/dl (β 4.54, 95%CI: 2.01–7.08, p = 0.001) were predictors of better QoL in the mental component summary. Conclusion In this setting, QoL decreased in CKD patients in the early stages of the disease. Study participants with low income and hemoglobin level were considered to have worse quality of life in both physical and mental component summaries."
https://openalex.org/W2916204794,"This aims of this study were (I) to determine the velocity variable and regression model which best fit the load-velocity relationship during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise, (II) to compare the reliability of the velocity attained at each percentage of the one-repetition maximum (1RM) between different velocity variables and regression models, and (III) to compare the within- and between-subject variability of the velocity attained at each %1RM. Eighteen men (14 rowers and four weightlifters) performed an incremental test during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise in two different sessions. General and individual load-velocity relationships were modelled through three velocity variables (mean velocity [MV], mean propulsive velocity [MPV] and peak velocity [PV]) and two regression models (linear and second-order polynomial). The main findings revealed that (I) the general (Pearson's correlation coefficient [r] range = 0.964–0.973) and individual (median r = 0.986 for MV, 0.989 for MPV, and 0.984 for PV) load-velocity relationships were highly linear, (II) the reliability of the velocity attained at each %1RM did not meaningfully differ between the velocity variables (coefficient of variation [CV] range = 2.55–7.61% for MV, 2.84–7.72% for MPV and 3.50–6.03% for PV) neither between the regression models (CV range = 2.55–7.72% and 2.73–5.25% for the linear and polynomial regressions, respectively), and (III) the within-subject variability of the velocity attained at each %1RM was lower than the between-subject variability for the light-moderate loads. No meaningful differences between the within- and between-subject CVs were observed for the MV of the 1RM trial (6.02% vs. 6.60%; CVratio = 1.10), while the within-subject CV was lower for PV (6.36% vs. 7.56%; CVratio = 1.19). These results suggest that the individual load-MV relationship should be determined with a linear regression model to obtain the most accurate prescription of the relative load during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2952575822,"Molecular tools adapted from bacterial CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems for adaptive immunity have become widely used for plant genome engineering, both to investigate gene functions and to engineer desirable traits. A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called 'off-targets' by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content of the target correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that 'high-fidelity' variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants. We present these molecular tools as standardised DNA parts to facilitate their re-use."
https://openalex.org/W2915632263,"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that causes ill health and death in millions of people each year worldwide. Timely diagnosis and treatment is key to full patient recovery. The Microscopic Observed Drug Susceptibility (MODS) is a test to diagnose TB infection and drug susceptibility directly from a sputum sample in 7-10 days with a low cost and high sensitivity and specificity, based on the visual recognition of specific growth cording patterns of M. Tuberculosis in a broth culture. Despite its advantages, MODS is still limited in remote, low resource settings, because it requires permanent and trained technical staff for the image-based diagnostics. Hence, it is important to develop alternative solutions, based on reliable automated analysis and interpretation of MODS cultures. In this study, we trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic interpretation of MODS cultures digital images. The CNN was trained on a dataset of 12,510 MODS positive and negative images obtained from three different laboratories, where it achieved 96.63 +/- 0.35% accuracy, and a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 91% to 99%, when validated across held-out laboratory datasets. The model's learned features resemble visual cues used by expert diagnosticians to interpret MODS cultures, suggesting that our model may have the ability to generalize and scale. It performed robustly when validated across held-out laboratory datasets and can be improved upon with data from new laboratories. This CNN can assist laboratory personnel, in low resource settings, and is a step towards facilitating automated diagnostics access to critical areas in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2916742476,"Medium containing Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) provides a supportive environment for isolation and expansion of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs); however, the inherent variability of FBS may contribute to inconsistencies in cell growth and yield between batches of stem cell products. For this reason, we set out to develop a serum-free medium capable of supporting the in vitro expansion of MSCs. First a naïve serum-free medium was formulated by Sato’s approach. Once it was established that the naïve serum-free medium supported the expansion of canine adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSCs), the serum-free medium was optimized by addition of growth factors. Combinations of growth factors were chosen and compared by their effect on cell proliferation and colony formation. Growth characteristics of canine adipose-derived MSCs cultured in the serum-free medium were comparable to those cultured in standard FBS containing medium. In addition, cell surface marker expression and differentiation potential of serum-free and FBS-based cultures were also comparable. However, a commercial serum-free medium developed for human MSC culture did not support growth of canine Ad-MSCs. In summary, canine Ad-MSCs isolated and cultured in serum-free medium retained the basic characteristics of MSCs cultured in FBS containing medium."
https://openalex.org/W2916561522,"Past research indicates that patient perceptions of surgeon warmth and competence influence treatment expectancies and satisfaction with treatment outcomes. Stereotypes have a powerful impact on impression formation. The present research explores stereotypes about surgeon warmth and competence and investigates the extent to which surgeon gender influences perceptions of female and male surgeons. A between-subjects experiment was conducted online using crowdsourcing technology to derive a representative sample from the general population. Four hundred and fifteen participants were randomly assigned to evaluate the warmth and competence of males, females, surgeons, male surgeons, or female surgeons, using validated measures. Planned contrasts revealed that as a group, surgeons received higher warmth and competence ratings than non-surgeons (p = .007). Consistent with gender stereotypes, female surgeons received higher warmth ratings (p < .001) and lower competence ratings (p = .001) than male surgeons. The stereotype of surgeons held by the general public is that they are high in warmth and competence relative to other occupational groups. Surgeon gender appears to influence general beliefs about the warmth and competence of female and male surgeons."
https://openalex.org/W2915837921,"Acoustic levitation method (ALM) is a container-less processing method with applications in various fields, including material processing, biology, and analytical chemistry. Because it is a container-less processing technique, ALM could prevent nucleation and contamination of materials being processed via contact with a container wall. It is well-known that evaporation of a sample is an important process in container-less processing of materials; however, the mechanism of evaporation in multicomponent droplets in a single acoustic levitator is still unclear. Thus, we evaluate and understand the evaporation of an acoustically levitated multicomponent droplet and manipulate the evaporation process of the sample in this study. Specifically, we investigate the evaporation process of pure and multicomponent droplets using container-less processing experimentally. The evaporation processes and temporal evolution of the surface temperature of a multicomponent droplet were evaluated using a high-speed camera and radiation thermometer, respectively. We used water, ethanol, methanol, hexane, acetone, pentane, and binary solutions (solution of 25 wt%, 50 wt%, and 75 wt% ethanol, methanol, and acetone, respectively) as test samples to study the effect of saturated vapor pressure on evaporation. Ethanol, methanol, and acetone droplets evaporate in two different stages. It was observed that the water vapor in the air condensed during the evaporation process of these water-soluble droplets; hence, our experimental data did not agree with the theoretical prediction in accordance with the d2 law. Nevertheless, the evaporation behavior in the first stage of evaporation was consistent with the theoretical prediction. Furthermore, for binary droplets, as the concentration of the resultant solution increased owing to evaporation, the transition time from the first to the second stage of evaporation also increased. Based on these observations, estimation equations for binary droplets were developed to ensure that the experimental and theoretical values were in good agreement."
https://openalex.org/W2915373590,"Background Iron overload, resulting from blood transfusions in patients with chronic anemias, has historically been controlled with regular deferoxamine, but its parenteral requirement encouraged studies of orally-active agents, including deferasirox and deferiprone. Deferasirox, licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2005 based upon the results of randomized controlled trials, is now first-line therapy worldwide. In contrast, early investigator-initiated trials of deferiprone were prematurely terminated after investigators raised safety concerns. The FDA declined market approval of deferiprone; years later, it licensed the drug as “last resort” therapy, to be prescribed only if first-line drugs had failed. We undertook to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and toxicities of deferiprone and deferasirox in one transfusion clinic. Methods and findings Under an IRB-approved study, we retrospectively inspected the electronic medical records of consented iron-loaded patients managed between 2009 and 2015 at The University Health Network (UHN), Toronto. We compared changes in liver and heart iron, adverse effects and other outcomes, in patients treated with deferiprone or deferasirox. Results Although deferiprone was unlicensed in Canada, one-third (n = 41) of locally-transfused patients had been switched from first-line, licensed therapies (deferoxamine or deferasirox) to regimens of unlicensed deferiprone. The primary endpoint of monitoring in iron overload, hepatic iron concentration (HIC), increased (worsened) during deferiprone monotherapy (mean 10±2–18±2 mg/g; p < 0.0003), exceeding the threshold for life-threatening complications (15 mg iron/g liver) in 50% patients. During deferasirox monotherapy, mean HIC decreased (improved) (11±1–6±1 mg/g; p < 0.0001). Follow-up HICs were significantly different following deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapies (p < 0.0000002). Addition of low-dose deferoxamine (<40 mg/kg/day) to deferiprone did not result in reductions of HIC to <15 mg/g (baseline 20±4 mg/g; follow-up, 18±4 mg/g; p < 0.2) or in reduction in the proportion of patients with HIC exceeding 15 mg/g (p < 0.2). During deferiprone exposure, new diabetes mellitus, a recognized consequence of inadequate iron control, was diagnosed in 17% patients, most of whom had sustained HICs exceeding 15 mg/g for years; one woman died after 13 months of a regimen of deferiprone and low-dose deferasirox. During deferiprone exposure, serum ALT increased over baseline in 65% patients. Mean serum ALT increased 6.6-fold (p < 0.001) often persisting for years. During deferasirox exposure, mean ALT was unchanged (p < 0.84). No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in the proportions of patients estimated to have elevated cardiac iron. Conclusions Deferiprone showed ineffectiveness and significant toxicity in most patients. Combination with low doses of first-line therapies did not improve the effectiveness of deferiprone. Exposure to deferiprone, over six years while the drug was unlicensed, in the face of ineffectiveness and serious toxicities, demands review of the standards of local medical practice. The limited scope of regulatory approval of deferiprone, worldwide, should restrict its exposure to the few patients genuinely unable to tolerate the two effective, first-line therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2915494788,"Climatic conditions affect the growth, development and final crop production. As wheat is of paramount importance as a staple crop in the human diet, there is a growing need to study its abiotic stress adaptation through the performance of key breeding traits. New and complementary approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS), are used for the dissection of different agronomic traits. The present study focused on the dissection of agronomic and quality traits of interest (initial agronomic score, yield, gluten index, sedimentation index, specific weight, whole grain protein and yellow colour) assessed in a panel of 179 durum wheat lines (Triticum durum Desf.), grown under rainfed conditions in different Mediterranean environments in Southern Spain (Andalusia). The findings show a total of 37 marker-trait associations (MTAs) which affect phenotype expression for three quality traits (specific weight, gluten and sedimentation indexes). MTAs could be mapped on the A and B durum wheat subgenomes (on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 3A) through the recently available bread wheat reference assembly (IWGSC RefSeqv1). Two of the MTAs found for quality traits (gluten index and SDS) corresponded to the known Glu-B1 and Glu-A1 loci, for which candidate genes corresponding to high molecular weight glutenin subunits could be located. The GS prediction ability values obtained from the breeding materials analyzed showed promising results for traits as grain protein content, sedimentation and gluten indexes, which can be used in plant breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2918013817,"Physical activity promotes metabolic and cardiovascular health benefits that derive in part from the transcriptional responses to exercise that occur within skeletal muscle and other organs. There is interest in discovering a pharmacologic exercise mimetic that could imbue wellness and alleviate disease burden. However, the molecular physiology by which exercise signals the transcriptional response is highly complex, making it challenging to identify a single target for pharmacological mimicry. The current studies evaluated the transcriptome responses in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and white and brown adipose to novel small molecule activators of AMPK (pan-activators for all AMPK isoforms) compared to that of exercise. A striking level of congruence between exercise and pharmacological AMPK activation was observed across the induced transcriptome of these five tissues. However, differences in acute metabolic response between exercise and pharmacologic AMPK activation were observed, notably for acute glycogen balances and related to the energy expenditure induced by exercise but not pharmacologic AMPK activation. Nevertheless, intervention with repeated daily administration of short-acting activation of AMPK was found to mitigate hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in four rodent models of metabolic disease and without the cardiac glycogen accretion noted with sustained pharmacologic AMPK activation. These findings affirm that activation of AMPK is a key node governing exercise mediated transcription and is an attractive target as an exercise mimetic."
https://openalex.org/W2917589083,"Background Traditional food systems are under pressure from various stressors, including climate change which is projected to negatively alter the abundance of marine species harvested by coastal First Nations (FNs) in British Columbia (BC). Objective To model the potential impacts of the climate-related declines in seafood production on the nutritional status of coastal BC FNs. In addition, we projected potential changes in nutrient intakes, under different scenarios of substitution where traditional seafood is replaced with alternative non-traditional foods. Methods The study design is a mixed-method approach that combines two datasets: projected scenarios of climate-related change on seafood catch potential for coastal BC FNs and data derived from the cross-sectional First Nations Food, Nutrition, and Environment Study. The consumption of seafood was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire among 356 FNs. The contribution of seafood consumption to protein, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamins (A, B12, D, niacin), and minerals (zinc, selenium and iron) requirements was assessed using Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Results Traditional seafood consumption provided daily recommendations of EPA+DHA (74–184%) and vitamin B12 (84–152%) and substantial levels of niacin (28–55%), selenium (29–55%), vitamin D (15–30%) and protein (14–30%). Projected climate change was estimated to reduce the intakes of essential nutrients by 21% and 31% under ‘strong mitigation’ (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP2.6) and ‘business-as-usual’ (RCP8.5) climate change scenarios, respectively, by the year 2050 relative to 2000. The hypothetical substitution of seafood with selected alternative non-traditional foods does not provide adequate amounts of nutrients. Conclusion Traditionally-harvested seafood remains fundamental to the contemporary diet and health of coastal BC FNs. Potential dietary shifts aggravated by climate-related declines in seafood consumption may have significant nutritional and health implications for BC FN. Strategies to improve access to seafood harvest potential in coastal communities are needed to ensure nutritional health and overall well-being and to promote food security and food sovereignty in coastal FNs."
https://openalex.org/W2916607247,"Adult heart size is determined predominantly by the cardiomyocyte number and size. The cardiomyocyte number is determined primarily in the embryonic and perinatal period, as adult cardiomyocyte proliferation is restricted in comparison to that seen during the perinatal period. Recent evidence has implicated the mammalian Hippo kinase pathway as being critical in cardiomyocyte proliferation. Though the transcription factor, Tead1, is the canonical downstream transcriptional factor of the hippo kinase pathway in cardiomyocytes, the specific role of Tead1 in cardiomyocyte proliferation in the perinatal period has not been determined. Here, we report the generation of a cardiomyocyte specific perinatal deletion of Tead1, using Myh6-Cre deletor mice (Tead1-cKO). Perinatal Tead1 deletion was lethal by postnatal day 9 in Tead1-cKO mice due to dilated cardiomyopathy. Tead1-deficient cardiomyocytes have significantly decreased proliferation during the immediate postnatal period, when proliferation rate is normally high. Deletion of Tead1 in HL-1 cardiac cell line confirmed that cell-autonomous Tead1 function is required for normal cardiomyocyte proliferation. This was secondary to significant decrease in levels of many proteins, in vivo, that normally promote cell cycle in cardiomyocytes. Taken together this demonstrates the non-redundant critical requirement for Tead1 in regulating cell cycle proteins and proliferation in cardiomyocytes in the perinatal heart."
https://openalex.org/W2917491956,"Introduction Several supply chain components are important to sustain point-of-care (POC) testing services in rural settings. To evaluate the availability of POC diagnostic tests in rural Ghana’s primary healthcare (PHC) clinics, we conducted an audit of the supply chain management for POC diagnostic services in rural Upper East Region’s (UER) PHC clinics, Ghana to determine the reasons/causes of POC tests deficiencies. Material and methods We conducted a review of accessible POC diagnostics in 100 PHC clinics in UER, Ghana from February to March 2018. We used a monitoring audit tool adopted from the World Health Organization and Management Science for Health guidelines for supply chain management of diagnostics for compliance. We determined a clinic’s compliance with the stipulated guidelines, and a composite compliant score was defined as a percentage rating of 90 to 100%. We used univariate logistic regression analysis in Stata 14 to determine the level of association between supply chain management and the audit variables. Results Overall, the composite compliant score of supply chain management for existing POC tests was at 81% (95%CI: 79%–82%). The mean compliance with distribution guidelines was at 93.8% (95%CI: 91.9%–95.6%) the highest score, whilst inventory management scored the lowest, at 53.5% (95%CI: 49.5%–57.5%) compliance. Of the 13 districts in the region, the results showed complete stock-out of blood glucose test in all selected PHC clinics in seven (53.8%) districts, haemoglobin and hepatitis B virus test in three (23.1%), and urine protein test in two (15.4%) districts. Based on our univariate logistics regression models, stock-out of tests at the Regional Medical and District Health Directorates stores in the region, high clinic attendance, lack of documentation of expiry date/expired tests, poor documentation of inventory level, poor monitoring of monthly consumption level, and failure to document unexplained losses of the various POC tests were significant predictors of complete test stock-out in most of the clinics in the Upper East Region. Discussion There is poor supply chain management of POC diagnostic tests in UER’s PHC clinics. Improvement in inventory management and human resource capacity for POC testing is critical to ensure accessibility and sustainability of POC diagnostic services in resource-limited settings PHC clinics."
https://openalex.org/W2918004693,"The Mediterranean sperm whale population is listed as 'Endangered"". The Hellenic Trench is the core habitat of the eastern Mediterranean sperm whale sub-population that numbers two to three hundred individuals. Major shipping routes running on or very close to the 1000 m depth contour along the Hellenic Trench are causing an unsustainable number of ship-strikes with sperm whales reviewed in this paper. Sperm whale sighting and density data were combined with specific information on the vessel traffic in the area (e.g., types of vessels, traffic patterns, speed and traffic density), in order to estimate the risk of a whale/ship interaction. Routing options to significantly reduce ship strike risk by a small offshore shift in shipping routes were identified. The overall collision risk for sperm whales in the study area would be reduced by around 70%, while a maximum of 11 nautical miles would be added to major routes and only around 5 nautical miles for the majority of ships. No negative impacts were associated with re-routing by shipping away from sperm whale habitat and there would be additional shipping safety and environmental benefits. A significant contribution to the overall conservation status of the marine Natura2000 sites in the area and very important population units of threatened species such as Cuvier's beaked whales, monk seals and loggerhead turtles would be achieved, by the reduction of shipping noise and reduced risk of any oil spills reaching the coasts, which are also important touristic destinations in Greece."
https://openalex.org/W2915919185,"Aim To assess the prognostic value of multiple recurrences on the risk of progression in a large cohort of TaG1 bladder cancer of low and intermediate risk based on the EORTC score and to evaluate prognostic factors of multiple recurrences. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed a French cohort of 470 patients with primary TaG1 bladder cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 2010 and followed until 2012. They were classified at low and intermediate risk using the EORTC risk score. Associations between the number of recurrences and the risk of progression to high grade Ta/T1 bladder cancer and progression to muscle-invasive disease were assessed. The characteristics of recurrences, as occurrence time or localization, and risk of other recurrences were evaluated. Results Out of 470 patients, 251 had recurrence, 34 progressed to high grade Ta/T1 and 17 to muscle-invasive disease, including 4 who had non muscle-invasive progression first. The median follow-up was 7.2 years (interquartile range: 4.2–10.9). In half the progressions, no previous recurrence was observed. No association between the number of recurrences and the risk of progression was detected. Even after 5 years free of event, patients had a 15% risk of recurrence. History of two or more recurrences increased by 4.5 the risk of subsequent recurrence. Time between two recurrences inferior to six months and multifocal localization increased the risk of recurrence. Conclusion Surveillance of patients with TaG1 should be continued beyond 5 years of follow-up. However, cystoscopy exams could be spaced after 5 years. Multiple TaG1 recurrences did not appear to be prognostic for disease progression, but increased significantly the risk of subsequent recurrences. Short time between two recurrences and multifocal localization may serve to adapt monitoring of patients with TaG1 Bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2917186721,"The use of emerging tobacco products, such as waterpipe or hookah and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), has gained significant popularity and are promoted as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes. Circadian systems are internal biological oscillations that are considered important regulators of immune functions in mammals. Tobacco induced inflammatory lung diseases frequently exhibit time-of-day/night variation in lung function and symptom severity. We investigated the impact of inhaled e-cig vapor and waterpipe smoke (WPS) on pulmonary circadian molecular clock disruption by determining the changes in expression levels and abundance of core clock component genes (BMAL1, CLOCK) and clock-controlled output genes (Rev-erbα, Per2, Rev-erbβ, Cry2, Rorα) in mouse lungs. We showed that the expression levels of these pulmonary core clock genes and clock-controlled output genes were altered significantly following exposure to WPS (Bmal1, Clock, and Rev-erbα). We further showed a significant yet differential effect on expression levels of core clock and clock-controlled genes (Bmal1, Per2) in the lungs of mice exposed to e-cig vapor containing nicotine. Thus, acute exposure to WPS and e-cig vapor containing nicotine contributes to altered expression of circadian molecular clock genes in mouse lungs, which may have repercussions on lung cellular and biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2917774954,"This paper proposes a mixture regression model-based method for drug sensitivity prediction. The proposed method explicitly addresses two fundamental issues in drug sensitivity prediction, namely, population heterogeneity and feature selection pertaining to each of the subpopulations. The mixture regression model is estimated using the imputation-conditional consistency algorithm, and the resulting estimator is consistent. This paper also proposes an average-BIC criterion for determining the number of components for the mixture regression model. The proposed method is applied to the CCLE dataset, and the numerical results indicate that the proposed method can make a drastic improvement over the existing ones, such as random forest, support vector regression, and regularized linear regression, in both drug sensitivity prediction and feature selection. The p-values for the comparisons in drug sensitivity prediction can reach the order O(10−8) or lower for the drugs with heterogeneous populations."
https://openalex.org/W2950194130,"Proteinuria is strongly associated with kidney disease progression but the mechanisms underlying podocyte handling of serum proteins such as albumin and IgG remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that albumin and IgG are transcytosed by podocytes in vitro. In other epithelial cells, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required to salvage albumin and IgG from the degradative pathway thereby allowing these proteins to be transcytosed or recycled. Here we directly examine the role of FcRn in albumin and IgG trafficking in podocytes by studying handling of these proteins in FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes in vitro and in a podocyte-specific FcRn knockout mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that knockout of FcRn leads to IgG accumulation in podocytes but does not alter albumin trafficking. Similarly, in vivo, podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn does not result in albumin accumulation in podocytes in vivo as measured by mean albumin fluorescence intensity whereas these mice demonstrate significant intraglomerular accumulation of IgG over time. In addition we find that podocyte-specific FcRn KO mice demonstrate mesangial expansion as they age and activation of mesangial cells as demonstrated by increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Taken together, these results suggest that trafficking pathways for albumin and IgG differ in podocytes and that sustained disruption of trafficking of plasma proteins alters glomerular structure."
https://openalex.org/W2917918011,"Numerous technologies exist to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs), although reports on cytological detection of CTCs remain limited. We recently developed a cytology-based CTC detection device using glass slides and light microscopy. In this study, we automated this previously manual device to improve its efficiency and cost effectiveness for clinical applications. We conducted a pilot study using this device to compare CTCs in peripheral blood (PB) and draining venous blood (DVB) from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The cytology-based automated CTC detection platform consisted of a disposable filtration device with a three-dimensional (3D) metal filter and multichannel automated CTC enrichment device. This platform allowed rapid and gentle filtration of CTCs and their efficient transfer from the filter to glass slides for subsequent Papanicolaou (Pap) and immunocytochemical (ICC) staining. Cytological diagnosis of CTCs was performed by observing permanent glass slide specimens by light microscopy. The current pilot clinical study enrolled CRC patients (n = 26) with stage I-IV tumors, who underwent surgery. PB was collected before surgery, and DVB was obtained from the mesenteric vein immediately after resection. Based on the CTC morphology obtained from PB and DVB samples, we proposed the following cytological criteria for the diagnosis of CTCs: pan-cytokeratin-positive, atypical cells with malignant morphological features identified by Pap staining. The numbers of CTCs defined by these criteria were significantly higher in DVB than PB from CRC patients (p<0.01), and the number of CTCs in DVB was increased significantly with stage progression (p<0.05). These results suggest that DVB may be another potential source of CTCs other than PB for liquid biopsies including downstream analysis. This automated cytology-based CTC detection device therefore provides a unique and powerful tool to investigate the significance of CTCs in CRC patients in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2915285435,"This cross-sectional study evaluated the quality of life and associated factors of climacteric women in Brazil using a random and representative sample of women assisted by primary care professionals. We investigated the variables using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, MENQOL, whose mean scores were compared using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests according to the sample characteristics. The variables associated with the outcomes in univariate analyses with a p≤0.2 were jointly evaluated using multiple linear regression. In this study, 849 women ranging in age from 40 to 65 years were evaluated. The predictors of poor quality of life in the vasomotor domain were women with severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001), increased Body Mass Index (BMI) (p = 0.006), sleep (p = 0.022), and postmenopausal (p<0.001) alterations. For the psychosocial domain, the associated variables were severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001) and sleep alterations (p<0.001); for the physical domain, the associated variables were severe climacteric symptoms (p<0.001), increased BMI (p<0.001), sleep (p<0.001), and postmenopausal (p<0.001) alterations. Severe climacteric symptoms, low sleep quality, increased BMI, and postmenopausal status were factors that were more associated with impairments in quality of life. With the increase in life expectancy, we suggest that greater attention should be paid to women's quality of life associated with climacteric symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2917559156,"Recent advancements have been made toward understanding the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and related hydrodynamics. Increased understanding of CSF dynamics may lead to improved detection of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and optimized delivery of CSF based CNS therapeutics, with many proposed therapeutics hoping to successfully treat or cure debilitating neurological conditions. Before significant strides can be made toward the research and development of interventions designed for human use, additional research must be carried out with representative subjects such as non-human primates (NHP). This study presents a geometric and hydrodynamic characterization of CSF in eight cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at baseline and two-week follow-up. Results showed that CSF flow along the entire spine was laminar with a Reynolds number ranging up to 80 and average Womersley number ranging from 4.1–7.7. Maximum CSF flow rate occurred ~25 mm caudal to the foramen magnum. Peak CSF flow rate ranged from 0.3–0.6 ml/s at the C3-C4 level. Geometric analysis indicated that average intrathecal CSF volume below the foramen magnum was 7.4 ml. The average surface area of the spinal cord and dura was 44.7 and 66.7 cm2 respectively. Subarachnoid space cross-sectional area and hydraulic diameter ranged from 7–75 mm2 and 2–3.7 mm, respectively. Stroke volume had the greatest value of 0.14 ml at an axial location corresponding to C3-C4."
https://openalex.org/W2916321050,"We use data from Twitter.com to study the interplay between affect and expectations about uncertain outcomes. In two studies, we obtained tweets about candidates in the 2014 US Senate elections and tweets about National Football League (NFL) teams in the 2014/2015 NFL season. We chose these events because a) their outcomes are highly uncertain and b) they attract a lot of attention and feature heavily in the communication on social media. We also obtained a priori expectations for the events from political forecasting and sport betting websites. Using this quasi-experimental design, we found that unexpected events are associated with more intense affect than expected events. Moreover, the effect of expectations is larger for outcomes that fall below expectations than outcomes that exceed expectations. Our results are consistent with fundamental principles in psychological science, such as reference-dependence in experienced affect. We discuss how naturally occurring online data can be used to test psychological predictions and develop novel psychological insights."
https://openalex.org/W2917084515,"Coral reefs around the world are under threat due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment. It is therefore important to develop methods to monitor the status of the reefs and detect changes in the health condition of the corals at an early stage before severe damage occur. In this work, we evaluate underwater hyperspectral imaging as a method to detect changes in health status of both orange and white color morphs of the coral species Lophelia pertusa. Differing health status was achieved by exposing 60 coral samples to the toxic compound 2-methylnaphthalene in concentrations of 0 mg L-1 to 3.5 mg L-1. A machine learning model was utilized to classify corals according to lethal concentration (LC) levels LC5 (5% mortality) and LC25 (25% mortality), solely based on their reflectance spectra. All coral samples were classified to correct concentration group. This is a first step towards developing a remote sensing technique able to assess environmental impact on deep-water coral habitats over larger areas."
https://openalex.org/W2917301836,"Ankyrin-repeat and SOCS-box protein 9 (ASB9) is a member of the large SOCS-box containing proteins family and acts as the specific substrate recognition component of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the process of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We previously identified ASB9 as a differentially expressed gene in granulosa cells (GC) of bovine ovulatory follicles. This study aimed to further investigate ASB9 mRNA and protein regulation, identify binding partners in GC of bovine ovulatory follicles, and study its function. GC were obtained from small follicles (SF: 2–4 mm), dominant follicles at day 5 of the estrous cycle (DF), and ovulatory follicles, 24 hours following hCG injection (OF). Analyses by RT-PCR showed a 104-fold greater expression of ASB9 in GC of OF than in DF. Steady-state levels of ASB9 in follicular walls (granulosa and theca cells) analyzed at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after hCG injection showed a significant induction of ASB9 expression at 12 and 18 hours, reaching a maximum induction of 10.2-fold at 24 hours post-hCG as compared to 0 hour. These results were confirmed in western blot analysis showing strongest ASB9 protein amounts in OF. Yeast two-hybrid screening of OF-cDNAs library resulted in the identification of 10 potential ASB9 binding partners in GC but no interaction was found between ASB9 and creatine kinase B (CKB) in these GC. Functional studies using CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed that ASB9 inhibition led to increased GC proliferation and modulation of target genes expression. Overall, these results support a physiologically relevant role of ASB9 in the ovulatory follicle by targeting specific proteins likely for degradation, contributing to reduced GC proliferation, and could be involved in the final GC differentiation into luteal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2915773440,"Integrated exercises that mimic daily tasks are generally preferred for improving performance and the later stages of rehabilitation, but it is unknown whether integrated core exercises are better than isolated core exercises at improving muscle activation for hypertrophy. The aim of the study was to compare the electromyographic (EMG) activity in rectus abdominis, oblique externus, and erector spinae while performing three conditions of integrated core exercises (lunges) with three isolated core exercises (prone bridge, side bridge and back extension). The three conditions of lunges were: on a stable surface, unstable surface and with external resistance to the trunk using an elastic band. The external resistance was measured with a force cell and peaked at 75N. After one familiarization session, all exercises were performed in one experimental session in randomized order. The isolated core exercises were performed in 20 seconds and the time performing the five repetitions with lunges was matched (20 seconds). Significantly greater peak normalized EMG activity were observed in the isolated core exercises compared to the three integrated core exercises (P<0.001) with two exceptions. For the oblique externus, the isolated core exercise was only greater than the stable lunge. Lunges with elastic bands only demonstrated greater peak erector spinae activation compared the other lunge conditions. Comparing the mean EMG activity between the isolated and three integrated exercises, greater muscle activations were observed performing the isolated exercises (P<0.001). Unstable lunges did not increase the peak or mean core muscle activations. In conclusion, mean and peak EMG activity performing the isolated exercises were in general greater than the three condition of lunges. Based on these results, we recommend using isolated core exercises when the primary goal is to improve muscle activation and elicit hypertrophy, but integrated exercises once adequate initial hypertrophy is achieved."

The type of amyloid fibril exerts an impact on the phenotype of the disease, and on the outcome of diagnostic procedures and therapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the type of amyloid fibril remains the same within ATTR Val30Met amyloidosis families.Fifteen families were identified in whom at least two first-degree relatives had their amyloid fibril composition determined. The type of ATTR was determined by Western blot in all but two patients. For these two patients a positive 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy indicated ATTR Type A.In 14 of the 15 families, the same amyloid fibril composition was noted irrespective of differences in age at onset. In the one family, different ATTR fibril types was found in two brothers with similar ages at onset.Family predisposition appears to have an impact on amyloid fibril composition in members of the family irrespective of their age at onset of disease, but if genetically determined, the gene/genes are likely to be situated at another location than the TTR gene in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2918056675,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted disease worldwide, and it particularly affects people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HPV and to describe HPV genotypes in HIV-1 infected women in Lomé, Togo. From September 2014 to September 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted in two treatment and care centers for people living with HIV: the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sylvanus Olympio and the non-profit organization ‘Espoir Vie Togo’. Women living with HIV-1, aged 18 years and older, receiving a combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months, and who gave their informed consent to participate in the study were recruited. Cervical swabs were collected using a cytobrush, and cells were stored in a preservative solution. HPV testing was performed using e-BRID equipment. Blood samples were collected for CD4+ count using a flow cytometer and for HIV viral load using polymerase chain reaction. A total of 221 HIV-1 infected women were enrolled. The prevalence of any type and oncogenic HPV was 22.2%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): [17.1–28.2] and 16.7% (95%CI: 12.3–22.3), respectively. The most prevalent genotypes were: 18 (8.6%), 68 (4.1%), and 62/81 (2.7%). Only 1.3% (3/221) of participants were infected with HPV16. In regression analysis, no factor was associated with HRHPV. Conclusion This study showed the diversity of circulating HPV genotypes in Togo. Programs of HPV vaccination and early detection of benign or precancerous lesions should be implemented to reduce cancer-related comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2915388683,"Researchers frequently discuss spatial distribution patterns of species diversity and biomass together with their correlations along geographical gradients. Typical subalpine meadows occur widely on the east of the Loess Plateau, China; here, we selected nine mountains belonging to four mountain systems from north to south on the east of the plateau. We analyzed five latitudinal and longitudinal gradients together with six elevational gradients to study the spatial distribution patterns of species diversity (including α, β, and γ diversity) and biomass plus with their relationships at various scales. Results showed that (1) for diversity, α-Diversity manifested unimodal variation patterns in horizontal spaces, peaking at high latitude and low longitude. However, α-diversity was not sensitive to elevation in vertical spaces and tended to decrease with increasing elevation. With increased latitude, longitude, and elevation, β-Diversity diminished; meanwhile, the rate of species turnover decreased and the similarity of community composition enlarged. γ-Diversity demonstrated quadratic function changes that were initially incremental and then decreased with increasing longitude, elevation, and latitude from 37.5° to 40°. In general, β-diversity had positive correlation with γ-diversity and negative correlation with α-diversity, which conformed to the function of β = γ/α. (2) For biomass, changes of aboveground biomass (AB) were more obvious along latitudinal gradients, whereas variations of belowground biomass (BB) had smaller differences along longitudinal and latitudinal gradients. More biomass was allocated to BB toward the north and east, whereas root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) was more evident at greater latitude than greater longitude. With increased elevation, more biomass was also allocated to BB, and the relationship of biomass to elevation was closer in AB. In short, the relation of biomass allocation tended to belowground plant parts with different geographical scales. (3) Species diversity had the strongest positive influence on AB. The Patrick and Shannon indices had correlations of power functions with AB and R/S, respectively, indicating that an allometric model could be used to model relationships between species diversity and biomass. In conclusion, the unique geomorphological structures with a series of basins between mountain systems on the east of the Loess Plateau, meant that subalpine meadows were mostly distributed along latitudinal directions, so the spatial distribution of species diversity and biomass was more evident along latitudinal gradients, and thus the response of aboveground biomass was more sensitive to variations of spatial gradients and species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2915665822,"The “noisy labeler problem” in crowdsourced data has attracted great attention in recent years, with important ramifications in citizen science, where non-experts must produce high-quality data. Particularly relevant to citizen science is dynamic task allocation, in which the level of agreement among labelers can be progressively updated through the information-theoretic notion of entropy. Under dynamic task allocation, we hypothesized that providing volunteers with an “I don’t know” option would contribute to enhancing data quality, by introducing further, useful information about the level of agreement among volunteers. We investigated the influence of an “I don’t know” option on the data quality in a citizen science project that entailed classifying the image of a highly polluted canal into “threat” or “no threat” to the environment. Our results show that an “I don’t know” option can enhance accuracy, compared to the case without the option; such an improvement mostly affects the true negative rather than the true positive rate. In an information-theoretic sense, these seemingly meaningless blank votes constitute a meaningful piece of information to help enhance accuracy of data in citizen science."
https://openalex.org/W2917786056,"The UK is one of the largest funders of health research in the world, but little is known about how health funding is spent. Our study explores whether major UK public and charitable health research funders support the research of UK-based scientists producing the most highly-cited research. To address this question, we searched for UK-based authors of peer-reviewed papers that were published between January 2006 and February 2018 and received over 1000 citations in Scopus. We explored whether these authors have held a grant from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust and compared the results with UK-based researchers who serve currently on the boards of these bodies. From the 1,370 papers relevant to medical, biomedical, life and health sciences with more than 1000 citations in the period examined, we identified 223 individuals from a UK institution at the time of publication who were either first/last or single authors. Of those, 164 are still in UK academic institutions, while 59 are not currently in UK academia (have left the country, are retired, or work in other sectors). Of the 164 individuals, only 59 (36%; 95% CI: 29-43%) currently hold an active grant from one of the three funders. Only 79 (48%; 95% CI: 41-56%) have held an active grant from any of the three funders between 2006-2017. Conversely, 457 of the 664 board members of MRC, Wellcome Trust, and NIHR (69%; 95% CI: 65-72%) have held an active grant in the same period by any of these funders. Only 7 out of 655 board members (1.1%) were first, last or single authors of an extremely highly-cited paper. There are many reasons why the majority of the most influential UK authors do not hold a grant from the country's major public and charitable funding bodies. Nevertheless, the results are worrisome and subscribe to similar patterns shown in the US. We discuss possible implications and suggest ways forward."
https://openalex.org/W2915693325,"The influence of sex hormones on women’s mate preferences has been an intensively discussed topic for more than a decade. Yet the extent to which levels of sex hormones, and testosterone in particular, influence women’s mate preferences is unclear. Thus, the current study used multilevel modelling to investigate putative relationships between salivary testosterone and facial masculinity preferences in a sample of 68 women, while controlling for their age, partnership status, and sociosexuality. We found no significant associations between masculinity preferences and either individual differences or within-woman changes in testosterone. We did find however, that sociosexuality was positively correlated with masculinity preferences. Although it has previously been suggested that testosterone is related to women’s facial masculinity preference, our data do not support this proposal."
https://openalex.org/W2917541384,"Plant diversity is important to human welfare worldwide, and this importance is exemplified in subtropical and tropical [(sub)tropical] African savannahs where regional biodiversity enhances the sustaining provision of basic ecosystem services available to millions of residents. Yet, there is a critical lack of knowledge about how savannahs respond to climate change. Here, we report the relationships between savannah vegetation structure, species richness, and bioclimatic variables as recorded by plant biochemical fossils, called biomarkers. Our analyses reveal that the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of discrete sedimentary plant biomarkers reflects vegetation structure, but the isotopic range among plant biomarkers–which we call LEaf Wax Isotopic Spread (LEWIS)–reflects species richness. Analyses of individual biomarker δ13C values and LEWIS for downcore sediments recovered from southeast Africa reveal that the region’s species richness mirrored trends in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (pCO2) throughout the last 25,000 years. This suggests that increasing pCO2 levels during post-industrialization may prompt future declines in regional biodiversity (1–10 species per unit CO2 p.p.m.v.) through imminent habitat loss or extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2915192042,"Transcriptomic analysis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells from experimental models offers insight into pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pathobiology. However, culturing may alter the molecular profile of endothelial cells prior to analysis, limiting the translational relevance of results. Here we present a novel and validated method for isolating RNA from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) ex vivo that does not require cell culturing. Initially, presumed rat PMVECs were isolated from rat peripheral lung tissue using tissue dissociation and enzymatic digestion, and cells were cultured until confluence to assess endothelial marker expression. Anti-CD31, anti-von Willebrand Factor, and anti-α-smooth muscle actin immunocytochemistry/immunofluorescence signal was detected in presumed rat PMVECs, but also in non-endothelial cell type controls. By contrast, flow cytometry using an anti-CD31 antibody and isolectin 1-B4 (from Griffonia simplicifolia) was highly specific for rat PMVECs. We next developed a strategy in which the addition of an immunomagnetic selection step for CD31+ cells permitted culture-free isolation of rat PMVECs ex vivo for RNA isolation and transcriptomic analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Heterogeneity in the validity and reproducibility of results using commercial antibodies against endothelial surface markers corresponded to a substantial burden on laboratory time, labor, and scientific budget. We demonstrate a novel protocol for the culture-free isolation and transcriptomic analysis of rat PMVECs with translational relevance to PAH. In doing so, we highlight wide variability in the quality of commonly used biological reagents, which emphasizes the importance of investigator-initiated validation of commercial biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W2916617436,"Evidence suggests that individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) report anticipatory pleasure deficits compared to controls and that these deficits are linked to decreased motivation to engage socially. However, these deficits have been identified via self-report measures of hypothetical pleasant stimuli, leaving it unclear whether they exist in reference to actual social situations. To address this issue, we created a live social interaction that minimized the reliance of higher-order cognitive processes. SZ and control participants were told that they would be playing an ""enjoyable sharing game"" with another study participant (who was actually a confederate) that involved asking and answering questions (36 interpersonal closeness generation questions; Aron et al., 1997). Participants then reported their current mood and the emotions they anticipated experiencing during the pleasant social interaction. Immediately following the interaction, they reported their experienced emotions. We found that the SZ group anticipated more negative emotion (d = 1.0), but were less accurate in forecasting negative emotion (d = .81), than controls, and these effects were large. There were small, non-significant group differences in anticipation, experience, and accuracy in forecasting of positive emotion (all ds < .29). Also, social anhedonia was positively correlated with anticipated negative affect and negatively associated with experienced positive emotion. At the same time, controls reported finding the interaction to be a more positive emotional experience overall, d = 0.75. This is the first study to show that ""anticipatory pleasure deficits"" in SZ might actually be heightened anticipated negative emotion and that inaccurate forecasting could be linked to decreased social motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2916988757,"An early understanding of others' vocal emotions provides infants with a distinct advantage for eliciting appropriate care from caregivers and for navigating their social world. Consistent with this notion, an emerging literature suggests that a temporal cortical response to the prosody of emotional speech is observable in the first year of life. Furthermore, neural specialisation to vocal emotion in infancy may vary according to early experience. Neural sensitivity to emotional non-speech vocalisations was investigated in 29 six-month-old infants using near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Both angry and happy vocalisations evoked increased activation in the temporal cortices (relative to neutral and angry vocalisations respectively), and the strength of the angry minus neutral effect was positively associated with the degree of directiveness in the mothers' play interactions with their infant. This first fNIRS study of infant vocal emotion processing implicates bilateral temporal mechanisms similar to those found in adults and suggests that infants who experience more directive caregiving or social play may more strongly or preferentially process vocal anger by six months of age."
https://openalex.org/W2915131565,"Understanding how painful hypersensitive states develop and persist beyond the initial hours to days is critically important in the effort to devise strategies to prevent and/or reverse chronic painful states. Changes in nociceptor transcription can alter the abundance of nociceptive signaling elements, resulting in longer-term change in nociceptor phenotype. As a result, sensitized nociceptive signaling can be further amplified and nocifensive behaviors sustained for weeks to months. Building on our previous finding that transcription factor Sp4 positively regulates the expression of the pain transducing channel TRPV1 in Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons, we sought to determine if Sp4 serves a broader role in the development and persistence of hypersensitive states in mice. We observed that more than 90% of Sp4 staining DRG neurons were small to medium sized, primarily unmyelinated (NF200 neg) and the majority co-expressed nociceptor markers TRPV1 and/or isolectin B4 (IB4). Genetically modified mice (Sp4+/-) with a 50% reduction of Sp4 showed a reduction in DRG TRPV1 mRNA and neuronal responses to the TRPV1 agonist—capsaicin. Importantly, Sp4+/- mice failed to develop persistent inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia, showing a reversal to control values after 6 hours. Despite a reversal of inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia, there was no difference in CFA-induced hindpaw swelling between CFA Sp4+/- and CFA wild type mice. Similarly, Sp4+/- mice failed to develop persistent mechanical hypersensitivity to hind-paw injection of NGF. Although Sp4+/- mice developed hypersensitivity to traumatic nerve injury, Sp4+/- mice failed to develop persistent cold or mechanical hypersensitivity to the platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin, a non-traumatic model of neuropathic pain. Overall, Sp4+/- mice displayed a remarkable ability to reverse the development of multiple models of persistent inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity. This suggests that Sp4 functions as a critical control point for a network of genes that conspire in the persistence of painful hypersensitive states."
https://openalex.org/W2915890108,"Biodiversity conservation, plant growth and spatial distribution of plant species are the central issues in contemporary community ecology. Ephemeral stream may influence soil properties, which in turn may determine biodiversity and function of an ecosystem in alluvial fan of arid desert region. Ephemeral stream is one of the most common natural disturbances, yet the effects of the ephemeral stream on plant communities in terms of species diversity and plant species distribution remain poorly studied. In this study, the information of species distribution, ephemeral stream beds (‘washes’), and the characteristics of plant growth, i.e. height, crown area, were interpreted at different heights using the images of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). After that, soil properties such as soil texture (sand, silt and clay), soil water content, pH, soil organic matter, soil electric conductivity, soil bulk density and the percentage of gravel content, and their relationships with UAV data were assessed in order to explore the influences of ephemeral stream on species diversity, plant growth characteristics and species distribution in an alluvial fan of arid desert region. The results showed that deep-rooted plants were only distributed in washes whereas shallow-rooted plants were distributed in both washes and the outside of washes (‘non-washes’). Species richness was significantly higher in washes than that in non-washes whereas the opposite pattern was true for abundance. Soil properties, plant height and crown area were higher in washes than that in non-washes. Plant height, crown area and the total number of individual plants increased with increasing wash width and per unit length of stream flow. This study highlights that the coupling factors of ephemeral stream, such as soil erosion, particle transport and sedimentation, can dramatically cause changes in soil properties and total number of individual plants, and hence, can influence species diversity, plant growth characteristics and spatial distribution of plant species in an alluvial fan of arid desert regions."
https://openalex.org/W2918140398,"Sublethal effects of oil spills may dampen seabird rehabilitation success due to lingering negative impacts of contamination and stress on reproduction and long-term survival. These effects can be difficult to measure while birds are in care as well as once birds are released. Expression of sexually selected traits that are sensitive to condition can provide information on physiological status of birds. We evaluated plumage molt and gular pouch skin color of California brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) following oil contamination and rehabilitation to test for differences between previously oiled and rehabilitated (post-spill) and presumably uncontaminated pelicans. Post-spill pelicans released with either color leg bands alone, or bands plus harness-mounted satellite GPS tags, were relocated and visually assessed in the field at non-breeding communal roosts and compared to surrounding unmarked pelicans in the general population. Non-oiled pelicans bearing GPS tags were also included in the study. Post-spill pelicans lagged the general population in molt of ornamental yellow crown feathers but hind neck transition into white plumage was not significantly different. Both post-spill and non-oiled pelicans wearing GPS tags had lower gular redness scores than the unmarked, non-oiled population. Pre-breeding gular pouch redness of post-spill pelicans was more strongly influenced by wearing of a GPS tag than a history of oil contamination and rehabilitation. Gular pouch redness of post-spill pelicans in the first 18 months after release was positively correlated with long term survivorship. If gular pouch color is a condition-dependent sexual signal and overall health influences plumage molt progression, our results indicate that many post-spill pelicans marked with bands alone were in relatively good condition going into the next breeding season, but those released with electronic tags experienced additional stress due to wearing the equipment, introducing a confounding variable to the post-release study."
https://openalex.org/W2952844886,"This research-on-research study describes efforts to develop non-Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) by analyzing demographical and time-course collaborations between international institutions using protocols registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) or published in scientific journals. We have published an a priori protocol to develop this study. Protocols published in scientific journals were searched using the MEDLINE and Embase databases; the query terms ""Systematic review"" [Title] AND ""protocol"" [Title] were searched from February 2011 to December 2017. Protocols registered at PROSPERO during the same period were obtained by web scraping all non-Cochrane records with a Python script. After excluding protocols that had a fulfillment or duplication rate of less than 90%, they were classified as published ""only in PROSPERO"", ""only in journals"", or in ""journals and PROSPERO"". Results of data and metadata extraction using text mining processes were curated by two reviewers. These Datasets and R scripts are freely available to facilitate reproducibility. We obtained 20,814 protocols of non-Cochrane SRs. While ""unique protocols"" by reviewers' institutions from 60 countries were the most frequent, a median of 6 (2-150) institutions from 130 different countries were involved in the preparation of ""collaborative protocols"". The highest Ranked countries involved in overall protocol production were the UK, the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Most protocols were registered only in PROSPERO. However, the number of protocols published in scientific journals (924) or in both PROSPERO and journals (807) has increased over the last three years. Syst Rev and BMJ Open published more than half of the total protocols. While the more productive countries were involved in ""unique"" and ""collaborative protocols"", less productive countries only participated in ""collaborative protocols"" that were mainly published in PROSPERO. Our results suggest that, although most countries were involved in solitary production of protocols for non-Cochrane SRs during the study period, it would be useful to develop new strategies to promote international collaborations, especially with less productive countries."
https://openalex.org/W2915942091,"In the present study, we investigated the capabilities of a novel ultrasonic approach for real-time control of fibrinolysis under flow conditions. Ultrasonic monitoring was performed in a specially designed experimental in vitro system. Fibrinolytic agents were automatically injected at ultrasonically determined stages of the blood clotting. The following clots dissolution in the system was investigated by means of ultrasonic monitoring. It was shown, that clots resistance to fibrinolysis significantly increases during the first 5 minutes since the formation of primary micro-clots. The efficiency of clot lysis strongly depends on the concentration of the fibrinolytic agent as well as the delay of its injection moment. The ultrasonic method was able to detect the coagulation at early stages, when timely pharmacological intervention can still prevent the formation of macroscopic clots in the experimental system. This result serves as evidence that ultrasonic methods may provide new opportunities for real-time monitoring and the early pharmacological correction of thrombotic complications in clinical practice."

After factor analysis, the questionnaire was reduced into only two components (Suicide Ideation and Suicide Attempt) with 5 items each. Both of the components obtained high reliability value (.89 and.86 respectively) and the questionnaire accounted for 67.84% of the total variance.The analysis showed that YSAS has an acceptable reliability and validity for Malaysian population. Although these findings corroborate literature on development of suicide ideation assessment instrument for specific cultural context, there is a need to further examine its reliability with clinical population and general population of different cultural context in Malaysia."

There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls in the standard blood tests for thrombophilias in plasma or the TiC test for genetic variables. One clinical-genetic model was generated using variables with the lowest P values: ABO, body mass index, C_rs5985, C_rs6025, and protein S. This model exhibited good prediction capacity, with an area under the curve of almost 0.7 (P <0.05), sensitivity of almost 67%, and specificity of 70%.Although some association may exist between hypercoagulability and pregnancy outcomes, no significant direct correlation was observed between adverse obstetric outcomes and inherited thrombophilias when analyzed using either standard blood tests or the genetic test. Future studies with a larger sample size are required to create a clinical-genetic model that better discriminates women with a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and an increased risk of poor outcomes in subsequent pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2917608664,"Discrepancies in patients' responses to various outcome measures challenge clinicians' evaluation of treatment outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to 1) evaluate the concordance of outcome measures after spine injection, 2) determine the patient variables that lead to discordant responses, and 3) suggest practical outcome measure for spine injections with good responsiveness. From October 2014 to November 2014, 164 patients with neck or low back pain who visited our outpatient clinics and had spine injections on the previous visit were enrolled. We asked patients to report changes in their symptom in the form of outcome measures: numeric rating scale, Oswestry disability index, neck disability index, residual symptom percentage and global perceived effect. The responses were categorized into three groups according to the degree of change; not improved, minimally improved, and significantly improved. The concordances of these categorized answers were evaluated. When ""significantly improved"" was considered as true improvement, 46 (28%) of the 164 patients had discordant responses to the four measures. There was no significant patients' variable that affects discordance in the outcome measures. Good agreement was shown between the global perceived effect and residual symptom percentage, while the Oswestry disability index had poor agreement with the other measurements. The calculated numeric rating scale and residual symptom percentage also had low levels of agreement. However, patients with severe pre-treatment pain tended to have better agreement. In conclusion, this result suggest that the residual symptom percentage may be a more practical for clinicians and better represent patients' improvements after spine injection."
https://openalex.org/W2915738946,"To look for abnormalities in circulating B-cell subsets in patients with rheumatic symptoms of Whipple's disease (WD).Consecutive patients seen between 2010 and 2016 for suspected inflammatory joint disease were identified retrospectively. Results of standardized immunological and serological tests and of peripheral-blood B-cell and T-cell subset analysis by flow cytometry were collected. Patients with criteria suggesting WD underwent PCR testing for Tropheryma whipplei, and those with diagnosis of WD (cases) were compared to those without diagnosis (controls). We used ROC curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of flow cytometry findings for WD.Among 2917 patients seen for suspected inflammatory joint disease, 121 had suspected WD, including 9 (9/121, 7.4%) confirmed WD. Proportions of T cells and NK cells were similar between suspected and confirmed WD, whereas cases had a lower proportion of circulating memory B cells (IgD-CD38low, 18.0%±9.7% vs. 26.0%±14.2%, P = 0.041) and higher ratio of activated B cells over memory B cells (4.4±2.0 vs. 2.9±2.2, P = 0.023). Among peripheral-blood B-cells, the proportion of IgD+CD27- naive B cells was higher (66.2%±18.2% vs. 54.6%±18.4%, P = 0.047) and that of IgD-CD27+ switched memory B cells lower (13.3%±5.7% vs. 21.4%±11.9%, P = 0.023), in cases vs. controls. The criterion with the best diagnostic performance was a proportion of IgD+CD27- naive B cells above 70.5%, which had 73% sensitivity and 80% specificity.Our study provides data on peripheral-blood B-cell disturbances that may have implications for the diagnosis and pathogenetic understanding of WD."
https://openalex.org/W2916260037,"Objective To evaluate the association between migration and physical activity among medical students from a university located in Lima, Peru. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among second-year medical students from a Peruvian university. Data on moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and migration features were obtained through a self-report questionnaire. To assess the associations of interest, prevalence ratios (PR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Poisson regression with robust variances. Results We analyzed data from 312 students (54.5% were women, mean age: 19.0 years, standard deviation: 1.4 years), 90 (28.9%) students performed MVPA for ≥150 minutes/week, 118 (37.8%) performed MVPA for ≤30 minutes/week, and 114 (36.7%) were migrants. Being a migrant was not associated with performing MVPA for ≤30 nor ≥150 minutes/week. However, adjusted analysis showed that the frequency of performing MVPA for ≤30 minutes/week was greater among those who migrated less than five years ago (PR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05–1.93) and among those who migrated to continue their studies (PR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.06–1.94), compared to non-migrants. Conclusion In our population, being a migrant was not associated with physical activity. However, low physical activity was more prevalent among recent migrants and among those who had migrated to study, compared to non-migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2916891344,"We introduce a novel machine learning approach for investigating speech processing with cochlear implants (CIs)—prostheses used to replace a damaged inner ear. Concretely, we use a simple perceptron and a deep convolutional network to classify speech spectrograms that are modified to approximate CI-delivered speech. Implant-delivered signals suffer from reduced spectral resolution, chiefly due to a small number of frequency channels and a phenomenon called channel interaction. The latter involves the spread of information from neighboring channels to similar populations of neurons and can be modeled by linearly combining adjacent channels. We find that early during training, this input modification degrades performance if the networks are first pre-trained on high-resolution speech—with a larger number of channels, and without added channel interaction. This suggests that the spectral degradation caused by channel interaction alters the signal to conflict with perceptual expectations acquired from high-resolution speech. We thus predict that a reduction of channel interaction will accelerate learning in CI users who are implanted after having adapted to high-resolution speech during normal hearing. (The code for replicating our experiments is available online: https://github.com/clips/SimulatingCochlearImplants)."
https://openalex.org/W2915501227,"Thirty-three autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) markers were used to evaluate genetic heterogeneity and diversity in 525 golden retrievers (GRs). This breed was selected because of its popularity and artificial selection for conformation vs. performance phenotypes. Seven additional STRs were used to evaluate the highly polymorphic dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class I and class II regions. From 3 to 13 alleles were found at each of the 33 loci (mean 7) and the average effective alleles (Ne) was 3.34. The observed heterozygosity was 0.65 and the expected heterozygosity was 0.68. The resulting fixation index was 0.035 indicating that the population was randomly breeding. We found that modern GRs retain 46% of genomic diversity present in all canids and 21/175 (12%) and 20/90 (22%) of the known DLA class I and class II haplotypes, respectively. Selection for performance or conformation led to a narrowing of genomic and DLA diversity with conformation having a greater effect than performance. A comparison was made between coefficient of inbreeding (COI) determined from 10 or 12 generation pedigrees and DNA based internal relatedness values. A weak but significant correlation was observed between IR score and 10 or 12 generation COI (r = 0.38, p<0.0001 and r = 0.40, p<0.0001, respectively). IR values were higher in conformation than performance lines but only significant at p = 0.17. This was supported by 10 and 12 generation COI values that were significantly (p<0.0001) higher in conformation than performance lines. We demonstrate herein that a low density of STR markers can be utilized to study the genetic makeup of GRs."
https://openalex.org/W2915681189,"Utilization by humans of a precise and adaptable internal model of the dynamics of the body in generating movements is a well-supported concept. The prevailing opinion is that such an internal model ceaselessly develops through long-term repetition and accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). However, a long-term learning process would not be absolutely necessary for the formation of internal models. It is possible to estimate the dynamics of the system by using a motor command and its resulting output, instead of constructing a model of the dynamics with precise parameters. In this study, a computational model is proposed that uses a motor command and its corresponding output to estimate the dynamics of the system and it is examined whether the proposed model is capable of describing a series of empirical movements. The proposed model was found to be capable of describing humans' fast movements which require compensation for system dynamics as well as sensory delays. In addition, the proposed model shows equifinality under inertial perturbations as seen in several experimental studies. This satisfactory reproducibility of the proposed computation raises the possibility that humans make a movement by estimating the system dynamics with a copy of motor command and sensory output on a momentary basis, without the need to identify precise system parameters."
