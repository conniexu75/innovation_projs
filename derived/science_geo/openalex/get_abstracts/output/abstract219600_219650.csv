https://openalex.org/W2002355858,"Hedgehog signalling--an essential pathway during embryonic pancreatic development, the misregulation of which has been implicated in several forms of cancer--may also be an important mediator in human pancreatic carcinoma. Here we report that sonic hedgehog, a secreted hedgehog ligand, is abnormally expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Pancreata of Pdx-Shh mice (in which Shh is misexpressed in the pancreatic endoderm) develop abnormal tubular structures, a phenocopy of human PanIN-1 and -2. Moreover, these PanIN-like lesions also contain mutations in K-ras and overexpress HER-2/neu, which are genetic mutations found early in the progression of human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hedgehog signalling remains active in cell lines established from primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signalling by cyclopamine induced apoptosis and blocked proliferation in a subset of the pancreatic cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that this pathway may have an early and critical role in the genesis of this cancer, and that maintenance of hedgehog signalling is important for aberrant proliferation and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2108060249,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and other related disorders are characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein protein (alpha-syn) inside brain cells. It is likely that the formation of alpha-syn aggregates plays a seminal role in the pathogenesis of at least some of these diseases, because two different mutations in the gene encoding alpha-syn have been found in inherited forms of PD. alpha-Syn is mainly expressed by neuronal cells and is generally considered to exist as a cytoplasmic protein. Here, we report the unexpected identification of alpha-syn in conditioned culture media from untransfected and alpha-syn-transfected human neuroblastoma cells, as well as in human cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma. The method used was immunocapture by using anti-alpha-syn antibodies coupled to magnetic beads, followed by detection on Western blots. In all cases, alpha-syn was identified as a single 15 kDa band, which co-migrated with a recombinant form of the protein and reacted with five different antibodies to alpha-syn. Our findings suggest that cells normally secrete alpha-syn into their surrounding media, both in vitro and in vivo. The detection of extracellular alpha-syn and/or its modified forms in body fluids, particularly in human plasma, offers new opportunities for the development of diagnostic tests for PD and related diseases."

We addressed this issue by first characterizing the structure of each individual Acrp30 oligomer and the determinants responsible for multimer formation. Freeze etch electron microscopy showed the trimer to exhibit a ball-and- stick-like structure containing a large globular sphere, an extended collagen stalk, and a smaller sphere on the opposite end of the stalk. The hexamer consists of two adjacent trimeric globular domains and a single stalk composed of collagen domains from two trimers. Although not necessary for trimer formation or stability, two of the three monomers in an Acrp30 trimer are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues at position 22. In contrast, assembly of hexameric and higher molecular weight (HMW) forms of Acrp30 depends upon formation of Cys22-mediated disulfide bonds because their reduction with dithiothreitol or substitution of Cys22 with alanine led exclusively to trimers. HMW and hexamer isoforms of Acrp30 activated NF-κB in C2C12 cells, but trimers, either natural, formed by reduction of Acrp30 hexamer, or formed by the C22A mutant, did not. In contrast, incubation of isolated rat extensor digitorum longus with naturally formed Acrp30 trimers or trimeric C22A Acrp30 led to increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase-α at Thr172 and its activation. Hexameric and HMW Acrp30 could not activate AMP-activated protein kinase. Thus, trimeric and HMW/hexameric Acrp30 activate different signal transduction pathways, and Acrp30 represents a novel example of the control of ligand signaling via changes in its oligomerization state.

Adipocyte complement related protein of 30 kDa (Acrp30), or adiponectin, is an adipocyte-secreted hormone found abundantly in serum (1.Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J.

How Acrp30 acts as a hormone to regulate these physiological processes remains unknown. We addressed this issue by analyzing the structure of Acrp30 secreted from cells and in serum.

Transfected HEK cells also secrete an even higher molecular weight (HMW) isoform of Acrp30 (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

All three isoforms of Acrp30 are present in mouse serum and the conditioned medium of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, albeit with different relative abundances (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C.

The HMW and hexameric Acrp30 can activate transcription factor NF-κB in undifferentiated or differentiated C2C12 cells, but trimeric Acrp30 or gAcrp30 cannot. Rather, gAcrp30, but not full-length Acrp30 hexamer, enhances muscle fatty acid oxidation by inactivating acetyl-CoA carboxylase following stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (11.Tomas E.

Because different isoforms of Acrp30 have different activities, it is important to understand how they are formed. Acrp30 contains three easily recognizable domains: an N-terminal signal sequence, a collagen domain, and a C-terminal globular domain. Because the crystal structure of the Acrp30 globular domain shows a trimeric fold similar to tumor necrosis factor α, the collagen domain of Acrp30 may mediate multimerization into hexamer and HMW isoforms. Alternatively, disulfide bonds may hold Acrp30 oligomers together because they are required for multimerization of Acrp30 homologs C1q and emilin (13.Doliana R. Bot S. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14.Kishore U. Reid K.B. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Acrp30 contains two cysteine residues that are conserved among all species with available sequence information. One is located in the globular domain at position 138 of mouse Acrp30 (numbering begins after the signal peptide). The other is at position 22 in a conserved 17-amino acid segment with the sequence APALVPPPKGTCAGWMA. To understand mechanisms used by Acrp30 to multimerize, we employed deep etch cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structures of each oligomer. We then tested whether disulfide bonds are required for Acrp30 oligomerization and which cysteine residues are involved in their formation. Acrp30 trimer is best described as a “ball on a stick” model, whereas the hexamer consists of two adjacent parallel trimers that resemble a “Y.” The HMW structure is currently not interpretable. Reduction of HMW or hexameric Acrp30 with dithiothreitol (DTT) collapsed them into trimers. In parallel, site-directed mutagenesis of each of the two cysteines in Acrp30 showed cysteine at position 22 to be crucial for formation of the HMW and hexamer species. In contrast, cysteine at position 138 in the globular domain had no role in directing the formation of Acrp30 oligomers. Consistent with our prior results that naturally produced Acrp30 trimers cannot activate NF-κB, we show that neither trimeric C22A Acrp30 nor trimers formed by the reduction of Acrp30 hexamers can activate NF-κB. Previously we showed that trimeric gAcrp30 could activate AMPK, and here we show that full-length C22A trimers as well as C138A trimers activated AMPK in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, as measured by phosphorylation at Thr172 of AMPKα. In contrast, hexameric and HMW C138A Acrp30 could not. Thus, trimeric Acrp30 activates AMPK and hexameric/HMW Acrp30 activates NF-κB, and we propose that the oligomerization state of Acrp30 determines the signaling pathway it can activate. Cysteine Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of Acrp30 in pcDNA3.1 vector was performed using a QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to construct C22A mutant have the sequences 5′-CCC AAG GGA ACT GCT GCA GGT TGG ATG GC-3′ and its reverse complement. Primers used to construct C138A mutant are 5′-C ACT GGC AAG TTC TAC GCC AAC ATT CCG GGA CTC-3′ and its reverse complement. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Production and Gel Filtration Analysis of Wild Type and Mutant Acrp30—As previously described, Acrp30 (residues 1–230, without the 17-residue signal sequence) was purified from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a His6-tagged precursor that was subsequently treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the tag (10.Tsao T.S.

Wild type (GenBank™ accession number U37222), C22A, and C138A Acrp30 (nucleotides 46–789 of U37222) were purified from conditioned serumfree medium of transfected HEK 293T cells as described previously (5.Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar, 10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Purified protein samples were loaded into an Akta fast protein liquid chromatography system and fractionated either through a 16/60 or a 10/30 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with PBS. Electron Microscopic Imaging of Acrp30 Oligomers—HEK 293T Acrp30 oligomers purified by gel filtration chromatography were suspended with finely ground mica flakes and quickly frozen using liquid helium in a cryopress as described previously (15.Heuser J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 155-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16.Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The samples were then fractured using a cryomicrotome and partially freeze-dried for deep etching before rotary replication with a 2-nm film of platinum (16.Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17.Heuser J.E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 295: 71-83PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission electron micrographs were taken in stereo with a 10° tilt at 70,000× magnification (16.Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17.Heuser J.E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 295: 71-83PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium Sedimentation—The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 18 h at 10 °C in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge before absorbance was recorded at 230 nm. The data were fit globally using MacNonlin PPC (18.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) to the following equation that describes sedimentation of a homogeneous species:A=B+A'exp[H×M(x2-xo2)], where A is the absorbance at radius x, A′ is the absorbance at reference radius xo, H = (1 - νρ)ω2/2RT (where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, ν is the partial specific volume = 0.71896131 ml/g, ρ is the density of solvent = 1.0061 g/ml, ω is the angular velocity in radians/s) M is the apparent molecular weight, and B is the solvent absorbance (blank). Luciferase Reporter Assay—C2C12 cells (ATCC) were co-transfected with plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under the control of E-selectin promoter (19.Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter using FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following overnight or 8 h of incubation with various forms of Acrp30 or lipopolysaccharide, the cells were washed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were tested using kits from Promega and Clontech. Muscle Incubations—The rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium injection (60 mg/kg), and EDL muscles strips were prepared and tied to stainless steel clips as described previously (20.Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E283-E289PubMed Google Scholar). The muscles were preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 6 mm glucose and then incubated for 30 min in the same medium in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml C22A Acrp30 or 2 μg/ml HMW, hexamer, or trimer isoforms of C138A Acrp30. At the end of this incubation the muscles were frozen in liquid N2 until Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Twenty-five μg of crude muscle homogenate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 135 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with Phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) or total AMPKα antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and then with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from Amersham Biosciences. The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by laser scanning densitometry. The immunoblots were performed under conditions in which autographic detection was in the linear response range. We performed freeze etch electron microscopy to visualize the architecture of HEK 293T cell-produced Acrp30 trimer, hexamer, and HMW isoforms following their separation by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). The trimer exhibits a ball- and-stick structure with the globular domain forming the ball and the collagen triple helix forming the rigid stick (Fig. 1A). In the majority of the pictures a ball-like structure smaller than the globular head domain was also observed. This probably represents the N-terminal region of Acrp30 upstream of the collagen domain. The length of the collagen domain is ∼15 nm. Because the collagen triple helix has 10 Gly-X-Y repeats per turn and a pitch of 86 Å, the expected length of the Acrp30 collagen domain with 21 repeats is ∼18 nm, similar to what was observed. The architecture of hexameric Acrp30 shows two trimers lying adjacent to each other in parallel head-to-head fashion and is reminiscent of the letter Y (Fig. 1B). Possibly because of strong interactions between the globular domain with the mica flakes, we only obtained what we believe to be tail end views of the HMW isoform (Fig. 1C). More apparent in the stereo views in supplemental Fig. S1, these HMW molecules resemble cones standing upside down, with the globular heads adhering to the mica and the tails sticking up into the air. However, we cannot infer the precise structure of HMW Acrp30 from these images. To investigate the possibility that disulfide bonds are responsible for formation or maintenance of hexamer or HMW Acrp30, we analyzed elution profiles of isolated hexamers and trimers purified from E. coli in gel filtration columns following incubation with 100 mm DTT. In the absence of DTT, the apparent molecular masses of E. coli-produced Acrp30 hexamer (Fig. 2A) and trimer (Fig. 2B) are 450 and 218 kDa, respectively. Similarly, the molecular masses of hexamer (Fig. 2C) and HMW (Fig. 2D) isoforms secreted from transfected 293T cells are 775 and 418 kDa. The trimer shown in Fig. 2B was referred to as trimer A in our previous publication (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Because trimer B consists of two full-length Acrp30 polypeptides and one polypeptide missing the collagen domain and is not found in serum (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), it is an artifact of the bacterial production process and was not studied further. In the present study we refer to the trimer A species simply as trimer. As shown in Fig. 2, 100 mm DTT treatment reduced the apparent molecular masses of E. coli-derived hexamer (Fig. 2A) and HEK cell-derived hexamer (Fig. 2C) and HMW Acrp30 (Fig. 2D) to that of a trimer (Fig. 2B). Reduction of E. coli hexamer into trimer could also be achieved with 10 mm of DTT or 1 mm βME (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, Acrp30 contains two conserved cysteines, one in the conserved region between the signal sequence and the collagen domain (Cys22) and the other in the globular domain (Cys138). The conserved region around Cys22 of mouse Acrp30 has the sequence APALVPPPKGTCAGWMA. To investigate whether one or both of these cysteines are responsible for oligomerization of Acrp30, each was substituted with alanine. Size exclusion chromatography of the C138A Acrp30 secreted from transfected HEK cells revealed a migration profile similar to that of wild type protein (Fig. 4A). Three peaks corresponding to HMW, hexamer, and trimer in proportions analogous to those of wild type Acrp30 were observed (Fig. 4A). Gel filtration analysis of purified C22A Acrp30 demonstrates that this mutant migrates only as a single, apparently trimeric species (Fig. 4B). Equilibrium sedimentation in the analytical ultracentrifuge confirmed this species to be a trimer (Fig. 5A); the molecular mass determined by this analysis is 78 kDa, identical to that of the wild type Acrp30 trimer A (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). C22A Acrp30 was also visualized by freeze etch electron microscopy (Fig. 5B). Similar to wild type Acrp30 trimer (Fig. 1A), a large sphere consisting the globular domain, a collagen stalk, and a smaller sphere most likely representing the N-terminal region could be seen in images of C22A Acrp30. These results indicate that the C138A mutation has no observable effect on oligomer formation and distribution, whereas the presence of Cys22 is critical for formation of hexamer and HMW complexes.Fig. 4Analysis of multimerization states of C138A (A) and C22A (B) mutant Acrp30 secreted by transfected 293T cells using gel filtration chromatography.

C, nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of C22A Acrp30 and the three different C138A Acrp30 oligomers purified from transfected HEK cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the degree to which Acrp30 monomers are disulfide-linked in each of the three isoforms, we analyzed the proportion of Acrp30 disulfide-linked dimers and monomers in nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5C). As control, after reduction all of the Acrp30 species migrate as monomers on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Trimers from both wild type and C138A Acrp30 contain dimers and monomers in an approximately 2:1 proportion, indicating one Cys22–Cys22 disulfide bond between two monomers and a free Cys22 sulfhydryl group in the third monomer. Both wild type and C138A HMW and hexamer isoforms contain virtually no monomers, indicating that all Acrp30 polypeptides are linked together by disulfide bonds. Because C138A HMW and hexamer have the same dimer to monomer ratios as the corresponding wild type Acrp30 species, the disulfide bonds linking monomers together must be formed by Cys22. Indeed, the C22A mutant trimer contains no dimers in nonreducing SDS-PAGE and consists only of monomers that are not disulfide linked. Previously we showed that HMW and hexameric Acrp30 activated NF-κB, but trimer could not (10.Tsao T.S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

To confirm the causal relationship between the oligomerization state and NF-κB activation, we examined the ability of βME-reduced E. coli-produced hexamer as well as C22A and C138A oligomers produced in transfected mammalian cells to activate NF-κB, as measured by an E-selectin promoter reporter gene assay. Following treatment with 0.5 mm βME at 2 h at 37 °C and then centrifugation under vacuum for 15 min to reduce the concentration of βME, E. coli-derived Acrp30 hexamer was collapsed to trimer (data not shown) and lost its ability to activate NF-κB (Fig. 6A). Reduction of βME concentration by centrifugation under vacuum did not reoxidize Acrp30 (data not shown). Consistent with results obtained using wild type Acrp30, the C138A HMW and hexamer species potently activated NF-κB (Fig. 6B). Neither the C138A trimer nor the mutant C22A trimer activated NF-κB (Fig. 6B), corroborating the observation that only hexamer and higher order oligomers of Acrp30 can activate NF-κB. We previously reported that gAcrp30 activated AMPK in isolated rat skeletal muscle but that full-length Acrp30 hexamer produced in E. coli did not (11.Tomas E. Tsao T.S. Saha A.K. Murrey H.E. Zhang Cc C. Itani S.I. Lodish H.F. Ruderman N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16309-16313Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether activation of AMPK also depends on the oligomerization state of Acrp30. Incubation of isolated rat EDL muscles with trimeric C22A Acrp30 or with purified C138A trimer led to 2.5- and 1.5-fold increases, respectively, in the proportion of AMPKα phosphorylated at Thr172 (Fig. 7); phosphorylation at Thr172 is a metric of AMPK activation. These changes in phosphorylation of AMPKα were not due to changes in AMPKα abundance (Fig. 7). Neither HMW (Fig. 7) nor hexamer (data not shown) isoform of C138A Acrp30 was able to increase AMPKα phosphorylation in isolated rat EDL muscles. Thus, gAcrp30 and trimeric Acrp30, but not hexameric or HMW Acrp30 isoforms, activate AMPK in skeletal muscle, whereas hexameric or HMW Acrp30 isoforms, but not gAcrp30 or trimeric Acrp30, activate NF-κB (Table I). Clearly the state of oligomerization of Acrp30 determines the signal transduction pathway it activates.Table IActivation of AMPK and NF-κB by distinct Acrp30 oligomers prepared from E. coli or mammalian 293T cellsAcrp30 isoformNF-κB activationAMPK activationE. coli-derived hexamer+aFrom Ref. 10-bFrom Ref. 11E. coli-derived trimer-aFrom Ref. 10+cTomas and Ruderman, unpublished observationE. coli-derived gAcrp30-aFrom Ref. 10+bFrom Ref. 11, dFrom Ref. 12Mammalian cell derived HMW (C138A)+ePresent study-ePresent studyMammalian cell derived hexamer (C138A)+ePresent study-ePresent studyMammalian cell derived trimer (C138A)-ePresent study+ePresent studyMammalian cell derived trimer (C22A)-ePresent study+ePresent studya From Ref. 10.Tsao T.S.

TICAM-1/TRIF was identified as an adapter that facilitates activation of IRF-3 followed by expression of interferon (IFN)-β genes in TLR3 signaling, but TICAM-1 does not directly bind TLR4. Although MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP adapters functions downstream of TLR4, DC maturation and IFN-β induction are independent of MyD88 and Mal/TIRAP. In this investigation, we report the identification of a novel adapter, TICAM-2, that physically bridges TLR4 and TICAM-1 and functionally transmits LPS-TLR4 signaling to TICAM-1, which in turn activates IRF-3. In its structural features, TICAM-2 resembled Mal/TIRAP, an adapter that links TLR2/4 and MyD88. However, TICAM-2 per se exhibited minimal ability to activate NF-κB and the IFN-β promoter. Hence, in LPS signaling TLR4 recruits two types of adapters, TIRAP and TICAM-2, to its cytoplasmic domain that are indirectly connected to two effective adapters, MyD88 and TICAM-1, respectively. We conclude that for LPS-TLR4-mediated activation of IFN-β, the adapter complex of TICAM-2 and TICAM-1 plays a crucial role. This results in the construction of MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways separately downstream of the two distinct adapters.

TLR4 together with MD-2 and CD14 play major roles in the recognition of LPS on membranes and initiate signaling that activates NF-κB and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-3 (1.Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). The IRF-3 activation is followed by IFN-β induction in the cells (2.Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). TLR4 signaling is mediated by an adapter molecule MyD88 for activation of NF-κB (2.Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 3.Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5688-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), but MyD88-dependent signaling pathways are not responsible for the DC maturation or IFN-β induction caused by LPS (2.Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 3.Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5688-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This point was confirmed by analyses of cells from MyD88-deficient mice (4.Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The cellular responses not induced by MyD88 are called MyD88-independent responses (2.Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 3.Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Akira S. J.

Thus, DC maturation and IFN-β induction should be attributable to the activation of a putative MyD88-independent pathway.TIRAP (5.Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), a Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR)-containing adapter also called Mal (6.Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), was initially considered to account for the MyD88-independent pathway. Indeed, a dominant-negative form of TIRAP and a synthetic TIRAP peptide reportedly inhibited IFN-β induction and double strand RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylation (5.Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7.Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, TIRAP knockout studies showed that DC maturation and type 1 IFN induction are largely independent of TIRAP and the phenotype of TIRAP –/– cells resembled those of MyD88 –/– cells (8.Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 9.Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Thus, the TLR4-TIRAP-mediated activation of the IFN-β-inducing pathway remain inconclusive, if any, in mouse cells and most human cells in culture.TLR3 recognizes poly(I-C) (10.Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4849) Google Scholar, 11.Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and activates the IFN-β promoter, and to a lesser extent NF-κB (12.Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Type 1 IFN production and DC maturation with distinct properties from the LPS-induced phenotype are representative cellular responses induced by TLR3-mediated DC activation (13.Honda K. Sakaguchi S. Nakajima C. Watanabe A. Yanai H. Matsumoto M. Ohteki T. Kaisho T. Takaoka A. Akira S. Seya T. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10872-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A recent study on TLR3 and its adapter suggested that an as yet unidentified adapter molecule, later named TICAM-1 (12.Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) or TRIF (14.Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), directly binds the TIR of TLR3 and activates IRF-3 independent of MyD88. TICAM-1, however, barely binds the TIR of TLR4 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in direct immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells (12.Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both TLR3- and TLR4-mediated IRF-3 activation and induction of IFN-inducible genes were abrogated in TICAM-1-deficient or -mutated cells (15.Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 16.Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K.

This suggested that another factor or mechanism must be involved in the MyD88-independent pathway of TLR4.Here, we report the identification of a protein that directly binds TLR4. This protein harbored a TIR domain that has significant homology to TICAM-1, and conferred heterophilic dimerization with TICAM-1. We have named this protein TIR-containing adapter molecule-2, TICAM-2. Based on its functional and physical association analyses, we demonstrated that TICAM-2 helps TLR4 bind TICAM-1 that subsequently induces LPS-mediated IRF-3 activation in the TLR4-mediated MyD88-independent cellular response.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—The human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and the epithelial cell line HeLa was supplied by Tokyo Metropolitan Institute (Tokyo, Japan). Both cell lines were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5 (HeLa) or 10% (MRC-5) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences) and antibiotics. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW267.4 was maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum (17.Hirano A. Kurita-Taniguchi M. Katayama Y. Matsumoto M. Wong T.C. Seya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (obtained from RIKEN Institute, Japan) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The HEK293 line used expressed TICAM-2 mRNA but no TLR3 mRNA and an extremely low level of TICAM-1 mRNA (data not shown). Poly(I-C) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polymyxin B, LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, and mouse IgG1 were from Sigma. The mycoplasma lipopeptide MALP-2 was prepared as described (18.Nishiguchi M. Matsumoto M. Takao T. Hoshino M. Shimonishi Y. Tsuji S. Begum N.A. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2610-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These reagents, except for LPS, were treated with polymyxin B (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C before stimulation of cells. MAbs against human TLR3 (TLR3.7) and TLR2 (TLR2.45) were produced in our laboratory as described previously (10.Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. K. Miyake (University of Tokyo). Anti-IRF-3 antibody was used for determination of IRF-3 activation as noted previously (21.Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human TICAM-1 and TICAM-2 were produced in our laboratory according to the reported method (22.Fukui A. Inoue N. Matsumoto M. Nomura M. Matsuda Y. Toyoshima K. Seya T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47143-47149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Identification and Cloning of TICAM-2 cDNA—TICAM-2 expressed sequence tags were identified by BLAST search analysis with the human TICAM-1 protein sequence in the NCBI BLAST server using the tblastn program. The full-length TICAM-2 cDNA sequence was predicted by searching for human expressed sequence tags in the DDBJ data base, and the two expressed sequence tag clones, BQ438847 and AW450623, were found to cover the putative full sequence of TICAM-2. The BLAST search revealed that the mouse cDNA sequence (accession number AK080879) showed high similarity to human TICAM-2. Full-length human TICAM-2 cDNA was obtained from MRC-5 cDNA by RT-PCR using primers F1 and R1 (see Table I). Mouse TICAM-2 cDNA was isolated by RT-PCR using cDNA of NIH3T3 cell lines with the mF1 and mR1 primers (Table I). The alignment of the adapter molecules was carried out using ClustalW. Expression vectors for TICAM-2 and its mutants were prepared as follows. The cDNA encoding full-length human or mouse TICAM-2 was placed between the XhoI-NotI sites of the pEFBOS plasmid. Regarding human TICAM-2, pEFBOS-TICAM-2 (TIR) was made by inserting the 68–235-amino acid region of TICAM-2 following the Kozak sequence into the XhoI-NotI site of pEFBOS. pEFBOS-TICAM-2(P116H) and -(C117H) were made from pEFBOS-TICAM-2 by site-directed mutagenesis changing Cys-117 to His and Pro-116 to His. The plasmids were prepared with an endotoxin-free Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen).Table IThe primers used for PCRPrimer namePrimer sequenceHuman TICAM-2F1, GGGAATTCATAATGGGTATCGGGAAGTCR1, GGCTGCAGGTTATATGTTTCATCTCAGGCHuman β-actinhBACT-F1, AAGAGAGGCATCCTCACCCThBACT-R1, TACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAMouse TICAM-2mF1, ATAAAGCTCCCTCGTCTGCCmR1, GGTGTGTGCTCGGTTTCAGGmR2, CTGATCCACTGCTCTGCTCCmF3, TGCGGAAGACTGCATTTGCmR3, TGCTCACAGAATTCATCAGGMouse TICAM-1mT-1-F1; CAGAGTTGTCTACAAAGTCGmT-1-R1; TGGATGACGTGGTGTTCTGCMouse IFN-βmIFN-F1, TTCCTGCTGTGCTTCTCCACmIFN-R1; GATTCACTACCAGTCCCAGAGTCmIFN-R2; GCATCTTCTCCGTCATCTCCMouse β-actinmBACT-F1; ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACCMouse β-actinmBACT-R1, GATGTCACGCACGATTTCCC Open table in a new tab Northern Blotting and RT-PCR—Human 12-Lane MTN Blot and Blot III membranes (Clontech) were hybridized under stringent conditions with a 32P-labeled probe of full-length human TICAM-2 cDNA and rehybridized with a labeled β–actin probe. The mRNA signals were detected using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji, Japan) with 4–24 h exposure.RT-PCR for mRNA identification and semiquantitation were performed with primers for human TICAM-2 or β-actin. The primers used are summarized in Table I.Yeast Two-hybrid Method—Yeast media were made as described previously (23.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 22-46Google Scholar). Yeast AH109 strain (Clontech) was transformed with the bait and prey plasmids. The transformants were streaked and incubated for 3 to 5 days. BD and AD in figures represent the bait and prey plasmids, respectively. BD-TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were made by inserting the TIR domain of TLRs into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The mutant P714H TLR4 was produced according to the previous report (18.Nishiguchi M. Matsumoto M. Takao T. Hoshino M. Shimonishi Y. Tsuji S. Begum N.A. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2610-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and BD-TLR4 P714H (TLR4 PH) was made for this assay. BD-TICAM-2 and AD-TICAM-2 were made by inserting the full-length wild-type TICAM-2 cDNA into the pGBKT7 (bait) or pGADT7 (prey). BD-TICAM-1 was made by inserting a TICAM-1 cDNA fragment (from the +1102- to +2142-bp region relative to the start codon). AD-TIRAP and AD-MyD88 were made by inserting the cDNA fragment encoding the full-length protein into the pGADT7 vector. SD-WLH is yeast synthetic dextrose medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His amino acids. SD-WLHA lacks adenine as well. SD-WLH plates are mild stringency plates and SD-WLHA plates are high stringency plates (24.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Reporter Gene Assay for NF-κB and IFN-β Promoter—HEK293 cells (2 × 105 cells per well) were transiently transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with pEFBOS for expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 + MD-2 (0.1 μg), TICAM-1, dominant-negative TICAM-1 (TICAM-1 TIR(P434H)), MyD88, TIRAP, TICAM-2, TICAM-2(TIR), TICAM-2(C117H), TICAM-2(P116H) (10, 100, or 200 ng), or vector alone for control, together with a luciferase-linked NF-κB reporter gene (Stratagene, 0.1 μg) or p-125 luc reporter plasmid (0.1 μg). The construct of the dominant negative TICAM-1, TICAM-1 TIR(P434), was described previously (12.Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The p-125 luc reporter was provided by Dr. T. Taniguchi (University of Tokyo) and contains the human IFN-β promoter region (–125 to +19) inserted into the Picagene luciferase reporter plasmid (Toyo Ink) (11.Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). pAP-1-Luc reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene. Reporter plasmid containing the ELAM-1 promoter was made in our laboratory (25.Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA (0.8–1.0 μg) was adjusted by adding empty vector. Five ng of plasmid pCMVβ (Clontech) was used as an internal control. Where indicated, a dominant-negative expression vector for MyD88 (MyD88(TIR)), TIRAP (TIRAP(P125H)), TICAM-1 (TICAM-1 TIR(P434H)), or TICAM-2 (TICAM-2(C117H)) was co-transfected into the cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with medium alone, LPS (100 ng/ml), polymyxin B-treated MALP-2 (100 nm), or polymyxin B-treated poly(I-C) (10 μg/ml) for 6 h. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega) and both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values were expressed as mean relative stimulations plus standard deviation (S.D.) for a representative experiment from a minimum of three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate.Assay for IRF-3 Activation—Two methods were employed to assess IRF-3 activation. Native gel assay was performed according to the report by Fujita et al. (21.Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Reporter gene assay for IRF-3 was performed as follows (26.Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with the indicated amounts of the plasmids for TICAM-1 or TICAM-2 together with 5 ng of pCMV-β, 100 ng of p55 UASG-Luc, and/or 25 ng of Gal4 DBD/IRF-3 in LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Gal4 DBD only was used as a control. At timed intervals (typically 24 h), cells were harvested and the reporters were determined.Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent with pCMV/TLR4, FLAG-TLR4, or FLAG-TLR4 P714H (2 μg), pEFBOS/TLR3 or FLAG-TLR3 (3 μg), pCMV/TLR2 or FLAG-TLR2 (2 μg), and pEFBOS/TICAM-1-HA (0.5 μg) or pEFBOS/MD-2 (1 μg) together with pEFBOS/TICAM-2 or TICAM-2-HA (0.5 μg). The total amount of DNA (4 μg) was kept constant by adding empty vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with medium alone or LPS for 15–60 min and then lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm EDTA). After centrifugation, the cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) or for 2 h at 4 °C. Mouse IgG1 was used for control. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed three times thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by adding Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. In some experiments, lysates were also directly immunoblotted.RNAi—The mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 was employed in this study because no good human cell lines were found for RNAi knockdown analysis. Mouse RAW cells (5 × 106) were plated onto 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Then cells were transfected with buffer alone, control siRNA (for human TLR3 or human lamin A/C) (11.Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), siRNA for mouse TICAM-2 or siRNA for mouse TICAM-1 using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty h after transfection, cells were collected after treatment with EDTA (5 mm), saline and plated onto 24-well plates. Cells were 30–50% confluent the next day. The cells were transfected again with siRNAs using OligofectAMINE, and incubated for 2 days. The culture supernatant was removed and the medium containing 100 ng/ml LPS was added to each well. Before and after 6 h of stimulation, the total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIZOL. The RNA was treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WA) to eliminate possible contaminating genomic DNA. No contamination was confirmed by RT-PCR (see Fig. 6). In some experiments, TICAM-2 or TICAM-1 knockdown cells were rescued by transfection with TICAM-1 (20 ng) or TICAM-2 plasmid (50 ng), respectively.The siRNA for human TLR3 was used as a control. Because the target TLR3 sequence is not conserved between humans and mice, the control siRNA did not down-regulate the mouse TLR3. The oligonucleotides used for RNAi were purchased from JBioS (Saitama, Japan) (Table II).Table IIsiRNATarget geneSense/antisenseOligonucleotide sequencea“r” and “d” represent ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide, respectively.Mouse TICAM-2 (site A)Senser(UUCUGAGGAAGCCUGCUUG)d(TT)Antisenser(CAAGCAGGCUUCCUCAGAA)d(TT)Mouse TICAM-2 (site B)Senser(CUUCCUAAGAGACACCUGG)d(TT)Antisenser(CCAGGUGUCUCUUAGGAAG)d(TT)Mouse TICAM-1Senser(AGUCAGAGGUCACCUCAGG)d(TT)Antisenser(CCUGAGGUGACCUCUGACU)d(TT)Control siRNA (human TLR3)Senser(UUAGAGUUGUCAUCGAAUC)d(TT)Antisenser(GAUUCGAUGACAACUCUAA)d(TT)Control siRNA (Human lamin A/C)Senser(CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACA)d(TT)Antisenser(UGUUCUUCUGGAAGUCCAG)d(TT)a “r” and “d” represent ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide, respectively. Open table in a new tab Quantitative PCR analyses were carried out using an iCycler iQ Real-Time detection system with iQ SYBR Green Supermix reagents (Bio-Rad). Primers used for the quantitative PCR were mF1, mR2, mF3, and mR3 for TICAM-2, mIFN-F1, and mIFN-R2 for IFN-β, and mBACT-F1 and mBACT-R1 for β-actin (Table I).IRF-3 reporter assay was performed with siRNA-treated cells as follows. RAW cells were twice transfected with siRNA (Table II) in OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for gene silencing of TICAM-1 or TICAM-2 as described above. Cells were then transfected with reporter genes (10 ng of pCMV-β, 100 ng of p55 UASG-Luc, and/or 50 ng of Gal4 DBD/IRF-3) by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). One day after the transfection, cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or polymixin B-treated poly(I-C) (10 μg/ml), and 6 h later, the reporters were measured as described above.RESULTSMolecular Cloning of TICAM-2—Because TICAM-1 was identified as an adapter that induces IFN-β (12.Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), we searched for sequences that contained a TIR similar to that of TICAM-1 in expressed sequence tag databases and identified a relevant partial cDNA for humans and mouse. The complete sequence of the human protein was confirmed by RT-PCR using the primers covering the open reading frame and named TICAM-2 (TIR-containing adapter molecule-2) (Fig. 1a). This protein consisted of 235 amino acids with a short (∼70 amino acids) N-terminal Ser/Thr-rich domain, TIR motif, and a C-terminal 20-amino acid stretch. The N- and C-terminal domains of TICAM-2 did not resemble those of TICAM-1. The TIR and C-terminal portion were highly conserved in human and mouse TICAM-2 (Fig. 1a). Although the TIR motif of TICAM-2 had low similarity to the TIR motifs of the reported adapters TIRAP (5.Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain of TICAM-2 shared tandemly arranged basic amino acids and serines with that of TIRAP. Similar to TICAM-1, TICAM-2 lacked the conserved sequences present in other TIR-containing proteins (27.Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L.

Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which is essential for the TIR-mediated signaling, was situated in front of the conserved position or replaced with cysteine in TICAM-2 (Fig. 1b). Identities in amino acid composition among the comparable TIR domains of the reported adapters are shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d is a comparative depiction of TICAM-2 with the known adapters.

We have found that both rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated 35S-labeled guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) incorporation in cells over-expressing GPCR135. Multiple rounds of extraction, purification, followed by N-terminal sequence analysis of the ligand from porcine brain revealed that the ligand is a product of the recently identified gene, relaxin-3 (aka insulin-7 or INSL7). Recombinant human relaxin-3 potently stimulates GTPγS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells with EC50 values of 0.25 and 0.35 nM, respectively. 125I-Relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 at high affinity with a Kd value of 0.31 nM. Relaxin-3 is the only member of the insulin/relaxin superfamily that can activate GPCR135. In situ hybridization showed that relaxin-3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the dorsomedial ventral tegmental nucleus of the brainstem (aka nucleus incertus), as well as in discrete cells in the lateral periaqueductal gray and in the central gray nucleus. GPCR135 is expressed abundantly in the hypothalamus with discrete expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus, as well as in the cortex, septal nucleus, and preoptical area. Relaxin-3 has previously been shown to bind and activate the LGR7 relaxin receptor. However, we believe that neuroanatomical colocalization of GPCR135 and relaxin-3, coupled with a clear high affinity interaction, suggest that GPCR135 is the receptor for relaxin-3. The identification of relaxin-3 as the ligand for GPCR135 provides the framework for the discovery of a new brainstem/hypothalamus circuitry.

Knobil E. North A.C. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 861-1009Google Scholar). Recently, two leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs), LGR7 and LGR8 (23.Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24.Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J.

Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). LGR7 and LGR8 belong to the typical hormone receptor family and share significant homologies with luteinizing hormone receptor (25.McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (26.Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Activation of LGR7 or LGR8 by their ligands leads to intracellular cAMP accumulation. Recently, a new member of the insulin superfamily was discovered and named relaxin-3 (27.Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated to be an additional ligand for LGR7 (28.Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas the ligand INSL3 (29.Adham I.M. Burkhardt E. Benahmed M. Engel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26668-26672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has also been shown to be a ligand for LGR8 (30.Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). As part of a directed effort to identify novel receptors and ligands in the central nervous system, we cloned the full-length cDNAs for nearly all GPCR-like sequences from public and in-house data bases. One of these receptors, GPCR135, was used to fish out a ligand from brain extracts. GPCR135, publicly known as somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor (SALPR) (31.Matsumoto M. Kamohara M. Sugimoto T. Hidaka K. Takasaki J. Saito T. Okada M. Yamaguchi T. Furuichi K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), shares significant homology to somatostatin receptor SSTR5 and angiotensin II receptor AT1 with 35 and 31% identity, respectively. GPCR135 mRNA is expressed in various regions in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra and pituitary as determined by RT-PCR (31.Matsumoto M. Kamohara M. Sugimoto T. Hidaka K. Takasaki J. Saito T. Okada M. Yamaguchi T. Furuichi K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GPCR135 mRNA can also be detected in the peripheral tissues, albeit at low levels (31.Matsumoto M. Kamohara M. Sugimoto T. Hidaka K. Takasaki J. Saito T. Okada M. Yamaguchi T. Furuichi K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The predominant expression of GPCR135 mRNA in the brain suggests a role in central nervous system function. However, the endogenous ligand(s) for GPCR135 had not been identified. In the present studies, we report the purification, identification, and characterization of relaxin-3, a new member of the insulin/relaxin peptide superfamily (27.Bathgate R.A. Samuel C.S. Burazin T.C. Layfield S. Claasz A.A. Reytomas I.G. Dawson N.F. Zhao C. Bond C. Summers R.J. Parry L.J. Wade J.D. Tregear G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1148-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), as the endogenous ligand for GPCR135. Relaxin-3 binds to and activates GPCR135 at high affinity. No other members of the insulin peptide family bind to or activate GPCR135. Because GPCR135 is expressed in the hypothalamus and relaxin-3 is expressed in the brainstem nuclei with known projections to the hypothalamus, we conclude that relaxin-3 is the endogenous ligand for GPCR135. Reagents—Human insulin, IGF1, and IGF2 were purchased from Sigma. Human INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, oxidized relaxin-3 A-chain and B-chain peptides were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Porcine relaxin was purchased from the National Hormone & Peptide Program (Torrance, CA). All other peptides were produced recombinantly. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) was recrystallized from ethanol/water, and dissolved in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile/water at 10 mg/ml. Carboxypeptidase Y (Roche Applied Sciences) was dissolved in 30 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, at 0.5 μg/μl, and methylated trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI) was dissolved at 0.2 μg/μl in 50 mm acetic acid, both were stored at -20 °C until use. Calibration solution was prepared in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, water from [Arg8]vasopressin (Sigma) at 0.28 pmol/μl and human insulin (Sigma) at 18 pmol/μl. Molecular Cloning of GPCR135—The human GPCR135 coding region was identified from a human genome sequence (GenBank™ accession number NT_023085) based on its homology to somatostatin receptors. The complete coding region of human GPCR135 was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using two primers with the forward primer: 5′-ACAGCTCGAGGCCACCATGCAGATGGCCGATGCAGCCACG-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-ACATCATCTAGATCAGTAGGCAGAGCTGCTGGGCAGCAG-3′. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 40 s, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 35 cycles. The PCR products were cloned into pCIneo and the insert region was sequenced to confirm the identity of the sequence. Initial Identification and Characterization of the GPCR135 Ligand Activity from the Rat Brain—Five grams of frozen rat brain were homogenized in 50 ml of -30 °C ethanol, 0.8 m HCl (3:1 ratio). The homogenate was extracted at 4 °C for 2 h and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml SP-Sephadex C-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The column was washed with 20 ml of 1 m acetic acid and eluted with 2 m pyridine and 1 m acetic acid. The eluted peptides were loaded onto a 500-mg C-18 Bond Elut column (Varian, Harbor City, CA), washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted peptides were lyophilized, reconstituted in water, and tested for ligand activity in GPCR135-expressing cell membranes using GTPγS binding assays. The reconstituted rat brain extract was also run on a HPLC gel filtration column (BioSep-SEC-S2000, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) in 1 m acetic acid to characterize the molecular weight of the ligand. Briefly, fractions of 1 ml were collected, lyophilized, and tested for GPCR135 ligand activity using GTPγS binding assays. In a parallel experiment, proteins or peptides with various molecular weights were run in the same conditions to serve as the molecular weight standards. Purification of GPCR135 Ligand from Porcine Brain—Porcine brains (1.8 kg) were extracted with 18 liters of cold ethanol, 0.8 m HCl, mixed at 3:1. Portions of 300 g of frozen brains were homogenized in a blender (Waring, Winster, CT) for 1–2 min in 3 liters of the liquid cooled to -30 °C. The homogenate was then stirred at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min and filtered through Whatman 541 filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and then through 0.22-μm Millipore GP Express Plus filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Aliquots of 2.5 liters of the extract were mixed with 600 ml of Express-Ion™ Exchanger S (Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, 20% acetonitrile, pH 5.2, stirred for 20 min, and filtered. The ion exchanger was washed 3 times with 500 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with 500 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% acetonitrile, pH 5.2, and the eluate was separated from the ion exchanger by filtration. The elution procedure was repeated twice, first with 500 ml and then with 400 ml of liquid, and the eluates were pooled. The remaining extract was processed identically. To the pooled eluate, an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water was added, and 10 liters of this liquid was mixed with 300 g of Amberlite XAD-16 HP (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and stirred for 20 min. Amberlite was washed on a filter with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, and eluted by mixing with 700 ml of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water. The eluate was separated from the Amberlite by filtration. Such elution from Amberlite was repeated twice, and the rest of the ion exchanger eluate was processed in the same manner. The eluates from Amberlite were pooled, and acetonitrile was removed with a rotary evaporator. The remaining liquid was lyophilized, and 0.52 g of dry material was obtained. The material was dissolved in 400 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate, 20% acetonitrile, pH 5.2, and filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore GP Express Plus filter. The following chromatographies were carried out on ÄKTA Explorer™ and Purifier™ HPLC systems (Amersham Biosciences). The filtrate (78 ml per run) was pumped onto a Resource S (6-ml column, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, 20% acetonitrile, pH 5.2, and eluted with a 0–20% linear gradient in 35 column volumes of the same buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, diluted with 5 volumes of water, pH was adjusted to 2.5, and loaded onto the same column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 20% acetonitrile, pH 2.5. Peptides were eluted with a 0–25% linear gradient in 35 column volumes of this buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Active fractions were collected, mixed with an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water loaded onto a Source 5RPC (ST 4.6/150, Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a 25–40% linear gradient in 12 column volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile/water. The pooled active fractions were mixed with 750 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, and chromatographed on a μRPC C2/C18 column (ST 4.6/100, Amersham Biosciences) using a 23–40% linear gradient in 15 column volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile/water. At this stage the active fractions appeared as a single peak and the material was subjected to structural analysis. S-Carboxyamidomethylation—A part of the lyophilized peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA (Merck), and 4 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol (Pierce) was added and kept at 40 °C for 2 h. 12 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide (Sigma) was added to the sample, and the sample was incubated at 40 °C for 35 min followed by 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The sample was mixed with 2 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, pumped onto the μRPC C2/C18 ST 4.6/100 column, and the peptides were separated with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile/water. Mass Spectrometry and Sequence Analysis—Positive-ion MALDI TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE Pro instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For mass determination 1 μl of sample from an HPLC fraction was mixed on a stainless steel MALDI target plate with 1 μl of calibration solution and 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution and allowed to dry at room temperature. Carboxypeptidase Y digests were prepared by pipetting 1 μl of samples from HPLC on the MALDI target, mixed with 1 μl of carboxypeptidase Y solution and allowed to dry at room temperature. Calibration solution (1 μl) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (1 μl) were added to the same spot and allowed to dry again. Acquired mass spectra were calibrated using monoisotopic peaks of singly or doubly charged ions of [Arg8]vasopressin and human insulin (m/z 1084.4457 Th, m/z 2902.8266 Th, m/z 5804.6455 Th). On-target tryptic digests were prepared by pipetting 1 μl each of sample, trypsin, and 0.2% ammonium bicarbonate solutions, and allowed to dry at room temperature. Finally, 1 μl of matrix solution was added and allowed to dry again. The spectra were calibrated using monoisotopic peaks of fragments from self-digestion of trypsin (m/z 515.3306 Th, m/z 842.5100 Th, and m/z 2211.1046 Th). Sequence analysis of tryptic fragments using tandem mass spectrometry was carried out on a Q-TOF Ultima instrument (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with the standard Z-spray source. The samples were sprayed in 60% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid/water from gold-coated borosilicate capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark) using a capillary voltage of 1.5 kV, and positive-ion spectra were recorded. Tryptic fragments were prepared from carboxyamidomethylated peptides by incubation with methylated trypsin in 0.2% ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C for 6 h, and the samples were lyophilized. Tandem MS/MS experiments were carried out at collision energies optimized within 25–35 eV, using 5-s scans during 5 min. Data were analyzed with a Biolynx peptide sequencing module of Masslynx 3.5. N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Procise HT sequencer. GTPγS Binding Assays—The GPCR135 expression vector described above was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and the cell membranes were prepared by homogenizing the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. GTPγS binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl) was added to the pellet and the pellet was homogenized using a Polytron tissue homogenizer. Protease inhibitors were added to the buffer at concentrations of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstain A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell membranes and different concentrations of ligands were added to 96-well plates and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 35S-GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then added to each well at a final concentration of 200 pm in a final volume of 200 μl. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h, filtered though a 96-well GFC filter plate (Packard Instrument Co.), and washed with cold washing buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2. 50 μl of Microscint-40 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well and the plate was counted on a top counter (TopCount NTX, Packard). Expression and Purification of Human Recombinant Relaxin-3—Human relaxin-3 complete coding region was PCR amplified from human brain cDNA (Clontech) using two primers with the forward primer: 5′-ACGATCGTCGACGCCACCATGGCCAGGTACATGCTGCTGCTGCTC-3′ and the reverse primer: 5′-ACGATAAAGCTTCTAGCAAAGGCTACTGATTTCACTTTTGC-3′. The PCR products were cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV-sport1 (Invitrogen) between SalI and HindIII sites. The cloned cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the identities of human relaxin-3. The expression vector was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Three days after the transfection, cell culture medium from the transfected cells was collected, adjusted to pH 3.0, and loaded onto a Sephadex C-25 cation exchange column. The column was washed with 1 m acetic acid and eluted with 2 m pyridine and 1 m acetic acid. The eluted proteins were loaded on a C-18 Bond Elut column (Varian), washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted proteins were lyophilized, reconstituted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and used for GTPγS binding assay. In a parallel experiment, we cloned the human relaxin-3 pro-peptide coding region into a modified pCMV-sport1 vector with the polycloning sites modified by repla"

For example, infection by Gram-negative bacteria induces the Imd signaling pathway, leading to the activation of the NF-κB-like transcription factor Relish and the expression of a battery of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. Bacterial infection also activates the JNK pathway, but the role of this pathway in the immune response has not yet been established. Genetic experiments suggest that the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian MAPK kinase kinase, TAK1 (transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1), activates both the JNK and NF-κB pathways following immune stimulation. In this report, we demonstrate that Drosophila TAK1 functions as both the Drosophila IκB kinase-activating kinase and the JNK kinase-activating kinase. However, we found that JNK signaling is not required for antimicrobial peptide gene expression but is required for the activation of other immune inducible genes, including Punch, sulfated, and malvolio. Thus, JNK signaling appears to play an important role in the cellular immune response and the stress response.

Thus, JNK signaling appears to play an important role in the cellular immune response and the stress response. Innate immune signaling pathways are highly conserved between insects and mammals (1.Silverman N. Maniatis T.

In both cases, pathogens are recognized through the detection of conserved molecules such as microbial cell wall components, which are shared by broad groups of microbes.

LPS and other microbial substances are recognized by germ line-encoded receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) or peptidoglycan recognition proteins. Activation of these receptors stimulates conserved signaling pathways leading to the expression of antimicrobial proteins and immune stimulatory cytokines. For example, LPS treatment leads to the activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways in both insects and mammals (1.Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In mammals, the NF-κB pathway is required for the induction of cytokines in response to infection.

Relish is a bipartite protein with an NF-κB (Rel homology) domain and an inhibitory IκB domain. In unstimulated cells, Relish is present in the cytoplasm as a full-length precursor protein and, upon infection, is endoproteolytically cleaved. The N-terminal Rel homology domain of Relish then translocates into the nucleus and activates antimicrobial gene expression, whereas the C-terminal IκB module remains in the cytoplasm (5.Stöven S. Ando I. Kadalayil L. Engström Y. Hultmark D. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Signal-induced cleavage and activation of Relish requires a signaling pathway known as the Imd pathway, which includes the receptor PGRP-LC (peptidoglycan recognition protein LC), the intracellular signaling component IMD (a receptor interacting protein (RIP)-like death domain protein), TAK1 (a MAP3K), the Drosophila IKK complex (IKKβ/ird5 and IKKγ/kenny), as well as the caspase Dredd and the adaptor known as the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (6.Ramet M.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The detailed biochemical mechanisms required for this intracellular signaling pathway are not understood. Another conserved immune signaling system is the JNK pathway. Activation of JNK (and other MAPK) signaling pathways in innate immune signaling is well documented in vertebrates. Three MAPK signaling pathways (JNK, ERK, and p38) are stimulated by LPS treatment (17.Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of the ERK and/or p38 pathways in monocyte cell lines inhibits the induction of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (17.Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, 18.Zhu W. Downey J.S. Gu J. Di Padova F. Gram H. Han J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6349-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts JNK2 is required for induction of type I interferons in response to viral infection and for the induction of IL-12 and IL-6 in response to LPS (19.Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although all the members of the JNK pathway are conserved in the fly, and Drosophila JNK signaling is activated in response to LPS stimulation (20.Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), the role of this pathway in the insect immune responses has not been clearly delineated. By contrast, the role of the JNK signaling pathway in Drosophila development has been extensively studied. The best understood role of JNK signaling is in dorsal closure during embryonic development (for review, see Ref. 21.Stronach B.E. Perrimon N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6172-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The dorsal closure JNK pathway kinase cascade relies on the mixed lineage kinase (MLK)-type MAP3K slipper (slpr), which is thought to function as a JNKK kinase (22.Stronach B. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), activating the JNK kinase hemipterous (hep), which, in turn, activates the JNK basket (bsk) (22.Stronach B. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bsk, in turn, phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor d-Jun. Dorsal closure is mechanistically similar to wound healing. Both processes involve pulling an epithelial sheet across an opening and sealing the hole. Recently, it was proposed that JNK signaling may be required for wound healing in the fly (23.Ramet M. Lanot R. Zachary D. Manfruelli P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, Perrimon and co-workers recently reported that the targets of JNK signaling during immune activation include many cytoskeletal components (24.Boutros M. Agaisse H. Perrimon N. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) similar to those reported to be JNK-inducible genes during dorsal closure (25.Jasper H. Benes V. Schwager C. Sauer S. Clauder-Munster S. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 579-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although this is a reasonable hypothesis, it has not yet been demonstrated that inhibition of JNK signaling, for example by inactivating bsk or hep, prevents proper wound repair. In addition to its potential role in wound healing, Drosophila JNK signaling has also been implicated in the activation of stress-protective proteins (25.Jasper H. Benes V. Schwager C. Sauer S. Clauder-Munster S. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 579-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Also, earlier reports have suggested that AP-1-like transcription factors, which are the ultimate targets of the JNK signaling pathway, might regulate antimicrobial peptide gene expression (26.Meister M. Braun A. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5958-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, JNK may act at many different levels in the Drosophila immune response, but few mechanistic details have emerged. In mammals, the MAP3K TAK1 plays a central role in the IL-1R/Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. In vitro biochemical studies showed that TAK1 could be activated directly by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is known to be a critical component of this signaling pathway. Furthermore, these in vitro studies demonstrated that, once activated, TAK1 can activate both the IKK complex (and NF-κB signaling) as well as the JNKK MKK6 (and JNK signaling) (27.Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mammalian cell culture have demonstrated that TAK1 is required for NF-κB activation following tumor necrosis factor α or IL-1 stimulation (28.Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Drosophila TAK1 is required for the Imd signaling pathway; Drosophila TAK1–/– flies have a severely compromised immune response and do not express antimicrobial peptides upon infection with Gram-negative bacteria (16.Vidal S. Khush R.S. Leulier F. Tzou P. Nakamura M. Lemaitre B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1900-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Also, gene expression profiling experiments have implied that Drosophila TAK1 is responsible for activation of both JNK and NF-κB (Relish) signaling following immune stimulation (24.Boutros M. Agaisse H. Perrimon N. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, these studies provide no biochemical data supporting this hypothesis. In this report we use Drosophila S2* cells to show that TAK1 is required for both LPS-induced JNK and IKK activation and for antimicrobial peptide gene induction. Surprisingly, the immune activation of the JNK pathway is not required for antimicrobial peptide gene induction. However, several other JNK-dependent, LPS-inducible genes were identified in microarray studies, suggesting a role for JNK signaling in the cellular immune response as well as protection from stress. S2* Cell Culture and Kinase Assays—S2* cells were grown as described previously (10.Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Immune stimulation was with 10 μg/ml LPS from Escherichia coli 055:B5 (Sigma) for 3–5 h. Prior to LPS stimulation, cells were differentiated with 1 μm 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (Sigma) for at least 24 h. RNA and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (10.Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). IKK immunoprecipitation kinase assays were performed as described previously, except that 100 ng of recombinant baculovirus-produced Relish was used. For baculovirus construction, FLAG Relish from pSH-Relish (29.Han Z.S. Ip Y.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21355-21361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was cloned into the shuttle vector pHIS-BIVT (30.Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6747-6756Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). JNK signaling activity was monitored with a c-Jun shift assay, as described previously (31.Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Microarray Construction, Experimentation, and Analysis—cDNAs were amplified by PCR, with universal primers, from a collection of ∼5900 plasmids from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's Drosophila Gene Collection, version 1. This collection contains one representative cDNA from every gene identified by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's expressed sequence tag (EST) project as of the year 2000. All products were analyzed by EtBr-stained agarose gel electrophoresis, and their product sizes were compared with the expected size as determined by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. A small number of amplification products were also analyzed by sequencing in which we found an error rate (either the wrong cDNA or a mixed population of cDNAs) in ∼15% of the samples. These problem samples contained either the wrong size band or multiple bands on the agarose gels. The data presented in Table I include only cDNAs with a single correctly sized amplification product. Microarrays were printed on polylysine-coated glass slides using a Brown-style arrayer at the Bauer Center for Genomics Research, Harvard University (32.DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar).Table IResults of BAGEL analysis performed on selected genes Open table in a new tab Hybridization probes were prepared from mRNA isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction and Oligotex enrichment (Qiagen). Before mRNA selection, the RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting to verify that LPS induction of antimicrobial peptide genes was effective and that RNAi targeting of IKK or TAK1 successfully blocked signaling. After mRNA purification, the BioAnalyzer 2100 RNA 6000 Nano Lab-Chip kit (Agilent) was used to verify the quality of the material. mRNA (1.5–2.0 μg) was used in an indirect labeling first strand cDNA synthesis reaction with amino-alyll-dUTP and subsequently labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (DiRisi lab web page, www.microarrays.org). After purification of the probe mixture, arrays were hybridized overnight at 62 °C, washed, and scanned with a GenePix 4000A (Axon). Data were normalized such that the Cy3 and Cy5 signals were equivalent across the entire array. Only those data that reached minimum signal strength in both colors (passing in the GeneScan spot-finding algorithm with an average spot intensity three times greater than the standard deviation of the background and at least 70% of the spot greater than two standard deviations of the background) were included in further analysis. The normalized values of the Cy5/Cy3 ratio from each hybridization were analyzed together using the Bayesian analysis of gene expression level (BAGEL) software. This analysis included ten conditions (or nodes), including LPS treated and untreated for wild type, TAK1, IKK, Hep, or Bsk mutant cells. For greater robustness, data from untransfected or LacZ dsRNA transfected cells were treated as wild type and either IKKβ or IKKγ dsRNA was transfected for the IKK mutant cells. The antimicrobial peptide genes were not included in the BAGEL analysis. The complete raw, normalized, and analyzed data is available on our web site, labs.umassmed.edu/silverman/suppl.htm. Further analysis was done with the output of the BAGEL analysis using Boolean logic to select for genes, which showed interesting expression patterns using a posterior Bayesian probability of 0.95 or greater as a significance cut-off. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction followed by DNase treatment, and 5 μg was used in a standard first strand cDNA synthesis reaction. Control reactions were performed without reverse transcriptase to verify that amplified products were bona fide cDNA amplicons. Real time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate with one-fiftieth of the cDNA product using primers specific to the various genes and to rp49, as a control, with Sybergreen on an MJ Research Opticon 2 real time apparatus. A standard curve, with an r value >0.95, was generated for each gene with serial 2-fold dilutions of a control cDNA sample. Expression levels were determined by normalizing the transcript levels of Punch or Sulfated with the level of rp49 expression. The median ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by using log transformations and back transforming the estimates and intervals. TAK1 Is Required for IKK Activation—Previous genetic studies have demonstrated that dTAK1 is required for the Imd pathway and have suggested it functions upstream of the Drosophila IKK complex. To characterize the role of dTAK1 in this pathway at a biochemical level, we have utilized the Drosophila S2* cell line (33.Samakovlis C. Åsling B. Boman H.G. Gateff E. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). When these cells are treated with ecdysone, they differentiate and become responsive to LPS treatment, which leads to high levels of antimicrobial peptide gene expression (10.Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). An additional advantage of this cell line is that RNAi can be used to target any gene of interest. Similar to the TAK1 mutant fly, targeting TAK1 with RNAi in S2* blocks LPS-mediated activation of antibacterial peptide gene expression, similar to that observed with DmIKKγ RNAi (Fig. 1A). TAK1 is unique among the Drosophila MAP3Ks tested because it is required for LPS signaling, whereas slpr and Drosophila MEKK4 are not. In mammals, TAK1 has been shown to play a critical role in IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (27.Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 28.Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In vitro, TAK1 can directly phosphorylate and activate the human IKK complex. Thus, TAK1 has been proposed to function as the IKK activating kinase (IKK-K) in this signaling pathway (27.Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The immuno-compromised phenotype of TAK1 mutant flies and S2* cells suggest that TAK1 may function as the IKK-K in the insect immune response. To determine whether TAK1 function is required for IKK activation, an immunoprecipitation kinase assay was utilized. The endogenous Drosophila IKK complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-DmIKKγ antisera from cell lysates prepared from LPS-treated or untreated cells. This immunoprecipitate was then tested for kinase activity in vitro using recombinant Relish as substrate. As demonstrated previously (10.Silverman N. Zhou R. Stöven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), LPS treatment leads to a significant increase in Drosophila IKK activity. Treatment of cells with TAK1 RNAi inhibits the LPS-induced IKK activation as much as targeting DmIKKγ itself (Fig. 1B). We conclude that TAK1 is required for LPS-induced activation of the Drosophila IKK complex and the subsequent expression of antimicrobial gene expression. TAK1 Is Required for JNK Activation—In mammals, TAK1 has also been proposed to function as the JNKK kinase in the IL-1 and LPS signaling pathways (27.Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Therefore we sought to determine whether Drosophila TAK1 is also required for the activation of the JNK signaling pathway. JNK signaling was assayed by monitoring the phosphorylation-induced shift in c-Jun gel mobility following LPS stimulation. In this assay, in vitro translated 35S-labeled c-Jun is incubated with whole cell extract from LPS-treated or untreated cells. The LPS-treated extract contains active JNK as evidenced by the decrease in mobility of the c-Jun protein after incubation with the extract from LPS-treated cells. A mutant c-Jun protein, with the JNK target serines (Ser-63 and Ser-73) mutated, is not phosphorylated in this assay (data not shown). This observation is consistent with a previous study showing that JNK activity was induced in response to LPS stimulation of S2* cells (20.Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). RNAi was used to inhibit the function of Drosophila IKKγ, TAK1, and, as controls, the Drosophila homologs of JNKK and JNK, hep and bsk. As expected, both Hep and Bsk RNAi inhibited LPS-induced JNK activity as demonstrated by a lack of a c-Jun shift, whereas IKKγ and LacZ RNAi had no effect on JNK activation. TAK1 RNAi also inhibited LPS-induced JNK activity (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that TAK1, but not the Drosophila IKK complex, is required for LPS-induced JNK activation. Thus, it is likely that TAK1 functions as the JNKK kinase by phosphorylating and activating the Drosophila JNKK Hep. Targeting two other Drosophila MAP3Ks, slpr and MEKK4, with RNAi had no effect on LPS-induced JNK activation. JNK Pathway Targets—Previous studies have shown that LPS treatment activates JNK signaling (20.Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and that some antimicrobial genes have potential AP-1-like elements in their promoter/enhancer regions (26.Meister M. Braun A. Kappler C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5958-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether JNK signaling is involved in immune-induced antimicrobial gene expression in Drosophila. This is due, in part, to the fact that null mutants in the previously characterized JNK components, hep and bsk, are embryonic lethal and therefore do not survive to the age when the immune response can be readily measured. Therefore, RNAi was used to inhibit LPS-inducible JNK activation in S2* cells by targeting TAK1, Hep, and Bsk. The level of LPS-induced antimicrobial gene induction was then determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 3). Although TAK1 is required for induction of the antimicrobial genes, neither Hep nor Bsk appear to play a significant role in induction of attacin, cecropin, and diptericin. Note that the RNA analyzed in this experiment is from the same cells used in the JNK assay shown in Fig. 2, which demonstrated that TAK1, Hep, and Bsk are all required for JNK activation. Thus, TAK1, in its role as the IKK-K, is responsible for the activation of antimicrobial production, whereas the JNK pathway is not involved. However, LPS-inducible JNK activation is likely to control the expression of other immune inducible genes. We used gene expression profiling to identify genes that are induced by LPS in a JNK-dependent manner. For these experiments, microarrays containing ∼5900 unique full-length Drosophila cDNAs were used. In a series of 27 hybridizations (encompassing four independent experiments), we analyzed expression profiles of wild type cells (e.g. untransfected cells or cells transfected with LacZ dsRNA) and mutant cells (e.g. transfected with JNK and/or IKK dsRNAs) before and after immune stimulation. Eleven competitive hybridizations were performed comparing cDNA prepared from the same cell line (i.e. wild type or mutant cells) before or after LPS stimulation. An additional sixteen hybridizations were performed comparing wild type LPS-stimulated cells to mutant LPS-stimulated cells. (See Supplemental Fig. 1 in the online version of this article for a diagram of this hybridization scheme.) To analyze this data set, which contains 10 conditions (or nodes), we used a newly developed tool for BAGEL (34Townsend, J. P., and Hartl, D. L. (2002) Genome Biology, http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/12/research/0071,Google Scholar). BAGEL uses Bayesian analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo integration to generate estimates of the relative expression level of each gene in all conditions. This analysis also generates a 95% confidence interval for the expression level of each gene in each condition and a probability score (the Bayesian posterior probability) showing the likelihood that the expression level (of any gene) in each condition is greater or lesser than the expression level in any other condition. For our analysis, we considered the expression level of a gene to be significantly greater in one condition compared with another only if the Bayesian posterior probability was at least 0.95 (95%), which corresponds to a classical one-tailed p value of 0.05 or less. The results of the BAGEL analysis were further parsed to select for genes whose expression profiles were of particular interest. For example, to identify LPS-inducible, JNK-specific genes, we selected those genes that are significantly induced by LPS in wild type and IKK RNAi-treated cells but are expressed at significantly lower levels in LPS-stimulated TAK, Bsk, or Hep RNAi-treated cells. This approach yielded a list of 25 genes, which were then sorted by their fold induction. To focus on those genes that are most strongly affected by LPS stimulation, we listed only those 15 genes which are induced at least 1.75-fold by LPS treatment (see Table I, panel A). Likewise, we identified 19 genes that are dependent on the IKK pathway (down-regulated in IKK and TAK1 mutant cells but not in Hep or Bsk mutant cells), 11 of which are induced at least 1.75-fold (Table I, panel B). Finally, we identified 15 genes (10 of which are induced >1.75-fold; Table I, panel C) that show a dependence on both IKK and JNK pathways. If a gene requires input from both pathways for maximal activation, it might be expected that blocking either pathway would reduce expression levels to intermediate levels, whereas blocking both pathways would have a more dramatic effect. In the data presented here, this would be manifest by intermediate expression levels when IKK or JNK pathways are blocked (IKK, or Bsk or Hep RNAi, respectively) and very low expression levels when both pathways are blocked (TAK1 RNAi). This prediction is true for Mvl and CG9312, suggesting that maximal LPS induction of these genes requires input from"
https://openalex.org/W2027559291,"High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to produce a dramatic alleviation of motor symptoms in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Its functional mechanism, however, remains obscure. We used extracellular recording and in situ cytochrome oxidase (CoI) mRNA hybridization to investigate the effects of HFS of the STN on neuronal activity of the STN and the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) in normal rats and rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). To allow detection of spikes and analysis of firing activity, artifacts recorded during stimulation were scaled down using a template subtraction method. In both normal and lesioned rats, the activity of a majority of STN neurons was inhibited during stimulation. In the SNr, HFS also induced an inhibition of the activity of a majority of neurons in normal and lesioned rats. In situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed these results in that it showed a significant decrease in levels of CoI mRNA expression in the STN and SNr in both normal and lesioned rats during stimulation. These data afford an interesting insight into the functional mechanism of deep brain stimulation and support the hypothesis that HFS exerts an inhibitory influence on STN neuronal firing."
https://openalex.org/W1971865087,"We have recently identified the insulin-like peptide relaxin-3 (aka INSL7) as the endogenous ligand for an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPCR135 (aka somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor). Analysis of possible receptors related to GPCR135 revealed a single orphan receptor, GPCR142. Thus, we tested whether GPCR142 could also respond to relaxin-3 or related insulin-like molecules. Surprisingly, GPCR142 was activated by nanomolar concentrations of relaxin-3 but was completely unresponsive to all other known insulin-like peptides.

In an analysis of other species, we were able to find a full-length mouse homolog of GPCR142, but were unable to detect any complete GPCR142 transcripts in rat. With respect to intracellular signaling, GPCR142 is similar to GPCR135 in that it potently inhibits adenylate cyclase and stimulates 35S-GTPγS incorporation in response to relaxin-3.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we report the purification and identification of the peptide ligand, relaxin-3, as an endogenous ligand for orphan receptor GPCR135, aka SALPR (somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor). In that report, we first demonstrated that an insulin-like peptide binds to and activates a type I GPCR with high affinity with a Kd value of ∼300 pm. We have tested all known insulin/relaxin peptides, including relaxin-3, relaxin, insulin, INSL3, INSL4, INSL5, and INSL6, and found that relaxin-3 is the only ligand capable of binding to and activating GPCR135. Although GPCR135 and LGR7 have a common ligand, the two receptors have different functions. Whereas LGR7 stimulates adenylate cyclase, upon activation by relaxin-3, GPCR135 inhibits adenylate cyclase. Although LGR7 is expressed in the brain, it is predominantly expressed in the reproductive tissues, e.g. uterus, which is consistent with its role as a receptor for the smooth muscle relaxing effect of relaxin. GPCR135 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the brain with particularly strong expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the supraoptic nucleus. The relaxin-3 mRNA is also predominantly expressed in the brain in discrete and limited areas, namely the lateral periaqueductal gray, nucleus incertus, and central gray regions in the brainstem. These brainstem nuclei are known to have projections to the hypothalamus (11.Goto M. Swanson L.W. Canteras N.S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 438: 86-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) where GPCR135 is expressed. With the predominant expression of both relaxin-3 and GPCR135 in the brain coupled with the high affinity interaction of the ligand/receptor pair, we believe that relaxin-3 is the endogenous ligand for GPCR135. In this current report, we demonstrated that GPCR142, an orphan GPCR that shares high homology with GPCR135, also selectively responds to relaxin-3. Because GPCR142 has a much broader range of tissue expression in the peripheral tissues, we hypothesize that GPCR142 may have a distinct physiological role from that of GPCR135. Reagents—Human insulin, IGF1, and IGF2 were purchased from Sigma. Human INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, oxidized relaxin-3 A-chain and B-chain peptides were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Porcine relaxin was purchased from National Hormone & Peptide Program (Torrance, CA). All other peptides were produced recombinantly. Molecular Cloning of GPCR142—Human GPCR142 sequence was identified from the human genome (GenBank™ accession number AL355388) based on its homology to GPCR135. The complete coding region of human GPCR142 was PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using two primers (forward primer: 5′-ACTGGAATTCGCCACCATGCCCACACTCAATACTTCTGCC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-ACTGACGCGGCCGCTCACCCGGGTGTCCCTCTGTCCAGGT-3′). The PCR were performed at 94 °C for 40 s, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 3 min for 35 cycles. The PCR products were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) and the insert region was sequenced to confirm the sequence identity. Expression, Purification, and Iodination of Human Relaxin-3—Human recombinant relaxin-3 was expressed in mammalian cells and purified as described in our accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The purified relaxin-3 was labeled using chloramine T in the presence of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Radioligand Receptor Binding Assays—Cell membranes from COS-7 cells transiently expressing GPCR142 were incubated with 125I-relaxin-3 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of different competitors in 96-well plates at a final volume of 200 μl in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin). The binding mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then filtered through 96-well GFC plates (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) and washed with ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Fifty microliters of Microscint-40 was added to each well and the plates were counted in a Topcount NTX (Packard). The radioligand binding results were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM software. GTPγS Binding Assays—The GPCR142 expression vector described above was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and the cell membranes were prepared by homogenizing the cells in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C, 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 4 °C, 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in GTPγS binding buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2,10 μm GDP, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl using a Polytron tissue homogenizer. Protease inhibitors were added to the buffer at concentrations of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstain A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell membranes and different concentrations of ligands were added to 96-well plates and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. 35S-GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then added to each well at a final concentration of 200 pm in a final volume of 200 μl. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h, filtered though a 96-well GFC filter plate (Packard), and washed with cold washing buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2. 50 μl of Microscint-40 (Packard) was added to each well and the plate was counted in Top-Count NTX. Intracellular cAMP Accumulation and Measurement—SK-N-MC cells stably expressing GPCR142 were established by transfection of GPCR142 expressing plasmids into SK-N-MC cells harboring a β-galactosidase gene under control of multiple cAMP responsive elements. The stable transfectants were selected by culturing the transfected cells under G418 selection (400 mg/liter). The receptor expressing cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a cell density of 30,000 cells/well. 24 h later, cells were stimulated with forskolin or different peptides. The intracellular cAMP accumulation was measured either using a cAMP Flash Plate method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer or by assaying the β-galactosidase activity in the cells, which represents the cAMP concentration in the cells (12.Liu C. Ma X.J. Jiang X. Wilson S.J. Hofstra C.L. Blevitt J. Pyati J. Li X. Chai W. Carruthers N. Lovenberg T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Mobilization Assays—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with GPCR135, GPCR142, or co-transfected with Gqi5 (13.Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) or Gα16 (14.Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) expressing plasmids using LipofectAMINE. Two days after transfection, cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm EDTA. The detached cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (without phenol red, Invitrogen) and seeded in black poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a cell density of 50,000 cells/well. Calcium dye, Fluo-3 (AM) (TEFLABS, Austin, TX) was loaded into the cells at a final concentration of 4 μm and ligand-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization was monitored using FLIPR (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Detection of GPCR142 mRNA Expression in Different Human Tissues—Forward primer: 5′-TTCACTGGCCCTTCGGAGGTGCCCT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CAGAGAGTGACCACATGGTTGGGAA-3′ for GPCR142 designed according to the human GPCR142 coding region were used to PCR amplify human cDNAs from different tissues (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). In a parallel experiment, human β-actin primers with forward primer (5′-ATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGGGCCGGACTC-3′) were used to amplify the human β-actin mRNA as the internal control. The PCR were performed at 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. The PCR products were run in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV irradiation. Identification and Sequence Analysis of GPCR142—GPCR135, which we recently identified as a receptor for relaxin-3, was used as a query sequence to search the human genome using the NCBI Blast search program. We found that there exists a putative orphan GPCR, designated as GPCR142, which shares the highest overall sequence identity (43%) to GPCR135 among all GPCRs. Within the transmembrane domain regions the two receptors share greater than 50% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). We have cloned the complete coding region of human GPCR142 from the human genomic DNA using PCR amplification. The DNA sequence of the cloned DNA confirmed the putative open reading frame of GPCR142. The complete coding region of human GPCR142 has been deposited in GenBank™ (GenBank™ accession number AY394502). A recent search of GenBank™ indicates that our GPCR142 sequence is identical to an orphan GPCR in the NCBI patent data base (GenBank™ accession number AX148192) and is nearly identical to another GenBank™ submission (GenBank™ accession number AY288415) except for a single base difference. The close homology of GPCR142 to GPCR135 suggested that GPCR142 may be another receptor for relaxin-3 or a related family member. Characterization of GPCR142 Using Radioligand Binding Assays—Using 125I-relaxin-3 and cell membranes from COS-7 transiently expressing GPCR142, we performed saturation binding and competition binding assays. Our results demonstrated that 125I-relaxin-3 specifically binds to GPCR142 expressing cell membranes. Control cell membranes showed no specific binding (Fig. 2A). In a saturation isotherm experiment, 125I-relaxin-3 binds GPCR142 in a saturable monophasic manner with a Kd value of 1.9 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 2B). In competition binding assays, the binding of 125I-relaxin-3 to GPCR142 is only displaced by unlabeled relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 B-chain (Fig. 2C) but not by any other insulin/relaxin family members including relaxin, INSL3, INSL4 (15.Koman A.

Lofton-Day C.E. Adams R.L. Jelmberg A.C. Whitmore T.E. Schrader S. Griswold M.D. Jaspers S.R. Biol.

The Ki values for relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 B-chain in the competition binding assays were 1.2 ± 0.15 and 85 ± 15 nm, respectively. Functional Characterization of GPCR142 by GTPγS Binding and cAMP Accumulation Inhibition Assays—In the accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we have shown that relaxin-3-stimulated GTPγS binding and inhibits cAMP accumulation in GPCR135 overexpressing cells. We performed similar assays to characterize GPCR142. Our results showed that in GTPγS binding assays, relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 B-chain stimulated 35S-GTPγS incorporation in GPCR142 expressing cell membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. None of the other insulin/relaxin family members stimulated significant 35S-GTPγS incorporation in GPCR142 expressing cell membranes. Control cell membranes with no GPCR142 expression did not respond to relaxin-3 stimulation (data not shown). The EC50 value observed in the GTPγS assays was 0.93 ± 0.12 nm for relaxin-3 (Fig. 3). Relaxin-3 B-chain was a less potent full agonist with an EC50 value of ∼100 nm. We further characterized GPCR142 to see if it is coupled to cAMP inhibition. We used SK-N-MC cells harboring a β-galactosidase gene under control of the cAMP responsive element (CRE) as the host cells (SK-N-MC/β-galactosidase). Our results showed that relaxin-3 dose dependently inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in GPCR142 overexpressing cells with an EC50 value of 1.1 ± 0.2 nm. Relaxin-3 B-chain shows weaker activity with an EC50 value of 88 ± 18 nm (Fig. 4). In a parallel experiment, the same cells were assayed for β-galactosidase expression, which represents the intracellular cAMP concentration, in response to the stimulation of forskolin and relaxin-3-related peptides. Our results showed that relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 B-chain dose dependently inhibit forskolin-stimulated β-galactosidase expression in GPCR142 expressing SK-N-MC/β-galactosidase cells with EC50 values of 0.85 ± 0.09 and 87 ± 10 nm, respectively. SK-N-MC/β-galactosidase without GPCR142 expression did not respond to relaxin-3 and relaxin-B-chain stimulation in both assay systems (data not shown). Our results strongly suggest that GPCR142 is coupled to Gi/o proteins, like GPCR135.Fig. 4A, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by relaxin-3. Cells stably expressing GPCR142 were established in SK-N-MC cells. Different peptides with various concentrations were added to the cell cultures. Forskolin was then added to all samples at a final concentration of 5 μm. Forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was measured using cAMP Flash Plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of GPCR142 by Ca2+ Mobilization Assays—Gqi5 has been reported to be able to shift the signal transduction of GPCRs from cAMP inhibition to calcium mobilization (13.Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In the accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we showed that relaxin-3-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells that co-expressed GPCR135 and Gqi5. However, when we performed similar experiments with GPCR142, no relaxin-3-stimulated Ca2+ signaling was observed in HEK293 cells co-expressing GPCR142 and Gqi5 (data not shown). Gα16 (14.Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) has been reported to be able to couple with many GPCRs that are not normally linked to Ca2+ signaling and shift their signal transduction into Ca2+ signaling (17.Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). When GPCR142 was co-expressed with Gα16 in HEK293 cells, relaxin-3 stimulated a strong Ca2+ signal in the transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 value of relaxin-3 to GPCR142 observed in the Ca2+ mobilization assays is ∼50 nm (Fig. 5). Relaxin-3 also stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells co-expressing GPCR135 and Gα16 with an EC50 value ∼5 nm. HEK293 cells transfected by Gα16 alone did not respond to relaxin-3 stimulation. GPCR142 mRNA Tissue Expression Profile—Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, we studied GPCR142 mRNA expression in different human tissues. Our results showed that the GPCR142 mRNA expression pattern is very different from that of GPCR135. In the accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we have shown that the GPCR135 mRNA is only found in brain, testis, thymus, and adrenal gland. GPCR142 mRNA is found in a broader range of tissues including brain, kidney, testis, thymus, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, and colon (Fig. 6). Relaxin-3, a member of insulin superfamily, has been shown to be a ligand for LGR7. In our accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we have shown that relaxin-3 is also a ligand for GPCR135 (aka somatostatin- and angiotensin-like peptide receptor). In fact it can be argued that relaxin-3 is the true ligand for GPCR135 because LGR7 expression is more consistent with its role as a relaxin receptor. The significant homology of GPCR142 and GPCR135 led us to hypothesize that GPCR142 may also be a receptor for relaxin-3. We characterized GPCR142 by radioligand binding, GTPγS binding, cAMP accumulation, and Ca2+ mobilization assays. Our results indicate that relaxin-3 is a high affinity ligand for GPCR142 and we conclude that GPCR142 is an additional receptor for relaxin-3. Pharmacologically, GPCR142 behaves similarly to GPCR135 in the majority of assays tested. In the radioligand binding assays, relaxin-3 binds GPCR142 with high affinity. In cAMP accumulation assays performed in SK-N-MC/CRE-β-galactosidase cells, relaxin-3 inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, suggesting that GPCR142 is linked to Gi/o proteins. The EC50 values derived from cAMP accumulation and GTPγS binding assays agree with the Kd and Ki values derived from the bindings assays, which range from 1 to 2 nm. Overall, compared with GPCR135, GPCR142 has a slightly lower affinity for relaxin-3. In our accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we showed that relaxin-3 binds GPCR135 with high affinity with a Kd value of ∼300 pm. In the functional assays, relaxin-3 also showed high potency with EC50 values ranging from 200 to 300 pm for activation of GPCR135. In our accompanying article (23.Liu C. Eriste E. Sutton S. Chen J. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50754-50764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we have shown that Gqi5 is capable of shifting the signal transduction of GPCR135 into Ca2+ mobilization. One significant difference between GPCR142 and GPCR135 is that relaxin-3 does not stimulate any detectable Ca2+ signal in HEK293 cells co-expressing GPCR142 and Gqi5 (data not shown). One reason could be that Gqi5, an artificial chimeric G-protein, does not couple to all Gi-linked GPCRs. We have observed a similar phenomenon when we studied GPR7 and GPR8 (18.Shimomura Y. Harada M. Goto M. Sugo T. Matsumoto Y. Abe M. Watanabe T. Asami T. Kitada C. Mori M. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Biol.

Whereas neuropeptide W stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in HEK293 cells co-expressing GPR7 and Gqi5, it did not do the same for cells co-expressing GPR8 and Gqi5. 2C. Liu, J. Chen, S. Sutton, B. Roland, C. Kuei, N. Farmer, R. Sillard, and T. W. Lovenberg, unpublished data. Gα16 seems to be capable of coupling with both GPCR142 and GPCR135 and shifting their signal transduction into Ca2+ signaling. However, relaxin-3 showed significantly lower potency in Ca2+ assays compared with those derived from other assays for both GPCR142 and GPCR135. We have observed a similar phenomenon for a few other Gi-linked receptors (20.Liu C. Wilson S. Kuei C. Lovenberg T.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Chen J. Liu C. Lovenberg T.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 467: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and we hypothesize that the difference could be because of either the non-natural receptor/G-protein coupling or because of the pre-equilibrium nature of the Ca2+ mobilization assays. Another marked difference between GPCR142 and GPCR135 is their mRNA expression patterns. Whereas GPCR135 mRNA is expressed in restricted tissues with the predominant expression in the brain (22.Matsumoto M. Kamohara M. Sugimoto T. Hidaka K. Takasaki J. Saito T. Okada M. Yamaguchi T. Furuichi K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), GPCR142 mRNA is expressed in a broader range of peripheral tissues, suggesting that GPCR142 may have a different physiological role from that of GPCR135. Because relaxin-3 is primarily expressed in the brain, the relative abundant expression of GPCR142 in the peripheral tissues also suggests the possible existence of an additional ligand (other than relaxin-3) expressed in peripheral tissues. Future studies to look for additional insulin/relaxin-related peptide will help find whether there is another ligand for GPCR142. In addition, knowing that GPCR142 belongs to the type I GPCR family similar to somatostatin and angiotensin receptors, it is also possible that GPCR142 is activated by a different ligand, for example, a peptide that is not in the insulin/relaxin family. We have searched the rat and mouse genome with human GPCR135 and GPCR142 sequences as the queries. We have found the orthologues for GPCR135 with open reading frames in both rat and mouse genomes. For GPCR142, an open reading frame is found only in the mouse genome. A similar open reading frame is not found in the rat. Although there is a highly related DNA sequence in the rat genome, that sequence does not have an open reading frame to encode a functional receptor for GPCR142. Further studies of GPCR142 in different species may help to evaluate the functional significance of GPCR142 in mammalian physiology."

Hence, copper levels may influence the infectivity of the scrapie form of prion protein (PrPSc). To determine the feasibility of copper-targeted therapy for prion disease, we treated mice with a copper chelator, d-(–)-penicillamine (d-PEN), starting immediately following intraperitoneal scrapie inoculation. d-PEN delayed the onset of prion disease in the mice by about 11 days (p = 0.002), and reduced copper levels in brain by 29% (p < 0.01) and in blood by 22% (p = 0.03) compared with control animals. Levels of other metals were not significantly altered in the blood or brain. Modest correlation was observed between incubation period and levels of copper in brain (p = 0.08) or blood (p = 0.04), indicating that copper levels are only one of many factors that influence the rate of progression of prion disease.

Transition metal ions, such as copper, manganese, iron, and zinc, are thought to be involved in the pathological events of various neurodegenerative diseases (1Bush A.I. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Although these ions are unlikely to have a causative effect, disease-induced alterations in their homeostasis may contribute to the progression of the pathology, possibly by altering the conformation of proteins and/or by enhancing their aggregation. Additionally, these ions can promote oxidation and generation of free radicals. Although copper has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prion disease, it is unclear if this ion may promote or attenuate disease progression. Prior to the discovery of the prion protein, some similarities were observed in the neuropathology associated with the toxicity of the copper chelator cuprizone and the neuropathology of scrapie (2Kimberlin R.H. Millson G.C. Bountiff L. Collis S.C. J. Comp. Pathol. 1974; 84: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Pattison I.H. Jebbett J.N. Nature. 1971; 230: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, copper supplementation does not prevent the development of cuprizone-induced spongy degeneration, indicating that these toxic effects may not be mediated by copper chelation. Conversely, one of Creutzfeldt's original patients later turned out to have had Wilson's disease (4Brown D.R. Biochem. Soc.

To the best of our knowledge, only one study has determined whether there is an association between copper and prion infectivity (18McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Those findings indicate that copper enhances reversibility of scrapie inactivation in vitro by facilitating refolding of denatured PrPSc into a protease-resistant and infectious form. Hence, increased copper may enhance the infectivity of PrPSc. To determine the feasibility of copper-targeted therapy for prion disease, we treated mice with a copper chelator, d-penicillamine (d-PEN). This compound is a derivative of penicillin and is the chelator most commonly used to treat Wilson's disease. Additional uses are in treating cystinuria, heavy metal poisoning, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain collagen disorders. We report here that d-PEN delays the onset of prion disease in mice, indicating that copper promotes prionosis. Animals—Two- to three-month-old CD-1 mice received 100 mg/kg of d-PEN (Sigma) dissolved in distilled water and delivered as a 100-μl intraperitoneal dose. The solution was prepared immediately before use to avoid disulphide formation. Control mice received water injections. The dose of d-PEN chosen for this experiment was based on a previous report showing that mice force-fed with 100 mg/kg body weight of d-PEN had a delay in the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (19Hottinger A.F. Fine E.G. Gurney M.E. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mice fed 0.5 g of d-PEN per kg of diet for up to 48 weeks have been reported not to have any abnormalities (20Takeda T. Yao C.S. Irino M. Tashiro S.I. Yasuhira K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1980; 55: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A mouse consumes on average around 150 g of chow per month, which corresponds to a dosage of about 75 mg of drug ingested per month. The injected dose used in the current study is equivalent to 43 mg of d-PEN per month for a mouse weighing 20 g. The mice had access to food and water ad libitum and were fed a standard diet, Purina No. 5015. The first injection was delivered immediately following scrapie inoculation, and subsequent injections were performed daily, 5 days a week. The mice (n = 10 per group) were inoculated intraperitoneally with a brain homogenate of the mouse-adapted scrapie strain 139A at a 10-fold and a 1000-fold dilution. The mice were monitored for clinical signs of scrapie, starting a few weeks before the expected onset of symptoms. The activity level and competency of the mice were assessed on an apparatus that contained a series of parallel bars (3 mm in diameter) placed 7 mm apart, as per an established protocol (21Carp R.I.

Mice with signs of prion disease have reduced activity and/or diminished ability to traverse the bars. The mice were euthanized when they rated as positive 3 weeks in a row by two observers blinded to the experimental status of the animals. This clinical end point is known to be associated with extensive scrapie pathology in the central nervous system of these mice (21Carp R.I. Callahan S.M. Sersen E.A. Moretz R.C.

Histology—At the clinical end point, the brains were removed from mice deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. The right hemisphere was immersion-fixed overnight in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde solution, and the left hemisphere was snap-frozen for measurements of copper levels. The periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde solution-fixed brain hemisphere was transferred to 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 20% glycerol and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 4 °C until sectioned. Coronal sections of 40 μm were cut, and a series of sections at 0.2-mm intervals were stained with cresyl violet and anti-PrP 78295 (courtesy of R. Kascsak, Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY) (25Kascsak R.J. Fersko R. Pulgiano D. Rubenstein R. Carp R.I. Immunol. Invest. 1997; 26: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to confirm the diagnosis of prion disease. Metal Analysis—Trace element content of brain was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as reported previously (26Thackray A.M. Knight R. Haswell S.J. Bujdoso R. Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, all labware used was acid-leached overnight under pressure to reduce metal contaminants. Brain hemispheres were hydrolyzed in nitric acid (1 ml of SpA grade per 100-μl sample) at room temperature overnight. The samples were then sealed, pressurized to 120 p.s.i., and heated to at least 140 °C for 10 min. The hydrolyzed samples were diluted to 4% nitric acid before analyzing for metal contents. Standards were prepared from certified single elements (1000-ppm solutions). To further monitor the analysis, a 10-ppb standard solution was analyzed after each set of samples. Each sample was analyzed at least three times, and the instrument was washed with 2% nitric acid for 110 s between samples. In Vitro Assay—Brains from mice at the terminal stage of infection with scrapie strain 139A were homogenized (10% w/v, pH 7.4) in various buffers containing 0.3 mm sucrose, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Brains from non-infected mice were used as controls. The buffers were: 1) phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, PBS tablets, Sigma); 2) 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5); and 3) 25 mmN-ethylmorpholine, 100 mm potassium chloride (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the homogenate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g, and the supernatant was then incubated with 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mm CuCl2 or CuSO4 and different amounts (0, 25, 50, and 100 mm) of d-PEN at 37 °C, for 72 h. In pilot studies, incubation with copper sulfate or copper chloride resulted in a similar dose-dependent (0.1–10 mm) enhanced resistance of the prion protein to proteinase K digestion, and copper chloride was used in all subsequent incubations. Initial studies also indicated that incubation of the samples for 72 h in PBS resulted in a partial precipitation of the brain supernatant. No biological precipitate formed in the N-ethylmorpholine or Tris buffer, but at high concentrations copper was only partially soluble in N-ethylmorpholine or PBS. Therefore, Tris buffer was used for all subsequent incubations, and the data presented are from samples incubated in that buffer. One-half of each reaction mixture was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and digested with 25 μg/ml proteinase K (PK; Sigma) at 37 °C, for 30 min. Brain supernatant incubated with 100 mm d-PEN as well as samples without copper and d-PEN were included as controls. Following the incubation, Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and then were electrophoresed on a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. Western blots were performed with the 8H4 antibody (1:10,000 dilution; courtesy of Man-Sun Sy, Case Western Reserve University) that recognizes residues 175–185 of the prion protein (24Sigurdsson E.M.

For confirmation, blots were incubated with 8F9 antibody, which binds to PrP residues 205–231 (24Sigurdsson E.M. Sy M.S. Li R. Scholtzova H. Kascsak R.J. Kascsak R. Carp R. Meeker H.C. Frangione B.

The secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution) was peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and the immunoreactive material was visualized with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed by measuring the pixel density of a PK-resistant band (∼25 kDa) from individual lanes (SigmaGel, Jandel Scientific), compared with the density of the PK-resistant band from the same blot of a control PrPSc brain incubated without copper (given a value of 100). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with two-way (treatment and dilution effect; Figs. 1 and 2) or one way (in vitro assay; Fig. 3) analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Duncan's post hoc test (Statistica software, Version 6.1, StatSoft Inc.). Correlation was determined by calculating the Pearson r correlation coefficient (Statistica software).Fig. 2Selective chelator-mediated reduction in copper levels in brain and blood.d-PEN reduced brain copper levels (p < 0.01 by ANOVA) by 26% (10-fold dilution; p = 0.04, by Duncan's post hoc test) and 32% (1000-fold dilution; p = 0.02, by Duncan's post hoc test) in the treated mice compared with control animals. Copper levels in blood were decreased in the treated mice (p = 0.03) by 9% (10-fold dilution) and 35% (1000-fold dilution: p = 0.01), respectively.

Brains from terminally ill scrapie-infected mice were homogenized in Tris buffer, and the samples were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C prior to electrophoresis. A shows that copper chloride dose-dependently promotes PK resistance of the prion protein. Equivalent amounts of scrapie brain homogenate, without PK digesting in lanes 1–5 and following PK digestion in lanes 6–9, was electrophoresed and transferred, followed by immunoprobing with monoclonal 8H4 antibody (anti-PrP residues 175–185). The – and + symbols above the lanes indicates whether PK digestion was not done or done, respectively. Also above each lane, it is indicated whether the samples were incubated with copper chloride and its concentration (mm). Lane 1 shows scrapie brain, with no PK digestion and no copper added (VEH, vehicle). Lanes 2–5 show scrapie brain incubated with increasing copper content (0.1–10 mm) without PK digestion. The bands in lanes 1–5 represent PrPC and PrPSc, with the band intensity being approximately the same in each sample as expected. Lanes 6–9 are of scrapie brain homogenates following incubation with copper at difference concentrations and PK digestion. The bands shown in lanes 6–9 are of PrPSc and are more intense in the samples incubated with higher concentrations of copper, prior to PK digestion. B, quantitation of the copper induced PK resistance of the prion protein. The pixel density of a PK-resistant band (25 kDa) was measured and normalized against the band observed following digestion of PrPSc-rich brain homogenate incubated without copper (rated as 100, not shown). Each bar depicts the mean band density + S.E. of four samples. ANOVA revealed significant group differences in the intensity of the PK resistant band (p = 0.018, n = 4 per group). The groups that received 5 and 10 mm copper chloride differed significantly from the 0.1 mm group (Duncan's post hoc test, p = 0.02 and 0.008, respectively). C, this effect is blocked by d-PEN, which by itself has no effect on PK-mediated protein degradation. Quantitation was performed in the same as manner as in B. d-PEN by itself had no effect on PK resistance, but dose-dependently reversed copper induced PK resistance of the prion protein. Each bar depicts the mean band density + S.E. of three samples. ANOVA revealed significant group differences (p = 0.0017, n = 3 per group) in the intensity of the PK-resistant band. The highest intensity was observed in the group that received 10 mm copper chloride compared with all the other groups (Duncan's post hoc test, p = 0.02–0.0008).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) d-PEN delayed the onset of prion disease in the mice (Fig. 1). Two-way ANOVA revealed a treatment effect (p = 0.002) and a dilution effect (p < 0.001) but no significant interaction between the two factors. Duncan's post hoc analysis showed a significant delay in disease onset in the group receiving the 1000-fold dilution of the brain homogenate (d-PEN = 179 ± 3 days, vehicle = 165 ± 4, p = 0.006) and a trend for a delay within the group receiving the 10-fold dilution (d-PEN = 153 ± 2 days, vehicle = 146 ± 3, p = 0.1). As expected, d-PEN reduced brain copper levels (p < 0.01; two-way ANOVA) by 26% (10-fold dilution; Duncan's post hoc test: p = 0.04, one-tailed) and 32% (1000-fold dilution; p = 0.02, one-tailed) in the treated mice compared with control animals (Fig. 2). Brain levels of manganese, iron, zinc, nickel, selenium, and molybdenum were not altered (data not shown). The copper levels we report in untreated mice are similar to prior studies (26Thackray A.M. Knight R. Haswell S.J. Bujdoso R. Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Blood levels of metals revealed a similar specificity in the copper-chelating effect of d-PEN at this dose. Copper levels were decreased in the treated mice (p = 0.03; two-way ANOVA) by 9% (10-fold dilution) and 35% (1000-fold dilution; Duncan's post hoc test: p = 0.01, one-tailed), but the two d-PEN-treated groups did not differ significantly from each other. The levels of manganese, iron, zinc, nickel, selenium, and molybdenum in the blood were not altered (data not shown). To further support the notion that the therapeutic effect of d-PEN was mediated through its copper chelating properties, brain homogenates from terminally ill 139A-infected mice were incubated with copper with or without d-PEN. Incubation with copper chloride resulted in a dose-dependent (0.1–10 mm) enhanced resistance of the prion protein to proteinase K digestion (p = 0.018; Fig. 3, A and B). The increased PK resistance associated with the presence of copper was counteracted in a dose-dependent manner by co-incubation with d-PEN (p = 0.0017; Fig. 3C). A similar but less pronounced effect of copper-mediated enhancement in PK resistance of PrP, and its reversal by d-PEN was observed in control samples, in which the brain homogenate was from non-infected mice (data not shown), suggesting that copper may affect the conformation of both PrPC and PrPSc. Overall, these findings support the proposed in vivo effect of d-PEN in delaying the onset of prion disease in the animals. To clarify the involvement of copper in the development of clinical symptoms of prion disease, we injected mice with the copper chelator d-PEN using a dose (100 mg/kg body weight) that has been shown to be without toxic effects in mice (20Takeda T. Yao C.S. Irino M. Tashiro S.I. Yasuhira K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1980; 55: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although d-PEN may chelate other ions at high doses, oral administration of a dose about 16-fold higher than we used in our study has been shown not to chelate other metals (30Irino M. Yasuhira K. Takeda T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1982; 63: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our measurements of brain and plasma levels of copper, and other metal ions support the selectivity of d-PEN for chelating copper ions at the dose we injected. The mice in our study that received the chelator developed clinical symptoms significantly later than the control group indicating that lower copper levels may delay disease progression. A past in vitro study has shown that copper may enhance the refold of partially denatured PrPSc (18McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while another study has documented that the protease cleavage pattern of PrPSc can be altered by copper and zinc ions as well as by metal chelators (31Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), suggesting that metal ions may be involved in maintaining certain conformations of the prion protein and thereby facilitate its conversion to the PrPSc form. Enhanced clearance of copper may, therefore, reduce PrPSc formation and/or its stability. The therapeutic effect of the chelator may also be indirect because copper has immunomodulatory effect (32Percival S.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 1064S-1068SCrossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and the immune system is involved in propagation of prionosis (33Weissmann C. Raeber A.J. Montrasio F. Hegyi I. Frigg R. Klein M.A. Aguzzi A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The relatively modest correlation between incubation period and copper levels in brain (p = 0.08) and blood (p = 0.04) suggests that the progression of prion disease is influenced by multiple factors, only one of which may be copper levels. Prior studies indicate that copper levels are reduced by up to 50% in the brains of individuals that succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease (34Wong B.S. Brown D.R. Pan T. Whiteman M. Liu T. Bu X. Li R. Gambetti P. Olesik J. Rubenstein R. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have observed a similar reduction in scrapie-infected mice, in which brain copper levels are maximally reduced at the onset of clinical symptoms, while the amount of copper is increased in the liver (26Thackray A.M. Knight R. Haswell S.J. Bujdoso R. Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Following clinical symptoms, blood copper levels are slightly elevated in these mice. Copper measurements in the previous studies are in a similar range our values. Also, prion knock-out mice have been shown to have lower copper levels but unchanged amounts of iron and zinc in synaptosomes (9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although brain copper content has also been reported not to be affected by prion expression levels (35Waggoner D.J. Drisaldi B.

The findings of lower brain copper levels in prion-infected patients and animals do not provide information on the type of role copper has on prion infectivity. Since copper has been shown to bind with higher avidity to PrPC than to the scrapie form, PrPSc (27Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Brown D.R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14595-14598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), decreased copper levels observed in the brains of infected patients and animals may reflect enhanced clearance of unbound central nervous system copper ions. Our in vitro observation that copper enhances PK resistance of both PrPSc and PrPC and that this effect can be reversed by d-PEN support a direct role of copper on the conformational state of PrP. Measurements of PrPSc and copper levels need to be performed over the whole course of the disease to thoroughly characterize the role of copper in progression of prion disease. Overall, our findings suggest that chelator-based therapy can prolong the incubation phase of prion disease. Future studies will determine whether higher doses with acceptable side effects may prevent disease onset, and the usefulness of this approach in multitargeted combinational therapy. Our studies highlight the importance of PrP/copper interactions for prion infectivity. We thank Robert Knight for assistance with metal analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2019865493,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a key element of inflammatory pain. It induces hyperalgesia by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding receptors, ion channels, and neuropeptides. Acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3), a depolarizing sodium channel gated by protons during tissue acidosis, is specifically expressed in sensory neurons. It has been associated to cardiac ischemic and inflammatory pains. We previously showed that low endogenous NGF was responsible for ASIC3 basal expression and high NGF during inflammation increased ASIC3 expression parallely to the development of neuron hyperexcitability associated with hyperalgesia. NGF is known to activate numerous signaling pathways through trkA and p75 receptors. We now show that (i). NGF controls ASIC3 basal expression through constitutive activation of a trkA/phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway, (ii). high inflammatory-like NGF induces ASIC3 overexpression through a trkA/JNK/p38MAPK pathway and a p75-dependent mechanism as a transcriptional switch, and (iii). NGF acts through AP1 response elements in ASIC3 encoding gene promoter. These new data indicate potential targets that could be used to develop new treatments against inflammatory pain."

https://openalex.org/W2018498733,"The airways of mice deficient in the cAMP phosphodiesterase PDE4D gene are refractory to muscarinic cholinergic stimulation. This study was undertaken to determine whether altered smooth muscle contractility causes the PDE4D-/- phenotype. A major disruption in contractility was observed in isolated PDE4D-/- tracheas, with a 60% reduction in maximal tension and a fivefold decrease in sensitivity to muscarinic cholinergic agonists. Conversely, responses to KCl or arginine vasopressin were unaffected. PDE4D is the predominant PDE4 form in tracheal extracts and PDE4D mRNA is expressed in smooth muscle where muscarinic binding sites are most abundant. Cyclic AMP accumulation in response to acute G(s)alpha-coupled receptor stimulation was increased up to fourfold in the airway of PDE4D-/- mice when compared with wild-type. This increase in cAMP was associated with an increased sensitivity to PGE2-induced relaxation of the PDE4D-/-tracheas. Furthermore, a blockade of prostanoid accumulation in PDE4D-/- tracheas restored the response to muscarinic cholinergic stimulation in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that PDE4D plays a key role in balancing relaxant and contracting cues in airway smooth muscle, suggesting that natural mutations in the PDE4D gene have profound effects on airway tone."
https://openalex.org/W1999869114,"Huntington's disease features the loss of striatal neurons that stems from a disease process that is initiated by mutant huntingtin. Early events in the disease cascade, which predate overt pathology in Hdh CAG knock-in mouse striatum, implicate enhanced N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, with excitotoxity caused by aberrant Ca2+ influx. Here we demonstrate in precise genetic Huntington's disease mouse and striatal cell models that these early phenotypes are associated with activation of the Akt pro-survival signaling pathway. Elevated levels of activated Ser(P)473-Akt are detected in extracts of HdhQ111/Q111 striatum and cultured mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells, compared with their wild type counterparts. Akt activation in mutant striatal cells is associated with increased Akt signaling via phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9. Consequent decreased turnover of transcription co-factor β-catenin leads to increased levels of β-catenin target gene cyclin D1. Akt activation is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent, as demonstrated by increased levels of Ser(P)241-PDK1 kinase and decreased Ser(P)380-PTEN phosphatase. Moreover, Akt activation can be normally stimulated by treatment with insulin growth factor-1 and blocked by treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. However, in contrast to wild type cells, Akt activation in mutant striatal cells can be blocked by the addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Akt activation in mutant striatal cells is Ca2+-dependent, because treatment with EGTA reduces levels of Ser(P)473-Akt. Thus, consistent with excitotoxicity early in the disease process, activation of the Akt pro-survival pathway in mutant knock-in striatal cells predates overt pathology and reflects mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced NMDA receptor signaling.

DiFiglia M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). HD is initiated by an unstable CAG repeat that lengthens a polyglutamine tract in huntingtin above ∼37 residues, such that disease severity is increased with increased polyglutamine length (2.The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6990) Google Scholar). Disease symptoms typically manifest in mid-life caused by mutant huntingtin with about 50 glutamines or in juvenile years caused by mutant huntingtin with more than ∼55 glutamines. However, although clinical symptoms manifest after decades, genotype-phenotype studies with neuropathologically graded HD postmortem brain samples strongly suggest that the disease process is likely to begin at birth (3.Penney Jr., J.B.

Given the evidence in support of subacute “toxicity,” we have now examined the hypothesis that mutant striatal neuronal cells may activate compensatory pro-survival pathways, countering potentially toxic metabolic changes that emanate from the expression of mutant huntingtin. Specifically, we have investigated whether serine/threonine protein kinase B, also known as Akt, which has been implicated in neuronal cell survival (16.Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), may be activated in mutant HdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells. Akt can be activated through the interaction of a trophic factor, such as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), with its cognate receptor. However, in neuronal cells Akt can also be activated via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling, because rapid glutamate-induced Ca2+- and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 can be blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (17.Sutton G. Chandler L.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akt signaling has been implicated in HD by findings in acute cell models that achieve pathology by overexpression of mutant huntingtin fragment. In these systems, IGF-1 treatment ameliorates mutant fragment-induced toxicity, and Akt phosphorylation of mutant fragment decreases intranuclear inclusions (18.Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelieres F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Now our investigations using genetically accurate HD mouse and striatal cell models reveals enhanced Ca2+- and PI 3-kinase-dependent Akt signaling that appears to be due to enhanced NMDA receptor activation. Thus, modulation of the Akt pathway may provide a means to counter the early excitotoxic effects of mutant huntingtin that predate overt neuronal cell pathology.

Striatum was dissected from genotyped 8-month-old homozygous mutant HdhQ111/Q111 and wild type HdhQ7/Q7 littermate offspring of matings between male and female HdhQ111/Q7 heterozygotes. Conditionally immortalized wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 striatal neuronal progenitor cells expressing endogenous normal huntingtin and homozygous mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal neuronal progenitor cell lines expressing endogenous mutant huntingtin with 111-glutamines generated from HdhQ111/Q111 and wild type HdhQ7/Q7 littermate embryos have been described previously (13.Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The striatal cell lines were grown at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine, and 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen). For overexpression of Myc-GSK3β, striatal cells were transfected with pcDNA3c-MycGSK3β, or, in the control with pcDNA3 vector alone, using LipofectAMINE™ 2000, according to the protocol of the supplier (Invitrogen). The protein extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection. Immunoblot Analysis—In general, the protein extracts were prepared from striatal tissue and from cultured striatal cells by lysis on ice for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin and supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4 and 50 mm NaF). The total cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. To analyze Akt activation, striatal cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's serum-free medium 3 h before protein extracts were prepared. For treatment with drugs, striatal cells were first placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's serum-free medium for 3 h and then exposed to IGF-1 (50 ng/ml for 30 min), LY294002 (25 μm for 30 min), MK-801 (2 μm for 10 min), or EGTA (400 μm for 5 or 20 min) and analyzed by immunoblot for levels of phospho-Akt (Ser473). To analyze the expression of NMDA receptor subtypes in membrane fraction, striatal cells grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were lysed in buffer A for 10 min with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The membrane fraction was obtained by resuspending the high speed pellet in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Following determination of protein concentration, by Bio-Rad (detergent compatible) protein assay, 30 μg of total protein extract prepared as detailed above was mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer containing 10% nonfat powdered milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: phospho-Akt (Ser473) (1:1,000), phospho-PDK1 (Ser241) (1:1,000), phospho-PTEN (Ser380) (1:1,000), phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) (1:1,000), phospho-FKHR (Ser256) (1:1,000), total Akt (1:1,000), total GSK3β (1:1,000), cyclin D1 (1:100), NMDAR1 (1:1,000), NMDAR2A (1:500), or NMDAR2B (1:500). Immunoblots were rinsed three times for 10 min in TBS-T and incubated1hat room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000) antibodies. After being washed extensively for 30 min, the membranes were processed using an ECL chemiluminiscence substrate kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and exposed to autoradiographic film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the immunoreactive bands was performed by scanning and analysis using the Scion densitometry program (Scion Images for Windows-Release Beta 4.0.2). Turnover of Cytosolic β-Catenin—Wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells plated on 10-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated in growth medium containing cyclohexamide at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml and chased at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h after the addition of cyclohexamide. At each time point the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and mechanically lysed by incubation for 10 min in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mixture, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) followed by 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to provide the cytoplasmic fraction. The protein concentration of the cytoplasmic extracts was quantified by Bio-Rad (detergent compatible) protein assay, and equal amounts of protein from each lysate were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 10% nonfat milk TBS-T, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody. The immunoblot was then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by ECL reagents (New England Biolabs). Immunoprecipitation—To isolate cytosolic and nuclear fractions, wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells were incubated in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mixture, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) for 10 min and mechanically lysed by 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to isolate the cytoplasmic fraction. The washed pellet from the 2,000 × g spin (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 25% glycerol, 0.42 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with gentle rotation for up to 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected to provide the nuclear fraction. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of cytosolic or nuclear fractions (500 μg of protein) with 3 μg of anti-β-catenin antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by a 2-h incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose Cl-4B (Sigma). The beads were washed by centrifugation three times, then resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then boiled for 5 min in reducing SDS loading buffer. The immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described above. Briefly, the blots were incubated with anti-β-catenin, anti-phospho-β-catenin, anti-ubiquitin, or anti-LEF-1 antibody and detected using ECL chemiluminescent reagents. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of observations from independent experiments was determined by one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe's S post-test for comparisons between multiple groups. STHdhQ111/Q111 Striatal Cells Exhibit Enhanced Akt Activation—Akt can be activated as a direct downstream target of PI 3-kinase. Upon stimulation of PI 3-kinase, PDK1 can activate Akt by phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation of Akt kinase at Ser473 is required for its full activation (19.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated Akt activation in Hdh CAG knock-in mice by using an antibody that specifically recognizes Akt phosphorylated at Ser473. Extracts of striatum dissected from three homozygous mutant HdhQ111/Q111 and three wild type HdhQ7/Q7 littermate mice were individually analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies that detect Ser(P)473-Akt or total Akt, as shown in Fig. 1A. Quantification of band intensity revealed that the average levels of Ser(P)473-Akt in the striata of mutant mice was significantly increased by 1.8-fold (p = 0.0045), compared with levels in wild type striata. Similar results were obtained at 2 and 18 months of age (data not shown). These data indicate that enhanced Akt activation is a consequence of the disease process in vivo, in Hdh knock-in striatum. Next, Akt kinase activation was measured in extracts prepared from immortalized wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111striatal cells, a manipulable genetic HD neuronal striatal cell model. As shown in Fig. 1B, a significant ∼4-fold increase in the ratio of Ser(P)473-Akt-signal versus the total Akt-signal (p = 0.0006) was apparent in mutant cell extracts compared with wild type cell extracts. This finding, which is consistent with the in vivo results, demonstrates an increase in Akt activation in mutant striatal neuronal cells. Increased Akt Activation Is Associated with GSK3β Inactivation—To test whether increased Akt activation might be associated with altered Akt signaling in STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells, we assessed Ser(P)9-GSK3β, which is a well known downstream target of the Akt pathway that is implicated in neuronal cell survival (16.Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 by Akt inhibits GSK3β kinase activity. Immunoblot analyses of Ser(P)9-GSK3β and total GSK3β in extracts prepared from wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells are shown in Fig. 2A. Consistent with increased Akt activation, the ratio of Ser(P)9-GSK3β versus total GSK3β was increased 3-fold (p = 0.0028) in mutant cell extracts compared with wild type cell extracts. To determine whether increased levels of Ser9-GSK3β phosphorylation might be a specific consequence of enhanced Akt activation in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells, we examined the Akt-regulated phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic transcription factor FKHR at Ser256 by immunoblot analysis. In contrast to GSK3β, levels of Ser(P)256-FKHR, normalized to α-tubulin levels, were similar in mutant compared with wild type striatal extracts (Fig. 2B). Thus, increased Akt activation in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells does not appear to have consequences for a downstream target that is involved in apoptosis but instead is associated with neuronal cell pro-survival signaling via GSK3β inactivation. Increased β-Catenin Stabilization in STHdhQ111/Q111 Striatal Cells—To further study the functional significance of Akt phosphorylation in mutant striatal cells, we determined whether elevated Ser(P)9 GSK3β in STHdhQ111/Q111 might alter the levels of β-catenin, an essential transcriptional co-activator downstream of GSK3β whose turnover and translocation to the nucleus is regulated by GSK3β phosphorylation (20.Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 3020-3023Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We first tested whether the turnover of cytosolic β-catenin differs in STHdhQ111/Q111 and wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 cells. Cyclohexamide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was added to the growth medium, and cells were then harvested after 0, 0.5 1, and 2 h and processed by differential centrifugation to isolate cytosolic and nuclear protein fractions. β-Catenin levels in equal amounts of cytosolic protein fractions were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3A shows that although the half-life of the 92-kDa β-catenin-reactive band in wild type cytosolic extracts was about 30 min, the β-catenin band in STHdhQ111/Q111 cytosolic extracts remained stable over the 2-h chase period, implying decreased turnover. Because β-catenin turnover is regulated by GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation, which targets β-catenin for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway, we next assessed the levels of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated β-catenin, immunoprecipitated by anti-β-catenin antibody from wild type and mutant cytosolic extracts. Detection of immunoblots with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 3B) revealed that multiple bands of ubiquitinated β-catenin are immunoprecipitated from wild type striatal cell cytosolic extracts, whereas the β-catenin band precipitated from mutant striatal cell extracts is not detected by anti-ubiquitin reagent. Reprobing immunoblots for phospho-β-catenin using a phospho-specific anti-β-catenin antibody that detects Ser33-, Ser37-, or Thr41-β-catenin revealed phosphorylated β-catenin bands in wild type immunoprecipitates. By contrast, phospho-β-catenin was almost undetectable in anti-β-catenin immunocomplexes from mutant cytosolic extracts. To determine whether the increased β-catenin levels that are detected in STHdhQ111/Q111 cell extracts might be a direct consequence of GSK3β inactivation, mutant and wild type striatal cells were transfected with a cDNA plasmid that drives overexpression of c-Myc-tagged GSK3β (c-Myc-GSK3β). Immunoblot analysis of cytosolic protein extracts immunoprecipitated by anti-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 3C) revealed that exogenous c-Myc-GSK3β, detected using a specific anti-Myc antibody, was associated with decreased levels of cytosolic β-catenin in both wild type and mutant cell extracts, eliminating the discrepancy between the two genotypes. Thus, because c-Myc-GSK3β can appropriately regulate the turnover of β-catenin in transfected STHdhQ111/Q111 cells, increased levels of cytosolic β-catenin detected in untransfected mutant striatal cells seem likely to reflect decreased GSK3β activity. Increased Levels of Cyclin D1 in STHdhQ111/Q111 Striatal Cells—Cytosolic β-catenin can bind to the T-cell factor/LEF-1 family of transcription factors, translocating to the nucleus and regulating the expression of specific target genes. Consequently, we assessed β-catenin-LEF complexes immunoprecipitated with an anti-β-catenin antibody from nuclear extracts of wild type and mutant striatal cells. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-β-catenin and anti-LEF-1 antibodies. The results in Fig. 4A demonstrate that as expected β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts from wild type and mutant striatal cells. By contrast, a 55-kDa band of LEF-1 was immunoprecipitated from mutant nuclear extracts but was barely apparent in the immunoprecipitates from wild type nuclear extracts. Because β-catenin-LEF complexes activate cyclin D1 gene transcription, cyclin D1 protein levels were measured in striatal extracts from three wild type and three homozygous mutant mice, by immunoblot analysis with anti-cyclin D1 antibody (Fig. 4B). In equal amounts of protein extract (anti-α-tubulin load control), the intensity of the 36-kDa cyclin D1 band is, on average, increased in mutant compared with wild type extracts by ∼1.8-fold. The increase in cyclin D1 levels in mutant striatal cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of STHdhQ111/Q111 and STHdhQ7/Q7 cell extracts (Fig. 4C). In equal amounts of protein extract (anti-α-tubulin load control), cyclin D1 is increased by ∼1.9-fold in mutant, compared with wild type extracts. Thus, stabilization of β-catenin in mutant striatal cells is accompanied by increased levels of cyclin D1, indicating elevated β-catenin signaling in association with enhanced Akt activation. PI 3-Kinase Mediates Akt Activation in STHdhQ111/Q111 Striatal Cells—To explore the basis of enhanced Akt signaling in STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells, we analyzed the upstream signaling molecules that regulate Akt activation. PDK1, the Ser/Thr kinase that transduces the PI 3-kinase signal and regulates Akt phosphorylation, is activated by phosphorylation at Ser241. Phosphatase-PTEN, which blocks PI 3-kinase signaling, thereby reducing Akt activation, is activated by phosphorylation at Ser380. Ser(P)241-PDK1 and Ser(P)380-PTEN levels were assessed by immunoblot analyses of proteins extracted from wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with enhanced Akt activation, detection of immunoblots with anti-phospho-specific antibodies revealed that, compared with wild type cell extracts, the level of Ser(P)241-PDK1 is increased by 2.4-fold (p = 0.003), and the level of Ser(P)380-PTEN is decreased by 1.7-fold (p = 0.03) in mutant cell extracts. We next determined whether the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is appropriately regulated in mutant and wild type striatal cells by supplementing the growth medium with IGF-1 and then evaluating the levels of Ser(P)473-Akt in total protein extracts by probing immunoblots using the specific Ser473-Akt antibody (Fig. 5B). IGF-1 treatment increased the levels of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in both wild type and mutant cell extracts, although there was an ∼4.7-fold response in wild type cells (p = 0.005), whereas in mutant striatal cells the already high levels of Ser(P)473-Akt were only augmented by ∼1.3-fold (p = 0.0016). These results indicate that although Akt is already activated in mutant striatal cells, the pathway can be appropriately induced by IGF-1. To confirm PI 3-kinase regulation of Akt activation, wild type and mutant striatal cells were treated for 30 min with LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinases. The immunoblot results presented in Fig. 5B demonstrate that pretreatment of cells with LY294002 completely prevented Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in wild type and mutant cell extracts, whereas the total levels of Akt were not altered. Thus, as it is in wild type striatal cells, Akt activation in mutant striatal cells is appropriately regulated by PI 3-kinase. This finding implies that increased Akt activation in mutant cells may reflect enhanced upstream receptor signaling. MK-801 Blocks Akt Phosphorylation in STHdhQ111/Q111 Striatal Cells—Consequently, given evidence of excitotoxicity in HD patient cells (14.Panov A.V. Gutekunst C.A. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Burke J.R.

Genet. 2003; 12: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we tested whether increased activation of Akt in STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells might be mediated through NMDA receptor signaling. Wild type STHdhQ7/Q7 and mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells express NMDA receptor subunits, NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, and NMDAR2B, as demonstrated by immunoblot analyses of proteins extracted from cell membrane fractions (Fig. 6A). To test whether Akt activation is associated with NMDA receptor activity, wild type and mutant striatal cells were treated with MK-801, a specific NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks Ca2+ influx associated with NMDA receptor signaling. Akt activation was judged by monitoring the levels of Ser(P)473-Akt in total cell extracts as assayed by immunoblot analyses. The results presented in Fig. 6B reveal that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in STHdhQ111/Q111cell extracts was dramatically decreased (∼10-fold, p = 0.0002) by treatment with MK-801. By contrast, the same MK-801 pretreatment had no significant effect (∼1.2-fold, p = 0.1) on the levels of Ser(P)473 Akt in wild type cell extracts. These data indicate that Akt activation in mutant but not wild type cells is directly associated with stimulation of NMDA receptors. Therefore, to address whether Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor pore might be involved in Akt phosphorylation in mutant cells, EGTA (400 μm) was added to the growth medium to chelate extracellular Ca2+. Immunoblot analyses of protein extracts prepared from untreated and treated mutant cells (Fig. 6C) revealed that EGTA treatment reduced the levels of phospho-Akt by ∼3-fold (p = 0.001). These data strongly implicate Ca2+ influx via NMDA receptors in the PI 3-kinase-dependent enhanced activation of Akt signaling in STHdhQ111/Q111 cells. HD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is initiated by a novel property that is conferred on mutant huntingtin by a lengthened amino-terminal polyglutamine segment. Evidence from HD patient samples and precise genetic Hdh CAG knock-in mouse and STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal neuronal cell models has revealed abnormal biochemical phenotypes that suggest excitotoxicity and loss of neuroprotective factors that must precede later pathologic markers and even later neuronal cell death. Now our data demonstrate that mutant huntingtin leads to enhanced activation of protein kinase B/Akt signaling via GSK3β inhibition and β-catenin stabilization. These data are consistent with a pro-survival response. For example, constitutive β-catenin signaling via LEF-1 has been shown to protect against neuronal cell death induced by the toxic β-amyloid protein (21.Zhang Z. Hartmann H. Do V.M. Abramowski D. Sturchler-Pierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhanced β-catenin signaling via LEF-1 may be expected to protect mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 striatal cells from the effects of mutant huntingtin. Notably, the precise downstream β-catenin target genes that mediate neuronal cell survival remain to be elucidated. In STHdhQ111/Q111 mutant striatal cells, the activation of Akt is appropriately dependent on PI 3-kinase and Ca2+. However, in contrast to Akt activation in wild type striatal cells, the enhanced Akt activation that is observed in mutant striatal cells can be abrogated by MK-801 and therefore is largely determined by Ca2+ influx via the NMDA receptor. Thus, as depicted in Fig. 7, our results link the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of the Akt pathway with the enhanced NMDA receptor activation and mitochondrial deficits that support excitotoxicity in mutant striatal cells (7.Levine M.S. Klapstein G.J. Koppel A. Gruen E. Cepeda C. Vargas M.E. Jokel E.S. Carpenter E.M. Zanjani H. Hurst R.S. Efstratiadis A. Zeitlin S. Chesselet M.F. J. Neurosci.

In the latter long standing hypothesis, decrements in mitochondrial calcium handling and ATP synthesis lead to lowered resting membrane potential alleviating the voltage-dependent Mg2+ blockade on the NMDA receptor, permitting Ca2+ influx via the NMDA receptor at physiologic glutamate concentrations (22.Cepeda C.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Therefore, the early disease cascade that is initiated by mutant huntingtin comprises a mixture of events. Some of these can lead to detrimental consequences, whereas other events represent the recruitment of signaling pathways that are activated in response to these deficits. Thus, the prosurvival Akt pathway is activated as an early disease event in mutant striatal neuronal cells in conjunction with NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Importantly, these consequences of mutant huntingtin are manifest before mutant striatal neuronal cells become more severely compromised and start to exhibit markers of overt pathology (6.Menalled L.B. Sison J.D. Wu Y. Olivieri M. Li X.J. Li H. Zeitlin S. Chesselet M.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8266-8276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Levine M.S. Klapstein G.J. Koppel A. Gruen E. Cepeda C.

Therefore, in genetically accurate HD models, in vivo and in cell culture, the end products of cellular dysfunction and toxicity, such as intranuclear inclusions, are not involved in determining the altered signaling state of mutant striatal cells early in the disease process. Instead, enhanced Akt signaling appears to reflect the consequences of mutant huntingtin on processes that lead to abnormally enhanced NMDA receptor activation. This may involve the decreased interaction of mutant huntingtin with the NMDA receptor-associated protein PSD95, which has been shown to increase NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate toxicity (26.Sun Y. Savanenin A. Reddy P.H. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mutant huntingtin may interact directly with the mitochondrion, resulting in aberrant calcium handling (7.Levine M.S. Klapstein G.J. Koppel A. Gruen E. Cepeda C. Vargas M.E. Jokel E.S. Carpenter E.M. Zanjani H. Hurst R.S. Efstratiadis A. Zeitlin S. Chesselet M.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 14.Panov A.V. Gutekunst C.A.

Greenamyre J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and impaired ATP synthesis, which is hypothesized to lead to abnormal NMDA receptor activation. Moreover, Akt signaling may be enhanced because of an increased association of mutant huntingtin with the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, which elevates intracellular calcium (27.Tang T.S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, because our data demonstrate that Akt activation in mutant cells can be fully blocked by MK-801, a specific NMDA receptor antagonist, participation of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor pathway would be expected to involve an effect on NMDA receptor activity. Activation of Akt, without changes in the total levels of the protein, early in the disease cascade appears to contrast with data suggesting that the Akt protein is diminished in HD postmortem brain (18.Humbert S. Bryson E.A. Cordelieres F.P. Connors N.C. Datta S.R. Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Saudou F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to this tissue, with extensive loss of neuronal cells, the Hdh CAG knock-in models do not feature overt neuronal cell death (11.Wheeler V.C. Gutekunst C.A. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Schilling G. Hersch S. Friedlander R.M. Gusella J.F. Vonsattel J.P. Borchelt D.R. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13.Trettel F.

Therefore, it is possible that in severely compromised neurons at end stage disease, Akt is decreased, and the earlier pro-survival Akt response is lost. Our data therefore suggest that strategies to boost Akt signaling early in the disease process may not be beneficial, because the pathway is already induced, although stimulating the Akt pathway late in the disease cascade may be ameliorative. Importantly, our data demonstrate that strategies designed to circumvent or alleviate the effects of enhanced NMDA receptor activation and other consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in mutant cells merit particular investigation.

Its precise role during inflammation and the underlying mechanisms is still unclear.

https://openalex.org/W2120145505,"We previously demonstrated that the phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the concomitant induction of both the caspase-8-mediated and mitochondrial activation-mediated apoptosis pathways. In the present study, we investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the activation of these two distinct cell death pathways induced by phytosphingosine in human cancer cells. Phytosphingosine caused strong induction of caspase-8 activity and caspase-independent Bax translocation to the mitochondria. A rapid decrease of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and a marked increase of p38 MAPK phosphorylation were observed within 10 min after phytosphingosine treatment. Activation of ERK1/2 by pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or forced expression of ERK1/2 attenuated phytosphingosine-induced caspase-8 activation. However, Bax translocation and caspase-9 activation was unaffected, indicating that down-regulation of the ERK activity is specifically required for the phytosphingosine-induced caspase-8-dependent cell death pathway. On the other hand, treatment with SB203580, a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, or expression of a dominant negative form of p38 MAPK suppressed phytosphingosine-induced translocation of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, from the cytosol to mitochondria, cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase-9 activation but did not affect caspase-8 activation, indicating that activation of p38 MAPK is involved in the mitochondrial activation-mediated cell death pathway. Our results suggest that phytosphingosine can utilize two different MAPK signaling pathways for amplifying the apoptosis cascade, enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms utilized by naturally occurring metabolites to regulate cell death.

Apoptosis can be induced via two distinct intracellular signaling pathways, the death receptor-mediated or the mitochondrial activation-mediated pathway (1.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R.

In this case, caspase-8 is recruited to the ligated receptors via FADD, an adaptor molecule, leading to its proteolytic activation. The activated caspase-8 in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3, which then initiates a set of events that culminate in apoptosis (1.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. VanArsdale T. Zhou Q.

In contrast to the death receptor pathway, the mitochondrial pathway responds to anticancer drugs and multiple classes of environmental stresses (3.Green D.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These stimuli cause redistribution of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 members, such as Bax, from the cytosol to mitochondria. This event is followed by reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol. The released cytochrome c participates in the process leading to caspase-9 activation, followed by activation of caspase-3 (4.Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial activation-mediated pathway has been shown to be required for Fas-induced apoptosis in certain cell types that are classified as type II cells. In these cells, Bid, a “BH3 only” protein of the Bcl-2 family, mediates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria initiated by caspase-8 activation (5.Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J.

The activation of the ERK pathway is generally considered to be a survival signal induced by growth factors against apoptotic signals (10.Yan C.Y. Greene L.A. J.

It has recently been reported that the ERK activation plays antiapoptotic roles in Fas-, TRAIL-, chemotherapeutic drug- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (12.Baek J.H. Jang J.E. Kang C.M. Chung H.Y. Kim N.D. Kim K.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MEK/ERK pathway blocks apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase-8, a key component of the death receptor pathway, induced by extrinsic stimulation of Fas, TNFR, and TRAIL receptor (13.Soderstrom T.S.

In contrast to ERKs, JNK and p38 MAPK are weakly activated by growth factors but respond strongly to a variety of stress signals including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, ionizing and UV irradiation, hyperosmotic stress, and chemotherapeutic drugs (15.Li T.

Activation of these kinases has shown to correlate well with the apoptosis induced by these stress stimuli. Additionally, studies using the inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK have suggested that JNK and/or p38 MAPK activation is necessary for UV-, cytokine-, ceramide-, and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis (20.Benhar M. Dalyot I. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6913-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the basis for crosstalk between MAPKs and apoptotic cell death machinery remains largely unclear. Sphingolipid metabolites such as ceramides, sphingosines, and sphingosine 1-phosphates have emerged as key regulators of apoptosis (21.Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Ceramide is generated as a product of the sphingomyelin hydrolysis, which is triggered by a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, anti-Fas, and γ-radiation (22.Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 23.Spiegel S. Milstien S.

Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Importantly, the apoptotic actions of these stimuli are attenuated when the ceramide generation is blocked. Moreover, direct exposure of cells to the cell-permeable ceramide analogs was shown to induce apoptosis, suggesting that ceramide can act as a mediator of apoptosis. It has been reported that ceramide induces apoptosis by the activation of the JNK signaling pathway (28.Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Ceramide can be further metabolized by ceramidase to sphingosine, which can be then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (29.Cuvillier O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whereas sphingosine induces apoptosis in various cell types (30.Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), sphingosine 1-phosphate antagonizes the apoptotic actions of ceramide (30.Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Given the well established role of these three sphingolipid metabolites in apoptosis, other sphingolipid derivatives may also contribute to controlling apoptosis. Among these derivatives, phytosphingosine is one of the most widely distributed natural sphingoid bases that is abundant in fungi and plants and also found in animals including humans. The structure of phytosphingosine is very similar to sphingosine; phytosphingosine possesses a hydroxyl group at C-4 of the sphingoid long-chain base, whereas sphingosine has a trans double bond between C-4 and C-5. However, the physiological role of phytosphingosine is largely unknown, although it has recently been reported that phytosphingosine exerts strong cytotoxic effects on Chinese hamster ovary cells and modulates the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway (31.Lee J.S. Min D.S. Park C. Park C.S. Cho N.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that phytosphingosine employs two distinct apoptotic pathways, the caspase-8-dependent and mitochondrial activation-dependent pathway, to induce apoptosis in two different cell types, human T cell lymphoma, Jurkat, and non-small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H460 (32.Kim M.R. Lee J.Y. Park M.T. Chun Y.J. Jang Y.J. Kang C.M. Kim H.S. Cho C.K. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.Y. Lee S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This bifurcation of the signaling pathway induced by phytosphingosine differs from those seen with other agents. Given this unique feature of phytosphingosine, further analysis of its action is expected to significantly advance understandings not only of physiological functions of sphingolipid but also of the apoptotic cell death control. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the simultaneous induction of both the caspase-8-mediated and mitochondrial activation-mediated cell death by phytosphingosine. The data suggest that down-regulation of the ERK pathway is critical in the death receptor-independent activation of caspase-8, and activation of p38 MAPK is essential for the induction of mitochondrial translocation of Bax and cytochrome c release during phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis. Since phytosphingosine appears to utilize two distinctive MAPK signaling pathways for killing cells, understanding the signaling mechanisms of phytosphingosine-induced cell death may provide a better knowledge of the interrelationship between MAPKs and cell death machinery in mammalian cell systems. Cell Culture—Jurkat, human T cell lymphoma (Type II), and NCI H460 human non-small cell lung cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Plasmids—pCMV5-DN-p38 MAPK, an expression vector encoding the dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK, and pLCEP4-DN-ERK, the dominant negative mutants of ERK, were gifts of Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Materials—Phytosphingosine was purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Polyclonal antibody to caspase-3 and monoclonal antibodies to PARP and cytochrome c were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and polyclonal antibodies to caspase-8 and -9, Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, and HSP60 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to phospho-p38 MAPK, caspase-3, and PARP were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, and the caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-fmk, were obtained from Calbiochem. Hoechst 33258 Staining—Hoechst 33258 staining was performed as described previously (32.Kim M.R. Lee J.Y. Park M.T. Chun Y.J. Jang Y.J. Kang C.M. Kim H.S. Cho C.K. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.Y. Lee S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in room temperature and then washed once with PBS. Hoechst 33258 (50 ng/ml) was added to the fixed cells, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Cells were mounted and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by the condensation and fragmentation of their nuclei. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells counted. At minimum, 500 cells were counted for each treatment. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was identified and quantified by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Both adherent and floating cells were collected after phytosphingosine treatment, washed with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 1 mg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C. Cellular DNA was stained with 50 ng/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Cells were then analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). From the analysis of DNA histograms, the percentages of cells in different phases of cell cycle were evaluated. Cells with DNA content less than the G1 phase (sub-G1) were taken as apoptotic cells. Extraction of DNA and Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were treated with 5 or 10 μg/ml phytosphingosine and were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). DNA samples were extracted and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described (33.Kim J.Y. Choi J.A. Kim T.H. Yoo Y.D. Kim J.I. Lee Y.J. Yoo S.Y. Cho C.K. Lee Y.S. Lee S.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 190: 29-37Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins with lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and proteins were visualized by ECL procedures (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined as the retention of the mitochondria-specific dye DiOC6(3) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were loaded with 30 nm DiOC6(3) during the last 30 min of phytosphingosine treatment. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and the relative amount of retained DiOC6(3) was measured by flow cytometric analysis. Preparation of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Protein Fractions for the Measurement of Cytochrome c and Bax Translocation—Cells were collected and washed twice in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in S-100 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.9 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, mixture of protease inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 20 min. After a 20-min incubation on ice, the cells were homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer and a loose pestle (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) for 70 strokes. Cell homogenates were spun at 1,000 × g to remove unbroken cells, nuclei, and heavy membranes. The supernatant was spun again at 14,000 × g for 30 min to collect the mitochondria-rich (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. The mitochondria-rich fraction was washed once with the extraction buffer, followed by a final resuspension in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors for Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldheyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with 25 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-human Bax diluted 1:200 in 5% FBS/PBS for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Excess antibody was removed by washing the coverslips three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:200 in 5% FBS/PBS, for 1 h protected from light at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin diluted 1:200 in 5% FBS/PBS for 4 h. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto microscopic slides using ProLong antifade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes). The slides were analyzed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Immune Complex Kinase Assay—ERK activity in phytosphingosine-treated cell lysates was measured by the ability of these lysates to phosphorylate PHAS-1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), a substrate for ERK (34.Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins with lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 200 μg of lysate with anti-ERK-1 or ERK-2 antibody for 90 min and then adding 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma). After a 90-min incubation at 4 °C, the immune complex was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer and then two times with kinase reaction buffer (250 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm Na3VO4). The immune complex was resuspended in kinase reaction buffer containing 120 μg of PHAS-1 substrate along with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer and boiling for 3 min. Phosphorylated PHAS was resolved on 12.5% PAGE gels, dried, and autoradiographed. Phytosphingosine Induces Death Receptor-independent Caspase-8 Activation—We have previously shown that phytosphingosine induces apoptosis in the human cancer cell line, Jurkat. To confirm, we treated these cells with different doses of phytosphingosine, and induction of apoptotic cell death was analyzed. Fig. 1A shows that there is a dose- and time-dependent increase of apoptotic cells after the phytosphingosine treatment, as measured by Hoechst 33258 staining for nuclei fragmentation and condensation. Several studies have suggested that activation of caspase-8 depends upon its oligomerization, which is mediated by the association of the DED domains of the adaptor molecule, FADD, and caspase-8. This association requires the interaction of FADD, either directly or indirectly with surface receptors such as Fas or TNFR, which possess death domains (1.Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. VanArsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 2.Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). To determine whether death receptors are involved in phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to analyze the association of FADD and caspase-8 in Jurkat cells after treatment with phytosphingosine. As shown in Fig. 1B, caspase-8 activation and interaction between FADD and caspase-8 were detected in cells treated with Ch11, a soluble Fas ligand. In contrast, caspase-8 was not found to be associated with FADD upon phytosphingosine-mediated activation of caspase-8. This suggests that caspase-8 activation triggered by phytosphingosine occurs in a death receptor-independent fashion. Phytosphingosine Induces Caspase-independent Bax Translocation, Cytochrome c Release, and Caspase-9 Activation in Human Cancer Cells—We previously reported that treatment of cells with phytosphingosine promoted cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation through acceleration of Bax translocation to the mitochondria (32.Kim M.R. Lee J.Y. Park M.T. Chun Y.J. Jang Y.J. Kang C.M. Kim H.S. Cho C.K. Lee Y.S. Jeong H.Y. Lee S.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether phytosphingosine-induced Bax translocation is affected by the caspase-8 activation, we examined the effect of Z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8-specific inhibitor, on the Bax translocation induced by phytosphingosine. As shown in Fig. 1C, phytosphingosine treatment dramatically redistributes Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria, and the addition of Z-IETD-fmk failed to prevent the intracellular redistribution of Bax. These results suggest that Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation occur in a caspase-8-independent fashion during the apoptotic process triggered by phytosphingosine. Phytosphingosine Suppresses the ERK Signaling Pathway—MAPKs have been implicated in regulation of apoptosis in response to various stimuli. To investigate a potential involvement of ERKs in phytosphingosine-induced cell death, we first examined their activities following phytosphingosine treatment. ERK1/2 activities were determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody to detect the activated phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 in Jurkat and NCIH460 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, phytosphingosine treatment led to a dramatic down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2. The phosphorylated ERK started to diminish within 2 min of the phytosphingosine treatment (5 or 10 μm, respectively, in Jurkat and NCI-H460 cells). Suppression of ERK activity was sustained for 3 or 6 h, respectively, in Jurkat and NCI-H460 cells, whereas the total expression level of ERK did not change throughout the observed time course in these cells. This result corroborates well with the results of ERK kinase assays, demonstrating a marked decrease of ERK activity in these cells after treatment with phytosphingosine (Fig. 2B). Suppression of ERK Signaling Pathway Is Involved in the Activation of Caspase-8 during Phytosphingosine-induced Apoptosis—To determine whether suppression of ERK activity is required for the phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis, we treated cells with PMA, a very efficient ERK activator, and analyzed its effect on phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis. As expected, the decrease of phosphorylated ERK1/2 level was inhibited by co-treatment of Jurkat cells with phytosphingosine and PMA (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PMA treatment markedly suppressed the phytosphingosine-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis (Fig. 3, A and B). However, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, and Bax translocation triggered by phytosphingosine were not affected by PMA treatment (Fig. 3A). To further clarify the relationship between ERK activation and phytosphingosine-induced cell death, we employed a specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059. A simultaneous treatment of cells with PD98059, PMA, and phytosphingosine effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of PMA on phytosphingosine-induced cell death (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, PD98059 treatment effectively reversed the blockade of phytosphingosine-induced caspase-8, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage by PMA (Fig. 4B). In fact, treating cells with PD98059 alone without PMA potentiates the phytosphingosine-induced cell death (Fig. 4A), caspase activation, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4PD98059 attenuates the inhibitory effect of PMA in phytosphingosine-induced cell death. Jurkat cells were pretreated with 100 nm PMA and/or 30 μm PD98059 for 30 min and then with 5 μg/ml phytosphingosine for 3 h. A, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258, and apoptotic cells were quantitated by fluorescence microscopy as described above. Results from three independent experiments are shown as means ± S.E. B, cell lysates were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed using anti-caspase-8, caspase-3, or PARP antibodies. The data represent a typical experiment conducted three times with similar results.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2093383843,"Using cysteine cross-linking, we demonstrated previously that the dopamine transporter (DAT) is at least a homodimer, with the extracellular end of transmembrane segment (TM) 6 at a symmetrical dimer interface. We have now explored the possibility that DAT exists as a higher order oligomer in the plasma membrane. Cysteine cross-linking of wild type DAT resulted in bands on SDS-PAGE consistent with dimer, trimer, and tetramer, suggesting that DAT forms a tetramer in the plasma membrane. A cysteine-depleted DAT (CD-DAT) into which only Cys243 or Cys306 was reintroduced was cross-linked to dimer, suggesting that these endogenous cysteines in TM4 and TM6, respectively, were cross-linked at a symmetrical dimer interface. Reintroduction of both Cys243 and Cys306 into CD-DAT led to a pattern of cross-linking indistinguishable from that of wild type, with dimer, trimer, and tetramer bands. This indicated that the TM4 interface and the TM6 interface are distinct and further suggested that DAT may exist in the plasma membrane as a dimer of dimers, with two symmetrical homodimer interfaces. The cocaine analog MFZ 2–12 and other DAT inhibitors, including benztropine and mazindol, protected Cys243 against cross-linking. In contrast, two substrates of DAT, dopamine and tyramine, did not significantly impact cross-linking. We propose that the impairment of cross-linking produced by the inhibitors results from a conformational change at the TM4 interface, further demonstrating that these compounds are not neutral blockers but by themselves have effects on the structure of the transporter.

The dopamine transporter (DAT) 1The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; TM, transmembrane segment; CuP, copper phenanthroline; bis-EA, bis-(2-methane-thiosulfonatoethyl)amine hydrochloride; CD, cysteine-depleted; GAT, γ-aminobutyric acid transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; HA, hemagglutinin; MTSEA, 2-aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate. is responsible for the re-uptake of dopamine released into the synaptic cleft and thus represents the major mechanism for the termination of dopaminergic neurotransmission (1Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). DAT is a member of the family of Na+- and Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, which includes transporters for other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine, as well as a number of other small molecules (2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 3Kanner B.I. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 237-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family also includes a large number of homologous bacterial and archaeal proteins, one of which has been recently identified as a Na+-dependent tryptophan transporter (4Androutsellis-Theotokis A.

These transporters couple the movement of sodium down its concentration gradient to the transport of substrate, but the molecular mechanism of this process is understood only in general terms. The Na+- and Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters are thought to have 12 transmembrane segments with intracellular NH2 and COOH termini, and this general topology has been supported by the accessibility of putative extracellular and intracellular loop residues to chemical modification (5Ferrer J.V.

Although the packing of the 12 TMs is unknown, some distance constraints have been established in DAT through the identification of an endogenous zinc binding site and subsequent use of engineered metal binding sites (9Loland C.J.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) was inferred to be a homooligomer, based on co-immunoprecipitation studies of differentially epitope-tagged SERT constructs and on the functional effects of chemical modification of co-expressed SERT mutants (11Kilic F.

In addition, cross-linking of SERT was also consistent with an oligomeric structure of SERT, although the residues responsible for cross-linking were not identified (12Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The demonstration of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between different spectral variants of green fluorescent proteins fused to the NH2 termini of SERT, GAT (13Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and more recently DAT (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), also supports their existence as dimers. In contrast, Horiuchi et al. (15Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) inferred from their studies that mature glycine transporter in the plasma membrane was not oligomeric, whereas immature intracellular transporter was oligomeric. Using cysteine cross-linking, we demonstrated that DAT is at least a homodimer, with the extracellular end of TM6 at a symmetrical dimer interface (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Moreover, we identified the presence of the dimerization motif GVXXGVXX(T/A) (17Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 18Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) in TM6 of DAT and of many related neurotransmitter transporters, and we engineered an inhibitory Zn2+-binding site at the extracellular end of TM6 near the dimer interface (19Norgaard-Nielsen K. Norregaard L. Hastrup H. Javitch J.A. Gether U. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, using different approaches, studies in both DAT (20Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and GAT (21Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have supported the existence of a dimer interface involving TM2. Whether the TM2 interface, which in both of these studies was disrupted by mutations in a leucine heptad repeat, is at the same homodimer interface as the TM6 interface or whether DAT is a higher order oligomer with distinct interfaces is unknown. Using cysteine cross-linking, we have now explored the possibility that DAT exists as a higher order oligomer in the plasma membrane. We show that DAT appears to be a tetramer in the plasma membrane and that TM4 is present at a homo-dimeric interface distinct from the TM6 interface. Moreover, we show that a cocaine analog and other dopamine uptake inhibitors inhibit cross-linking of a cysteine in TM4, suggesting the presence of a conformational change at the TM4 interface upon inhibitor binding. Stable Transfection of DAT—EM4 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with macrophage scavenger receptor to increase their adherence to tissue culture plastic (22Robbins A.K. Horlick R.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) were stably transfected with a synthetic human DAT gene (synDAT) that was tagged at the amino terminus with a FLAG epitope fused to the hemagglutinin epitope with the first 22 amino acids truncated (FLAG-HA) as described previously (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some experiments were also conducted with a full-length synDAT tagged at the NH2 terminus with a FLAG epitope as described previously (23Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cross-linking—Cross-linking was performed for 5 min at room temperature as described previously (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with 100 μm CuSO4 and 400 μm 1,10-phenanthroline (CuP), 20 μm bis-EA, 20 μm HgCl2, or 1 mm CuSO4 (Cu2+). Pretreatment with 1 μm MFZ 2–12, 10 μm mazindol, 10 μm benztropine, 100 μm dopamine, or 100 μm tyramine was performed, when indicated, for 20 min at room temperature before cross-linking, which was performed in the continued presence of these compounds. After cross-linking, the cells were washed and DAT extracted for immunoblotting as described previously (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Samples were applied to 1.5-mm, 15-well 7.5% acrylamide gels. For quantitation of the apparent molecular mass of the higher order bands, we also used Invitrogen NuPAGE Tris acetate gels run according to the Invitrogen instruction manual. Immunoblotting was otherwise performed as described previously (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and chemiluminescence was detected and quantitated on a FluorChem 8000 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). We demonstrated previously that DAT heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells was cross-linked to a dimer by copper phenanthroline (CuP) and that Cys306 at the extracellular end of TM6 was the endogenous cysteine that is cross-linked at a symmetrical homodimer interface (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we also observed CuP-induced cross-linking of DAT to dimer in mouse striatal membranes (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition to dimer, however, in mouse striatal membranes we also demonstrated the appearance of a larger oligomeric species containing DAT, suggesting that DAT might exist as a higher order oligomer but that a difference in the cellular context might somehow limit additional CuP-induced cross-linking in the HEK 293 background. To explore this phenomenon further, we evaluated a number of other cross-linking reagents with FLAG-tagged wild type DAT expressed in HEK 293 cells. CuS04 (Cu2+) has been used in the absence of phenanthroline to cross-link cysteines in G-actin (24Shvetsov A. Musib R. Phillips M. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10787-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and we found that although CuP and bis-EA only produced DAT dimer, treatment with Cu2+ produced cross-linked DAT species consistent with dimer, trimer, and tetramer at 177 ± 4, 269 ± 6, and 341 ± 6 kDa, respectively, with some residual monomer at 84 ± 2 kDa (mean ± S.E., n = 5). Identical results were observed with FLAG-HA-DAT in which the 22 NH2-terminal residues are truncated (Fig. 1A). When expressed as a fraction of the total immunoreactivity in the lane, the percentage of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer was 33 ± 5, 41 ± 4, 15 ± 2, and 12 ± 3, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 5). In contrast, a cysteine-depleted DAT (CD-DAT) (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (in which the only cysteines are Cys180 and Cys189, which likely form a native disulfide bond (25Wang J.B. Moriwaki A. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and Cys135 and Cys342, which are in cytoplasmic loops (5Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) was not cross-linked by Cu2+ (Fig. 1A), despite the fact that it is expressed at the plasma membrane and functional (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Substitution of the endogenous Cys306 back into CD-DAT resulted in the appearance of a dimer band in response to Cu2+ treatment (Fig. 1B) just as we observed with CuP (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, Cys306 is cross-linked by both CuP and by Cu2+. A FLAG-HA DAT in which Cys90 and Cys306, the two cysteines inferred to be accessible from the extracellular milieu (5Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), were mutated to Ala was inefficiently cross-linked to dimer by Cu2+ (Fig. 1B), although we previously showed that this construct was not cross-linked at all by CuP (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, an endogenous cysteine or cysteines present in C90A/C306A, but absent in CD-DAT, must be cross-linked by Cu2+ but not by CuP. Mutation of Cys243 to Ala (C243A) in the C90A/C306A background greatly diminished the Cu2+-induced cross-linking (Fig. 1B). This implicated Cys243 in TM4 as the cross-linked residue, and consistent with this hypothesis, CD-DAT with only Cys243 restored was cross-linked to dimer by Cu2+, albeit inefficiently (Fig. 2A). In addition, CD-DAT containing both Cys243 and Cys306 was cross-linked to dimer, trimer, and tetramer in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild type DAT (Fig. 2B). Cross-linking of Cys243 by Cu2+ was inefficient when compared with that of Cys306 (Figs. 1B and 2A). Moreover, in contrast to Cys306, no cross-linking of Cys243 was observed with CuP or with bis-2-aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (bis-MTSEA) (Fig. 3). Reasoning that this might have resulted from poor access of the cross-linking reagents to a protein interface surrounded by lipid, we attempted cross-linking with HgCl2, which has been used to cross-link membrane-embedded cysteines (27Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HgCl2 cross-linked Cys243 much more efficiently than did Cu2+ (compare Fig. 3 and 2A). The size of the cross-linked species, ∼176 kDa, was consistent with it being a homodimer of DAT. HgCl2 cross-linked Cys306 as well, with optimal cross-linking seen at lower concentrations (data not shown). Importantly, the CD-DAT background was not cross-linked at all by HgCl2 (Fig. 3). It was not possible to study the effect of cross-linking on uptake because HgCl2 potently inhibited uptake by CD-DAT (data not shown), presumably due to reaction with cytoplasmic Cys342, the modification of which inhibits uptake (28Chen N. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Justice Jr., J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1608-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cu2+ also potently inhibited uptake by CD-DAT (data not shown), consistent with the presence of an inhibitory Cu2+ binding site (29Bonnet J.J. Benmansour S. Amejdki-Chab N. Costentin J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We were able, however, to assess whether bound ligand impacted cross-linking of Cys243. The potent cocaine analog MFZ 2–12 (30Newman A.H. Zou M.F. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1659-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) dramatically decreased mercury-induced cross-linking of CD-DAT-A243C (Fig. 4B). In addition, the uptake inhibitors benztropine and mazindol also protected against cross-linking, whereas the substrates dopamine and tyramine did not significantly affect cross-linking (Fig. 4B). 2Cocaine protected against the weak cross-linking of Cys243 induced by Cu2+, but in preliminary experiments cocaine protected less efficiently against mercury-induced cross-linking (data not shown). These differences may relate to the very high reactivity of mercury and/or the lower affinity and faster dissociation rate of cocaine relative to the other inhibitors tested. CuP-induced cross-linking of Cys306, at the extracellular end of TM6, was unaffected by MFZ 2–12 (data not shown). Consistent with protection against cross-linking of Cys243 but not Cys306, the trimer and tetramer bands produced by Cu2+ were eliminated when cross-linking was performed in the presence of MFZ 2–12, leaving only the dimeric species in which Cys306 was cross-linked (Fig. 4A). If TM4 and TM6 were situated at the same homo-dimer interface, then cross-linking would be expected to produce only dimer. The appearance of dimer, trimer, and tetramer, therefore, is consistent with the existence of two distinct homodimer interfaces. Thus, DAT appears to exist in the membrane as a dimer of dimers with distinct symmetrical interfaces involving both TM4 and TM6. This is consistent with our earlier observation of higher order oligomeric species upon cross-linking of DAT in mouse striatal membranes (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and also with a radiation inactivation study in which DAT was inferred to be a tetramer (31Milner H.E. Beliveau R. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Experiments with concateners of SERT also supported a dimeric or tetrameric, but not a trimeric, quaternary structure (32Chang A.S. Starnes D.M. Chang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inactivation studies with coexpressed SERT mutants were also interpreted as consistent with SERT possibly being a tetramer (11Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unlike Cys306, Cys243 was not cross-linked by CuP or by bis-EA, suggesting that it is not readily accessible to the aqueous environment. Consistent with this, treatment with MTSEA did not prevent cross-linking of Cys243 by Cu2+ or by HgCl2 (data not shown), suggesting that Cys243 is not accessible to reaction with MTSEA. Cu2+ must gain limited access to the site, but cross-linking by Cu2+ is quite inefficient. Mercury is known to react rapidly and selectively with sulfhydryl groups and can bridge nearby pairs of cysteines to form an intermolecular mercury-linked dimer (27Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mercury is able to enter a hydrophobic environment (27Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which likely accounts for its more efficient cross-linking of Cys243. In contrast to Cys306, the cross-linking of which was unaltered by cocaine-like inhibitors, cross-linking of Cys243 was dramatically inhibited by the cocaine analog MFZ 2–12, as well as by other structural diverse uptake inhibitors, including benztropine and mazindol (Fig. 4). This adds to the growing literature demonstrating that cocaine-like molecules and other uptake inhibitors are not simply neutral blockers but by themselves produce conformational rearrangements of DAT (5Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9238-9243Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Reith M.E. Berfield J.L. Wang L.C. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29012-29018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Norregaard L. Loland C.J. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30587-30596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are two potential explanations for the decreased cross-linking of Cys243 seen with uptake inhibitors. First, DAT might dissociate from a tetramer into a dimer upon inhibitor binding. In this scenario, the tetramer may be required for function, and disruption of this oligomeric species may be a critical mechanism of inhibition of uptake as well as block of currents associated with cocaine (23Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 35Sonders M.S. Zhu S.-J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the tetrameric structure of DAT may be stable, but the inhibitors may cause a conformational change at the TM4 interface that decreases cross-linking. Based on preliminary cross-linking and protection data on an extensive series of TM4 cysteine substitution mutants, 3H. Hastrup and J. A. Javitch, manuscript in preparation. we think it most likely that a conformational change, rather than dissociation of the tetramer, is responsible for the protection against cross-linking. It is interesting to speculate whether the interfaces contribute to the transport pathway or ion conduction pathways in DAT and related transporters, and this will merit further investigation. It seems unlikely that inhibitors sterically block access of the cross-linkers to Cys243 given the lack of access of MTSEA, bis-EA, and CuP to this position and the lack of significant impact of mutation of Cys243 on binding or transport (16Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although we did not observe bands larger than tetramer, we cannot rule out the possibility that DAT may exist in the membrane as an even higher order oligomeric structure. It is geometrically possible to pack a dimer of dimers into an extended array (Fig. 5), as recently described for murine rhodopsin in native retinal disk membranes (36Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 37Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In addition, electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional crystals of NhaA, a Na+/H+ antiporter from Escherichia coli also revealed an array-like structure, with two distinct symmetrical interfaces (38Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since this structure was determined after solubilization in detergent and reconstitution of purified protein in lipid, the relevance of the crystal packing for the native structure is uncertain, but functional and biochemical experiments also support the existence of NhaA in the native membrane as a homo-oligomer (39Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the existence of two distinct symmetrical interfaces in TM4 and TM6 of DAT, DAT must exist in the plasma membrane at least as a dimer of dimers. Although there is no experimental evidence that DAT exists as more than a tetramer, it is unclear geometrically what would limit the oligomeric structure to a tetramer rather than an extended array. Indeed, in such a tetramer comprised of a dimer of dimers, given the geometric constraints imposed by symmetry, there must be two cysteines, for example two Cys243, that are not in close proximity despite the fact that the other two Cys243 are located at a symmetrical interface (40Klingenberg M. Nature. 1981; 290: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). It is conceivable that interaction with other proteins, as reported for both the NH2 and COOH termini (41Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 42Carneiro A.M. Ingram S.L. Beaulieu J.M. Sweeney A. Amara S.G. Thomas S.M. Caron M.G.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) of DAT and/or related transporters, may somehow prevent DAT from forming an extended array. It is also conceivable that DAT does form an array but that we cannot detect higher order species for technical reasons, such as inefficient transfer, or because the relatively low efficiency of cross-linking of Cys243 makes the higher order species too rare for detection. The relationship between a potential TM2 interface, as predicted by mutagenesis studies in DAT and GAT (20Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol.

It is possible that the TM2 interface is shared with either the TM4 or the TM6 interface in a tetrameric complex, and ongoing studies attempting to cross-link cysteines in TM2 of DAT may help to resolve this as well. We thank Arthur Karlin, Harel Weinstein, and Thijs Beuming for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2006197681,"A pathogen-induced oxygenase showing homology to prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases-1 and -2 was recently characterized by in vitro experiments as a fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase catalyzing formation of unstable 2(R)-hydroperoxy fatty acids. To study the activity of this enzyme under in vivo conditions and to elucidate the fate of enzymatically produced 2-hydroperoxides, leaves of tobacco were analyzed for the presence of alpha-dioxygenase-generated compounds as well as for lipoxygenase (LOX) products and free fatty acids. Low basal levels of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (0.4 nmol/g leaves fresh weight) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (0.1 nmol/g) could be demonstrated. These levels increased strongly upon infection with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae (548 and 47 nmol/g, respectively). Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing alpha-dioxygenase were developed, and incompatible infection of such plants led to a dramatic elevation of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid (1778 nmol/g) and 8,11,14-heptadecatrienoic acid (86 nmol/g), whereas the levels of LOX products were strongly decreased. Further analysis of oxylipins in infected leaves revealed the presence of a number of 2-hydroxy fatty acids differing with respect to chain length and degree of unsaturation as well as two new doubly oxygenated oxylipins identified as 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid and 2(R),9(S)-dihydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. alpha-Dioxygenase-generated 2-hydroxylinolenic acid, and to a lesser extent lipoxygenase-generated 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid, exerted a tissue-protective effect in bacterially infected tobacco leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1991256158,"NFBD1/MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) is a nuclear factor with an amino-terminal FHA (forkhead-associated) domain and a tandem repeat of BRCT (breast cancer susceptibility gene-1 carboxyl terminus) domains. We have previously shown that NFBD1 is an early participant in DNA damage signaling pathways and that ionizing radiation-induced nuclear foci (IRIF) of NFBD1 colocalize with several DNA checkpoint signaling and repair factors. We report here that NFBD1 physically associates with ATM, p53, components of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, and gamma-H2AX. An overexpressed FHA domain-containing fragment of NFBD1 binds to endogenous NFBD1 and components of the MRN complex, but not to gamma-H2AX. This fragment interferes with IRIF formation by endogenous NFBD1, MRE11, or NBS1. A BRCT domain-containing fragment of NFBD1 binds to gamma-H2AX and 53BP1, but not to components of the MRN complex, and abolishes IRIF formation by NFBD1, MRE11, NBS1, 53BP1, CHK2 phospho-T68, gamma-H2AX, and possible ATM/ATR substrates recognized by anti-phospho-SQ/TQ antibody. These results suggest that NFBD1 is an ATM/ATR-dependent organizer that recruits DNA checkpoint signaling and repair proteins to the sites of DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2090815681,"We investigated the effects of mechanical stretch and induced stimulation of lung parenchyma on the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors in normal mice and in a mouse model of asthma. Mechanical stretching of lung parenchyma led to increased activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors. Incubation of lung parenchyma with methacholine increased the activation of NF-kappaB, which was further augmented by stretch. Activation of NF-kappaB in response to mechanical stretch was associated with the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha and the activation of IkappaB kinase. Stretch-induced activation of NF-kappaB involves activation of stretch-activated (SA) channels and the production of free radicals. Mechanical stretch and/or treatment with methacholine resulted in an increased activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, and the inhibition of the activity of these kinases partially blocked the stretch-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. A greater level of NF-kappaB and ERK1/2 activity was observed in the asthmatic mice, which was further increased by mechanical stretching. The level of cyclooxygenase-2, an NF-kappaB-regulated enzyme, was also higher in lung parenchyma from asthmatic mice than in normal mice. Our data suggest that mechanical stretching of lung parenchyma activates NF-kappaB and AP-1, at least in part, through the activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2054418404,"The late steps in assembly of capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and their translocation to the bacterial cell surface are not well understood. The Wza protein was shown previously to be required for the formation of the prototype group 1 capsule structure on the surface of Escherichia coli serotype K30 (Drummelsmith, J., and Whitfield, C. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 57–66). Wza is a conserved outer membrane lipoprotein that forms multimers adopting a ringlike structure, and collective evidence suggests a role for these structures in the export of capsular polymer across the outer membrane. Wza was purified in the native form and with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. WzaHis6 was acylated and functional in capsule assembly, although its efficiency was slightly reduced in comparison to the native Wza protein. Ordered two-dimensional crystals of WzaHis6 were obtained after reconstitution of purified multimers into lipids. Electron microscopy of negatively stained crystals and Fourier filtering revealed ringlike multimers with an average outer diameter of 8.84 nm and an average central cavity diameter of 2.28 nm. Single particle analysis yielded projection structures at an estimated resolution of 3 nm, favoring a structure for the WzaHis6 containing eight identical subunits. A derivative of Wza (Wza*) in which the original signal sequence was replaced with that from OmpF showed that the native acylated N terminus of Wza is critical for formation of normal multimeric structures and for their competence for CPS assembly, but not for targeting Wza to the outer membrane. In the presence of Wza*, CPS accumulated in the periplasm but was not detected on the cell surface. Chemical cross-linking of intact cells suggested formation of a transmembrane complex minimally containing Wza and the inner membrane tyrosine autokinase Wzc.

In Gram-negative bacteria, macromolecules destined for the cell surface or the extracellular environment must cross both the inner (IM) 1The abbreviations used are: IMinner membraneOMouter membraneCPScapsular polysaccharidesEPSexopolysaccharidesKcapsularLPSlipopolysaccharideNTAnitrilotriacetic acidDSPdithiobissuccinimidyl propionateDDMn-dodecyl β-d-maltosideDTTdithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: IMinner membraneOMouter membraneCPScapsular polysaccharidesEPSexopolysaccharidesKcapsularLPSlipopolysaccharideNTAnitrilotriacetic acidDSPdithiobissuccinimidyl propionateDDMn-dodecyl β-d-maltosideDTTdithiothreitol. and the outer membrane (OM). In protein export, where the processes are arguably best understood, secretion systems with varying complexity accomplish the translocation steps; all involve multi-enzyme complexes where an outer membrane protein (channel) is linked directly, or via helper proteins, to IM components.Cell-associated capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and their secreted (cell-free) counterparts, exopolysaccharides (EPS), represent another type of macromolecule that must be transported across the cell envelope. The early steps in assembly of these polymers are reasonably well established. However, there is little understanding of the terminal steps, including the mechanism by which they cross the bacterial cell envelope and the machinery involved.In Escherichia coli, more than 80 antigenically distinct capsular (K) polysaccharide structures are recognized. They are divided into four groups based on the organization of their genetic loci, polymerization mechanisms, and regulation (1.Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Group 1 and 2 capsules have received the most attention, and they involve biosynthetic mechanisms that are conserved in other bacteria. Translocation of group 1 and 2 CPS occurs at specific sites where the IM and OM are in close apposition (so called “Bayer junctions” or zones of adhesion) (2.Bayer M.E. Thurow H. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 911-936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Bayer M.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 268-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Krönke K.-D. Golecki J.R. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3469-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing indirect evidence for transmembrane complexes in capsule assembly. Translocation of group 2 capsules is proposed to involve coordinated synthesis and export (1.Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 5.Bliss J.M. Silver R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Rigg G.P. Barrett B. Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7.Silver R.P. Prior K. Nsahlai C. Wright L.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the current model, group 2 CPS is polymerized in the cytoplasm by a multi-enzyme membrane-bound complex and then modified with a phospholipid anchor. Next, the nascent CPS is exported across the IM by a member of the ABC-2 family of ATP-binding cassette transporters, before being transported across the OM by a currently unidentified channel protein. Our laboratory is interested in the biosynthesis of the E. coli K30 CPS, the established prototype for group 1 capsules. A model representing the current thinking about the assembly mechanism is presented in Fig. 1. Individual group 1 K-antigen repeat units are assembled on an undecaprenol phosphate carrier lipid at the cytoplasmic face of the IM and are then proposed to be transferred across the IM by a “flippase” Wzx. The majority of the repeating units serve as substrate for polymerization in a process minimally requiring the IM protein, Wzy, and resulting in high molecular weight CPS (8.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, a small fraction of the repeat units can also serve as substrate for the O-antigen ligase WaaL, ligating the repeating unit onto the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lipid A-core. This LPS-linked form of the group 1 antigens is called KLPS (9.MacLachlan P.R. Keenleyside W.J. Dodgson C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7515-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the high molecular weight capsular form of K antigen requires four additional highly conserved proteins (Wzi (formerly OrfX), Wza, Wzb, and Wzc), encoded by all group 1 capsule gene loci (i.e. independent of CPS structure) in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.Rahn A. Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2307-2313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Wzi is a monomeric β-barrel OM protein acting late (after translocation) in the assembly pathway. In the absence of Wzi, K30 polymer is still made and exported but much of it is secreted into the surrounding medium, instead of being elaborated into a coherent capsular structure on the cell surface. Wzi is therefore involved at some level in linking CPS to the cell surface, rather than functioning in polymerization or capsule translocation (11.Rahn A. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5882-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Wzc is an IM protein with tyrosine autokinase activity, and the cytosolic Wzb enzyme is its cognate phosphatase (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Deletion of either Wzc or Wzb abolishes the ability of the bacteria to make a K30 capsule but not K30LPS (which serves as an independent measure of synthesis of K30 repeat units) (8.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The extent of phosphorylation of Wzc also affects the amount of K30 CPS (13.Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite the information now available concerning the biochemical properties of Wzc proteins in E. coli K30 (8.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and in E. coli K-12 (14.Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15.Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the precise role(s) of Wzc in capsule assembly has yet to be resolved. Wza is a conserved OM lipoprotein that forms multimers with a low resolution ringlike structure identified in electron microscopy (17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Wza protein is required for the formation of the group 1 capsule structure on the surface, but mutants deficient in Wza can still form K30LPS (8.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These properties collectively suggest a role for Wza in export of capsular polymer across the OM, but the absence of capsule or any accumulated high molecular weight periplasmic polymer in wza mutants make it difficult to assign a definitive role to this protein in the assembly pathway. An attractive explanation for the inability of wza and wzc mutants to form any high molecular weight polymer is that high level Wzy-dependent polymerization and translocation are linked processes in an enzyme complex; a defect in any component of the complex would impact preceding steps.In this report we further characterize the structure and function of Wza in E. coli K30. The secondary structure of Wza was investigated, and electron crystallography revealed an octameric quaternary structure. A non-acylated Wza derivative (Wza*) was found to target to the OM but was unable to form stable multimers, leading to a capsule-assembly pathway defect in which CPS was retained in the periplasm. Chemical cross-linking was used to show an association between Wza and Wzc. The collective data provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of Wza in translocation and for a transmembrane complex necessary for coordinated synthesis and surface assembly of group 1 capsules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Condition—E. coli K-12 strain LE392 (supE44 supF58 hsdR514 galK2 galT22 metB1 trpR55 lacY1) was used for all genetic manipulations and purification of proteins. A Wza-deficient mutant (E. coli CWG281) derived from E. coli E69 serotype O9a: K30:H12 (17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used for complementation studies. E. coli E69 isolate contains two copies of the wza-wzb-wzc genes on its chromosome, and both encode proteins that can function to varying efficiency in K30 CPS assembly (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One copy (designated wza-wzb-wzcK30) resides in the cps (K30 biosynthesis gene cluster), and the other (wza-wzb-wzc22min)is in a locus found in many E. coli isolates (18.Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) at a position corresponding to 22 min on the E. coli K-12 map. The wzb-wzc22min genes have also been called etp-etk (18.Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and their products have broader physiological activities (19.Klein G. Dartigalongue C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Complementation experiments were performed in a background in which the 22-min locus has been inactivated by a polar insertion (wza22min::aadA; Ref. 17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and all functional and structural characterization reported here involves only the Wza (and Wzc) proteins encoded by the K30 biosynthesis cps locus. The E. coli wza-null mutant CWG281 (wzaK30::aacC1, wza22min::aadA; Gmr, Spr) was reported previously (17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as was the wzc-null strain, CWG285 (wzcK30::aacC1, wza22min::aadA) (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with arabinose (0.02 or 0.006%), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml) or gentamicin (15 μg/ml) where appropriate.Plasmid Construction—A hexahistidine (His6) tag was added to the C terminus of Wza. The sequence encoding the 6 histidine residues and the stop codon was provided by two complementary oligonucleotides (JD135, 5′-CCCAACCATCACCATCACCATCACTAACTGCA-3′; and JD136, 5′-GTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTTGGG-3′). The annealed oligonucleotides possessing a PstI overhang were ligated to MscI-PstI-digested pWQ126 (17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pWQ300, expresses WzaHis6 under the control of the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter in pBAD24 (20.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3906) Google Scholar).To obtain a Wza derivative that is not acylated but is processed, the lipoprotein consensus signal sequence and N-terminal 5 amino acid residues of mature Wza were replaced by the corresponding sequence from OmpF of E. coli K-12. Two complementary oligonucleotides providing the replacement sequence (OmpFSS1, 5′-AATTCACCATGATGAAGCGCAATATTCTGGCAGTGATCGTCCCTGCTCTGTTAGTAGCAGGTACTGCAAACGCTGCAGAAATCTATAACG-3′; and OmpFSS2, 5′-TCGACGTTATAGATTTCTGCAGCGTTGCAGTACCTGCTACTAACAGAGCAGGGACGATCACTGCCAGAATATTGCGCTTCATCATGGTG-3′) were annealed giving terminal EcoRI and SalI overhangs. The fragment was ligated into pBAD24 (20.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3906) Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI and SalI to obtain pWQ301. The region of the wza open reading frame corresponding to amino acids 8–359 of the mature Wza protein was amplified by PCR from E. coli E69 using primers wzaaa8SalI (5′-GTACGCGTCGACGGATTGAACAGTCTGCGTAAA-3′) and wzaHindIII (5′-CTCCCAAGCTTTTAGTTTGGCCATCTCTCTTAATGTAT-3′); introduced SalI and HindIII sites underlined. The SalI- and HindIII-digested PCR product was ligated into SalI/HindIII-digested pWQ301. The resulting plasmid, pWQ302, expresses a chimeric mature Wza* protein comprising the N-terminal 5 amino acid residues of OmpF plus 2 additional residues (derived from the introduced SalI site) and Wza beginning at amino acid residue 8. To obtain a Wza* derivative containing a C-terminal His6 tag, plasmid pWQ302 was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and the 750-bp fragment was ligated to the 4.9-kb NcoI-EcoRI fragment of pWQ300 to give pWQ303.A C-terminal truncation derivative of Wza (WzaΔ348–359) was also constructed, in which the last 12 amino acid residues were deleted. Truncation of wza was achieved by PCR amplification of wza from E. coli E69 using primer pairs JD125 (17.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and JN20 5′-AACTGCAGTTACATATCATGAACACCTGATATTG-3′ (PstI site is underlined, stop codon is in bold). The PCR fragment was cloned into pBAD24 using the PstI and EcoRI restriction sites to give pWQ304.Plasmid pWQ305 expresses an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Wzc derivative under the control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter. To construct the plasmid, an NcoI-SalI fragment encoding WzcHis6 was isolated from the pET-based plasmid pWQ141 (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cloned into pBAD24 (20.Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3906) Google Scholar) to generate pWQ305. In some experiments, native Wzc was used. This was expressed from plasmid pWQ130, a pBAD18-Km derivative described previously (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).To maintain the plasmids expressing Wza and WzcHis6 together in E. coli LE392, the origin and antibiotic resistance cassette of the native Wza-expressing plasmid, pWQ126, was exchanged. Plasmid pWQ126 was digested with ClaI and ScaI, and the 3.3-kbp fragment containing araC and PBADwza was ligated to pACYC184 previously digested with EcoRV and ClaI. This resulted in plasmid pWQ306 with a chloramphenicol resistance marker and Wza expression under control of the PBAD promoter.The nucleotide sequences of all PCR-amplified products were verified using the service at the University of Guelph Molecular Supercenter.Protein Purification—Proteins were overexpressed by growing cells containing the arabinose-inducible pBAD24 derivatives to an A600 of 0.5 and inducing for 3 h at 37 °C following addition of 0.006% (final concentration) l-arabinose. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell. Cell envelopes were isolated in a pellet following ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the IM was solubilized in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2% N-laurylsarcosinate for 1 h at room temperature. The insoluble OM pellet collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% SB 3–14 and 150 mm NaCl (for the native Wza protein), or 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% SB 3–14 and 500 mm NaCl (for His6-tagged derivatives). After solubilization overnight at room temperature, the remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h.For purification of His6-tagged proteins, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.05% SB 3–14 and 500 mm NaCl. His6-tagged proteins were eluted with a step gradient using the same buffer containing 1 m imidazole. Detergent exchange was achieved on an anion-exchange column (5-ml Econo-Pac High Q; Bio-Rad) washed with at least 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and either 0.008% DDM (n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; Sigma) or 0.3% octyl-polyoxyethylene (Bachem). Protein was eluted with 1 m NaCl in the same buffer.Wza was purified by applying the OM extract to the anion-exchange column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% SB 3–14. Wza-containing fractions were eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.05% SB 3–14 and reloaded to the anion exchange column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.008% DDM. After washing with 100 ml of the same buffer, Wza was eluted with a gradient of 0.05–1 m NaCl. Fractions containing Wza were applied to a hydroxyapatite column (5-ml Econo-PacCHT-II, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.008% DDM and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.008% DDM. To concentrate Wza, the eluted protein was rebound to the anion exchange column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.008% DDM. Elution was performed using the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl.Between the different purification steps, buffer was exchanged by using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) or by dialysis. All chromatography steps were performed on a AKTA Explorer 100 system (Amersham Biosciences).Separation of Inner and Outer Membranes—Whole membrane fractions obtained as described above were resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (72%/49%/26% sucrose in TE) to separate the inner and outer membranes (21.Amer A.O. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h in a swinging bucket rotor. The IM and OM fractions generated visible bands in the gradients that were collected individually. Western immunoblotting with anti-Wzc polyclonal serum (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used to verify purity of the OM; Wzc is an exclusively IM protein, and the OM fractions showed no reactivity.In Vivo Cross-linking—Cross-linking experiments were performed essentially as described elsewhere (22.Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli CWG281 (pWQ130-pWQ300), CWG281(pWQ130-pWQ126), LE392(pWQ305-pWQ306), and LE392(pWQ306) were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5). To induce expression of proteins, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.02% and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. Cultures were adjusted to give A600 = 1, washed, and concentrated 10-fold in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl. The chemical cross-linker dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP, Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature before the reaction was quenched with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final concentration). The treated cells were washed once in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and pellets were frozen overnight.Purification of Hexahistidine-tagged Protein Complexes—Pellets of cross-linked whole cells were thawed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell, and cell envelopes were isolated as described above. The cell envelope pellet containing cross-linked complexes was then solubilized for 16 h at room temperature in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 0.5% SDS, 0.25% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g and the supernatant mixed with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) to bind cross-linked complexes. In experiments involving WzcHis6, binding of residual non-cross-linked WzcHis6 presented a potential problem. To avoid this complication, the relevant cell envelope pellet was first solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2% N-laurylsarcosinate. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant containing solubilized IM (23.Filip C. Fletcher G. Wulff J.L. Earhart C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including non-cross-linked WzcHis6, was discarded. The residual pellet enriched in OM was then solubilized in n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside as described above. Binding to Ni-NTA-agarose was allowed to proceed for 16 h at room temperature on a rotating mixer. The resin was then washed extensively with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, 8 m urea, and 0.5% SDS followed by a second wash step using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, 4 m urea, 0.5% SDS, and 5 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted from the resin with PAGE gel loading buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen, containing no reducing agents) supplemented with 0.4 m imidazole and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 (final concentration), by incubating first at room temperature for 10 min, followed by 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then split, and half received dithiothreitol (DTT) to give a final concentration of 40 mm, to cleave the cross-links. Samples with or without DTT were incubated for 10 min at 100 °C prior to separation on an 8% PAGE gel.Affinity Purification of Anti-Wza Antiserum—OM extracts containing overexpressed WzaHis6 were solubilized overnight in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.5% SDS. The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was mixed with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and then transferred into an Econo-Pac column. The column was extensively washed in sequence with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, containing 0.1% SDS and 500 mm NaCl followed by 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% SDS and 5 mm imidazole. Finally, the column was equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 28 mm NaCl. To remove serum proteins, the WzaK30 polyclonal antiserum (8.Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was first purified by chromatography on an Econo-Pac Serum IgG purification column (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing Wza antibodies were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 28 mm NaCl and loaded onto the equilibrated WzaHis6/Ni-NTA-agarose column. After sequentially washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, the Wza-specific antibodies were eluted with 4 m MgCl2. Elution fractions were separately dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 28 mm NaCl and tested for specificity in Western immunoblot analysis.Protein Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and either stained with silver (24.Heukeshoven J.

Wzc and Wza were detected by Western immunoblotting using anti-Wzc polyclonal serum (12.Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Immunocomplexes were detected by using either alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Caltag) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) as substrate, or horseradish-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) and the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).Purified Wza and WzaHis6 proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis at the University of Guelph biological mass spectrometry facility. N-terminal sequencing of purified Wza* protein was performed by Edman degradation at the University of British Columbia, Biotechnology Laboratory-Nucleic Acids Protein Service facility. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of purified Wza (0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 80 mm NaCl and 0.008% DDM) and WzaHis6 (1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3% octyl-polyoxyethylene) were performed at the Scottish circular dichroism facility at Glasgow (Scotland, United Kingdom)"

Glutaminyl cyclases (QC) 1The abbreviations used are: QCglutaminyl cyclaseAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: QCglutaminyl cyclaseAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (EC 2.3.2.5) are acyltransferases present in animals and plants that catalyze the conversion of N-terminal glutaminyl residues into pyroglutamic acid with the concomitant liberation of ammonia (Scheme 1). Several peptide hormones and proteins carry N-terminal pyroglutamyl residues. Previously, the formation of N-terminal pyroglutamate from glutamine was assumed to proceed spontaneously (1.Richter K. Kawashima E. Egger R. Kreil G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the QCs were identified more recently as catalysts of the reaction in both mammals and plants (2.Messer M. Nature. 1963; 197: 1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3.Busby Jr., W.H. Quackenbush G.E. Humm J. Youngblood W.W. Kizer J.S. J. Biol.

Generally, QCs from both mammalian and plant sources appear to be very similar monomeric proteins that are expressed in the secretory pathways and have similar molecular masses, ∼33 and ∼40 kDa, respectively (6.Pohl T. Zimmer M. Mugele K. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7.Zerhouni S. Amrani A. Nijs M. Smolders N. Azarkan M. Vincentelli J. Looze Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Their primary structures, however, reveal no sequence homology, and the enzymes feature completely different folding patterns. Whereas plant QC consists almost solely of β-sheet structure, mammalian QCs are predicted to possess an α/β-fold (8.Oberg K.A. Ruysschaert J.M. Azarkan M. Smolders N. Zerhouni S. Wintjens R. Amrani A. Looze Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9.Bateman Jr., R.C. Temple J.S. Misquitta S.A. Booth R.E.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10849-10857Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, plant QC does not share sequence or structural homology to other plant enzymes, belonging, apparently, to a separate enzyme subfamily (4.Dahl S.W. Slaughter C. Lauritzen C. Bateman Jr., R.C. Connerton I. Pedersen J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mammalian QCs, however, exhibit remarkable homology toward bacterial aminopeptidases, suggesting their evolutionary origin in this protein family (9.Bateman Jr., R.C. Temple J.S. Misquitta S.A. Booth R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Investigating the substrate specificity of both enzymes, we recently found differences between papaya and human QC (24.Schilling S. Manhart S. Hoffmann T. Ludwig H.-H. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the catalysis of cyclization of and the inhibition by modified N-terminal residues were quite different, both enzymes catalyzed the cyclization of oligopeptides with similar specificity rate constants. Moreover, they also catalyzed the formation of a five-membered lactam ring from l-β-homoglutaminyl peptides. Based on the present state of knowledge, it is assumed that plant and animal QCs catalyze the formation of N-terminal pyroglutamic acid (pGlu) residues by enabling the intramolecular cyclization of the glutaminyl residue in a non-covalent manner (11.Gololobov M.Y. Song I. Wang W. Bateman Jr., R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12.Temple J.S. Song I. Burns K.H. Bateman Jr., R.C. Korean J. Biol. Sci. 1998; 2: 243-248Crossref Google Scholar). However, the results of the substrate specificity study revealed differences in substrate recognition by both enzymes.Thus, a more detailed analysis of the inhibition pattern of plant and human QCs should help to deepen our understanding of QC catalysis. To date, however, systematic inhibitor data exist only for plant QC, which is competitively inhibited by peptides containing an N-terminal proline residue (13.Gololobov M.Y. Wang W. Bateman Jr., R.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 395-398PubMed Google Scholar), whereas human QC was shown to be inactivated by 1,10-phenanthroline and reduced 6-methylpterin (3.Busby Jr., W.H. Quackenbush G.E. Humm J. Youngblood W.W. Kizer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8532-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the inhibiting potency of heterocyclic compounds from different structural classes. Among them, imidazole and structurally related compounds were found to be the most efficient competitive inhibitors of human QC. The data provide the first insights into enzyme/inhibitor interactions, offer clues for further optimization of the inhibitory structure, and reveal novel aspects of human QC catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human QC was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described previously (10.Schilling S. Hoffmann T. Rosche F. Manhart S. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10849-10857Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chemicals were purchased as follows. Glutamate dehydrogenase was from Fluka, pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase came from Qiagen, H-Gln-AMC and H-Gln-Gln-OH were from Bachem, NADH/H+ and α-ketoglutaric acid were from Sigma, and the imidazole derivatives were from Acros, Sigma-Aldrich, Asinex, TimTec, and InterBioScreen. Papaya QC was purified from crude papain as described previously (14.Schilling S. Hoffmann T. Wermann M. Heiser U. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical or high pressure liquid chromatography grade.QC Assays—QC activity was assayed essentially as described elsewhere (14.Schilling S. Hoffmann T. Wermann M. Heiser U. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay reactions (250 μl) consisted of varying concentrations (∼0.25–4 Km) of H-Gln-AMC or H-Gln-Gln-OH in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. In some cases, assay buffer also contained up to 5 mm EDTA, which has been shown to stabilize the auxiliary enzyme (15.Tsuru D. Fujiwara K. Kado K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ki values of QC inhibition were not influenced by EDTA. In the case of the spectrophotometric assay, samples additionally contained 30 units/ml glutamic acid dehydrogenase, 0.25 mm NADH/H+, and 15 mm α-ketoglutaric acid. Reactions were started by the addition of QC, and activity was monitored by recording the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. In contrast, the assay samples for the fluorometric detection of QC activity contained only buffer and 0.4 units/ml pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase as an auxiliary enzyme. The excitation/emission wavelengths were 380/460 nm. Reactions were started by the addition of QC. QC activity was determined from a standard curve of AMC under assay conditions. All determinations were carried out at 30 °C using either the TECAN SpectraFluor Plus or the BMG Novostar reader for microplates.Inhibitor Assay—For inhibitor testing, the sample composition was the same as described above, except for the addition of the inhibitory compound. For rapid inhibitor screening, samples contained up to 4 mm of the respective imidazole derivative and a substrate concentration equal to the Km value of the test substrate. For detailed investigations of the inhibition and determination of Ki values, the influence of the inhibitor on the auxiliary enzymes was investigated first. In no case was an influence on one of the auxiliary enzymes detected, enabling the reliable determination of the QC inhibition. The inhibition constants were evaluated by fitting the data of the obtained progress curves according to the general equation for competitive inhibition using GraFit software (version 5.0.4. for windows, Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK).pH Dependence—For the investigation of the pH dependence of QC catalysis and inhibition, the previously developed fluorometric assay was used (14.Schilling S. Hoffmann T. Wermann M. Heiser U. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Determinations were carried out at 30 °C in a buffer originally used by Ellis and Morrison consisting of 0.06 m acetic acid, 0.06 m Mes, and 0.12 m Tris (16.Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The buffer provides a constant ionic strength over the entire pH range chosen. Additionally, the activity of human QC acting on H-Gln-AMC has shown to be quite independent from variations in ionic strength. The resulting pH dependence data were fitted to single dissociation models for the inhibitors or to equations that account for two dissociating groups in the case of the kinetic parameter Km using Grafit software. Because of the reduced stability and catalytic activity of the auxiliary enzyme pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase under acidic and basic conditions, the study was limited to the range between 5.5 and 8.5 pH.Enzyme Inactivation/Reactivation Procedures—An aliquot of human QC (0.1–0.5 mg, 1 mg/ml) was inactivated overnight by dialysis against a 3000-fold excess of 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, or 5 mm dipicolinic acid in 0.05 m Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 6.8. Subsequently, the inactivating agent was carefully removed by dialysis (three cycles, 2000-fold excess) of the samples against 0.05 m Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. Reactivation experiments were performed at room temperature for 15 min using Zn2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, K+, and Co2+ ions at concentrations of 1, 0.5, and 0.25 mm in 0.025 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.8, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. QC activity assays were performed in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 2 mm EDTA to avoid a rapid reactivation by the traces of metal ions present in buffer solutions.RESULTSInhibition by Imidazole—Because neither glutamic acid dehydrogenase nor pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase were inhibited by imidazole in the concentration range used, both the fluorometric as well as the spectrophotometric assay could be applied. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the fluorometric assay data (Fig. 1) reveals competitive inhibition by imidazole (inset in Fig. 1). Thus, imidazole binds in the active site completely blocking substrate conversion. The Ki values of 103 ± 4 and 129 ± 8 μm obtained with the fluorometric and chromogenic assay, respectively, match very well. Interestingly, benzimidazole inhibits human QC similarly as does imidazole, also exhibiting linear competition and a Ki value of 138 ± 5 μm. Obviously, the condensed ring structure does not influence significantly the binding of the compound under the conditions used. Driven by the similar inhibitory characteristics of imidazole and benzimidazole, derivatives of both compounds were tested to identify secondary interactions that improve or diminish their inhibitory potency.Fig. 1Lineweaver-Burk plots for human QC catalyzed cyclization of H-Gln-AMC in presence of various concentrations of imidazole between 0.03 and 1 mm. The inset shows a secondary plot of the obtained slopes of the Lineweaver-Burk evaluation versus the inhibitor concentrations. The conditions were 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Imidazole Derivatives—Imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives carrying substituents at different positions of the ring system were tested, and the influence of the substituents was compared (Table I).

In contrast, N-ω-acetylated histamine proved to be a potent inhibitory compound. Small substituents in both positions (4 and 5) seemed to have only minor effects on binding, as indicated by the similar inhibition constants of 5-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-imidazole and imidazole itself. Larger and more bulky groups attached to these sites diminished or abolished binding of the compounds to the enzyme. However, some of the substituents of the tested imidazole derivatives are known to exert negative inductive or mesomeric effects, thereby reducing the electron density within the imidazole ring. This could also contribute to poorer binding. The different Ki values detected for l-histidine and histidinamide also indicate an influence of the charge of the inhibitors on binding. Evidence for electrostatic repulsion of charged substrates was observed previously during an investigation of the substrate specificity of QC, i.e. glutaminamide was readily converted to products by human QC, but glutamine was not cyclized (24.Schilling S. Manhart S. Hoffmann T. Ludwig H.-H. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).C-2 derivatives—All derivatives tested showed a diminished binding to the active site of QC relative to imidazole. Obviously, there is a strong impact on proper binding by any additional atom in this position. For instance, the simple addition of a methyl group to form 2-methyl-benzylimidazole reduces the inhibition constant of the interaction by about one order of magnitude. A very similar relation becomes evident comparing the Ki values for benzimidazole and 2-amino-benzimidazole.N-1 Derivatives—Among the imidazole derivatives tested as inhibitors of human QC, most compounds that had reduced Ki values compared with imidazole contained modifications at the N-1 nitrogen atom (Table I). Interestingly, only minor changes in the N-substituent were necessary for substantial loss of inhibitory power. This can be seen when comparing 1-benzylimidazole, 1-benzoylimidazole, and phenylimidazole as QC inhibitors. The data suggest, however, that steric hindrance for QC binding of N-1 derivatives is marginal, opening up the possibility for the development of even more potent QC inhibitors by structure optimization of N-1 modified imidazole compounds.Compound Data Base Screening—The apparent improvement of the inhibitory power obtained by N-1 substitutions of the imidazole ring allowed us to identify highly potent inhibitors of QC by data base screening. Some of the most potent inhibitors are shown in Table II. In fact, the observed inhibition constants are one order of magnitude lower as compared with those determined in the initial structure-activity relationship experiments (Table I). This approach led finally to the identification of hit compounds exhibiting Ki values of the QC inhibition in the nm range.Table IIInhibition of human QC by N1 derivatives selected from compound databases Open table in a new tab Effect of 1,4 and 1,5 Derivatization—The inhibition constants obtained for the 4(5)-substituted imidazole derivatives already indicated that there are restrictions for efficient binding to the enzyme. An individual contribution of position 4 and 5, however, were undetectable, because both are identical with respect to substitutions at one carbon. The individual effect of substitutions in position 4 and 5 was analyzed by comparing the inhibitory constants of l-histamine and the two intermediates in the biological degradation of histamine, 1-methyl-4-histamine, and 1-methyl-5-histamine (Table III). Interestingly, whereas methylation of one nitrogen of histamine forming 1-methyl-5-histamine improved the inhibitory activity considerably, methylation of the other nitrogen (1-methyl-4-histamine) led to a near total loss of inhibitory potential. Thus, steric hindrance by the carbon atom adjacent to the basic nitrogen seems to occur, which provides further support for the key role of the basic nitrogen in binding of the imidazole derivatives to the enzyme.Table IIIInhibition of human QC by l-histamine and two derivatives Open table in a new tab pH Dependence—The role of the basic nitrogen of imidazole was further characterized through an investigation of the pH-dependence of QC inhibition. Because of a limited catalytic activity as well as the reduced stability of the auxiliary enzyme pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase, this analysis was limited to a pH range between pH 5.5 and 8.5. Because imidazole has a pKa value near neutrality, however, this range was assumed to be sufficiently wide for inspecting the influence of protonation and deprotonation of the inhibitor. The inhibition of the QC-catalyzed reaction showed a strict dependence on the pH value (Fig. 2). With decreasing pH, the Ki-value of imidazole increased drastically, exhibiting a 25-fold increase when moving from pH 8 to 5.5. Furthermore, in the basic pH region, Ki was constant, suggesting that the potency of QC inhibition depends on deprotonation of the imidazole derivatives. This was also corroborated by fitting of the data to a single dissociation model (Fig. 2). The dissociating group influencing the inhibitory properties of imidazole was characterized by a pKa value that is in excellent agreement with the pKa of the basic nitrogen of imidazole (Table IV). Similar pH dependences were obtained for QC inhibition by benzimidazole and 1-methylimidazole (Fig. 2). For both compounds, the kinetically determined pKa values compare well with the pKa values determined by titration (Table IV). The dependence of the kinetic parameters Km and kcat on the pH-value was also analyzed (data not shown). Whereas the turnover number for conversion of H-Gln-AMC was not affected in the pH range between 5.5 and 8.5, the Michaelis constant showed a simple pH dependence with an optimum between pH 7.5–8, tending to increase in the acidic and basic pH region. The pH dependence of Km revealed a slope of 1 in the acidic pH range, reflecting the presence of a single underlying dissociative group. The kinetically determined pKa value in the acidic range was nearly identical to the pKa of the substrate H-Gln-AMC (Table IV). In the basic pH range, data revealed a pKa value of 8.6 ± 0.1, apparently reflecting a dissociating group of the QC protein.Fig. 2The pH-dependence of the inhibition constant of imidazole (circles), benzimidazole (triangles), and 1-methylimidazole (squares) inhibiting human QC catalyzed cyclization of H-Gln-AMC. Data points were fitted to a single dissociation model and revealed pKa values of 6.94 ± 0.02, 6.93 ± 0.03 and 5.60 ± 0.05 for imidazole, 1-methylimidazole, and benzimidazole, respectively. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C in 0.06 m acetic acid, 0.06 m Mes, and 0.12 m Tris adjusted to the respective pH by the addition of NaOH or HCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IVComparison of the dissociation constants of inhibitors and a substrate determined by the pH-dependence of inhibitory and Michelis-Menten constants as well as by acid/base titrationCompoundParameterpKa kinetic determinationpKa titrimetric determinationImidazoleKi6.94 ± 0.026.946 ± 0.003BenzimidazoleKi5.60 ± 0.055.500 ± 0.0101-MethylimidazoleKi6.93 ± 0.037.000 ± 0.003H-Gln-AMCKM(I)6.81 ± 0.046.830 ± 0.010KM(II)8.60 ± 0.10— Open table in a new tab Inhibition by Heterocyclic Chelators—The inhibition of porcine QC by 1,10-phenanthroline has already been described (3.Busby Jr., W.H.

Also, in addition to being inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, human QC-catalyzed substrate cyclization was abolished in presence of dipicolinic acid, another inhibitor of metalloenzymes. Both chelators inhibited QC in a competitive and time-dependent manner, i.e. initial activity that was already competitively inhibited was found to be further reduced after prolonged incubation with the compounds (Fig. 3). Interestingly, EDTA did not show remarkable inhibition regardless of incubation time or under any conditions.Fig. 3Inhibition of human QC by metal-chelating reagents. Concentration dependence of inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline (circles) and EDTA (triangles) is shown. Residual activity of QC in the presence of either compound was determined directly after the addition (dotted traces) or preincubation of QC with the respective reagent for 15 min at 30 °C (continuous line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Human QC was almost completely inactivated after extensive dialysis against 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline or 5 mm dipicolinic acid. After repeated dialysis overnight against chelator-free buffer solutions, QC activity was partially reactivated up to 50–60% (data not shown). However, when dialyzed against buffers containing 1 mm EDTA, no reactivation was observed.Near-total restoration of QC activity after inactivation by either dipicolinic acid or 1,10-phenanthroline was achieved by incubating the protein for 10 min with 0.5 mm ZnSO4 in presence of 0.5 mm EDTA (Fig. 4). Partial restoration of QC activity was similarly obtained using Co2+ and Mn2+ ions for reactivation. Even in the presence of 0.25 mm Zn2+, a reactivation to 25% of the original activity was possible (data not shown). No reactivation was observed applying Ni2+, Ca2+, or K+ ions. Similarly, incubation of fully active QC with these ions had no effect on the enzyme activity.Fig. 4Reactivation of human QC with monovalent and divalent metal ions. QC was nearly inactivated by the addition of 2 mm dipicolinic acid in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8. Subsequently, the enzyme was subjected to dialysis against 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. Reactivation of the enzyme was achieved by incubation of the inactivated enzyme sample with metal ions at a concentration of 0.5 mm in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA to avoid an unspecific reactivation by traces of metal ions present in buffer solutions. Controls are given by enzyme samples that were not inactivated but also dialyzed against the EDTA solution as the inactivated enzyme (+EDTA) and by enzyme samples that were dialyzed against buffer solutions without added EDTA (–EDTA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONAfter a more detailed comparison, human QC does not seem to have much in common with its counterpart from the plant Carica papaya except for the catalyzed reaction. In a recent study of substrate specificity, we found a relatively similar proficiency for glutaminyl cyclization by both enzymes (24.Schilling S. Manhart S. Hoffmann T. Ludwig H.-H. Wasternack C. Demuth H.-U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, differences were observed in binding and conversion of peptides bearing the modified N-terminal glutaminyl residues γ-hydrazide or γ-methylamide. Although human QC is inhibited by the hydrazide derivative (not papaya QC), only the methylamide derivative"
https://openalex.org/W2065004565,"Abstract Calreticulin is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal Ca2+-binding chaperone involved in folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins via the “calreticulin-calnexin cycle.” We reconstituted ER of calreticulin-deficient cells with N-terminal histidine (His25, His82, His128, and His153) calreticulin mutants and carried out a functional analysis. In crt-/- cells bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release is altered, and the reestablishment of bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release was used as a marker for calreticulin function. Bradykinin-dependent Ca2+ release from the ER was rescued by wild type calreticulin and by the His25, His82, or His128 mutant but not by the His153 mutant. Wild type calreticulin and the His25, His82, and His128 mutants all prevented in vitro thermal aggregation of malate dehydrogenase and IgY, whereas the His153 mutant did not, indicating that His153 chaperone function was impaired. Biophysical analysis of His153 mutant revealed that conformation changes in calreticulin mutant may be responsible for the loss of its chaperone activity. We conclude that mutation of a single amino acid residue in calreticulin has devastating consequences for its chaperone function, indicating that mutations in chaperones may play a significant role in protein folding disorders."

Thus, the other nutritionally available vitamer forms in this family must be converted to PLP. The enzymes that are conventionally involved in the metabolism are an ATP dependent pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) (3.McCormick D.B. Gregory M.E. Snell E.E. J. Biol.

The major pathways of vitamin B6 metabolism have been established for decades, but little is known of how the concentration of PLP is controlled in mammalian tissues. Studies on the homeostasis have shown that there is not a single mechanism. The factors for the regulation of PLP may include catabolism of PLP by PLP phosphatase, activities of pyridoxal kinase and PNP oxidase, degree of protein binding of the synthesized coenzyme, and transport of the precursors (10.Snell E.E. Haskell B.E. Florkin M. Stotz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Vol. 21. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 47-71Google Scholar, 11.Anderson B.B. Newmark P.A. Rawlins M. Nature. 1974; 250: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although PNP oxidase plays a kinetic role in regulating the level of PLP formation (12.McCormick D.B. Merrill A.H. Tryfiates G.P. Vitamin B6 Metabolism and Role in Growth. Food and Nutrition Press, Westport, CT1980: 1-26Google Scholar, 13.Kwon O.-S. Kwok F. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22136-22140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PLP availability is mainly dependent on protein binding and phosphatase action (10.Snell E.E. Haskell B.E. Florkin M.

Thus, the phosphatase action may be important in the regulation of PLP concentration. A PLP-specific phosphatase has been purified from human erythrocytes (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular properties including the molecular weight, pH optimum, substrate specificity, and metal requirement indicate that the PLP phosphatase distinct from other known phosphatases. Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) also hydrolyze PLP and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), but they have broad substrate specificity for phosphomonoesters (17.Harris H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 186: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 18.Bull H. Murray P.G. Thomas A.M. Nelson P.N. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase is resistant to fluoride and inhibited by L(+)-tartrate and levamisole, whereas the PLP-specific phosphatase not. Acid phosphatase is not inhibited by fluoride and EDTA. The PLP phosphatase is most active at physiological pH and requires Mg2+ for activity (19.Fonda M.L. Zhang Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is a dimer with a molecular mass of 64 kDa, and has a Km value of ∼1 μm for PLP, which is 10-fold lower than that reported with other phosphatases (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data obtained in chemical modification studies revealed that PLP phosphatase has essential residues such as cysteine, arginine, histidine, and a carboxylate group at or near the active site (20.Gao G. Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7163-7168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Gao G. Fonda M.L. J. Biol.

Although the PLP-specific phosphatase has been purified and characterized, a cDNA encoding PLP phosphatase has not yet been identified. Here we cloned cDNAs encoding PLP phosphatase from human and mouse. In addition, we describe the high efficiency expression of the protein in Escherichia coli with its kinetic properties and the tissue-specific expression. Materials—We purchased a human brain cDNA library as well as a dot blot array containing poly(A)+ RNAs from human tissues from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Restriction endonuclease and other cloning reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Promega. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Biosciences using a commercial random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences). All other reagentgrade chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers. Identification and Cloning of Human Brain PLP Phosphatase (hPLPP) cDNA—BLAST searches, conducted with PLP phosphatase peptides (AQGVLFDCDGVL and AVLVGYDEHFSFAK) as query sequences, revealed a full match with the predicted amino acid sequence of a cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM020315). This clone was used to design PCR primers for the cloning of human PLP phosphatase cDNA. We employed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using hPLPP-specific primer 1 (5′-CGATGCTGAAGTTCTCCGTGATGCAC-3′), AP1 anchor primer, and Marathon Ready cDNA (human whole brain, Clontech) as a template. PCR was carried out with betaine in a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s annealing; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min extension). The resulting PCR product of 737 bp fragment revealed that the 5′-untranslated region is completely matched except 9 bp shorter than the cDNA from lung carcinoma. The full-length open reading frame (ORF) of 891 bp was amplified using the hPLPP-specific primers (sense, 5′-GGATCCGGCTGCATGGCGCGCTGCGA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGATCCGGGGTGG GCCTGTGGCTGCAG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY125047). A multiple protein sequence alignment of the human PLP phosphatase clone, along with the sequences most closely related to it, was performed using the ClustalW (version 1.74) program (23.Thompson J.D. Hinggins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar), and the resulting aligned sequence were shaded using Boxshade. Identification of the chromosomal localization of the human PLP phosphatase was performed by a BLASTN search of the human genome sequences of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Cloning of Mouse Brain PLP Phosphatase (mPLPP) cDNA—We also identified a mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (GenBank™ accession number AK043228) with high similarity to human PLP phosphatase. To obtain a full-length cDNA corresponding to this EST clone, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were performed using mouse brain cDNA (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two consecutive PCR reactions using Ex Taq polymerase (Takara) were performed as follows: (1) 5′-RACE, 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 63 °C for 40 s, followed by primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min with 5′-RACE primer (5′-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCAT-3′) and mPLPP-specific primer 1 (5′-ATCCCAGCCTCCCTTCACT-3′); and (2) 3′-RACE, 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 40 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 5 min with 3′-RACE primer (5′-CTGTGAATGCTGCGACTACGAT-3′) and mPLPP-specific primer 2 (5′-ATGGAAGGGAGGCTGGGATCCAGG-3′). The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Expression in E. coli and Purification of Human PLP Phosphatase— The PLP phosphatase cDNA was cloned between the BamHI of the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) after PCR amplification. Transformants of E. coli M15/pRER4 with the resulting pQE30-hPLPP construct were grown at 37 °C in 200 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The plasmid pREP4 constitutively expresses the Lac repressor protein encoded by the lacI gene to reduce the basal level of expression (Qiagen). When that culture had grown to an A600 of 0.6, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After inducing the expression of the PLP phosphatase protein for 16 h at 25 °C cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. The cell suspension was sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was then poured into the column loaded with the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), washed with Tris buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, and eluted protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The purity of the eluted protein was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE using Coomassie blue staining to visualize the protein. Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Characterization—The enzymatic activity of PLP phosphatase was measured at pH 7.4 in 40 mm triethanolamine-HCl. The rate of production of pyridoxal from PLP was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 390 nm for at least 3 min. The initial velocity data were fitted by a least-squares method to the Line-weaver-Burk transformation of the following equation,υ=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S]) where [S] represents the concentration of the varied substrate PLP, and Km represents the Michaelis constant. A molecular weight of 64,000 for PLP phosphatase with a specific activity of 1.4 μmol·min–1mg–1 was used in the calculations of molar enzyme concentrations. One unit of specific activity is defined as the amount of protein that catalyzes the formation of pyridoxal/min from PLP. PLP is known to have an extinction coefficient of 4900 cm–1m–1 at pH 7. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the reagent and micro procedure from Pierce Chemical Co. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. In addition, hydrolysis of all other substrates was measured in 40 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 4 mm MgCl2. The release of free phosphate from potential substrates was measured colorimetrically as the molybdate complex with malachite green (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Rose Z.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Multiple Tissue Expression Array—A Northern filter containing 8 human tissue-specific poly(A)+ RNAs and a dot blot array containing human poly(A)+ RNAs from various adult tissues, fetal tissues, and cancer cell lines were prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech). The filters were then hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h with 32P-labeled cDNA probe containing the complete ORF. After washing as recommended by the manufacturer, blots were exposed to x-ray films at –70 °C with an intensifying screen for the appropriate time period. For scanning densitometry, the blot was scanned and BioLab Image software was used to quantify the signals. Blots were reprobed with β-actin as a loading control. Identification and Cloning of the PLP Phosphatase cDNA from Human and Mouse—Using two tryptic peptide sequences from the erythrocytes PLP phosphatase previously reported by Gao and Fonda (21.Gao G. Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8234-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conducted NCBI BLAST searches of the human EST data base. A cDNA clone encoding both peptide sequences, designated a hypothetical protein dj37E 16.5 from lung carcinoma (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM020315) was identified. When the tryptic peptide sequences were aligned with the deduced amino acid sequence there was a perfect match, confirming that the cDNA in the EST GenBank™ data base codes for PLP phosphatase. We used the sequence information for designing specific primers for PCR amplification utilizing a human brain cDNA library. Sequencing of this clone revealed that the brain cDNA is identical to the hypothetical protein from lung carcinoma. The ORF encodes a 296-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 31698 Da. A computer calculation reveals that the isoelectric point for the protein is 6.12. ScanProsite software analysis by ExPASy showed that the deduced human protein has the following putative post-translational modification sites: 2 N-glycosylation sites, 7 phosphorylation sites, and 4 N-myristoylation sites. In addition, we cloned a complete mouse homologue by 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE-PCR using an EST sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AK043228). As shown in Fig. 1, the longest cDNA contains 1978 bp consisting of a 879-bp ORF, a 13-bp 5′-untranslated region, and a 1086-bp 3′-noncoding region. The 3′-end of the sequence contains a poly(A) stretch, preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal AATAAA. The open reading frame encodes a 292-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 31512 Da and pI of 5.53. The deduced protein has a putative N-glycosylation site, 5 phosphorylation sites, and 4 amidation sites. Using BLAST searches of the EST data bases, we found putative PLP phosphatases in various species. Multiple alignment of the protein sequence of PLP phosphatase with other homologous proteins or putative proteins was performed using the ClustalW program as shown in Fig. 2. All of the PLP phosphatases are highly homologous at the amino acid sequence level. The mouse PLP phosphatase sequence shows a high degree of similarity (94% identity and 98% similarity) with the human enzyme. The sequence identities of human PLP phosphatase to the hypothetical proteins from Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and E. Coli are 36, 28, 26, 25, 31, and 27%, respectively, and similarities share 77, 65, 68, 60, 70, and 66%, respectively. This result suggests that PLP phosphatase is highly homologous and widely expressed throughout evolution. The tryptic sequences from human erythrocytes enzyme that are perfectly matched with the deduced amino sequence are indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2. Genomic Organization and Chromosomal Localization—Using PLPP cDNA as a query sequence, a BLAST analysis of the genomic sequence available through NCBI Web site mapped the PLP phosphatase gene to human chromosome 22q12.3. Mouse PLP phosphatase gene is located on chromosome 15.E1 with a very similar genomic organization to that observed in human. The ORF of PLP phosphatase is encoded by two exons as shown in Fig. 3. The intron/exon junctions followed the GT/AG rule (25.Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar) and were flanked by conserved sequences. The lariate branch-point in the consensus sequence is located at 23 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice site. The possible exon/intron junction site in mouse cDNA is also indicated by a slash in Fig. 1. Functional Expression and Catalytic Properties of the Human Recombinant Enzyme—After E. coli M15/pQE30-hPLPP was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the His6-tagged recombinant PLP phosphatase yielded a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to about 15% of the total applied protein (Fig. 4). Most of the expressed protein was found in the soluble extract after lysis of the cells. As shown in Table I, the crude extraction from 200 ml of cells contained ∼14.5 mg of total protein and 0.14 units/mg of PLP phosphatase activity. Purification by binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin and elution with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole resulted in a near homogeneous preparation. The purified recombinant protein had a specific activity of 1.4 units/mg and appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 32 kDa agreeing with the value calculated from the deduced sequence (Fig. 4, lane 6).Table IPurification of human recombinant PLP-phosphatasePurification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldmgnmol/min/mgfold%Crude extract14.51381100Affinity chromatography: Ni-NTA agarose1.413209.692.3 Open table in a new tab Activity of the human PLP phosphatase toward PLP, PNP, and PMP was determined (Table II). Recombinant human enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to PLP, and the Michaelis constant and kcat value for this reactant was 2.5 μm and 1.52 s–1, respectively. Km for PNP and PMP were 43 and 81 μm, respectively, and kcat values were 1.25 and 0.45 s–1, respectively, whereas activity with p-nitrophenyl phosphate was very low. Thus, the specificity constant of the recombinant PLP phosphatase was highest with PLP followed by PNP. The recombinant enzyme requires a divalent ion for activity, and Mg+2 is the most effective in catalyzing the dephosphorylation of PLP.Table IIKinetics of purified PLP-phosphatase with various substratesCompoundKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmμmol/min/mgs-1m-1 s-1PLP2.5 ± 0.21.42 ± 0.041.526.08 × 105PNP43.4 ± 5.01.17 ± 0.171.252.70 × 104PMP80.6 ± 7.20.42 ± 0.060.455.58 × 103p-NPPaActivity with 40 μmp-nitrophenylphosphate.0.04 ± 0.01a Activity with 40 μmp-nitrophenylphosphate. Open table in a new tab To investigate the state of aggregation of recombinant human PLP phosphatase, the purified enzyme was examined by FPLC gel filtration at pH 7.4 in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer. The elution profile of the enzyme exhibits a symmetrical peak characterized by a molecular mass of about 60 kDa when the concentration of the recombinant protein in the fraction is around 10 μm (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that the recombinant enzyme is a dimer, agreeing with previous data for the erythrocyte enzyme. Tissue-specific Expression of Human PLP Phosphatase—Dot blot array and Northern blot analyses were used to determine the expression pattern for PLP phosphatase in human tissues. As evident by multiple tissue expression (MTE™) array analysis, PLP phosphatase transcripts were detected in most tissues, indicating ubiquitous expression. However, the level of expression was markedly variable. PLP phosphatase was most highly represented in all the regions of central nerve system except the spinal cord (Fig. 5). The other major sites of expression were found in liver and testis. In fetus, expression levels of PLP phosphatase transcript showed a rather even distribution in all organs except brain. Like adult, fetal brain expressed PLP phosphatase transcript with a very high level. To determine the size of mRNA transcripts, Northern blots analyses were performed. A single 2.1-kb transcript was detected with variable intensity in all adult tissues examined: heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (data not shown). In this report, we describe the first identification and characterization of cDNAs encoding a PLP phosphatase from human and mouse. A human cDNA clone of PLP phosphatase was identified by NCBI BLAST search on the basis of the amino acid sequences of two peptides from the purified human erythrocytes enzyme. Several lines of evidence confirm that the cDNA is indeed encoding the PLP phosphatase. First, the amino acid sequences of the two peptides of the purified protein are contained in the amino acid sequence deduced from the ORF (Fig. 2). Second, the molecular mass of the protein of 32 kDa calculated from the deduced cDNA sequence is identical to the values from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the purified erythrocyte protein and the recombinant protein. Third, the kinetic parameters of the recombinant protein are similar to those of purified enzyme. The Km values for the substrate PLP (2.5 μm) are practically indistinguishable from those of the erythrocyte (1.5 μm) (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human PLP phosphatase cDNA encodes a 296-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 31698 Da. The hydropathy profile of PLP phosphatase indicated a rather even distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions throughout the molecule (data not shown). Therefore, no evidence for integral membrane domains in PLP phosphatase was found. The isolated cDNA contains a short 5′-untranslated segment similar to lung carcinoma cDNA. No larger product has been generated in repeated RACE experiments using different primer sets. Furthermore, the 2.1-kb message determined by Northern analysis agrees well with the size of the full-length cDNA, suggesting that the 5′-end of the cDNA is at or near the transcription start site. Therefore, the cloned human brain cDNA may be complete. By contrast, analysis the EST clone for mouse PLP phosphatase shows that it was incomplete. The mouse EST sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AK043228) contains several unidentified nucleotides and a stop codon in ORF, but no polyadenylate tail. Thus, we cloned a full-length cDNA of mouse PLP phosphatase by 5′- and 3′-RACE-PCRs, and the sequence has been deposited in GenBank™/EBI as accession number AY366300. Comparison of the identified cDNA sequences with the genome sequences revealed the genomic structure and chromosomal localization. The PLP phosphatase gene is divided into two exons, and the splice site sequences are remarkably well conserved as shown in Fig. 3. In mammals two ends of the intron are conserved by a donor-site consensus sequence AG/GURAGU and an acceptor-site consensus sequence (Y)nNCAG/G, where R, Y, and N indicate purine, pyrimidine, and any nucleotide, respectively (25.Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar, 26.Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A branch-point consensus sequence, YNCUGAC, is usually about 15–40 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice site, and the adenosine in the sequence forms the 2′–5′ linkage in the lariat structure. In addition, the genomic sequences were examined for the presence of CpG islands using the CpG plot program in European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), as defined by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (27.Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). The hPLPP gene contains a CpG island with a CGobs/CGexp ratio in excess of 0.8 and a GC content of 74% spanning a region from 343-bp upstream to 614-bp down-stream of the start codon, whereas the mPLPP gene has a CpG island extending from –282 bp to +643 bp with a CG content of 71%. We also reported here the functional expression of human PLP phosphatase. The expressed protein was purified by a one-step affinity chromatographic method, and consequently endogenous PLP phosphatase produced by E. coli was eliminated. Enzymological analysis of the recombinant human protein expressed from this cDNA clone showed a high specificity for the hydrolysis of PLP. Characteristics of the recombinant enzyme were similar to those from the native enzyme purified from human erythrocytes, except kinetic values for PNP (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the relatively high Vmax and Km with PNP as a substrate. As shown in Table II, the Km values of recombinant enzyme for PNP and PLP were 43 and 2.5 μm, respectively, whereas the Vmax values for PNP were surprisingly high as 1.2 units/mg, which is almost same to the value for PLP (1.4 units/mg). Judging from the kinetic results, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for PNP was 20-fold lower than that of PLP. On the other hand, the kinetic values for the native enzyme were somewhat different (16.Fonda M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15978-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme had relatively low Km and Vmax values with PNP. Km values with respect to PNP and PLP were 5.2 and 1.5 μm, respectively, whereas the Vmax were 3.2 units/mg and 0.7 units/mg, respectively. In consequence, catalytic efficiency value for PNP was 17-fold low than that of PLP, which is practically indistinguishable from that of the recombinant enzyme. An interesting aspect of our work is the finding that PLP phosphatase is differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Based on the levels of mRNA expression, the wide-spread distribution of PLP phosphatase in human tissues is consistent with its essential role in cellular metabolism. In addition to its housekeeping role in PLP metabolism, however, PLP phosphatase may play a more specific role especially in brain, where its level is substantially higher. In this connection, it is should be noted that pyridoxal kinase is expressed in essentially all mammalian organs (4.Hanna M.C. Turner A.J. Kirkness E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10756-10760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas PNP oxidase is selectively present with the highest activity found in liver and kidney (28.Buss D.D. Hamm M.W. Mehansho H. Henderson L.M. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results obtained in this study will provide valuable information on the action mechanism of human PLP phosphatase and the physiological role of this enzyme. The availability of the cDNAs encoding PLP phosphatase, and the recombinant enzyme will be helpful to expand our view of metabolic pathways that could involve PLP phosphatase and to evaluate its functional role in human cellular homeostasis."

In this study, TNFα in a time-dependent manner activated both janus tyrosine kinase 1 and Tyk2 tyrosine kinase and increased the nuclear translocation of interferon-regulatory factor-1, STAT1, and STAT2 in human airway smooth muscle cells. In cells transfected with a luciferase reporter, TNFα stimulated γ-activated site-dependent gene transcription in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Using neutralizing antibodies to IFNβ and TNFα receptor 1, we show that TNFα-induced secretion of IFNβ mediated γ-activated site-dependent gene expression via activation of TNFα receptor 1. In addition, neutralizing antibody to IFNβ also completely abrogated the activation of interferon stimulation response element-dependent gene transcription induced by TNFα. Secreted IFNβ acted as a negative regulator of TNFα-induced interleukin-6 expression, while IFNβ augmented TNFα-induced RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) secretion but had little effect on TNFα-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Furthermore TNFα, a modest airway smooth muscle mitogen, markedly induced DNA synthesis when cells were treated with neutralizing anti-IFNβ. Together these data show that TNFα, via the autocrine action of IFNβ, differentially regulates the expression of proinflammatory genes and DNA synthesis.

In vivo studies using selective inhibitors of TNFα activity demonstrate that TNFα plays a major role in antigen-induced airway inflammation (leukocyte infiltration) and airway hyper-responsiveness in animal models of asthma (1.Lukacs N.W. Strieter R.M. Chensue S.W. Widmer M. Kunkel S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5411-5417PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Renzetti L.M. Paciorek P.M. Tannu S.A. Rinaldi N.C. Tocker J.E. Wasserman M.A. Gater P.R. J.

Others who used receptor knock-out mice confirmed the importance of both TNFα receptors (TNFRs), TNFR1 and TNFR2, in the abnormal airway changes induced by allergen challenge in sensitized animals (3.Peschon J.J.

Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A potential site for TNFα deleterious action in the lungs is airway smooth muscle (ASM), a primary effector tissue thought to only regulate bronchomotor tone (6.Amrani Y. Chen H. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In human cultured ASM cells that retain physiological responsiveness and express both TNFα receptors (7.Amrani Y. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), TNFα alters proinflammatory gene expression that in turn may play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. In previous reports, we showed that TNFα increased expression of ICAM-1, IL-6, and RANTES by selectively activating TNFR1, although TNFR2 was also involved in TNFα-induced RANTES secretion (8.Amrani Y. Lazaar A.L. Hoffman R. Amin K. Ousmer S. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9.Amrani Y. Ammit A.J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol.

TNFR1-associated gene expression has been involved in the development of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (6.Amrani Y. Chen H. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Respir.

TNFα also cooperates with other cytokines such as interferon γ (IFNγ) to regulate the expression of cytokines (IL-1 and IL-5) and chemokines (IL-8, eotaxin, and RANTES) as well as adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and CD40 (for a review, see Ref. 10.Lazaar A.L. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because ASM expresses receptors for a variety of cytokines and chemokines, investigators suggest that many secreted cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-5, in an autocrine manner, may modulate ASM function to elicit a “proasthmatic phenotype” (13.Hakonarson H. Maskeri N. Carter C. Chuang S. Grunstein M.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14.Lahiri T. Laporte J.D. Moore P.E. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Shore S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1225-L1232PubMed Google Scholar). Whether Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-dependent signaling pathways mediate the cooperative interaction between TNFα and IFNγ in human ASM cells remains unknown. JAKs and STATs are the central components of IFN receptor signaling. Ligands stimulate IFN-receptor complexes (types I and II) and activate the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase JAK, specifically JAK1 and Tyk2 by IFNα/β (type I) or JAK1 and JAK2 by IFNγ (type II) (15.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). JAKs then phosphorylate STAT proteins that assemble in dimeric or oligomeric forms, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate gene expression. STAT proteins play an important function in regulating immunological and inflammatory responses (16.Horvath C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 496-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The role of the JAK/STAT-dependent pathways in promoting airway diseases is supported by evidence that STAT proteins regulate a number of inflammatory responses associated with allergic diseases such as Th1 and Th2 differentiation, IgE regulation, and cytokine expression (for a review, see Ref. 17.Pernis A.B. Rothman P.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Increased levels of STAT1 and STAT1-dependent genes such as IFN-regulatory factor IRF-1 or ICAM-1 in bronchial epithelium from subjects with asthma correlate with an accumulation of T cells in the airways, a defining feature of asthma (18.Sampath D. Castro M. Look D. Holtzman M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the factors responsible for STAT activation in asthma still remain unknown, these data suggest that altered STAT-dependent gene expression may be a key factor driving airway inflammation. In the present study, we investigated whether the modulatory effect of TNFα on gene expression in human ASM cells involves activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Smooth Muscle Cell Culture and Characterization—Human ASM cell culture was performed as described previously (7.Amrani Y. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human trachea was obtained from lung transplant donors in accordance with procedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania Committee on Studies Involving Human Beings. A segment of trachea just proximal to the carina was removed under sterile conditions, and the trachealis muscle was isolated. The muscle was then centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 0.2 mm CaCl2, 640 units/ml collagenase, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 units/ml elastase. Enzymatic dissociation of the tissue was performed for 90 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. The cell suspension was filtered through 105-μm Nytex mesh, and the filtrate was washed with equal volumes of cold Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Aliquots of the cell suspension were plated at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/cm2. The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and this was replaced every 72 h. Human ASM cells in subculture during the second through fifth cell passages were used since the cells retain native contractile protein expression as demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining for smooth muscle actin and myosin. Thymidine Incorporation Assays—DNA synthesis was evaluated by measuring thymidine incorporation as described previously (19.Panettieri R.A. Murray R.K. DePalo L.R. Yadvish P.A. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C329-C335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were growth-arrested by incubating the cultures in serum-free medium consisting of Ham's F-12 medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After 48 h in serum-free medium, the cells were stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TNFα with or without neutralizing anti-IFNβ. After 16-18 h of stimulation, human ASM cells were labeled with 3 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (40-60 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. The cells were then scraped and lysed, and the protein and DNA were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitant was aspirated onto glass filters, extensively washed, dried, and counted. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry was performed as described previously (20.Amrani Y. Lazaar A.L. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2128-2134PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used for IFNβ receptor expression (anti-IFNAR1 and anti-IFNAR2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were bought from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cytokines in supernatants were measured using antibodies obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) (IL-6 and RANTES) and BD Pharmingen (IFNγ) as indicated by the manufacturers' instructions (9.Amrani Y. Ammit A.J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control for IFNγ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the renal carcinoma cell line (REN) was infected with either adenovirus encoding for IFNγ and β-galactosidase (Ad-IFNγ) or a control adenovirus encoding for β-galactosidase alone (Ad) (21.Gurubhagavatula I. Amrani Y. Pratico D. Ruberg F.L. Albelda S.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Levels of IFNβ were measured using a commercially available human IFNβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (catalogue number 41400-1, R&D Systems). The range of detection using IFNβ standard was found to be between 125 and 10 000 pg/ml (R2 = 0.9911). Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis for cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 was performed as described previously (20.Amrani Y. Lazaar A.L. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2128-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lazaar A.L. Amrani Y. Hsu J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Fanslow W.C. Albelda S.M. Pure E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3120-3127PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4 for 20 min at 4 °C. Postnuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation of lysates at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations using the Tyk2, JAK1, and STAT2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were performed as indicated by the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (anti-phosphoprotein antibodies) in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with either of the following antibodies: anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701), anti-STAT1, anti-Tyk2, and anti-JAK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-Tyk2 (Tyr-1054/1055) and anti-phosphotyrosine Tyr(P) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); and anti-phospho-JAK1 (Tyr-1022/1023) (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). Detection of IRF-1 proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed on nuclear extracts. After incubation with the appropriate peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Roche Applied Science), the bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiographed. Immunocytochemistry of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-1—Immunostaining for nuclear translocation experiments was performed as described previously (8.Amrani Y. Lazaar A.L. Hoffman R. Amin K. Ousmer S. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the exception of the following antibodies: anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701), anti-STAT2, and anti-IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Isotype-matched antibodies (rabbit and mouse IgG from R&D Systems) were used as negative controls. After staining, the glass coverslips were mounted onto glass slides, examined under epifluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and photographed using Olympus 1X70 (Hitech Instruments, Inc., Edgemont, PA). Transfection of Human ASM Cells—Transfection of human ASM cells was performed as reported previously (9.Amrani Y. Ammit A.J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, human ASM cells were transfected with 10 μg of pGAS-Luc or 10 μg of pISRE-Luc to monitor the transcriptional activities of STAT1 and STAT2, respectively (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and 5 μg of a pSV-β-galactosidase control vector was used to normalize transfection efficiencies (Promega, Madison, WI). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were rendered quiescent in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and exposed to 10 ng/ml TNFα or 500 units/ml IFNβ. In neutralizing experiments, human ASM cells were preincubated with anti-TNFR1 or anti-TNFR2 (20 μg/ml, 60 min) anti-IFNβ or isotype-matched IgG (same concentration). Cells were then harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assessed with a Promega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—Human ASM cells were serum-deprived in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and exposed to 10 ng/ml TNFα at different times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was then performed as reported previously (6.Amrani Y. Chen H. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consensus primers (upstream primer, 5′-TGATGGCAACCAGTTCCAGAAGGCTCAAG-3′; downstream primer, 5′-ACAACCTCCCAGGCACAAGGGCTGTATTT-3′ (23.Chehadeh W. Weill J. Vantyghem M.C. Alm G. Lefebvre J. Wattre P.

Other primers for IFNβ, IFNγ, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection were identical to those reported previously (23.Chehadeh W. Weill J. Vantyghem M.C. Alm G.

PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Materials and Reagents—Tissue culture reagents and primers used for PCR were obtained from Invitrogen. Human rTNFα was provided by Roche Applied Science. rIFNγ, rIFNβ, anti-TNFR1 neutralizing antibody, anti-IFNβ neutralizing antibody (sheep polyclonal antibody, catalogue number 31400-1, 5 μg/ml, 15 min), isotype-matched goat or mouse IgG were purchased from R&D Systems. Cycloheximide and thrombin were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. The anti-TNFR2 neutralizing antibody was obtained from Cell Sciences Inc. (Norwood, MA). Statistical Analysis—To compare differences between treatment means (expressed as mean ± S.E.), all data were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance when experiments were of a factorial design. After analysis of variance, Fisher's method of protected least significant differences was used as a multiple comparison test. Comparison of two populations was made with Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were sufficient to reject the null hypothesis for all analyses. TNFα Stimulates STAT1 Activation and γ-Activated Site (GAS)-dependent Gene Expression in Human ASM Cells—In human ASM cells, TNFα and IFNs synergize to regulate the expression of a number of proinflammatory genes (10.Lazaar A.L. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we tested the hypothesis that TNFα modulates IFN-associated signaling pathways. We found that TNFα stimulates STAT1 activation at 3 and 4 h as shown by the increased STAT1 phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 701 in cytokine-treated nuclear extracts. In comparison, STAT1 phosphorylation by IFNγ was swifter and more robust occurring at 30 min (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that TNFα treatment for 3 h also stimulated the nuclear translocation of activated STAT1 in human ASM cells, an effect that was completely abrogated by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (data not shown). To address the functional consequences of TNFα-induced STAT1 activation, ASM cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing GAS motifs that bind activated STAT1 (15.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, TNFα stimulated luciferase activity in a time-dependent manner, although a slight decrease in GAS reporter activity was observed at 2 h (45%) when compared with untreated cells. Interestingly the effect of TNFα on GAS-dependent gene expression temporally correlated with the increase in the phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by TNFα (Fig. 1A). The effect of TNFα on GAS-mediated gene expression was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2A) with significant increases at 1, 10, and 30 ng/ml with a 3.49 ± 0.6-, 5.2 ± 0.54-, and 13 ± 0.37-fold increase over basal, respectively. In contrast to TNFα, IFNγ differentially regulates GAS-dependent gene expression, characterized by a swifter time course as early as 2 h with a 5 ± 0.7-fold increase over basal and more robust activation of reporter activity reaching an 18 ± 1.3-fold increase over basal at 4 h (Fig. 1D), suggesting that both cytokines activate GAS-dependent gene expression via potentially disparate pathways. Using antagonistic antibodies against TNFR receptors (9.Amrani Y. Ammit A.J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 646-655PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that neutralizing anti-TNFR1, but not anti-TNFR2, abrogated TNFα-induced GAS-dependent transcription (Fig. 2B), while an isotype-matched IgG had no effect on TNFα-induced STAT1 activation (data not shown). Together these results show that TNFα, via TNFR1, induces a delayed activation of GAS-mediated gene expression in human ASM cells.Fig. 2Concentration-dependent effects of TNFα on GAS-dependent gene expression: role of TNFR1. Cells transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing GAS enhancer elements were stimulated with the indicated concentration of TNFα for 4 h (A) or were first preincubated with neutralizing anti-TNFR1 or anti-TNFR2 (20 μg/ml, 60 min) antibodies before adding 10 ng/ml TNFα for 4 h (B). Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity in cell extracts was normalized for β-galactosidase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of three separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with untreated cells. #, p < 0.05 when compared with cells treated with TNFα alone.

Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, blocked TNFα-induced STAT1 phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting the involvement of a de novo synthesized protein in the delayed time course of TNFα-induced STAT1 activation. Since IFNγ is the prototypical ligand that stimulates GAS-dependent gene transcription (15.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), we next examined whether TNFα stimulated the expression of IFNγ. TNFα did not induce secretion of IFNγ in ASM cells, while a human malignant mesothelioma cell line (REN cells) infected with adenovirus encoding for IFNγ (21.Gurubhagavatula I. Amrani Y. Pratico D. Ruberg F.L. Albelda S.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) constitutively secreted IFNγ as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). We also investigated whether TNFα stimulated expression of IFNα, IFNβ,or PDGF (A and B) since these ligands reportedly activate STAT1 in many cell types (15.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Using a reverse transcriptase PCR technique, we found that TNFα significantly increased, in a time-dependent manner, levels of IFNβ mRNA starting at 1 h, reaching a plateau at 2-3 h, and declining after 4 h (Fig. 3A). TNFα, however, had no effect on mRNA expression of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, or IFNα (data not shown). TNFα also induced secretion of IFNβ protein with net levels of 168 ± 31 IU/ml over basal at 3 h (p < 0.05). In support of IFNβ-mediated regulation of TNFα-induced STAT1 activation, we also found that TNFα stimulated IFNβ receptor-associated signaling molecules JAK1 and Tyk2. TNFα increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both JAK1 and Tyk2, an effect that was apparent at 1 h and increased in a time-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 3B. In addition, blocking anti-IFNβ antibody completely abrogated both TNFα-and IFNβ-induced GAS-dependent gene expression as shown in Fig. 3C. These data suggest that TNFα regulates GAS-dependent gene expression via the autocrine action of IFNβ. TNFα Activates STAT2 and IRF-1 in Human ASM Cells—Because STAT2 is a major component of IFNβ signaling pathways, we next determined whether TNFα activates STAT2 in human ASM cells. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that TNFα increased STAT2 phosphorylation at 2 h (Fig. 4A) and nuclear translocation (Fig. 4B) at 3 h, an effect that was completely blocked by neutralizing anti-IFNβ antibodies (Fig. 4, A and B) and by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (data not shown). To address the question as to whether STAT2 activation was transcriptionally active, we studied the effect of TNFα on a luciferase reporter that is controlled by a promoter containing ISRE binding elements. As shown in Fig. 4C, TNFα activates ISRE-dependent luciferase activity in a time-dependent manner (2-4 h). Neutralizing antibody to IFNβ completely prevented the induction of ISRE-dependent gene expression in response to both TNFα and exogenous IFNβ (Fig. 4D). Because IRF-1 acts as a transcriptional activator of IFNβ gene (25.Taniguchi T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we determined whether TNFα induces IRF-1 expression in human ASM cells. Both immunoblot analysis and immunostaining showed IRF-1 expression in the nucleus of cells treated with TNFα, observed as early as 1 h (Fig. 5, A and B) and sustained for up to 4 h, an effect that was not inhibited by neutralizing anti-IFNβ (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that in addition to IRF-1, TNFα activates major components of IFNβ receptor signaling pathways (STAT1 and STAT2) in human ASM cells.Fig. 5TNFα stimulates the nuclear translocation of IRF-1.A, cells stimulated with TNFα for the indicated time were lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for IRF-1 by immunoblot analysis (15% SDS-PAGE). B, cells stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 3 h in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-IFNβ (5 μg/ml, 15 min) were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with mouse or anti-IRF-1 followed by a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IgG antibody. This result is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image"

As a means of artificially altering splice site choice, we have investigated the impact of positioning proteins in the vicinity of 5′ splice sites. We find that a recombinant GST-MS2 protein interferes with 5′ splice site use, most efficiently when it binds upstream of that site. To broaden the use of proteins as steric inhibitors of splicing, we have tested the activity of antisense oligonucleotides carrying binding sites for the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1/A2 proteins. In a HeLa cell extract, tailed oligonucleotides complementary to exonic sequences elicit strong shifts in 5′ splice site selection. In four different human cell lines, an interfering oligonucleotide carrying A1/A2 binding sites also shifted the alternative splicing of the Bcl-x pre-mRNA more efficiently than oligonucleotides acting through duplex formation only. The use of protein-binding oligonucleotides that interfere with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding therefore represents a novel and powerful approach to control splice site selection in cells.

The use of protein-binding oligonucleotides that interfere with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding therefore represents a novel and powerful approach to control splice site selection in cells. The alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is now recognized as a most important generator of protein diversity in mammals. A recent estimate suggests that more than half of the human genes may be alternatively spliced (1.Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Given that some pre-mRNAs are spliced to yield dozens and potentially thousands of isoforms, the tight control of alternative splicing events is undoubtedly of the highest importance for many cellular and physiological functions. In addition, many human genetic diseases are caused by mutations that affect splice site choice. Thus, procedures that can specifically influence the use of a target splice site will be profitable tools that will help understand the function of protein isoforms, as well as offer novel opportunities to intervene in the correction or the reprogramming of splice site choice for the benefit of human health. Recent efforts aimed at uncovering natural strategies used by the cell to control splice site selection have identified a variety of sequence elements and factors that influence splice site utilization. Specific exonic or intronic sequence elements help to recruit components of the splicing machinery (reviewed in Refs. 2.Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar and 3.Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). In addition, many control elements are bound by factors that prevent the efficient use of adjacent splice sites (4.Siebel C.W. Fresco L.D. Rio D.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8535-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whereas a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the activity of such repressors is often lacking, the assembly of a complex that directly impedes recognition of a nearby splicing signal has been described (4.Siebel C.W. Fresco L.D. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1386-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5.Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Aküsjarvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The sequestration of splicing signals into a duplex structure has also been associated with natural examples of splicing repression (21.Blanchette M. Chabot B. RNA (N.Y.). 1997; 3: 405-419PubMed Google Scholar). An artificial approach to control splice site use has been pioneered by Kole and collaborators (reviewed in Ref. 22.Kole R. Sazani P. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 229-234PubMed Google Scholar). This approach consists of providing oligonucleotides complementary to a target splice site to prohibit its use, often increasing the use of an alternative site. This antisense approach has been used to modulate splice site selection in different pre-mRNAs including β-globin, tau, dystrophin, and Bcl-x (reviewed in Ref. 23.Sazani P. Kole R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2003; 31: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whereas notable successes have been reported with this approach, it is important to realize that because splice sites conform to consensus sequences, an oligonucleotide complementary to any given splice site can potentially affect the use of many other splice sites, especially because an anti-splice site oligonucleotide with mismatches still displays weak activity (24.Karras J.G. Maier M.A. Lu T. Watt A. Manoharan M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7853-7859Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, an anti-splice site oligonucleotide is less effective against a strong splice site possibly because it must compete with factors that normally bind to splicing signals (e.g. U1 snRNP) 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionntnucleotide(s)hnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. (25.Sierakowska H. Sambade M.J. Schumperli D. Kole R. RNA (N.Y.). 1999; 5: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy to minimize these problems is to use oligonucleotides complementary to unique regions that are close to the target splice site. Indeed, an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a region 20 nt upstream of the Bcl-xL 5′ splice site has been used with success (26.Taylor J.K. Zhang Q.Q. Wyatt J.R. Dean N.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of inhibition has not been addressed. small nuclear ribonucleoprotein glutathione S-transferase reverse transcription nucleotide(s) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein small interfering RNA. In the present report, we describe a novel strategy that combines the specificity of oligonucleotide-based approaches with the interfering capacity of proteins or complexes bound near splice sites. Antisense oligonucleotides carrying an extension bound by hnRNP A1/A2 proteins are active on different model pre-mRNAs in vitro and in vivo. This approach could be useful in many systems where alternative or aberrant splicing events need to be manipulated. Cells and Oligonucleotide Transfection Procedures—HCT 116 cells were cultured in McCoy's medium, HeLa S3 and EcR 293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, PC-3 cells in Ham's medium/nutrient mixture F-12, and MCF-7 cells in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/μl insuline. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours prior to oligonucleotide treatment, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (35 mm) at a density of 6.5 × 104 cells/well for HeLa S3 and HCT 116 cells and 1 × 105 cells/well for PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Eighteen hours prior to plasmid transfections, 5 × 105 EcR 293 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates. Oligonucleotides and siRNAs used in splicing experiments were synthesized by Dharmacon. For oligonucleotide treatments, cells were treated with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions at the concentrations indicated. SiRNAs against A1/A2 were transfected using the same procedure at a final concentration of 80 nm (27.Patry D. Bouchard L. Labrecque P. Gendron D. Lemieux B. Toutant J. Lapointe E. Wellinger R. Chabot B. Cancer Res. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—The pC5′ –/– plasmid was described previously (28.Blanchette M. Chabot B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1939-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Plasmids derived from pC5′ –/– and containing MS2 binding sites were produced using mutagenesis by overlap extension to obtain blunt restriction sites at positions –46, –37, –26, –17, +15, +23, and +31 relative to the 5′ splice site of exon 7B. MS2 binding sites were inserted in the sense and antisense orientations by inserting reannealed oligonucleotides bearing optimized and mutated MS2 binding sites. For the optimized MS2 binding sites, oligonucleotides MS2-I (TTGTCGACCTGCACGTACACCATCAGGGTACG) and MS2-IA (CGTACCCTGATGGTGTACGTGCAGGTCGACAA) were inserted at positions –46, –37, –26, and –17 and oligonucleotides MS2-D (CGTACACCATCAGGGTACGCTGC-AGTCGACTT) and MS2-DA (AAGTCGACTGCAGCGTACCCTGATGGTGTACG) were inserted at +15, +23, and +31. For the plasmid pC5-M26SΔ, oligonucleotides MS2-IΔ (TTGTCGACCTGCACGTACCCATCAGGGTACG) and MS2-IAΔ (CGTACCCTGATGGGTACGTGCAGGTCGACAA) were inserted at –26. pDUP5.1-MS2 and pDUP5.1-SP were constructed from the stepwise assembly of various restriction fragments. pDUP4.1 and pDUP5.1 were described previously (29.Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The BamHI-SacI fragment of pDUP4.1 was inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites of pBluescript II KS+ to produce pKS-DUP4.1. pKS-DUP5.1HpaI was created by inserting reannealed oligonucleotides DUP-HpaIA (CATGGCAAGGTGAACGTGGATGAA-GTTAACGGTG) and DUP-HpaIB (CATGCACCGTTAACTTCATCCACGTTCAC-CTTGC) in NcoI sites of pKS-DUP4.1 to obtain an alternative splicing unit similar to DUP5.1 and containing an HpaI restriction site at –26 relative to the 5′ splice site of exon 2. The BglII-ApaI fragment of pKS-DUP5.1-HpaI was then inserted into the BglII and ApaI sites of pDUP5.1 to create pDUP5.1-HpaI. pDUP5.1-MS2 was created by inserting the reannealed oligonucleotides MS2-I and MS2-IA in the HpaI site of pDUP5.1-HpaI. pDUP5.1-SP was obtained by inserting reannealed oligonucleotides DUP-SalIA (TGCACTCTCAGTACAATCTGCTCTGTCGACGC) and DUP-SalIB (GCGTCGACAGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCA) in the HpaI site of pDUP5.1-HpaI. pCI-MS2-NLS-FLAG was described previously (8.Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and was used for the creation of pGST-MS2B. The sequence encoding for the protein glutathione S-transferase of pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides GST-StuI3 (ATTGTAGGCCTGGATCCACGCGGAACC-AGAT) and GST-StuI4 (GTTATAGGCCTATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTG) and inserted in StuI sites of pCI-MS2-NLS-FLAG. pGEX-UP1 was described previously (30.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). pGEX-MS2 was obtained from Marco Blanchette. Plasmid Transfections Assays—EcR 293 cells were treated with Dosper (Roche Applied Sciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. To allow DNA-liposome complexes to form, 1 μg of plasmid encoding alternative splicing units (pDUP5.1, pDUP5.1-MS2, and pDUP5.1-SP) and 6 μg of pGST-MS2B were mixed with 20 μg of Dosper in 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. pLacZ (Invitrogen) was used for cell transfections in the absence of pGST-MS2B. The DNA-liposome complexes were laid on cells and incubated for 6 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were cultured for 48 h. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant GST-UP1 and GST-MS2 proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) following procedure II as described (31.Fiset S. Chabot B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2268-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bacterial lysis was performed in buffer A (50 mm piperazine-HCl, pH 9.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml bacitracin, and 1 mm benzamidine) in the presence of 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were eluted from the columns with buffer B (200 mm piperazine-HCl, pH 9.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm reduced glutathione). Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol). The concentration of the recombinant proteins was measured by Bradford (Bio-Rad) using serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin as a standard. Transcription and in Vitro Splicing Assays—Splicing substrates were produced from plasmids linearized with ScaI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of cap analog and [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA was gel purified as described (32.Chabot B. Higgins, S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing, A Practical Approach. Vol. 1. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 1-29Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared (33.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and used in splicing reactions as described previously (34.Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for a final volume of 15 μl. Creatine kinase was added to HeLa nuclear extracts at a final concentration of 1 unit/15 μl. Gel Shift Assays—Radiolabeled probes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) containing 60 μg of heparin in the absence or presence of 10 or 25 pmol of GST-UP1 before addition of 1 μl of dye. The reactions were run on 8% native acrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. RNase H Protection—HeLa extracts depleted of U1 snRNPs were produced by adding RNase H (Amersham Biosciences) and oligonucleotide TCAGGTAAGTAT that is complementary to the 5′ end of U1 RNA (35.Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). A mock-treated extract was obtained by incubation with RNase H in the absence of oligonucleotide. RNase H and 75 pmol of oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ splice site of exon 7B (CTGGATACCTACCA) were added to 12 μl of treated extract, 1 unit of creatine kinase, in the absence or the presence of 150 pmol of GST-MS2 or 10 pmol of oligonucleotides C5-M4 and C5-M4A1W after incubation for the specified times at 30 °C. Incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I following the manufacturer's procedure. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers and Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and was carried out at 42 °C for 60 min and stopped at 95 °C for 5 min. These reactions were followed by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following procedure: 96 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles at 93 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Products related to Bcl-x where amplified using primers Bclx-2 (TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA) and Bclx-3 (ATGGCAGCAG-TAAAGCAAGCG). Products related to DUP where amplified using primers GE1 (ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC) and DUPRT-3 (AACAGCATCAGGAGTGGACAG-ATCCC). PCR products were quantified using Instant Imager (Canberra-Packard). The Binding of a GST-MS2 Protein Near a 5′ Splice Site Alters Splice Site Selection—As an alternative approach to current methods developed to alter splice site selection, we first tested the effect of targeting the binding of a protein in the vicinity of a 5′ splice site with the goal of interfering with its use through steric hindrance. Although one natural case of this type of splicing control exists (see Introduction), we wished to ascertain whether obstruction could be achieved by unrelated proteins, and if so, assess some of parameters associated with such an effect. We used a pre-mRNA that contains two competing 5′ splice sites derived from the hnRNP A1 gene (C5′ –/–; Fig. 1A), and tested the effect of targeting the binding of a recombinant form of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein close to the proximal 5′ splice site. A high affinity MS2 binding site was inserted at various positions upstream or downstream of the proximal 5′ splice junction (–46, –37, –26, –17, +15, +23, and +31). The resulting pre-mRNAs were incubated in a HeLa extract in the presence or absence of the GST-MS2 protein. As seen in Fig. 1B, promoting the binding of GST-MS2 26 nt upstream of the proximal 5′ splice site decreased splicing at that site and stimulated the use of the distal 5′ splice site (compare lane 4 with lane 3). GST-MS2 did not affect 5′ splice site utilization when the MS2 binding site was substituted for its complementary sequence (Fig. 1B, compare lane 2 with lane 1), or when the MS2 binding site contained a point mutation that reduces binding by 3000-fold (36.Schneider D. Tuerk C. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (compare lane 6 with lane 5). A compilation of the effect on splicing with the MS2 binding site inserted at different positions is shown in Fig. 1C. The effect on splice site selection was concentration-dependent (data not shown). The largest effect was observed when the MS2 binding site was placed 26 and 37 nt upstream of the 5′ splice junction. In contrast, the insertion of the MS2 binding site at similar distances downstream from the 5′ splice junction had little or no effect. To determine whether the interference detected in vitro could also be obtained in vivo, we used the β-globin DUP5.1 reporter plasmid (29.Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6537-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37.Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 687-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The internal exon 2 in DUP5.1 is preferentially skipped because of its small size, and its inclusion level did not change upon co-expression of GST-MS2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Insertion of the MS2 binding site or a spacer element 26 nt upstream of the 5′ splice junction leads to almost complete inclusion of the central exon (lanes 3 and 5), most likely because of the increase in the size of the central exon. Co-transfection with the GST-MS2 expression plasmid promoted a decrease in the relative frequency of exon 2 inclusion only when DUP5.1 contained the MS2 binding site (compare lane 4 with lane 6). This result suggests that the binding of GST-MS2 upstream of a 5′ splice site can interfere with the use of this site in vivo. A Protein-binding Oligonucleotide Can Switch 5′ Splice Site Selection in Vitro—Next, we asked whether positioning a protein near a 5′ splice site through the use of an hybridizing oligonucleotide could also affect 5′ splice site selection. For this purpose, we designed a series of antisense oligonucleotides complementary to nucleotides –4 to –23 relative to the proximal 5′ splice site on the C5′ –/– pre-mRNA (Fig. 3A). The hybridizing portion of each oligonucleotide was made of 2′-O-methyl nucleotides. The C5-M4A1 oligonucleotide also contains at its 5′ end a 16-nt long non-hybridizing DNA extension carrying one high affinity binding site for the hnRNP A1/A2 proteins (TAGGGA). The C5-M4A1W oligonucleotide contains at the same position an RNA sequence for high affinity hnRNP A1 binding (38.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A mutated version of this oligonucleotide harboring two GGG to CGC mutations was used as a control (C5-M4A1M). Oligonucleotides carrying a non-related 16-nt long tail (C5-M4CT) or lacking a tail (C5-M4) were also used as controls. All oligonucleotides were tested for A1 binding by using the UP1 protein, a shortened derivative of hnRNP A1 (Fig. 3B). Complex formation in a native gel indicated that UP1 bound best to C5-M4A1W followed by C5-M4A1. The mutated C5-M4A1M was not bound by UP1, nor were the control oligonucleotides C5-M4 and C5-M4CT. Splicing assays were next carried out to investigate the interfering capacity of these oligonucleotides. The simple duplex-forming C5-M4 oligonucleotide provoked a reduction in the use of the proximal 5′ splice site (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). A similar effect was obtained with the C5-M4CT and C5-M4A1M oligonucleotides (Fig. 3C, lanes 8–10 and 14–16, respectively). For C5-M4, C5-M4CT, and C5-M4A1M, the ratio of distal to proximal products shifted from 0.25 in the absence of oligonucleotides to 1.3 at the highest concentration of oligonucleotides (Fig. 1D). Thus, the presence of a duplex structure with a nucleic acid extension emerging at position –4 relative to the target 5′ splice site was not more inhibitory than a duplex alone. In contrast, a stronger shift was obtained with the oligonucleotide carrying the A1-binding DNA extension (C5-M4A1; Fig. 3, C, lanes 5–7, and D). The strongest shift was observed with the C5-M4A1W oligonucleotide that combined a strong reduction in proximal 5′ splice site use with an important increase in distal 5′ splice site use (Fig. 1, C, lanes 11–13, and D). In this case, the amplitude of shift obtained was more than 25-fold at the highest concentration of the C5-M4A1W oligonucleotide. These results indicate that a 5′ tail carrying A1/A2 binding sites adds considerably to the interfering capability of the bound oligonucleotide. We also compared the activity of the interfering oligonucleotide carrying the A1 binding tail with the activity of an oligonucleotide directly complementary to the proximal 5′ splice site (C5-5) (see Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, C5-M4A1W was more active than C5-5 at shifting splicing (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 2–6 with lanes 12–16). We also tested the effect of positioning A1 further upstream by using an oligonucleotide that hybridizes 26 to 45 nt upstream of the 5′ splice site of exon 7B (C5-M26A1; see Fig. 3A). Compared with an oligonucleotide that only forms a duplex with this sequence (C5-M26), the protein-bound C5-M26A1 oligonucleotide was slightly more effective than C5-M26 at repressing the proximal 5′ splice site and did not significantly stimulate distal 5′ splice site usage (Fig. 3F, compare lanes 2–4 with lanes 5–7). In contrast, the presence of the A1-binding tail on oligonucleotide C5-M4A1 promoted a more efficient shift toward the distal site when compared with the effect of the C5-M4 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3F, compare lanes 8–10 with lanes 11–13). Thus, more interference is obtained when the A1-binding tail is closer to the target splice site. Modulation of Endogenous Bcl-x Alternative Splicing by an A1-binding Oligonucleotide in Vivo—The Bcl-x pre-mRNA was used on several occasions as a target for splice site modulation by duplex-forming oligonucleotides (e.g. Ref. 26.Taylor J.K.

Acta. 2002; 1587: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two types of oligonucleotides have been tested: one oligonucleotide is partially complementary to the proximal 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL (positions +2 to –16 relative to the 5′ splice junction), whereas the other oligonucleotide is complementary to positions 16 to 35 nt upstream of the same 5′ splice site. Each oligonucleotide affects Bcl-x splicing such that the relative abundance of the mRNA isoforms shifts in favor of the production of Bcl-xS (41.Mercatante D.R. Kole R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine the modulating efficiency of protein-binding oligonucleotides in vivo, we used a series of 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). X-5 is complementary to the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xL (+7 to –13); X-M4 is complementary to the –4 to –23 region, upstream of the Bcl-xL site. The other two oligonucleotides contain the same complementary region and carry a 5′ tail with two high affinity binding sites for hnRNP A1 or a mutated version thereof (X-M4A1W and X-M4A1M, respectively). The A1 binding ability of these 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides was confirmed by gel shift assays (Fig. 4B). The best UP1 binder was X4-M4A1W (lanes 7–9), whereas no binding was detected using X-M4A1M, X-M4, and X-5. Transfection of the individual oligonucleotide was carried out in triplicate and at different concentrations in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3, the colon carcinoma cell line HCT 116, and the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 using control transfections with an unrelated oligonucleotide (C-RNA) or with no oligonucleotide (mock). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR to monitor changes in the relative abundance of the endogenous Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS mRNAs. Compared with the control, we observed that the X-5 oligonucleotide had little activity at the concentrations tested in PC3, HCT 116, and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4, C, lane 2; D, lane 3; and E, lane 3, respectively). The duplex-forming X-M4 oligonucleotide displayed moderate activity in all cell lines (Fig. 4, C, lane 3; D, lane 4; and E, lane 4). The X-M4A1W oligonucleotide elicited the strongest shift toward the production of Bcl-xS in all three cell lines (Fig. 4, C, lane 4; D, lane 5; and E, lane 5). As expected, the X-M4A1M oligonucleotide was less efficient (Fig. 4, C, lane 5; D, lane 6; E, lane 6), thus supporting the conclusion that A1/A2 binding is important for the activity of the interfering oligonucleotide. The residual activity may reflect low affinity binding by A1/A2 or may indicate that a 5′ tail can display intrinsic interfering activity in vivo. Although the X-M4A1W oligonucleotide was similarly active in PC-3 and HCT 116 cells, the amplitude of the switch was less important in MCF-7 cells. Given that the transfection efficiencies were similar for all cell lines (typically greater than 90%), cell-specific differences in the level of oligonucleotide intake or oligonucleotide stability may account for the noted differences in splicing switch. Alternatively or in addition, different levels of Bcl-x pre-mRNA and hnRNP A/B proteins may contribute to cell lin"

We therefore examined the biological and transcriptional programs induced by estrogens and glucocorticoids in the uterus of immature female rats. Estradiol 17beta (E2) rapidly induced morphological changes reminiscent of an acute inflammatory response, including infiltration of eosinophils, edema in the stroma and myometrium, and a decrease in the height of luminal epithelial cells, whereas dexamethasone (Dex) only altered stromal cell morphology. When coadministered with E2, Dex completely blocked the proinflammatory effects of E2. Surprisingly, examination of E2 and Dex effects on gene expression using cDNA microarrays and real-time PCR revealed that these hormones had similar effects on the expression of many genes and that very few genes displayed antagonistic regulation. Together, these results indicate strong discord between the early biologic and genomic actions of estrogens and glucocorticoids and highlight a complex regulatory role for glucocorticoids and GR in the mammalian uterus."

Soluble recombinant forms of the natural cell membrane regulators of complement are effective in animal models and some human diseases. However, their use is limited for reasons related to cost, short half lives, and propensity to cause unwanted systemic effects. Some of these limitations may be overcome by use of bacterial expression systems, specific targeting moieties, and judicious choice of regulator. Here we describe the application of these strategies to the generation of a membrane-targeted form of CD59. A recombinant soluble form of rat CD59, comprising the first 71 residues of the mature protein and missing the membrane-anchoring signal, was expressed in bacteria, purified, and refolded in a fully active form. The protein was coupled through its carboxyl terminus to a short, synthetic address tag that confers membrane binding activity. Attachment of the membrane address tag markedly increased complement-inhibitory activity assessed in vitro in hemolysis assays. Intra-articular administration of the tagged agent markedly suppressed disease in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in Lewis rats.

N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). As a consequence, controlling inappropriate activation of C may be an appropriate therapeutic strategy in these diseases (2.Harris C.L. Fraser D.A. Morgan B.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Numerous approaches to the development of agents that regulate C activation have evolved, and some are now reaching the clinic. Two agents have led the way. The first, a soluble recombinant form of the membrane regulator C receptor 1 (CR1; CD35), has proven beneficial in many animal models of human disease, although preliminary results in human disease have been disappointing (3.Moore Jr., F.D. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rioux P. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 364-371PubMed Google Scholar). The second, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks cleavage of C5, more recent in development, is likely to be the first anti-C agent in clinical use (5.Thomas T.C. Rollins S.A. Rother R.P. Giannoni M.A. Hartman S.L. Elliott E.A. Nye S.H. Matis L.A. Squinto S.P. Evans M.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1389-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6.Fitch J.C. Rollins S. Matis L.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 2499-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although both of these agents have been shown to be effective and relatively safe in models, it must be stressed that systemic inhibition of C is not without consequence. Agents that efficiently inhibit C in vivo may cause iatrogenic infections or immune complex disease, probably limiting their use to acute situations (7.Morgan B.P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

The problems of systemic inhibition of C might be overcome either by targeting the agent to a specific site or by choosing an agent that permits the physiological actions of C to proceed unhindered. For the latter strategy, agents that specifically inhibit formation of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC) are attractive, because MAC is implicated as an important cause of pathology, whereas most of the physiological roles of C are mediated by products of the activation pathways (8.Morgan B.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 115-140PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, individuals deficient in components of the MAC are healthy apart from an increased susceptibility to meningococcal disease (9.Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CD59 is a small, broadly distributed, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is the sole membrane regulator of MAC assembly (10.Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, London1999Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble forms of CD59 (sCD59) have been generated with the aim of developing a specific inhibitor of MAC for therapy (11.Sugita Y. Ito K. Shiozuka K. Suzuki H. Gushima H. Tomita M. Masuho Y. Immunology. 1994; 82: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Sugita Y. Masuho Y. Immunotechnology. 1995; 1: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13.Rushmere N.K. Tomlinson S. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 1997; 90: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, sCD59 is a poor inhibitor of MAC both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, sCD59 inhibits efficiently in “reactive lysis” systems where purified components are used to assemble the MAC on targets, but this inhibitory activity is markedly reduced in the presence of serum (11.Sugita Y. Ito K. Shiozuka K. Suzuki H. Gushima H. Tomita M. Masuho Y. Immunology. 1994; 82: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Vakeva A. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Lehto T. Meri S. Immunology. 1994; 82: 28-33PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, the problem is compounded by the small size of sCD59, which permits rapid clearance in the kidney. Attempts have been made to generate more active forms of sCD59 by designing chimeras or fusion proteins (15.Zhang H.F. Yu J. Bajwa E. Morrison S.L. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16.Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but no clear evidence of MAC-inhibiting activity in vivo has yet been reported. We have taken a different approach to the problem of targeting and retaining C therapeutics by utilizing a membrane-associating “tag” that can be coupled to proteins. Several C regulators have previously been modified in this manner, particularly a small molecule derived from human sCR1 and a portion of the rat C regulator Crry (17.Linton S.M. Williams A.S. Dodd I. Smith R. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18.Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2512-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In each case, the addition of the membrane tag markedly increased the C regulatory capacity of the parent molecule in vitro and, in the case of the sCR1 fragment, also markedly enhanced activity in animal models. The targeting technology has been coupled with development of bacterial expression systems for these complex proteins that enable large amounts of active protein to be generated economically. CD59 inhibits MAC assembly by incorporating tightly into the forming complex (10.Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, London1999Google Scholar, 19.Meri S. Morgan B.P. Davies A. Daniels R.H. Olavesen M.G. Waldmann H. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 1990; 71: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The molecule is held together by four disulfide bonds that maintain a rigid, compact, discoid structure. Soluble recombinant forms of CD59 have been expressed in mammalian cells, insect cells, and yeast and shown to be functional in “reactive lysis” assays in vitro (11.Sugita Y. Ito K. Shiozuka K. Suzuki H. Gushima H. Tomita M. Masuho Y. Immunology. 1994; 82: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Davies A. Morgan B.P. Biochem.

Despite its small size, expression of CD59 in a bacterial system has not previously been reported and represents a considerable challenge, given the complex disulfide bridging and tertiary structure. Here we describe the production in Escherichia coli of a recombinant soluble form of rat CD59, modified such that an additional Cys residue is available at the carboxyl terminus. This molecule was fully active as an inhibitor of MAC assembly when compared with soluble rat CD59 expressed in mammalian cells. The addition of a membrane address tag at the carboxyl terminus generated a membrane binding molecule that had markedly increased MAC-inhibitory activity in vitro when compared with the untailed molecule. Intra-articular administration of the membrane-tagged rat CD59 in rats efficiently inhibited disease progression and joint destruction in a rat arthritis model. These data demonstrate for the first time that specific inhibition of MAC can inhibit pathology in a C-mediated disease model.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-reduced human CD59 antiserum (cross-reactive with rat CD59) was provided by Dr. S. Tomlinson (Charleston, SC). C8-depleted serum was made in house using standard methods (23.Abraha A. Morgan B.P. Luzio J.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Soluble recombinant forms of rat CD59, comprising the amino-terminal 71 amino acids, either unmodified or mutated to delete the single N-glycosylation site, were made in CHO cells essentially as previously described (13.Rushmere N.K. Tomlinson S. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 1997; 90: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Antiserum against rat C9, cross-reactive with MAC in rat tissues, was made by repeated immunization of rabbits with purified rat C9. The antibody was purified from antiserum and biotinylated using standard protocols. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled avidin was obtained from Sigma. Using as template a plasmid containing the full coding sequence for rat CD59, a cDNA encoding a soluble recombinant form of rat CD59 (residues 1–71 of the mature protein sequence, missing the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor addition sequence) and including at the carboxyl terminus a 7-residue spacer (SGGSGGS) and a terminal cysteine, was engineered and amplified (sCD59-Cys). The primers used were as follows: 1) 5′-GTTCCACAGGTCATATGCTCAGATGC-3′, which added an NdeI restriction site (boldface type) immediately upstream of the nucleotides encoding the initiating methionine of the recombinant protein; 2) 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGCAAGAACCGCCAGAACCACCGGATTTGTTACACAAGTCCGCCTG-3′, which included the spacer and terminal Cys upstream of a stop codon (italic type) and a BamHI restriction site (boldface type). The PCR product (266 bp) was subcloned into the plasmid TOPO-TA® (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm fidelity. The plasmid was then digested with NdeI and BamHI to release the insert, which was purified and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pET26b (Invitrogen) digested at the corresponding sites. The sCD59-Cys cDNA in pET26b was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) by electroporation (GenePulser™; Bio-Rad). Cells were then plated onto LB agar containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to select for clones containing the plasmid. Positive colonies were picked and expanded, and the presence of insert was confirmed by PCR screening. A single positive colony was picked into 25 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. A 20-ml aliquot of this starter culture was inoculated into 2 liters of NZCYM medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) in a Bioflo 3000 Bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) with a 2-liter bioreactor culture vessel. The fermenter was prepared and run as described previously (18.Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2512-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown for 4 h until the bacteria were in their log phase of growth (A600 = 5–8). Protein expression was then induced by adding sterile filtered isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The fermentation culture was harvested at 3 h post-induction and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were stored at –40 °C. The cell pellet obtained above was thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0; 5 ml/g of pellet), and disrupted by two passes at pressure >12,000 p.s.i. through an Emulsiflex C5 High Pressure Homogenizer (Glen Creston, Stanmore, UK) at 4 °C. The homogenate was immediately centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellet containing sCD59-Cys in inclusion bodies was washed three times by centrifugation in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), pH 8.0, before being resuspended to ∼5 mg/ml in solubilization buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5). Conditions for refolding of sCD59-Cys were chosen empirically by testing a large panel of solutions differing in their pH, presence of reducing and denaturing agents, presence of detergents, etc. as previously described (18.Fraser D.A. Harris C.L. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2512-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24.Dodd I. Mossakowska D.E. Camilleri P. Haran M. Hensley P. Lawlor E.J. McBay D.L.

In the chosen protocol, sCD59-Cys was refolded from solubilized inclusion bodies by rapid dilution (1:40) into 50 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 3 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 8.0. The refold mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then buffer-exchanged into PBS and concentrated 10-fold by ultra-filtration (Amicon stirred cell; 5-kDa cut-off membrane; Amicon Inc., Beverley, MA). Aggregated and/or misfolded protein was removed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Protein in PBS was diluted 1:2.5 into 3.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged. The supernatant was retained and dialyzed into PBS prior to measurement of protein concentration. The molecular mass of the final product was measured using matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF; Bruker, Coventry, UK). The identity of the final product was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer). A membrane address tag was added to sCD59-Cys by derivatization at the free carboxyl-terminal cysteine with the sulfydryl-reactive peptide, N-(myristoyl)GSSKSPSKKKKKKPGDC-(S-2-thiopyridyl) C-amide (termed APT542; Adprotech Ltd.) (25.Smith G.P. Smith R.A. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), to produce sCD59-APT542. The tagged protein was separated from untagged and purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono-S (Amersham Biosciences) column. Protein was loaded in PBS and eluted with a salt gradient to 1 m NaCl in PBS. Fractions containing sCD59-APT542 were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Novex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using the Bio-Rad miniblot system. Membranes were probed with the relevant antibodies and developed using the Western Breeze Kit (Novex). Two types of hemolysis assay were used to assess the function of sCD59-Cys and sCD59-APT542. Nonwash Assays—Guinea pig E (GPE) (2% in CFD) were incubated (15 min, 37 °C) with C8-depleted human serum diluted 1:5 in CFD in order to generate C5b-7 sites on the cells (GPE5b-7). The GPE5b-7 were washed and resuspended to 2% in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA, and 100-μl aliquots were delivered to wells of a 96-well round-bottomed plate. Dilutions of rat serum in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA (100 μl) were then added to individual wells as a source of C8 and C9 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Zero lysis controls contained no rat serum, and 100% controls contained 1% Triton in place of serum. Plates were spun, and supernatant was removed to a fresh 96-well flat-bottomed plate. Absorbance was read in a Bio-Rad enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 410 nm, and percentage of hemolysis at each serum dilution was calculated relative to the zero and 100% controls. From this titration study, a serum dose that caused approximately 70% lysis of GPE5b-7 was chosen. GPE5b-7 aliquoted as above were incubated with the selected serum dilution together with dilutions in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA of sCD59-Cys, sCD59-APT542, or, as control, sCD59 generated in CHO cells. Supernatants were harvested, and hemolysis was measured as described above. The MAC-inhibitory effect at different concentrations of each of the CD59 constructs were assessed by comparing the hemolysis obtained in the presence of CD59 with that in the absence of CD59. All measures were made in triplicate. Wash Assays—GPE5b-7 prepared as described above were resuspended to 2% in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA and aliquoted into the wells of a 96-well round-bottomed plate. Dilutions in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA of sCD59-Cys, sCD59-APT542, or, as control, sCD59 generated in CHO cells, were then added (100 μl) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times by centrifugation in PBS plus 10 mm EDTA prior to the addition of the selected dilution of rat serum to develop hemolysis, and the MAC-inhibitory effect was measured as described above. Male Lewis rats (approximately 200 g) were obtained from Charles River (Margate, UK) and housed at Biomedical Services (University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff). Rats were allowed free access to food and water and kept in light/dark cycles of 12 h. AIA was induced following an established protocol (17.Linton S.M. Williams A.S. Dodd I. Smith R. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were injected subcutaneously with an emulsion of equal volumes of methylated bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and Freund's complete adjuvant (containing 0.25 mg/ml heat-killed Mycobacteria) on two occasions a week apart. Fourteen days after the second injection (day 0), an injection of methylated bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg in 100 μl of saline) was administered into the right knee of each animal. The left knee served as a control joint and received an equal volume of saline. For assessment of therapeutic effects, AIA was induced in groups of six animals, groups receiving either sCD59-Cys (250 μg in 0.1 ml of PBS), sCD59-APT542 (250 μg in 0.1 ml of PBS), or the same volume of PBS alone (control) in a single dose given into the joint together with the disease-initiating antigen on day 0. Disease was assessed clinically by measuring the knee diameters of inflamed (right) and noninflamed (left) knees with a Mitutoyo digital caliper over a 14-day period. On each occasion, three readings were taken from each joint by an independent observer blinded to the treatment regimen. The swelling attributed to the antigenic challenge was expressed as the difference (in mm) between the mean readings of the inflamed and noninflamed knee diameters. Results were statistically evaluated using a two-sample t test, and p values less than 0.05 were taken as significant. Disease was also assessed histologically. Rats from different treatment groups were killed 14 days after arthritis induction. Knee joints were dissected intact and fixed in formalin-buffered saline prior to processing, sectioning, staining, and scoring for arthritis as described previously (17.Linton S.M. Williams A.S. Dodd I. Smith R. Williams B.D. Morgan B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The histological parameters assessed were synovial hyperplasia (on a scale of 0–3), inflammatory infiltrate (scale 0–5), intraluminal inflammatory exudate (scale 0–3), and number of cartilagenous/bony erosions (scale 0–3). The sum of the scored parameters gave the arthritis index for each knee. Results were statistically evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric variables, and p values less than 0.05 were taken as significant. MAC deposition was detected in joint sections by incubation with biotinylated anti-rat C9 (30 μg/ml final concentration in PBS, 10 min) followed by avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (10 μg/ml in PBS, 10 min). Sections were viewed under a fluorescence microscope and scored for MAC staining, and representative areas were photographed. Generation of Soluble Recombinant CD59 in E. coli—Soluble recombinant rat CD59, comprising the first 71 amino acids of rat CD59 modified with a 7-residue carboxyl-terminal “spacer” region and terminal Cys residue, was expressed in E. coli. The expressed protein was present almost exclusively as inclusion bodies in the bacterial pellet, with none detected in supernatants from transfectants (data not shown). Numerous bands were present in the fermentation pellet samples, but an additional band at the predicted molecular mass for sCD59-Cys (9 kDa) was present only in the postinduction pellet sample (Fig. 1; compare lanes 1 and 2). This band was retained during several wash steps (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5), demonstrating that the protein was a component of the inclusion bodies. Upon solubilization of the bacterial pellet, it was apparent that sCD59-Cys was the major protein component (lane 6). From a 2-liter fermentation, the yield of sCD59-Cys was between 70 and 100 mg at this stage. Efficient refolding, assessed by acquisition of conformation-dependent mAb epitopes (data not included), was obtained under the conditions described, and misfolded/aggregated protein was removed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The process was monitored by Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum that recognized reduced and denatured CD59 and a mAb, 6D1, that detected only correctly folded protein (Fig. 2). In the prepurification sample, the polyclonal reagent detected a faint band at 9 kDa, heavier bands, presumably different conformers of dimer at 18–21 kDa, and a higher aggregate band at 48 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The ammonium sulfate pellet contained no 9-kDa monomer, but the larger bands were present (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The supernatant contained predominantly the 9-kDa monomer with trace amounts of dimer remaining, demonstrating that all of the aggregated protein was contained within the pellet (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Under reducing conditions, only a 9-kDa band reactive with the polyclonal anti-CD59 antiserum was seen in each lane, indicating that all higher molecular mass bands were reduced to monomer (Fig. 2B). The mAb 6D1 (Fig. 2C) strongly stained a band at 9 kDa in the ammonium sulfate supernatant (Fig. 2C, lane 9) and, more weakly, the same band in the prepurification sample (Fig. 2C, lane 7), demonstrating that these contained correctly folded protein. No bands were stained in the ammonium sulfate pellet (Fig. 2C, lane 8), indicating that bands detected in the pellet by the polyclonal reagent represented denatured and misfolded protein. The final yield of pure, correctly refolded monomeric protein was ∼5 mg, as determined by Coomassie protein assay (Pierce), with a refolding efficiency of 5%. The obtained N-terminal sequence was MLRXYNX; this was identical to the known sequence (MLRCYNC) with, as anticipated, failure to identify Cys residues. Retention of the initiating methionine has frequently been described in prokaryotic expression systems. The molecular mass of the refolded protein, measured using MALDI-TOF, was 9039 Da (theoretical mass 8728 Da).Fig. 2Purification of refolded sCD59-Cys by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Protein in PBS was diluted 1:2.5 into 3.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Precipitated material was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. Samples of the prepurification solution (lanes 1, 4, and 7), the pellet (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and supernatant (lanes 3, 6, and 9) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Novex) under nonreducing (A and C) or reducing (B) conditions, and a Western blot was carried out using polyclonal anti-reduced CD59 antiserum (blots A and B) and mAb 6D1 anti-rat CD59 (blot C). Molecular weight markers are shown on each blot (m), and sizes in kDa are indicated on the left. The arrow indicates the anticipated size of the sCD59-Cys protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Generation and Characterization of Membrane-targeted sCD59 (sCD59-APT542)—sCD59-Cys was modified at its C terminus by the addition of the membrane address tag, APT542, using thiol interchange chemistry. The “tagged” protein was purified by cation-exchange chromatography; SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) of soluble CD59 before (lane 1) and after (lane 2) conjugation to APT542 showed that the addition of a membrane address tag increased the apparent molecular mass of sCrry-Cys from 9 to 11 kDa. Efficiency of tailing of sCD59-APT542 was between 80 and 100%, and the residual untailed material was efficiently separated by chromatography on Mono-S (not shown). The molecular mass of the tailed protein, measured using MALDI-TOF, was 10,725 Da. The capacity of sCD59-APT542 to inhibit MAC-mediated cell lysis was compared with that of untargeted sCD59-Cys and CHO-expressed sCD59 using nonwash (Fig. 4a) and wash (Fig. 4b) hemolysis assays on GPE5b-7 cells. In a nonwash assay, sCD59-Cys expressed in E. coli and sCD59 expressed in CHO cells (either with or without N-glycosylation), when used in equimolar amounts, were similarly effective at inhibiting lysis, indicating that the bacterially expressed and refolded protein was fully active when compared with that expressed in CHO. In contrast, sCD59 containing a membrane-targeting moiety (sCD59-APT542) was 100-fold more active than the untargeted proteins. In the wash assay, the differences were even greater. The C-inhibitory profile of sCD59-APT542 was almost identical in wash and nonwash assays, indicating that the protein had bound firmly to the cells and there exerted its effect. In contrast, no residual hemolysis inhibiting activity was seen with th"

This inhibitor is thought to be secreted by axons at synaptic regions where it controls tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activity. Mechanisms regulating neuroserpin are not known, and the current studies were undertaken to define the cellular pathways involved in neuroserpin catabolism. We found that both active neuroserpin and neuroserpin·tPA complexes were internalized by mouse cortical cultures and embryonic fibroblasts in a process mediated by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). Surprisingly, despite the fact that active neuroserpin is internalized by LRP, this form of the molecule does not directly bind to LRP on its own, indicating the requirement of a cofactor for neuroserpin internalization. Our studies ruled out the possibility that endogenously produced plasminogen activators (i.e. tPA and urokinase-type plasminogen activator) are responsible for the LRP-mediated internalization of active neuroserpin, but could not rule out the possibility that another cell-associated proteases capable of binding active neuroserpin functions in this capacity. In summary, neuroserpin levels appear to be carefully regulated by LRP and an unidentified cofactor, and this pathway may be critical for maintaining the balance between proteases and inhibitors.

Increasing evidence implicates an important role for tPA in synaptic plasticity and memory development. For example, tPA is induced as an immediate-early gene during long term potentiation (1.Qian Z.

This is further supported by studies showing that injection of neuroserpin markedly delays the progression of seizure activity in wild-type, but not tPA-deficient, mice (15.Yepes M. Sandkvist M.

In the present investigation, we have characterized mechanisms that regulate levels of neuroserpin and identified receptors responsible for binding and mediating the catabolism of this molecule. The results demonstrate that both active neuroserpin and the tPA·neuroserpin complex are rapidly internalized in an LRP-dependent process. Surprisingly, active neuroserpin does not directly bind to LRP, implying that a cofactor molecule may facilitate this process.

The protein was labeled with [125I]iodine (Amersham Biosciences) using IODOGEN (Pierce) to a specific activity of 3–25 μCi/μg as described by the manufacturer. Fluorescence-labeled neuroserpin was prepared by conjugating neuroserpin with Alexa Fluor 546 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described by the manufacturer. The cleaved form of neuroserpin was prepared by incubating 125I-labeled neuroserpin (800 nm) with 1.3 μm tPA for 4 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography confirmed that all of the 125I-labeled neuroserpin was present as the cleaved form.

A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 7 days before the assays. Genotyping of uPA and tPA alleles were performed as described (29.Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Danton M.J.S. Daugherty C.C. Romer J. Dano K. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Degen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunoblotting and Ligand Blotting—Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on gels (4–20, 4–12, or 8% Novex® Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) under nonreducing conditions. The extracts were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting and ligand blotting were performed as described using 1 μg/ml anti-LRP rabbit IgG, or 1 μg/ml mouse polyclonal anti-VLDLR IgG goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate or goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). Solid Phase Binding Assay—96-well microtiter plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with LRP or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (4 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, with 1 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then blocked with 3% BSA in Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2 (300 μl/well,2hat room temperature). Complex of neuroserpin and tPA was made by incubating the two proteins at a neuroserpin·tPA molar ratio of 1:1.6 (800:1330 nm) for 5 min at room temperature in Hepes, pH 7.5, with 3% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2. Neuroserpin was added to wells (100 μl/well) in increasing concentrations (from 4 to 64 nm) in Tris-buffered saline, 3% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. Preformed neuroserpin·tPA complex was added to wells to a final neuroserpin concentrations of 4 to 64 nm. The selectivity of the binding for LRP was assessed by measuring binding to wells coated with just BSA. LRP- and BSA-coated microtiter wells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature and then washed with the wash buffer (the blocking buffer with 0.05% Tween 20). The wells were broken apart, and their radioactivity was measured. Measurements were performed in duplicate. Fluorescent Microscopy—The primary cortical cultures were used after 7 days of culturing on coverglasses (Fisher Scientific) coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). One hour before the experiment, cells were washed and preincubated with the assay media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nutridoma® NS media supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5% BSA). Cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled (Alexa546) neuroserpin (20 nm) and/or Alexa Fluor 488-mouse anti-LRP IgG 5A6B6 for times indicated in figure legends. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, rinsed with distilled water, and mounted with FluorSave™ reagent (Calbiochem). For detection of the endogenous LRP fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 5% donkey serum for 1 h at 37 °C, and incubated with rabbit anti-LRP 2629 antibody (25 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverglasses were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (25 μg/ml) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, rinsed with distilled water, and mounted with FluorSave™ reagent. Fluorescent and phase contrast images were obtained on a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope using Nikon Plan Apo 100×/1.4 oil objective and immersion oil type FF (Cargille Laboratories, Cedar Grove, NJ) at room temperature. Images were acquired with a Radiance 2100 laser scanning system (Bio-Rad) using Laser Sharp 2000 version 4.1 software (Bio-Rad) and processed using Adobe PhotoShop software. Cell Internalization and Degradation Assays—Mouse fibroblasts were plated on 12-well tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc., New York, NY) coated with polylysine 1 day prior to the experiment and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, DC) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The primary cortical cultures were used after 7 days in culture. The experiments were performed when cells were ∼80% confluent. One hour before the experiment, the cells were washed and preincubated with the assay media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Nutridoma® NS medium supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5% BSA). In certain experiments, the cells were incubated with 2 μm RAP, 100 μm chloroquine, the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), antibodies, or the assay media for 15–75 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 12 nm125I-neuroserpin (active, complexed with tPA, or cleaved) to the wells. The cells were incubated with the labeled neuroserpin with or without RAP or antibody for 10 min to 10 h at 37 °C. Degradation is defined as the radioactivity in the cell culture medium that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of radioactivity in the absence of cells is subtracted. Trypsin-Versene mixture (BioWhittaker (a Cambrex company), Walkersville, MD) with proteinase K (0.05 mg/ml) were added to washed cells, and the cells were collected and centrifuged. Internalization of 125I-neuroserpin was determined as radioactivity that is resistant to release from cells by trypsin with proteinase K (i.e. the radioactivity of the pellet). The cell numbers or total protein contained in well for each experimental condition were measured in parallel wells to normalize counts to cell number in well and to ensure that the treatment did not cause cell detachment. To analyze internalized radiolabeled protein, the cells were collected with trypsin-proteinase K, and then subjected to centrifugation in Eppendorfs with 10-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cell pellets were diluted in the cell extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) with Complete™ proteinase inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions; the gels were dried and exposed to MS film. The Neuroserpin·tPA Complex Is Relatively Unstable—Barker-Carlson et al. (30.Barker-Carlson K. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46852-46857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that tPA rapidly reacts with neuroserpin to form a covalent complex that can be detected as a higher molecular weight form upon SDS-PAGE. They found, however, that in contrast to other serpin-enzyme complexes, the neuroserpin·tPA complex readily dissociates releasing free tPA and cleaved neuroserpin. Prior to examining the binding of neuroserpin and neuroserpin·tPA complexes to purified LRP, we performed experiments to determine the extent of complex formation and stability under experimental conditions used for in vitro binding studies and cell uptake experiments. As reported by Barker-Carlson et al., we found that tPA rapidly reacts with 125I-labeled neuroserpin to form a covalent complex evident by the slower mobility band upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) (30.Barker-Carlson K. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46852-46857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, only a portion of the total 125I-labeled neuroserpin was detected as a covalent complex with tPA after incubation with a molar excess of tPA. With increasing time of incubation, significant amounts of cleaved forms of neuroserpin appeared, most likely arising from dissociation of the tPA·neuroserpin complex (30.Barker-Carlson K. Lawrence D.A. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46852-46857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For the experiments in the current study, we reacted neuroserpin with tPA for 5 min before diluting and adding to cells or microtiter wells coated with LRP. As evident from the analysis in Fig. 1, the neuroserpin·tPA complex contains significant amounts of both active and cleaved forms of neuroserpin. Neuroserpin Binds to LRP in Vitro Only after Incubation with tPA—The ability of active neuroserpin and neuroserpin incubated with tPA (hereafter referred to as the neuroserpin·tPA complex) to bind LRP was assessed by employing a solid phase binding assay. Purified LRP was immobilized in microtiter wells, and incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled native neuroserpin (Fig. 2A), 125I-labeled cleaved neuroserpin (Fig. 2B), or 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA complexes (Fig. 2C). The results demonstrate low binding of native and cleaved forms of 125I-labeled neuroserpin to immobilized LRP (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, when tPA was premixed with 125I-labeled neuroserpin prior to the assay, the binding of 125I-labeled neuroserpin to LRP increased substantially (Fig. 2B). The increased binding of 125I-neuroserpin to immobilized LRP when tPA is present suggests that the tPA·neuroserpin complex has much higher affinity for LRP than active or cleaved neuroserpin. This observation is consistent with previous studies examining the catabolism of antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II, α1-antitrypsin, and PAI-1 by LRP (9.Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31.Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), where it was found that LRP only binds to the serpin·enzyme complex, and no binding of the active or cleaved serpin forms to LRP was detected. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2C, multiple species of neuroserpin are present in the mixture, not all of which bind to LRP. Thus, the affinity of the interaction is not possible to estimate from the data. We also investigated whether RAP is able to block binding of 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA to immobilized LRP. RAP is a known antagonist of LDL receptor family members and is capable of blocking binding of all known ligands to this class of receptors (23.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Our results demonstrate that RAP significantly reduces the binding of 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA to immobilized LRP (Fig. 2D), confirming that RAP antagonizes binding of 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA complexes to LRP like all other known ligands for this receptor. Both 125I-Neuroserpin and 125I-Neuroserpin·tPA Complex Are Efficiently Internalized by Murine Primary Cortical Cultures in an LRP-mediated Process—Because neuroserpin is primarily expressed in neurons, we used cortical cultures from mouse embryos to assess whether 125I-labeled neuroserpin and 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA complexes are internalized by these cells. Several LDL receptor family members are expressed in the brain, and thus we subjected cell extracts from these cultures to immunoblot analysis. The results (Fig. 3) revealed that both LRP and the VLDL receptor are expressed in cells present in these cultures, whereas no LRP-2 (megalin) was detected in these cells (data not shown). Initial experiments were performed to characterize LRP localization and function in the primary cortical cultures employing fluorescent microscopy. The primary cultures of mouse cortex were plated on glass coverslips and maintained in culture for 7 days, during which time cells develop an elaborated network of axons and dendrites (Fig. 4A). To examine LRP localization and to confirm its function as an endocytic receptor in these cells, fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody 5A6, which binds the LRP ectodomain on the β-subunit, was incubated with cell cultures for 7 min at 37 °C to label the pool of receptors undergoing internalization from the cell surface. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP IgG to detect total cellular LRP. Confocal fluorescent microscopy revealed that LRP is localized in punctuate structures throughout the cell body and neuronal processes (Fig. 4B), and we conclude from these data that the majority of LRP is located within compartments of the endocytic pathway. When fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibody 5A6 was incubated with the cells, immunofluorescence was detected in LRP-positive endosomes on the cell periphery (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that LRP undergoes internalization from the surface of neuronal cells. Of interest, the internalized 5A6 antibodies can be detected not only in neuronal somas but also in processes, revealing LRP activity in remote dendritic elements, such as branching regions and/or synapses (Fig. 4, B and C, insets).Fig. 4LRP is localized within endosomal compartments in murine primary cortical cultures. Murine primary cortical cultures were grown for 7 days on coverslips, and were then incubated for 7 min at 37 °C with Alexa488-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-LRP antibody 5A6 to visualize functionally active LRP. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP antibody to visualize total LRP. The scale bar corresponds to a length of 10 μm. A, phase contrast shows location of cell body and extensions. B, rhodamine fluorescence shows a punctuate pattern of endogenous LRP distribution. C, Alexa488 fluorescence shows a punctuate pattern of internalized anti-LRP 5A6 antibody corresponding to the distribution of functionally active LRP. D, merge of the rhodamine and Alexa488 fluorescence shows localization of functionally active and total LRP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated the ability of these cells to mediate the uptake of various forms of 125I-labeled NS (Fig. 5A). The results reveal that cortical cultures efficiently internalized both 125I-labeled active neuroserpin and 125I-labeled neuroserpin·tPA complexes, and their internalization was significantly reduced when excess RAP was included in the assay. The ability of RAP to block the internalization of both neuroserpin and neuroserpin·tPA complex indicates the involvement of an LDL receptor family member in this process. The results in Fig. 5A also demonstrate that cleaved 125I-labeled neuroserpin was not effectively internalized by these cells, confirming that this form of neuroserpin is not recognized by LRP. To assess which receptor is responsible for internalization, specific antibodies were utilized. Anti-LRP IgG blocked ∼60% of the 125I-neuroserpin internalized, whereas anti-"
https://openalex.org/W1969550052,"Acrolein is a representative carcinogenic aldehyde found ubiquitously in the environment and formed endogenously through oxidation reactions, such as lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed amino acid oxidation. It shows facile reactivity toward DNA to form an exocyclic DNA adduct. To verify the formation of acrolein-derived DNA adduct under oxidative stress in vivo, we raised a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb21) against the acrolein-modified DNA and found that the antibody most significantly recognized an acrolein-modified 2′ -deoxyadenosine. On the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the major antigenic product of mAb21 was the 1,N6-propano-2′ -deoxyadenosine adduct. The exposure of rat liver epithelial RL34 cells to acrolein resulted in a significant accumulation of the acrolein-2′ -deoxyadenosine adduct in the nuclei. Formation of this adduct under oxidative stress in vivo was immunohistochemically examined in rats exposed to ferric nitrilotriacetate, a carcinogenic iron chelate that specifically induces oxidative stress in the kidneys of rodents. It was observed that the acrolein-2′ -deoxyadenosine adduct was formed in the nuclei of the proximal tubular cells, the target cells of this carcinogenesis model. The same cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody 5F6 that recognizes an acrolein-lysine adduct, by which cytosolic accumulation of acrolein-modified proteins appeared. Similar results were also obtained from myeloperoxidase knockout mice exposed to the iron complex, suggesting that the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation system might not be essential for the generation of acrolein in this experimental animal carcinogenesis model. The data obtained in this study suggest that the formation of a carcinogenic aldehyde through lipid peroxidation may be causally involved in the pathophysiological effects associated with oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2057529869,"Oscillations in citric acid cycle intermediates have never been previously reported in any type of cell. Here we show that adding pyruvate to isolated mitochondria from liver, pancreatic islets, and INS-1 insulinoma cells or adding glucose to intact INS-1 cells causes sustained oscillations in citrate levels. Other citric acid cycle intermediates measured either did not oscillate or possibly oscillated with a low amplitude. In INS-1 mitochondria citrate oscillations are in phase with NAD(P) oscillations, and in intact INS-1 cells citrate oscillations parallel oscillations in ATP, suggesting that these processes are co-regulated. Oscillations have been extensively studied in the pancreatic beta cell where oscillations in glycolysis, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H and ATP/ADP ratios, plasma membrane electrical activity, calcium levels, and insulin secretion have been well documented. Because the mitochondrion is the major site of ATP synthesis and NADH oxidation and the only site of citrate synthesis, mitochondria need to be synchronized for these factors to oscillate. In suspensions of mitochondria from various organs, most of the citrate is exported from the mitochondria. In addition, citrate inhibits its own synthesis. We propose that this enables citrate itself to act as one of the cellular messengers that synchronizes mitochondria. Furthermore, because citrate is a potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, the pacemaker of glycolytic oscillations, citrate may act as a metabolic link between mitochondria and glycolysis. Citrate oscillations may coordinate oscillations in mitochondrial energy production and anaplerosis with glycolytic oscillations, which in the beta cell are known to parallel oscillations in insulin secretion.

The beta cell is a unique fuel sensing organ in which mitochondria transduce a metabolic stimulus into multiple pharmacologic stimuli that activate the movement of insulin granules to the plasma membrane and granule extrusion into the circulation (6MacDonald M.J.

Glucose, the most potent insulin secretagogue, is metabolized via aerobic glycolysis. Anaplerosis, the synthesis of cycle intermediates, and cataplerosis, the export of cycle intermediates from mitochondria (10Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), are most likely very important for insulin secretion. In the beta cell about one-half of pyruvate, the terminal product of aerobic glycolysis in the cytosol, enters mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation through the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, and the other half enters mitochondrial metabolism via decarboxylation catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (11MacDonald M.J.

Because the synthesis of malate and other four-carbon citric acid cycle intermediates from pyruvate beginning with the pyruvate carboxylase reaction is against the direction of citrate synthesis and the citric acid cycle (Fig. 1), this raises an interesting question. How does the synthesis of these four-carbon intermediates proceed simultaneous with citrate synthesis and carbon flux in the cycle unless the synthesis of citrate oscillates out of phase with that of the other cycle intermediates? To address this question we looked for oscillations in several cycle intermediates that are known to be synthesized in large amounts and exported from mitochondria (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol.

Of all the citric acid cycle intermediates measured, citrate levels exhibited the largest oscillations. Citrate oscillations mirrored NAD(P) oscillations in INS-1 mitochondria and paralleled ATP oscillations in intact INS-1 cells, suggesting that oscillations of these factors are regulated by similar mechanisms. From the large body of knowledge on the citric acid cycle, it is possible to speculate on the regulation and physiologic significance of citrate oscillations.

We further suggest that because citrate is a potent inhibitor of phosphofructokinase (23Parmeggiani A. Bowman R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The mixture was centrifuged, the pellet was saved for protein measurements, and the supernatant fraction was neutralized with about 3 μl of 0.92 m KOH. INS-1 cells were maintained for 2 weeks in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium containing 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm pyruvate and then incubated in the same medium modified to contain 5 mm glucose for 22.5 h before the cells were harvested.

ATP was measured with luciferase by luminescence (31Harber M.J. Kricke L.J. Carter T.J.N. Clinical and Biochemical Luminescence. Dekker, New York1982: 189-194Google Scholar) with p1,p5-di (adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate in the reaction mixture to inhibit any nucleoside diphosphokinase present. Protein was measured by the Lowry method (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be as certain as possible that citrate oscillations could not be explained by enzyme cycling of metabolites and co-enzymes present in the extract and/or added with reagents, several additional steps in the analysis of citrate were taken. Commercially obtained pure citrate lyase from Aerobacter aerogenes (Roche Applied Science) was further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, the purity was checked by PAGE, and the purer enzyme was used for citrate assays. In addition, some neutralized perchloric acid extracts from liver mitochondria and intact INS-1 cells were heated at 90 °C for 15 min to inactivate any trace amounts of enzymes possibly not removed by the acid precipitation and/or that might have been reactivated by neutralization of the acid extract. These additional steps in the assay procedure did not change the results. Preliminary studies suggested that citrate might oscillate in suspensions of mitochondria. Proof of this novel observation required rigorous testing. Therefore, we had different individuals perform numerous replicate experiments with both mitochondria and with intact cells every few months for over a year to diminish the possibility that the results were specific to an individual or to seasonal factors. In addition citrate levels were measured by three different individuals, and the values were averaged. We first studied liver mitochondria because they can be readily obtained and, similar to islet mitochondria, possess a high amount of pyruvate carboxylase (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although oscillations in many intermediates were either not observed or were small, citrate oscillations were easily demonstrated in liver mitochondria. When pyruvate was added to liver mitochondria, citrate oscillated with the highest amplitude and with a periodicity of 1.5–2 min. After about 10 min citrate increased and continued to oscillate (Fig. 2, A–D). Oscillations and an increase in citrate did not occur in the absence of an added substrate or in the presence of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Fluctuations in citrate appeared as true oscillations rather than as random levels because sequential data points were connected in a pattern of ascendance followed by a peak and then descendence and a trough. Malate increased steadily after pyruvate was added, but the amplitude of its fluctuations was small relative to its concentration (Fig. 3), suggesting that it did not oscillate. The levels of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate were low, and although they appeared to exhibit an oscillatory pattern, fluctuations in their levels were also low making it difficult to discern with certainty that these intermediates oscillated. Most of their data points appeared to be connected in a sequence of peaks suggestive of low amplitude oscillations. However, some regions of data points appeared to be random fluctuations (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Effect of pyruvate on malate levels in liver mitochondria. Each panel shows a separate experiment. A–C show malate in the same experiments corresponding to those shown in Fig. 2 (A–C, respectively), in which 5 mm pyruvate was added at zero time. D shows an experiment in which no substrate was added.

The conditions were the same as in Fig. 2. Pyruvate was added at zero time. The vertical dashed lines in the panels show fluctuations that might be considered individual oscillations. Negative isocitrate values occur when a blank value is larger than its corresponding total value (see Ref. 19MacDonald M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar for explanation).

In addition, citrate also oscillated in all preparations of INS-1 cells given glucose (Figs. 7 and 8). In INS-1 cell mitochondria citrate oscillations coincided with oscillations in NAD(P) (Fig. 6), and in intact INS-1 cells citrate oscillated in parallel with ATP, but offset by a few seconds (Fig. 7). When no substrate was provided to INS-1 cells, fluctuations in citrate were of lower amplitude and less regular than in the presence of glucose (Fig. 7).Fig. 6Oscillations of citrate and NAD(P) in INS-1 insulinoma cell mitochondria. Mitochondria were incubated in MIM for 15 min at 37 °C exposed to air with gentle shaking before pyruvate was added at time 0, and the samples were obtained every 15 s. The citrate values are the averages of triplicate measurements. Mitochondria incubated without a substrate or incubated with 1,2,3-benzene tricarboxylate, an inhibitor of the citrate transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane, did not exhibit oscillations in citrate (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Oscillations of citrate and ATP in intact INS-1 insulinoma cells.

The citrate values are the averages of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When pyruvate is added to mitochondria from liver, pancreatic islet, or INS-1 cells, sustained large amplitude oscillations in citrate occur. Levels of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate are low, and if they oscillate, their fluctuations are low in amplitude. Although malate increases more than citrate, it does not appear to oscillate. Citrate also clearly oscillates in INS-1 cells given glucose. Although the main purpose of the current work was to conclusively determine whether citrate oscillates in mitochondria and cells and to obtain data that might explain how the oscillations are regulated, the extensive information available on mitochondrial metabolism makes it possible to accurately speculate about the mechanism of regulation of citrate oscillations and their physiological significance. An important question is how mitochondria communicate to become synchronized to form the oscillatory citrate pattern. The answer may involve citrate itself and other cycle intermediates. Communication among individual mitochondria is possible because in suspensions of isolated mitochondria, such as from organs as diverse as liver (16Walter P. Paetkau V. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2523-2532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bobyleva V. Kneer N. Bellei M. Battelli D. Lardy H.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), pancreatic islets (11MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and heart (18LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), almost all of the citrate and malate and several other metabolites formed from the metabolism of substrates can be found in the extramitochondrial space. After citrate reaches a high level, its rapid decrease must occur by the uptake of extramitochondrial citrate back into the mitochondria and metabolism in the citric acid cycle as well as by a decrease in its synthesis. A plausible explanation for the regulation of citrate oscillations can be formulated on the basis of our current data plus what is known from decades of research on the citric acid cycle. Within an individual oscillation, as the citrate level increases and then plateaus (as in Figs. 2, 5, and 6), its rate of synthesis should begin to decrease because citrate synthase is inhibited by its product citrate and also by succinyl-CoA, the product of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction (Fig. 1) (21Williamson J.R. Cooper R.H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 117: K73-K85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Atkinson D.E. Lowenstein J.M. Citric Acid Cycle: Control & Compartmentation. Marcel Dekker, New York1969: 137-162Google Scholar). In addition, the citrate level should decrease via its metabolism. A high NAD level should favor increased flux through the reactions catalyzed by NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1), thus increasing the rate of citrate metabolism. The fact that the citrate profile exactly mirrors the NAD(P) profile in INS-1 cell mitochondria (Fig. 6) is consistent with this idea. Concomitantly with the metabolism of citrate, the NAD level will decrease from its reduction to NADH, and the NADH level will increase. The resulting lower NAD/NADH ratio will decrease flux through the dehydrogenase reactions. As the citrate and the NAD/NADH ratio reach their nadirs, the low citrate level will permit its rate of synthesis to increase, and the low NAD/NADH ratio will slow the rate of citrate metabolism. This will contribute to the ascending part of the citrate profile. The mitochondrial NAD/NADH and ATP/ADP ratios are tightly coupled, and these ratios are known to control flux at various steps of the citric acid cycle (18LaNoue K. Nicklas W.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 102-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Williamson J.R. Cooper R.H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 117: K73-K85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Atkinson D.E.

Adriatica Editrice, Bari, Spain1969: 329-382Google Scholar), including the reaction that synthesizes citrate (Fig. 1). The oscillations in ATP levels in intact INS-1 cells that are parallel with oscillations of citrate (Fig. 7) are also consistent with the idea that ATP/ADP and NAD/NADH oscillations control citrate oscillations or that these factors are controlled by similar mechanisms. In addition to the citric acid cycle per se regulating oscillations in citrate, pyruvate carboxylase may facilitate citrate oscillations by exerting control strength over the availability of oxaloacetate for synthesis of citrate (Fig. 1). This is possible, if not likely, because the level of oxaloacetate is lower than that of acetyl-CoA and all other cycle intermediates (35Walter P. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 239-265Google Scholar, 36Randle P.J. England P.J. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and even lower than the binding sites for oxaloacetate on citrate synthase and other mitochondrial enzymes that react with oxaloacetate, such as malate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase (37Fahien L.A. Davis J.W. Laboy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17935-17942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the supply of oxaloacetate can be rate-limiting for citrate synthesis. The reciprocal flow of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle also might contribute to an oscillatory pattern in citrate levels. Many conditions that activate pyruvate carboxylase are inhibitory to pyruvate dehydrogenase and vice versa (Fig. 1). High ratios of NADH/NAD, acetyl-CoA/CoA and ATP/ADP inhibit the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (38Hansford R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1552-1560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but ATP is a substrate for pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA allosterically activates pyruvate carboxylase (39McClure W.R. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3591-3596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase is activated by calcium (40Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Edgell N.J. Moule S.K. Diggle T.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but calcium inhibits pyruvate carboxylase (39McClure W.R. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3591-3596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, a high NAD/NADH ratio favors flux in the malate dehydrogenase reaction in the direction of oxaloacetate and activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (38Hansford R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1552-1560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Denton R.M. McCormack J.G. Rutter G.A. Burnett P. Edgell N.J. Moule S.K. Diggle T.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This enhances the supply of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA that condense to form citrate. Citrate oscillations may fulfill a requirement in overall cellular metabolism by coordinating mitochondrial energy formation and cataplerosis with oscillations in glycolysis, the pathway that supplies pyruvate for mitochondrial metabolism. High levels of citrate and ATP inhibit the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is widely believed to be the pacemaker of glycolytic oscillations in yeast and mammalian cells (23Parmeggiani A. Bowman R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and adding citrate to cell free extracts of skeletal muscle dampens oscillations of glycolysis (43Tornheim K. Andres V. Schultz V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15675-15678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In intact INS-1 cells, citrate and ATP oscillations are in phase with each other. Although their peaks are offset by a few seconds, they sufficiently overlap to provide simultaneous high levels of both citrate and ATP (Fig. 7). High citrate and ATP by inhibiting glycolysis should slow the supply of pyruvate to mitochondria, and this will be coordinated with the direct inhibitory effects of acetyl-CoA and citrate on their own synthesis (Fig. 1). The resulting lower levels of mitochondrial-generated citrate and ATP will permit phosphofructokinase to be reactivated, and this will trigger another cycle of increased formation of pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and citrate. Citrate oscillations may have other consequences, such as causing oscillations in citrate-derived malonyl-CoA. In addition to supplying acetyl-CoA for malonyl-CoA synthesis, citrate is an allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme that converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA itself is believed to be a regulator of insulin secretion (20Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Deeney et al. (5Deeney J.T. Kohler M. Kubik K. Brown G. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36946-36950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) observed that oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio, calcium levels, and insulin release in INS-1 insulinoma cells have a periodicity of about 1.5 min similar to the periodicity of oscillations of citrate we observed in mitochondrial preparations (Figs. 2, 5, and 6) and in citrate and ATP in INS-1 cells (Figs. 7 and 8). The current results provide new and unexpected insights into the role of citrate in maintaining an essential link that coordinates glycolytic flux with mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and anaplerosis. This is very likely necessary for efficient cellular metabolism and further supports the idea that the control of metabolic flux in glucose metabolism is distributed among many enzyme reactions (27Kashiwaya Y.

It is difficult to form this cis-glycosidic bond (α-linkage) with high specificity and masking of the amino function as a non-participating group is required to generate the α-linkage. In addition, the carboxyl group is generally masked as a protected hydroxyl group during glycosylation, because the presence of this functional group renders GlcA/IdoA a poor glycosyl donor or acceptor. The enzymatic method for HS assembly could allow for a more rapid synthesis of structures of interest, which would facilitate the establishment of structure-function relationships of this class of molecules. This approach requires at least a dozen enzymes/isoforms involved in HS biosynthesis, and the combination of enzymes needed to generate a specific HS structure is unknown. To examine the potential of this method, we carried out enzymatic synthesis of biologically active HS polysaccharides. Since anticoagulant HS structures are well established, we initiated our explorations to determine the practicability of generating anticoagulant polysaccharides. Heparin accelerates the inactivation of blood coagulation enzymes by ATIII (6Damus P.S. Hicks M. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1973; 246: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 7Rosenberg R.D.

A unique pentasaccharide domain was found to bind to ATIII in a highly specific way and to promote rapid inhibition of the blood coagulation enzymes. The critical structural features of the pentasaccharide required for the anticoagulant function are 3-O and 6-O sulfates of residues C and A, respectively (Fig. 1) (8Atha D.H. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M.

These two residues are thermodynamically linked and serve as pincer to induce the conformational change in ATIII that is required for accelerating coagulation enzyme inactivation (13Desai U.R.

Animal-derived heparin has been in use over seven decades as an anticoagulant. Despite having undesirable side effects such as bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with arterial thrombosis, it is still the drug of choice in combination therapy to treat humans after strokes and heart attacks. Recent concern about the potential spread of bovine spongiphorm encephalopathy to humans has increased interest in the development of alternatives to animal sources of heparin. Sinay et al.

We describe here our enzymatic approach to rapidly synthesize ATIII-binding classical and non-classical anticoagulant polysaccharide structures for the first time. We should like to note our companion investigations, which explored different strategies and resolved different problems of this novel synthetic approach (15Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Lawrence R. Lech M.

In those studies, we have shown that enzymes whose actions do not interfere with each other can be employed simultaneously in order to shorten the time of synthesis while generating the desired products. Finally, we also demonstrated that the sequential use of enzymes whose actions facilitate each other can be utilized to achieve the regional selectivity and hence lead to the production of homogeneous oligosaccharide of defined structures.

[32S]PAPS was purchased from Calbiochem. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), heparitinase II (no EC number), and heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) were purchased from Seikagagu. ATIII and Factor Xa were from Hematologic Technologies Inc.

Polysaccharides were digested with 1 mU of Hep1, -II, and -III in a total volume of 100 μl of 40 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 3.3 mm calcium chloride at 37 °C overnight. Separation and characterization of 35S-labeled disaccharides were carried out by HPLC using a C18-reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) (RPIP-HPLC) (Vydac). Solvent A was double-distilled water containing 10 mm ammonium dihydrophosphate and 1 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrophosphate. Solvent B was 40% acetonitrile containing 10 mm ammonium dihydrophosphate and 1 mm tetrabutylammonium dihydrophosphate. The RPIP-HPLC was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with the following stepwise gradients: 100% solvent A for 15 min; 6% solvent B for 25 min; 12% solvent B for 40 min; 40% solvent B for 60 min; 100% solvent B for 10 min and finally 100% solvent A for 20 min to reequilibrate the column. Flow Injection Capillary Liquid Chromatography—An ultimate capillary HPLC workstation (Dionex) was used for microseparation. UltiChrom software was used in data acquisition and analysis. A gradient elution was performed, using a binary solvent system composed of water (eluent A) and 70% aqueous methanol (eluent B), both containing 8 mm acetic acid and 5 mm dibutylamine as an ion-pairing agent. HPLC separations were performed on a 0.3 mm × 250 mm C18 polymeric silica column (Vydac). The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and the flow rate was set to 5 μl min–1. Sample volumes of 6.3 μl were injected. For disaccharide analysis, a 20-μl sample injection loop was used. The chromatographic conditions were optimized for resolution of disaccharides. In brief, non-sulfated disaccharide was eluted with 100% A, single sulfated disaccharides were eluted with 10% B, isocratic elution with 20% B for double-sulfated disaccharides, followed by isocratic elution with 35% B for triple sulfated disaccharide. The column was washed and equilibrated by further elution with 100% B for 10 min, returning to 100% A for 10 min at the end of the run. The absorbance of the column eluate was monitored at 232 nm. Mass spectra were acquired on a Mariner BioSpectrometry Workstation ESI time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). In the negative-ion mode, the instrument was calibrated with bis-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid, heptadecafluorononanoic acid, and perfluorotetradecanoic acid. Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas as well as a nebulizer. Conditions for ESI-MS were as follows: nebulizer flow 1 liter/min, nozzle temperature 140 °C, drying gas (N2) flow 0.6 liters/min, spray tip potential 2.8 kV, nozzle potential 70 V, and skimmer potential 9 V. Negative ion spectra were generated by scanning the range of m/z 40–2000. During analyses, the indicated vacuum was 2.1 × 10–6 Torr. 30 mg of K5 polysaccharide was dissolved in 7.5 ml of 2 n NaOH, incubated for 24 h at 60 °C, and cooled to room temperature, and was adjusted to pH 7. The solution was warmed to 45–50 °C. 100 mg of sodium carbonate, and 100 mg of trimethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex were added in a single step and incubated for 12 h. An equal portion of sodium carbonate and trimethylamine-sulfur trioxide was added after 12 h and the selective N-sulfation was continued for an additional 12 h at the same temperature. The solution was then brought to room temperature, dialyzed overnight against distilled water, using 1000 Da mwco cellulose membrane. The dialysate was lyophilized to obtain salt-free, N-sulfated K5 heparosan polysaccharide. The purified polysaccharide 2 was digested with heparitinases, and the resulting mixture was analyzed by LC/MS. The m/z of 416 was observed for the disaccharide corresponding to [M-H]–1. The reaction mixture, after termination of sulfation, was diluted to 1 ml with 0.25 m NaCl, 20 mm NaAc, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 6.0, and then 1 mg of glycogen was added to minimize nonspecific interaction of polysaccharides with the column matrix. The diluted reaction mixture was loaded on 0.1 ml of DEAE-Sephacel column, pre-equilibrated with 2 ml of washing buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl, 20 mm NaAc, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 6.0. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of washing buffer, and the polysaccharide was eluted from the column with 2 ml of 1 m NaCl in 20 mm NaAc, pH 6.0. 8 ml of absolute ethanol and 1 mg of glycogen were added to 2 ml of eluent in a 50-ml disposable polystyrene tube and incubated at 4 °C overnight to facilitate the precipitation of polysaccharide. The precipitate was obtained by centrifuging in a RC3B centrifuge for 15 min at 3000 rpm. The obtained pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol twice and finally dissolved in 200 μl of double distilled water for subsequent characterization. cDNA Cloning of Human Glucuronyl C5 Epimerase—A cDNA clone coding for human C5 epimerase was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA panel (Origene) by screening with PCR primers spanning nucleotides 7–157 of the coding region. A donor plasmid for the preparation of recombinant baculovirus expressing a soluble form of the epimerase was constructed in pFastBac HT plasmid modified by the insertion of honeybee melittin signal peptide ahead of the histidine tag. The construction employed a synthetic oligonucleotide adapter that also encoded amino acids 35–44 of the epimerase and two restriction fragments isolated from the cDNA clone (TaqI to EcoRI and EcoRI to SacI) that incorporate the rest of the epimerase coding region. Baculovirus Expression and Purification of Glucuronyl C5 Epimerase—Human glucuronyl C5 epimerase recombinant baculovirus was prepared using the donor and the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that recombinant bacmid DNA was purified using an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and transfection of Sf9 cells was scaled up to employ 15 μg of bacmid DNA and 2.5 × 107 exponentially growing cells in four 100-mm dishes. Medium containing recombinant baculovirus was harvested at 3 days post-transfection and amplified twice for about 65 h each on Sf9 cells. The resulting high titer viral stock was stored in aliquots (0.75 ml) sufficient to infect 3.5 × 108 cells, as determined by Western blotting of medium from infected cells using (His)4 antibody (Qiagen). Infected cells were plated in ten 150-mm dishes and incubated at 26 °C for 90–96 h. The pooled medium was centrifuged at 400 × g, adjusted to 10 mm in HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4, chilled on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. The clarified pool diluted in half with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, made 1 mm in phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and applied to an 8-ml column of ToyoPearl AF heparin 650 m. The column was washed with 40 ml of hCG 50 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2% glycerol, 0.6% CHAPS, 50 mm NaCl) and eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient of 50–600 mm NaCl in hCG. Aliquots of selected 1-ml fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of the histidine tag, and peak fractions were adjusted to 50% glycerol. Glucuronyl C5 Epimerase Reaction—N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide 2 (1 μg) was incubated with purified glucuronyl C5 epimerase at 37 °C in a volume of 50 μl containing 25 mm HEPES, 40 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, or alternatively in 25 mm MES (pH 7.0) with or without polymer p40. After incubation for 12 h, the fresh epimerase was added, and incubation was extended for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with DEAE wash buffer and purified on a 0.1 ml DEAE column. The epimerase treated N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide was treated with [35S]PAPS in the presence of 2-OST sulfotransferase in total volume of 10 μl for 30 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed on 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The epimerase treated N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide was also treated with [35S]PAPS in the presence of 6-OST-1 or 6-OST-2a. After DEAE purification, the polysaccharide was subjected to low pH nitrous acid and sodium borohydride treatment to obtain the disaccharide mixtures. The disaccharide profile was analyzed by HPLC on C18 column to estimate the percentage of glucuronic acid and iduronic acid. The labeling buffer contains 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.075 mg/ml protamine chloride, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For a 25-μl reaction, the following were assembled: 1 μg of substrate, 12.5 μl of 2× labeling buffer, 70 ng of the expressed sulfotransferase, 2–10 μl [35S]PAPS (1 μl ∼1.0 × 107 cpm) or [32S]PAPS or [34S]PAPS, and the appropriate amount of water. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time ranging from 30 min to overnight, then diluted to 1 ml with DEAE wash buffer, and purified on a DEAE column. Alternatively, the reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was used for GMSA or polyacrylamide gel analysis. Modified polysaccharide at each stage was digested with heparitinases and analyzed by IPRP-HPLC. Heparin-ATIII binding buffer contained 12% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For a typical 20-μl binding reaction, radiolabeled polysaccharide (1∼50,000 cpm) was mixed with ATIII (1 μg) in the binding buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature (23 °C) for 20 min and was then applied to a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel (with 0.1% of bisacrylamide). The gel buffer was 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA, and the electrophoresis buffer was 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA. The gel was run at 6 volts/cm for 1–2 h with an S.E. 250 Mighty Small II gel apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to 3-mm paper and dried under vacuum. The dried gel was autoradiographed by a PhosphorImager 445SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The image was analyzed with NIH Image 1.60, and the band intensities were evaluated. Purified human factor Xa (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) was diluted to a concentration of 2.85 mg/ml with 50% glycerol. Human antithrombin III (Cutter Laboratories) was dissolved in PBS at 5.0 mg/ml and frozen in aliquots. Chromogenic substrate S-2765 (Chromogenix) was dissolved in water at 25 mm. Porcine heparin (Sigma, 174 I.U./mg) was employed as a standard. Protein working stocks were prepared by diluting factor Xa 1:500 in PBS and ATIII 3:1000 in 1.6× PBS, both containing bovine serum albumin at 5 mg/ml, and were held at 4 °C. Substrate was diluted to 2.25 mm in PBS containing Polybrene at 1.0 mg/ml and held at 37 °C. The assay was initiated by adding 20 μl of ATIII (2.6 × 10–7m) to 12 μl of heparin standard or test polysaccharide (diluted in distilled water) with incubation at 37 °C for 90 s. Factor Xa stock (20 μl, 1.24 × 10–7m) was added and mixed. After 240 s of incubation, 20 μl of substrate was added and incubated for an additional 30 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 52 μl of 60% acetic acid, and sample absorbance was measured at 405 nm. A non-sulfated N-acetyl heparosan 1, a capsular polysaccharide of E. coli strain K5, resembles the unmodified nascent HS chain of proteoglycans (Scheme 1) (17Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The production and isolation of bacterial K5 heparosan for use as a starting material in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of bioactive HS polysaccharides is an attractive alternative to the laborious chemical synthesis of the HS backbone. The partial digestion of the isolated polymer with heparitinase enzymes was carried out and analyzed by capillary reverse phase ion-pair high performance liquid chromatography coupled to micro-electrospray ionization time of flight (RP-IP-HPLC-ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry (24Kuberan B. Lech M. Zhang L.J. Wu Z.L.L. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8707-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The identity of HS precursor polysaccharide structure 1 was confirmed (Scheme 1). The second step is synthesis of N-sulfated polysaccharide 2, as it is essential for subsequent enzymatic transformations. N-Deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase is a single protein that catalyzes the two initial modifications, N-deacetylation and N-sulfation, of the polysaccharide precursor in the biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate (25Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This enzyme exists as four isoforms in humans. The ratio of N-deacetylase to N-sulfotransferase activities differ dramatically among the four isoforms. For these reasons, we utilized the established simple chemical approaches to prepare the N-sulfated polysaccharide 2 (Scheme 1). N-deacetylation of polysaccharide 1 was accomplished by hydrazinolysis at 100 °C or alkaline treatment with 2 m NaOH at 60–65 °C. The resulting free amino groups were selectively N-sulfated using trimethylamine sulfur trioxide, a chemoselective sulfonating agent, under controlled reaction conditions (27Lloyd A.G. Embery G. Fowler L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Polysaccharide 2 was partially digested using heparitinases and analyzed by LC/MS to confirm its identity. Next, synthesis of polysaccharide 3 was undertaken, in which N-sulfated polysaccharide 2 was treated with heparan sulfate glucuronyl C-5 epimerase, resulting in inversion of stereochemical configuration at the C-5 carbon of many uronic acids along the chain. To date there are no efficient chemical strategies available to selectively epimerize glucuronic acid to iduronic acid. In fact the presence of both epimers along the polysaccharide adds further complexity and challenges in chemical synthesis and structure-function relationship studies (21Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjellen L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandback D. Roden L. Lindahl U. Li J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epimerization proceeds only at residues located at the reducing side of N-sulfated glucosamine residues, and only with uronic acids that are neither O-sulfated nor adjacent to O-sulfated glucosamine residues (21Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjellen L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Kusche M. Hannesson H.H. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, epimerase treatment was carried out before any further modifications with sulfotransferases. The epimerization process has been monitored in the past by measuring the release of 3H2O from 3H-labeled (at C-5) polysaccharide 2 (21Li J. Hagner-McWhirter A. Kjellen L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21538-21543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We devised a new strategy in which we monitored the epimerization of polysaccharide 2 by determining selective incorporation of sulfate at the 2-O position of the newly generated iduronic acid using limiting amounts of [35S]PAPS and HS 2-OST. The selective 2-O sulfation of iduronic acid on polysaccharide 3 was observed to be predominant whereas incorporation of sulfate on polysaccharide 2 was observed to be minor (Fig. 2). Synthesis of polysaccharide 3 containing iduronic acid was confirmed on 5% native polyacrylamide gel through selective radioactive 2-O sulfation of iduronic acid. This approach is better than traditional approaches, which involve measuring the release of tritium as 3H2O to monitor the epimerization process. Our approach is superior because, in our opinion, the classical approach may be biased by isotope effects, and furthermore the assay is relatively slow and therefore could not be employed in real-time monitoring of our synthetic strategy. Next the extent of epimerization was determined by treating the polysaccharide 3 with [35S]PAPS in the presence of 6-OSTs to prepare radioactive 6-O sulfated polysaccharide 7, which was then subjected to low pH nitrous acid and sodium borohydride treatment (31Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to obtain two disaccharides, GluA-anManR[635S] and IdoA-anManR[635S]. These two disaccharides were then resolved on C18 reverse phase HPLC to determine the percentage of each epimer (Fig. 3). Normally one quantifies the percentage of iduronic acid and glucuronic acid by nitrous degradation coupled to [3H]borohydride end labeling. However, the traditional approach can be utilized only in the analysis of polymers that are fully N- and O-sulfated. In the case of polysaccharide 3, the above approach generated two disaccharides, which do not contain"
https://openalex.org/W2132453124,"Nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (NOV) is highly expressed in the nervous system. We investigated its biological activity by expressing the human NOV gene (NOVH) in a human glioblastoma cell line that is negative for NOVH and by analyzing four clones with different levels of NOVH expression. There was no difference in cell proliferation between the NOVH-expressing cell lines, but there was increased cell adhesion and migration that correlated with increasing NOVH expression. Gene expression profiling was used to investigate the mechanisms by which NOVH expression regulated cell activity. We identified two induced genes in NOVH-expressing cells that are involved in cell migration: matrix metalloprotease (MMP)3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-alpha. Our studies show that PDGFR-alpha induced MMP3 gene expression and increased cell proliferation and cell migration upon stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA. We also show that the induction of MMP3 in cells expressing NOVH is potentiated by either cell density, serum, or PDGF-BB. Thus, expression of NOVH in glioblastoma cells triggers a cascade of gene expression resulting in increased cell adhesion and migration."
https://openalex.org/W2117209016,"The epithelial cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule-1) is down-regulated in colon, prostate, breast, and liver cancer. Here we show that CEACAM1-4S, a splice form with four Ig-like ectodomains and a short cytoplasmic domain (14 amino acids), directly associates with annexin II, a lipid raft-associated molecule, which is also down-regulated in many cancers. Annexin II was identified using a glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pull-down assay in which the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM-4S was fused to glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase, the fusion protein was incubated with cell lysates, and isolated proteins were sequenced by mass spectrometry. The interaction was confirmed first by reciprocal immunoprecipitations using anti-CEACAM1 and anti-annexin II antibodies and second by confocal laser microscopy showing co-localization of CEACAM1 with annexin II in mammary epithelial cells grown in Matrigel. In addition, CEACAM1 co-localized with p11, a component of the tetrameric AIIt complex at the plasma membrane, and with annexin II in secretory vesicles. Immobilized, oriented peptides from the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S were shown to directly associate with bovine AIIt, which is 98% homologous to human AIIt, with average <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> values of about 30 nm using surface plasmon resonance, demonstrating direct binding of functionally relevant AIIt to the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S."
https://openalex.org/W2034532438,"The modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by kinases and phosphatases represents a key mechanism in controlling synaptic signal transduction. However, molecular determinants involved in the specific targeting and interactions of these enzymes are largely unknown. Here, we identified both catalytic γ-isoforms of protein phosphatase 1C (PP1γ1 and PP1γ2) as binding partners of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1a, 5a, and 5b in yeast cells and pull-down assays, using recombinant and native protein preparations. The tissue distribution of interacting proteins was compared, and protein phosphatase 1C was detected in dendrites of retinal bipolar cells expressing the respective interacting glutamate receptors. We mapped interacting domains within binding partners and identified five amino acids in the intracellular C termini of the metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1a, 5a, 5b, and 7b being both necessary and sufficient to bind protein phosphatase 1C. Furthermore, we show a dose-dependent competition of these C termini in binding the enzyme. Based on our data, we investigated the structure of the identified amino acids bound to protein phosphatase 1C by homology-based molecular modeling. In summary, these results provide a molecular description of the interaction between protein phosphatase 1C and metabotropic glutamate receptors and thereby increase our understanding of glutamatergic signal transduction. The modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by kinases and phosphatases represents a key mechanism in controlling synaptic signal transduction. However, molecular determinants involved in the specific targeting and interactions of these enzymes are largely unknown. Here, we identified both catalytic γ-isoforms of protein phosphatase 1C (PP1γ1 and PP1γ2) as binding partners of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1a, 5a, and 5b in yeast cells and pull-down assays, using recombinant and native protein preparations. The tissue distribution of interacting proteins was compared, and protein phosphatase 1C was detected in dendrites of retinal bipolar cells expressing the respective interacting glutamate receptors.

In summary, these results provide a molecular description of the interaction between protein phosphatase 1C and metabotropic glutamate receptors and thereby increase our understanding of glutamatergic signal transduction. The correct targeting and localization of proteins to synaptic specializations represents an important biological mechanism to regulate neuronal excitability. Increasing evidence underlines the importance of macromolecular signaling complexes, where functionally related proteins such as ion channels, neurotransmitters receptors, kinases, and phosphatases are arranged in close vicinity and are physically anchored to the synaptic cytoskeleton. Therefore, identification and characterization of interactions between synaptically localized proteins adds substantially to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Receptors for glutamate are divided in ion channel-associated (ionotropic) receptors of the AMPA-, Kainate-, and NMDA-type and in G-protein coupled (metabotropic) receptors. Although ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 1The abbreviations used are: mGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorPP1protein phosphatase 1GSTglutathione S-transferasePKCprotein kinase CCNScentral nervous systemOPLouter plexiform layerINLinner nuclear layerIPLinner plexiform layerGCLganglion cell layerntnucleotide(s)Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: mGluRmetabotropic glutamate receptorPP1protein phosphatase 1GSTglutathione S-transferasePKCprotein kinase CCNScentral nervous systemOPLouter plexiform layerINLinner nuclear layerIPLinner plexiform layerGCLganglion cell layerntnucleotide(s)Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. modulate neuronal excitability and development, synaptic plasticity, transmitter release, and memory function using a variety of intracellular second messenger systems (1.Schoepp D.D.

Glutamate-mediated neurotransmission depends critically on the regulation by associated proteins. The intracellular C termini of mGluR1 and mGluR5 (see Fig. 1A) interact with Calmodulin, Siah-1A, adenosine receptor A1, α-Tubulin, Tamalin, and Homer, the latter linking group I mGluRs to the NMDA/PSD-95 complex via Shank scaffold proteins (19.Brakeman P.R.

Recently, we identified two catalytic isoforms of protein phosphatase 1C (PP1C), PP1γ1 and PP1γ2, as binding partners of mGluR7b (31.Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No interaction was observed with the mGluR7a isoform, indicating that binding of PP1C to mGluR7b was regulated by alternative splicing of the mGluR7 transcript. Furthermore, preliminary results of our laboratory indicated a physical interaction between PP1γ1 and mGluR5 in yeast cells. Here, we investigated the binding between the two PP1C isoforms PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 and the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5. We compared the expression profile between PP1γ1/2 and interacting mGluRs and showed in the retina that PP1γ1 is present in the same subcellular compartments as mGluR1 and mGluR5. Furthermore, we mapped PP1γ1-binding amino acids in the interacting glutamate receptors mGluR1a, mGluR5a/b, and mGluR7b and investigated their three-dimensional structure using homology-based molecular modeling. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Federal Government of Germany, the National Institutes of Health, and the Max Planck Society. Molecular Biology—Domains of mGluR C termini were PCR-amplified from rat brain cDNA and sub-cloned in the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pBTM116 or fused to the coding sequence of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pET41 (Novagen, Madison, WI). The complete coding regions of rat PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 were also generated by PCR, ligated in the yeast two-hybrid prey vector pVP16, or fused to the T7-epitope of pET21 (Novagen). Mutation and deletion constructs of mGluR C termini and PP1γ1/2 were generated by PCR cloning techniques. All constructs were sequenced to check for PCR errors. Binding Assays—For GST pull-down assays pET21 and pET41 constructs were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma-Aldrich). Fusion proteins were purified under native conditions, immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with the cytosolic fractions of E. coli expressing PP1γ1 as described (31.Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32.Croci C. Brandstätter J.H. Enz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 21: 6128-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). C-terminal domains of mGluR1a, -5a, and -5b were also synthesized in vitro using the T7 promoter of pET41 according to the RiboMAX RNA Production Kit and the Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). To obtain comparable conditions in competition experiments, E. coli protein extracts of similar protein concentrations, as measured at 280 nm, were used. For these samples the total volume was adjusted to 400 μl (defined as 100%) by adding protein extract of non-transformed E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) or detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-T7 antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise stated all reagents were purchased from Novagen. For binding assays with native proteins, rat brains were homogenized in 0.32 m Saccharose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing DNaseI and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min as described (32.Croci C. Brandstätter J.H. Enz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 21: 6128-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and 5 mg of the resulting supernatant were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, coated with GST or GST fusion proteins, for 5 h under slow agitation. Interaction partners were analyzed on Western blots using specific immunesera for PP1γ1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and PKC-ζ (1:10000; Sigma-Aldrich). For immunoprecipitation assays, rat brain microsomal membrane proteins (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibodies specific for mGluR1a (5 μg; Upstate Biotechnology), mGluR5a/b (6 μg; Upstate Biotechnology), PP1γ1 (15 μl; kindly provided by Paul Greengard, Rockefeller University, New York; see Ref. 33.da Cruz e Silva E.F. Fox C.A. Ouimet C.C. Gustafson E. Watson S.J. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or PKC-ζ (5 μl; Sigma-Aldrich). Then 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Agarose (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight as above. Precipitates were washed three times with 500 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerin, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics), and bound PP1γ1 was detected on Western blots using its specific immune serum (1:1000; see Ref. 33.da Cruz e Silva E.F. Fox C.A. Ouimet C.C. Gustafson E. Watson S.J. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA was extracted from adult rat tissues and reverse transcribed as described (32.Croci C. Brandstätter J.H. Enz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 21: 6128-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with 150 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA using specific primers for PP1γ1+2 (sense nt 677–698; antisense PP1γ1 nt 972–948; antisense PP1γ2 nt 1014–993), mGluR1a (sense nt 2521–2540; antisense nt 2796–2776), and mGluR5a/b (sense nt 2479–2498; antisense nt2753–2734) in a programmable thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the following parameters: 94 °C, 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C, 45 s; 62 °C, 60 s; 72 °C, 30 s; and a final incubation at 72 °C, 10 min. Oligonucleotides recognizing β-actin (sense nt 372–391; antisense nt 1065–1046) were used as controls, using 25 PCR cycles with the same parameters. Additional controls were performed without adding template and/or reverse transcriptase and showed no amplified DNA. Five μl of each PCR reaction were separated on 1% agarose gels and detected on Southern blots using digoxygenindidesoxy-UTP (DIG-ddUTP)-labeled oligonucleotides specific for PP1γ1/2 (nt 807–786), mGluR1a (nt 2758–2766), mGluR5a/b (nt 2626–2646), and β-actin (nt 732–750) following the protocol of the DIG-Oligonucleotide Tailing Kit and the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Immunocytochemistry—Adult mice were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Retinal cryostat sections with a thickness of 12 μm were prepared for immunocytochemical labeling by the indirect fluorescence method as described (14.Brandstätter J.H. Koulen P. Kuhn R. van der Putten H. Wässle H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4749-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The retinal sections were incubated with primary antibodies directed against PKC-α (1:100; Dunn Labortechnik, Asbach, Germany) and PP1γ1 (1:1000; kindly provided by Paul Greengard, Rockefeller University, New York; see Ref. 33.da Cruz e Silva E.F. Fox C.A. Ouimet C.C. Gustafson E. Watson S.J. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) overnight at room temperature. Binding of primary antibodies was detected by goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa™ 594 (red fluorescence) or Alexa™ 488 (green fluorescence) (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In control experiments, either the primary or secondary antibody was omitted, resulting in a complete loss of specific immunoreactivity. Sections were examined with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with argon and HeNe lasers (LSM5 Pascal; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast Two-hybrid Techniques—Protein interactions were tested in the yeast strain L40 (Invitrogen) as described (31.Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, yeast strains expressing bait constructs were transformed with prey constructs and vice versa, and protein interactions were monitored by the activation of His3 and LacZ reporter genes on selection plates. Binding affinities were calculated according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate. Comparative Modeling—The crystal structure of PP1γ1 in complex with a RRVSFA peptide (34.Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) was used as template to model PP1γ1 binding sequences (KSVSWS, KSVTWA, KSVTWY) identified in this study. Models were generated by substituting side chains of the RRVSFA ligand using the Sybyl 6.5 program package (Tripos, Inc.). Noncovalent interactions were improved by 200 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization using the Powell algorithm (35.Powell M.J.D. Mathemat. Progr. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry and nonbonded contacts were evaluated using the programs PROCHECK (36.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT_CHECK (37.Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Protein-ligand contacts were analyzed with LIGPLOT (38.Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4297) Google Scholar) using default settings. PP1γ1 Binds to mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b—Preliminary experiments of our laboratory indicated binding of PP1γ1 to mGluR5 in yeast cells. Therefore, interactions between PP1γ1 and the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b were now tested in GST pull-down assays using immobilized C-terminal domains of mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b C termini fused to GST. Loaded glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with E. coli protein extracts or soluble native proteins from rat brain, and bound PP1γ1 was identified by Western blots using specific antibodies. Both recombinant and native PP1γ1 interacted with mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b (Fig. 1A). The previously described interaction of PP1γ1 with mGluR7b, and absence of interaction with mGluR7a (31.Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), served as positive and negative controls, respectively. To ensure that GST fusion proteins did not unspecifically bind to proteins of the extracts, we analyzed their interaction with the ζ-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC-ζ). This enzyme was present in the soluble protein fraction of rat brain (32.Croci C. Brandstätter J.H. Enz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 21: 6128-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a specific immune serum was available in the laboratory. Interaction between PKC-ζ and metabotropic glutamate receptors has not been reported, and consistently we did not detect its binding to mGluR C termini (Fig. 1A). Next, we tested whether the observed interactions between PP1γ1 and mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b C-terminal domains also occurred with the native forms of the metabotropic glutamate receptors. As a source for mGluR1a and the two mGluR5 isoforms we used microsomal membrane proteins purified from rat brain that also contained high concentrations of PP1γ1 (Fig. 1B, left panel). Immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies for mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b demonstrated binding of PP1γ1 to both receptor types (Fig. 1B, right panel). Antibodies against PP1γ1 and PKC-ζ were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Tissue Distribution of mGluR1a, mGluR5a/b, and PP1γ1/2— Next, we compared the expression profiles of PP1γ1, its isoform PP1γ2, and of mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b performing semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. To reduce variability between samples, the same primer pair was used to amplify both splice variants of mGluR5. Furthermore, DNA products representing mGluR5a and mGluR5b, as well as PP1γ1 and PP1γ2, were visualized using an oligonucleotide hybridizing to both isoforms. mGluR1a and mGluR5 isoforms were present in all regions of the central nervous system (CNS) examined, although in different amounts (Fig. 2). The isoform distribution between mGluR5a and mGluR5b varied between CNS regions. mGluR5a was predominantly expressed in olfactory bulb and cerebellum, whereas mGluR5b was higher concentrated in cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. PP1γ1 was present in all CNS regions examined, whereas transcripts for PP1γ2 were more diversely expressed, being most abundant in cerebellum (Fig. 2). Outside the CNS, PP1γ1, and PP1γ2 seemed to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas only mGluR1a was detected in lung. PP1γ1 Is Present at Retinal Synapses Expressing mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b—Co-expression of binding partners represents a pre-requisite for protein interactions. In the retina, the localization of mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b was analyzed in detail (39.Koulen P. Kuhn R. Wässle H. Brandstätter J.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2200-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether PP1γ1 is present in the same sub-cellular compartments as described for mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b. Staining of vertical sections of adult mouse retinae with an antiserum against PP1γ1 showed expression of PP1γ1 in the two synaptic layers of the retina, the outer (OPL) and inner (IPL) plexiform layer (Fig. 3A). No staining for PP1γ1 was found on somata of interneurons in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and of ganglion cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). In the IPL, PP1γ1 immunoreactivity was homogeneously distributed in small immunofluorescent puncta, suggestive of a synaptic localization of the enzyme. In the OPL, small immunofluorescent puncta (arrows in Fig. 3A) were visible above larger aggregates of PP1γ1 staining (arrowheads). In this layer, the small synaptic terminals of rod photoreceptors are located above the large cone photoreceptor synaptic terminals. Thus, the small puncta indicated PP1γ1 expression at rod synapses, whereas the larger immunoreactive aggregates suggested expression of PP1γ1 in neurons postsynaptic to cone photoreceptors. Group I mGluRs are expressed by the postsynaptic neurons of photoreceptors, especially in the dendrites of rod bipolar cells postsynaptic to the rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals (39.Koulen P. Kuhn R. Wässle H. Brandstätter J.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2200-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, sections were double-labeled with antibodies against PP1γ1 (green) and against PKC-α (red), a marker for rod bipolar cells (Fig. 3B). The rod bipolar cell somata are located in the INL, their dendrites extend into the OPL toward the synaptic terminals of the rod photoreceptors, and their axons terminate in the innermost part of the IPL close to the GCL. Comparison of the staining for PP1γ1 in the OPL with the dendritic structures of the labeled rod bipolar cells by confocal laser-scanning microscopy unambiguously demonstrated that PP1γ1 was expressed in the dendrites of rod bipolar cells (Fig. 3, C and D). This is best seen in Fig. 3E, showing higher power views of the merge of the two stainings for selected areas (boxes) in the OPL. Mapping of Interacting Domains within mGluR C Termini and PP1γ1/2—Based on our findings, we proposed the existence of PP1γ1/2 binding motifs located in the C-terminal domains of mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b. To map interacting domains within the binding partners, we analyzed the interaction between PP1γ1 and mGluR C termini in yeast cells by the ability of transformants to grow on selective media upon activation of His3 and LacZ reporter genes. The complete C termini of mGluR1a, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b showed transactivation of the reporter genes, which had been also noticed by other groups (21.Ishikawa K. Nash S.R. Nishimune A. Neki A.

Therefore, we used C-terminally truncated constructs for our studies (see stars in Fig. 4A) that were able to bind recombinant and native PP1γ1 in GST pull-down assays (data not shown). In yeast cells PP1γ1 interacted with mGluR1a*, mGluR5a*, and mGluR5b*, whereas no binding was observed for mGluR1b and mGluR1c (Fig. 4A). The PP1γ1 binding characteristics of mGluR7a and mGluR7b have been reported before (31.Enz R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and were used as controls for the assay. The relative intensities of the interactions were estimated using a quantitative β-galactosidase assay and are presented as arbitrary β-galactosidase units (horizontal columns in Fig. 4A). To identify PP1γ1 binding regions within interacting mGluR C termini, their identical and splice-specific domains were tested individually. The proximal region of the mGluR1a C terminus, identical to the corresponding regions in mGluR1b and mGluR1c, showed no interaction with PP1γ1, whereas the distal, isoform-specific sequence of mGluR1a* (mGluR1a*sp) was sufficient for the binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the isoform-specific cassette inserted into the C terminus of mGluR5b did not interact with PP1γ1, whereas a region identical between mGluR5a and mGluR5b (mGluR5*sp) contained enough information for the binding. Again, reported interactions of mGluR7a and mGluR7b C-terminal domains were used as positive and negative controls. From these results we concluded that the PP1γ1 binding motif is located in the splice-specific distal region of mGluR1a and mGluR7b, whereas the isoform-specific sequence of mGluR5b does not seem to be involved in the binding. We also mapped domains in PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 mediating the binding to mGluR1a and mGluR5a/b C termini, following a classification of functional domains described for PP1α (40.Connor J.H. Kleeman T.

https://openalex.org/W2093351401,"We recently showed that normal fibroblasts mediate capillary-like differentiation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) in a 3-D angiogenesis model. Here, we show that a collaborative effect of VEGF-A and alphaVbeta3 integrin is critical in fibroblast-mediated angiogenesis because enhancement of both VEGF production by fibroblasts and beta3 integrin expression in HMVEC can rescue capillary-like endothelial differentiation under reduced serum conditions. To investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms, we compared N-Ras and Rho/Rac/Cdc42, as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and Akt, for their involvement in the capillary-like network formation. The dominant-negative mutant of N-Ras (N-RasN17), but not the mutants of Rho/Rac/Cdc42, suppressed network formation. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of PI3-K rescued the network formation, which was inhibited by a dominant-negative >beta3 integrin; however, an active form of Akt failed to rescue the inhibition but induced a phenotypic change in HMVEC. Moreover, PI3-K is a downstream target of N-Ras because it could be co-immunoprecipitated with N-Ras, and its active form could rescue the inhibitory effect of N-Ras N17. Thus, our data indicate the existence of N-Ras- and PI3-K-dependent but Rho/Rac/Cdc42- and Akt-independent signaling mechanisms for the synergistic effect of VEGF-A and alphaVbeta3 on fibroblast-mediated microvascular network formation."
https://openalex.org/W2061948197,"Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy is a plastic process during which the mechanisms that coordinate liver mass restoration compensate one another through a complex regulatory network of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Vasopressin, an agonist that triggers highly organized Ca2+ signals in the liver, may be one of these factors, although little in vivo evidence is available in support of this hypothesis. We provide evidence that hypothalamic vasopressin secretion is stimulated early after partial hepatectomy. Although hepatocytes were fully responsive to vasopressin during the first hours of regeneration, they became desensitized and exhibited slow oscillating Ca2+ responses to vasopressin on the following days. On the first day, hepatocyte V1a receptor density decreased and its lobular gradient increased in hepatectomized rats. By antagonizing the V1a receptor in vivo, we demonstrated that vasopressin contributes to NF-kappaB and cyclin (D1 and A) activation, to hepatocyte progression in the cell cycle, and to liver mass restoration. Finally, vasopressin exerted a choleretic effect shortly after hepatectomy, both in the isolated perfused liver and in the intact rat. In conclusion, we provide compelling in vivo evidence that vasopressin contributes significantly to growth initiation and bile flow stimulation in the early stages of liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2089122893,"Various cardiorespiratory diseases (e.g. congestive heart failure, emphysema) result in systemic hypoxia and patients consequently demonstrate adaptive cellular responses which predispose them to conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and stroke. Central to many affected excitable tissues is activity of large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ (maxiK) channels. We have studied maxiK channel activity in HEK293 cells stably co-expressing the most widely distributed of the human α- and β-subunits that constitute these channel following maneuvers which mimic severe hypoxia. At all [Ca2+]i, chronic hypoxia (∼18 mm Hg, 72 h) increased K+ current density, most markedly at physiological [Ca2+]i K+ currents in cells cultured in normoxia showed a [Ca2+]i-dependent sensitivity to acute hypoxic inhibition (∼25 mm Hg, 3 min). However, chronic hypoxia dramatically changed the Ca2+ sensitivity of this acute hypoxic inhibitory profile such that low [Ca2+]i could sustain an acute hypoxic inhibitory response. Chronic hypoxia caused no change in α-subunit immunoreactivity with Western blotting but evoked a 3-fold increase in β-subunit expression. These observations were fully supported by immunocytochemistry, which also suggested that chronic hypoxia augmented α/β-subunit co-localization at the plasma membrane. Using a novel nuclear run-on assay and RNase protection we found that chronic hypoxia did not alter mRNA production rates or steady-state levels, which suggests that this important environmental cue modulates maxiK channel function via post-transcriptional mechanisms.

Crucial to the cellular and physiological response to acute perturbation of systemic and/or pulmonary O2 levels is the rapid inhibition of K+ channels by hypoxia (see Ref. 1Lopez-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Saenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar for recent review). Thus, acute modulation of ion channel activity is central to the homeostatic mechanisms that underlie chemosensing in carotid body (2Lopez-Barneo J. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Urena J. Gonzalez C.

Although somewhat controversial, ion channel inhibition has also been implicated in hypoxic vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (13Ward J.P. Aaronson P.I. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, such O2 sensitivity is believed to play a significant role in modulation of excitability in several cellular components of the mammalian nervous system (14Vergara C. Latorre R.

Although O2-sensitive tissues express a wide variety of channel types, central to the cellular mechanism of acute O2 sensing in several is hypoxic suppression of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (maxiK) channels. Indeed, hypoxic inhibition of native maxiK channel activity has been demonstrated in carotid body (4Peers C. Neurosci.

Although their contribution to carotid body, chromaffin cell, and central neuronal function is well supported, some controversy still surrounds their involvement in pulmonary vasoconstriction (15Coppock E.A. Martens J.R. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L1-L8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and there is good evidence for both delayed rectifier (23Tristani-Firouzi M. Reeve H.L. Tolarova S. Weir E.K. Archer S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and tandem P domain K+ channels in the response (24Gurney A.M. Osipenko O.N. MacMillan D. Kempsill F.E. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); the latter observation is fully supported by our recent reports of O2 sensitivity of the recombinant human tandem P domain channels, hTASK1 (25Lewis A. Hartness M.E. Chapman C.G. Fearon I.M. Meadows H.J. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 1290-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and hTASK3 (26Kemp P.J. Lewis A. Miller P. Chapman C.G. Meadows H. Peers C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A61Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Tissue specificity notwithstanding, we have recently demonstrated at the single channel level that a recombinant human maxiK channel can be rapidly and reversibly inhibited by acute hypoxia; this inhibition is underlain by hypoxia-evoked depression in unitary conductance, slowed channel activation kinetics (without an effect on channel deactivation kinetics), reduced open-state probability, and altered channel sensitivity to intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (27Lewis A. Peers C. Ashford M.L.J. Kemp P.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of K+ channels in general, and maxiK channels in particular, may involve O2-dependent modulation of cellular redox potential, the nature of the sensor is still unclear and the mechanism whereby decreased pO2 evokes inhibition of this channel type in different tissues remains controversial. Indeed, there are reports that have suggested involvement of either cytosolic factors (e.g. Refs. 18Wyatt C.N. Peers C. J. Physiol. 1995; 483: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 20Liu H. Moczydlowski E. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or more direct channel modulation (e.g. Refs. 17Jiang C. Haddad G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 19Perez-Garcia M.T. Lopez-Lppez J.R. Riesco A.M. Hoppe U.C. Marban E. Gonzalez C. Johns D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5689-5695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In favor of potential regulation by cellular redox state are recent data demonstrating activation of these channels by oxidizing agents in a recombinant cellular system (28Tang X.D. Daggett H. Hanner M. Garcia M.L. McManus O.B. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and inhibition by reduced glutathione in rat hippocampal neurons (29Soh H. Jung W. Uhm D.Y. Chung S. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 298: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that channel inhibition by hypoxia is maintained in excised inside patches from HEK293 1The abbreviations used are: HEK293human embryonic kidney 293 cellsPBSphosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: HEK293human embryonic kidney 293 cellsPBSphosphate-buffered saline. cells stably expressing the human α/β-maxiK channel (27Lewis A. Peers C. Ashford M.L.J. Kemp P.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consequently, the likelihood of an interaction of soluble cytosolic components with this particular channel accounting for hypoxic inhibition seems remote. human embryonic kidney 293 cells phosphate-buffered saline. human embryonic kidney 293 cells phosphate-buffered saline. Individuals suffering from a variety of cardiorespiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea of sleep, emphysema, congestive heart failure, and stroke) undergo adaptive responses. Given the central importance of K+ channels to cellular function, it seems likely that remodeling of channel functional activity by sustained or intermittent episodes of hypoxia may contribute to certain pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension (see Refs. 30Prabhakar N.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1986-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Prabhakar N.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 859-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Lanfranchi P. Somers V.K. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar for recent reviews) in addition to the well documented adaptation to high altitude (33Monge C. Leon-Velarde F. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1135-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Such a notion is supported by observations in exemplar chemosensing tissues such as the pulmonary vasculature (where voltage-gated K+ channel expression is selectively suppressed in chronic hypoxia, Ref. 34Smirnov S.V. Robertson T.P. Ward J.P.T. Aarsonson P.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H365-H370PubMed Google Scholar) and the carotid body (where chronic hypoxia both in vivo, Refs. 35Stea A. Jackson A. Nurse C.A. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9469-9473Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 36Stea A. Jackson A. Macintyre L. Nurse C.A. J.

Physiol. 1987; 392: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar has been shown to blunt the acute cellular and whole body hypoxic responses). Thus, chronic hypoxia appears to be a central theme in adaptative responses during both physiological and pathological processes. Since maxiK activity is expressed in many O2-sensing tissues and maxiK activity is acutely regulated by hypoxia, we proposed that one method of long term modulation by chronic hypoxia might involve functional remodeling of the maxiK channel complex itself. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the effect of long term, severe hypoxia (pO2 ∼18 mm Hg for 3 days) on channel expression and function, employing HEK293 cells stably co-expressing human α/β-maxiK subunits. The notion that chronic hypoxia exerts a dramatic influence on maxiK function is demonstrated by electrophysiological and biochemical techniques which show increased current density, altered Ca2+ sensitivity of acute O2 regulation, dynamic and differential up-regulation of the β-subunit protein, and augmented co-localization of the α- and β-subunits in the plasma membrane. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells, which express human brain αβ-maxiK channels (40Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Christophersen P. Olesen S.P. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), were maintained in Earle's minimal essential medium (containing l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotic antimycotic, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 0.2% gentamycin (all purchased from Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were passaged every 7 days in a ratio of 1:25 using Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen). The co-expressed α- and β-subunits were KCNMA1 (GenBank™ accession no. NM_002247) and KCNMB1 (GenBank™ accession no. U61536), respectively. HEK293 cells expressing the same α-subunit but in the absence of the β-subunit were also used for one set of experiments. For the experiments described herein, cells were cultured for up to 3 days at 37 °C in water-saturated environments of either 2.5% O2, 5% CO2, 92.5% N2 (pO2 ∼18 mm Hg, chronic hypoxia) or 21% O2, 5% CO2, 74% N2 (pO2 ∼143 mm Hg, normoxia). Electrophysiology—Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals for whole cell patch-clamp recordings were of the highest grade available and were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. Pipette solution was K+-rich and contained (in mm): 10 NaCl, 117 KCl, 2 MgSO4, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH), 2 Na2ATP with Ca2+ buffered to 4 nm, 27 nm, 300 nm, and 3 μm using EGTA and CaCl2 in appropriate ratios. Bath solution was Na+-rich and contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). All tubing was gas-impermeant (Tygon tubing, BDH). For the experiments in which pO2 was changed acutely, normoxic solutions were bubbled with medical air while solutions were made hypoxic by bubbling with N2(g) for at least 20 min. prior to perfusion of cells. This procedure produced no shift in bath pH or temperature. Solution flow rate was ∼5-7 ml·min-1. pO2 was measured close to the cell using a polarized (-800 mV), calibrated carbon fiber electrode (41Mojet M.H. Mills E. Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); for the experiments reported herein, the pO2 values were 150 mm Hg (normoxia) and 15-25 mm Hg (acute hypoxia). Cells were cultured for up to 72 h in either normoxic or chronic hypoxic conditions before being allowed to adhere at 37 °C for at least 1 h to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips before being placed in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of either a Nikon TMS or an Olympus CK40 inverted microscope. All experiments were carried out at 22 ± 1 °C. Patch pipettes were manufactured from standard-walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing (Clarke Electromedical Instruments, Reading, Berks., UK) on a two-stage Narishige PP-830 pipette puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratory, Kasuya, Tokyo, Japan), were heat-polished on a Narishige microforge and had measured tip resistances of 5-8 MΩ when filled with pipette solution. Resistive feedback voltage-clamp was achieved using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA). Voltage protocols were generated and currents recorded using pClamp 8 software employing a Digidata 1310 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered (4-pole Bessel) at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Following successful transition to the whole cell recording mode (42Hamill O.P. Marty A. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers. Archiv. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar) capacitance transients were compensated and measured. To evoke ionic currents in HEK293 cells, three voltage protocols (Vh = -70 mV, 0.1 Hz) were used: 1) a voltage ramp protocol, -100 mV to +60 mV, ramp duration = 1 s 2) a time series, single increment to +60 mV, step duration = 50 ms; 3) single inactivating step protocol to +100 mV for 200 ms. The magnitudes of the steady-state outward currents were measured from the final 5 ms of the +60 mV step and current density-voltage relationships were constructed from the voltage ramp data. Inactivation data were taken from the 200-ms step; peak current was the maximum achieved during first 20 ms, and final current was measured during the final 5 ms of the step. Inactivation was expressed as proportion of current still available at end of long step as proportion of the maximum measured during the first 20 ms (Iend/Imax). Statistical comparisons were made using paired or unpaired Student's t tests, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 being considered significant. Immunoblotting—The expression of maxiK α- and β-subunits was measured by immunoblotting of crude cell extracts taken from confluent cell layers as follows. The confluent cell layer was rinsed twice with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and removed by scraping in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue (1 ml per 75 cm2 flask). The cell lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min. A sample (100 μl) was taken for protein assay and replaced with 100 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and 10 μl of a saturated solution of bromphenol blue. The cell extract was boiled for a further 10 min and equal protein amounts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to allow direct comparison between samples. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at a constant voltage of 30 V overnight and immunoblotted with either a maxiK channel α-subunit antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:250 or crude antisera raised against residues 58-75 of rat BK β1-subunit (Biochem Pharm, Innsbruck, Austria) at a dilution of 1:6000. In some experiments the antibody was pre-adsorbed with this sequence (which has only one residue mismatch with the corresponding sequence in human β1-subunit) using 2 μg of peptide per 1 μl of undiluted antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After thorough washing of membranes, immunolabeled proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The level of maxiK subunit expression in the chronic hypoxic cells was expressed as a percentage of that found in the normoxic cells by densitometric analysis using the Quantity One densitometry package (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfs., UK). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 72 h under normoxic or chronic hypoxic conditions. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and then fixed for 5 min with 10% formalin at 37 °C. The remaining procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then incubated in PBS containing 1 mm sodium azide and 5% normal goat serum (blocking solution) for 3 h to block nonspecific binding. Cells were then incubated overnight in 1:160 dilution of crude rabbit antisera to residues 58-75 of the rat maxiK β1 subunit in blocking solution. After thorough washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with blocking solution for a further 3 h. Cells were then incubated overnight in 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-maxiK+ channel α antibody in blocking solution. Following the antibody incubation, cells were washed eight times in PBS and incubated in Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antiserum and FITC-labeled anti-mouse antiserum for 3 h. Finally, cells were washed a further eight times in PBS prior to mounting and viewing with a laser confocal microscope. For controls, cells were processed in the same way, except that the primary antibodies were omitted from the initial incubations. This resulted in a lack of specific fluorescent staining in all cases (not shown). Nuclear Run-on Transcription Assay—Isolation of Nuclei: HEK293 cells expressing human αβ-maxiK channels were cultured in 150-cm3 flasks for 3 days in either normoxic or chronic hypoxic conditions, as before. Cells were detached from each flask with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS and harvested at 400 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4.5 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer I (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgAc2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA containing 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100) and Dounce homogenized (20 strokes). An equivalent volume of sucrose buffer II was added to the nuclei preparation (2.1 m sucrose, 5 mm MgAc2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EGTA containing 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by gentle vortexing. This mixture was layered on top of a 4 ml sucrose cushion (sucrose buffer II) and nuclei were purified by centrifugation for 50 min at 16 000 × g at 4 °C. Purified nuclei were re-suspended in 200 μl of storage buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm spermidine) and frozen at -80 °C until required. Nuclei concentration was determined by counting the number of viable nuclei present in a 1:100 dilution of each sample using a hemacytometer. PCR-based Nuclear Run-on Assay—Rolfe and co-workers (43Rolfe F.G. Sewell W.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 44Rolfe F.G. Valentine J.E. Sewell W.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have developed a novel nuclear run-on method based on the polymerase chain reaction. Here we describe an evolution of this method employing LightCycler real-time PCR. Fresh or thawed nuclei (200 μl) were split into two aliquots and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20% glycerol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Southampton, Hants., UK). 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP were added to one aliquot (+NTPs); no NTPs were added to the second aliquot (-NTPs). Following the 30-min incubation period, RNA was isolated from the nuclei using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, Strathclyde, UK). cDNA was synthesized using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system purchased from Invitrogen. In brief, RNA was heated at 65 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 10 μl with 50 pmol of oligo(dT)20, placed on ice and made up to 20 μl with the addition of a reverse transcription master mix (final concentration; 1× cDNA synthesis buffer, 1 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNaseOUT, and 15 units of Thermoscript RT). Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler for 60 min at 50 °C and the reverse transcription reactions terminated by heating at 85 °C for 5 min. Finally, template RNA was digested with RNase H (2 units) at 37 °C for 20 min. cDNA samples were cleaned using QIAquick PCR purification columns following the manufacturers protocol (Qiagen, Crawley, Sussex, UK). Primers for real time quantitative PCR were designed for the maxiK α (accession NM_002247) and β-subunits (accession no. U61536) using Primer3 software (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www_slow.cgi) and specificity was confirmed by BLAST data base analysis. The forward and reverse primers used for the α-subunit were 5′-CGGTTAGTGGAAGAAAGCACA-3′ (nt, 1385-1405) and 5′-GAGGACGGAACCCTGATAAAA-3′ (nt, 1570-1590), respectively. The forward and reverse primers used for the β-subunit were 5′-CTGTACCACACGGAGGACACT-3′ (nt, 668-688) and 5′-GTAGAGGCGCTGGAATAGGAC-3′ (nt, 836-856). All oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma-Genosys (Pampisford, Cambridge, UK). PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 5 μl using LightCycler FastStart DNA master SYBR green I (Roche Applied Science GmBH). Forward and reverse primers were used at 0.5 μm, sybrmix was used at a 1× concentration and the MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to 5 mm. A master mix giving the above final concentration was prepared of which 4.5 μl was transferred to glass capillaries together with 0.5 μl of relevant sample cDNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s, 55 °C 6 s, and 72 °C 15 with a transition rate of 20 °C·s-1 and a single melt cycle of 95 °C for 0 s, 65 °C 15 s, 95 °C 0 s with transition rates of 20, 20, and 0.1 °C·s-1, respectively. Relative Quantification of α- and β-Subunit Transcription Rates—Quantitation of the relative differences between normoxic and chronic hypoxic conditions was elucidated using equations adapted from a mathematical model developed by Pfaffl (45Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25131) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR efficiencies were determined for each subunit primer pair from standard curves generated from LightCycler experiments performed on serial dilutions of cDNA transcribed from RNA isolated from HEK293 cells expressing αβ-maxiK. PCR efficiency (E) was calculated according to the equation: E = [10(-1/S)], where S is the slope of the crossing point number at 0.1 fluorescence versus log10 concentration of template cDNA curve (see Fig. 4, A and B). Specificity of RT-PCR products was documented by sequencing and agarose gel electrophoresis and resulted in single products of the appropriate length for both α- and β-subunits (Fig. 4A, inset). The relative differences between transcription rates in normoxia and chronic hypoxia for each subunit was determined using Equation 1,Ratio=(E)ΔCPhypoxia(norNTPs-rNTPs)(E)ΔCPnormoxia(norNTPs-rNTPs)(Eq. 1) where, ΔCP is the difference in the crossing cycle point numbers between real-time PCR results obtained from cDNA derived from the run-on experiments in the presence or absence of NTPs (Fig. 4, C and D). Nuclease Protection Assay (NPA)—Probe generation: DNA corresponding to human maxiK α-subunit, maxiK β-subunit, and human β-actin genes was amplified using RT-PCR. The specific primers used were as follows: α-subunit forward, 5′-GTGGGCTCTATTGAGTACC-3′(nt, 2641-2659), α-subunit reverse 5′-TCGGTTTGCTGTGGATGG-3′ (nt, 3621-3648); β-subunit forward 5′-CCACAGGACGCCGGGAAGACTAA-3′ (nt, 356-378), β-subunit reverse 5′-GAGGGCAGGTGGAGAAGGCATTG-3′ (nt, 1054-1076); β-actin (accession no. NM_001101) forward 5′-CAACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAAATC-3′ (nt, 304-328), β-actin reverse 5′-AGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC-3′(nt, 851-873). PCR products were cleaned using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen), and ligated into pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega). Constructs were sequenced (Lark Technologies Inc, Saffron Walden, Essex, UK) to determine orientation and correct sequence of inserts. Specific primers for the T7 or SP6 promoter sequences were used in conjunction with internal primers specific for either α-subunit, β-subunit, or β-actin, to generate PCR products from the pGEM-T Easy which would act as templates for antisense RNA probe production. Primer pairs used were as follows: SP6pGEM 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA-3′ and BKαNPA 5′-ACCCGCCCTATGAGTTTG 3′-for maxiK α probe template; SP6pGEM and BKβNPA 5′-GGCCCTCCTCTTCTCCCTCTT-3′ for maxiK β probe template; T7pGEM 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and ActNPA 5′-CAACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAGAT-3′ for β-actin probe. Probe template DNA was purified on QIAquick PCR purification columns. Radiolabeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Huntington, Cambs., UK). In brief, 0.2 μg of template DNA was added to a reaction mixture containing 1× transcription buffer, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 3.125 μm [32P]UTP (800 Ci·mmol-1) and either 40 units of SP6 or 30 units of T7 enzyme mix in a final volume of 20 μl. In addition to the above components, 0.5 mm of unlabeled UTP was added to the β-actin probe template to reduce the specific activity of this RNA probe. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and template DNA was removed by the addition of 2 units of DNase I"
https://openalex.org/W2075275458,"The cellular mechanisms that modulate interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling are not defined. In fibroblasts, IL-1 signaling is affected by the nature of cell-matrix adhesions including focal adhesions, adhesive domains that sequester IL-1 receptors. We conducted studies to elucidate which steps of cellular Ca2+ handling are affected by focal adhesions and by which mechanisms focal adhesions modulate IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals and ERK activation in human gingival fibroblasts. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine or fibronectin and treated with tenascin, Hep-I, or SPARC peptides to inhibit focal adhesion formation. These treatments blocked IL-1 and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that the ER-release pathway is focal adhesion dependent. Focal adhesions were also required for Ca2+ entry through store-operated channels and for IL-1-induced ERK activation. Thus interactions with the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion formation regulate IL-1-induced generation of intracellular Ca2+ signals that in turn are required for ERK activation."

To understand how human cells process DNA loop structures, a set of circular heteroduplexes containing a 30-nucleotide loop were constructed and tested for repair in vitro by human cell nuclear extracts. We demonstrate here that, in addition to the previously identified 5′ nick-directed loop repair pathway (Littman, S. J., Fang, W. H., and Modrich, P. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7474–7481), human cells can process large DNA loop heterologies in a loop-directed manner. The loop-directed repair specifically removes the loop structure and occurs only in the looped strand, and appears to require limited DNA synthesis. Like the nick-directed loop repair, the loop-directed repair is independent of many known DNA repair pathways, including DNA mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair. In addition, our data also suggest that an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase is involved in the excision step of the nick-directed loop repair pathway.

DNA loop heterologies are unpaired, single-stranded DNA structures that can be generated during DNA metabolism. These structures reflect a form of genetic instability and are considered as an early phenotype in carcinogenesis (1.Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3230-3239PubMed Google Scholar).

There is accumulating evidence, however, suggesting that eukaryotic cells possess multiple pathways to process these loops, including both the mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent and -independent pathways (6.Bishop D.K.

This redundancy of pathways for loop processing has been recently shown to apply to DNA loops less than 16 nt, but not to those larger than 16 nt. The former can be repaired by both the MMR-dependent and -independent pathway, and the latter can only be processed by the MMR-independent pathway(s) (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The limit of MMR-dependent loop repair at 16 nt in length serves as a criterion to classify DNA loop heterologies into small loops (≤16 nt) and large loops (≥17 nt) (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For small loops, the MMR-dependent pathway appears to utilize the same general mechanism to process these heterologies, i.e. excision is conducted by exonucleases from the pre-existing strand break to the heterology no matter whether the strand break is located 5′ or 3′ to the loop. However, small DNA loops are repaired differently by the MMR-independent pathway(s) (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the processing of small DNA loops with a strand break 5′ to the heterology occurs by a manner similar to that seen for MMR-dependent processing (i.e. involving exonucleases), the processing of looped heteroduplexes containing a3′ strand break seems to involve endonuclease(s) that remove the loop directly, without excision occurring from the nick (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the requirements and mechanism of large loop (>17 nt) processing by the MMR-independent pathway in eukaryotes. Previous studies have indicated that the human MMR-independent pathway(s) can process large loops containing a strand break 5′, but not 3′ to the heterology (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a very weak 3′-directed large loop repair activity has been identified in yeast (16.Corrette-Bennett S.E. Mohlman N.L. Rosado Z. Miret J.J. Hess P.M. Parker B.O. Lahue R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these large loop repair pathways operate are largely unknown. To understand large DNA loop repair in human cells, we tested the repair of a series of DNA loop heteroduplexes containing a 30-nt loop and a strand break either 5′ or 3′ to the heterology by human nuclear extracts. We demonstrate that there are at least two pathways for large loop repair in human cells, one of which has been previously demonstrated (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this work, we identify a human large loop repair activity that specifically removes the loop in a manner independent of a nick, which we designate as the loop-directed pathway. The loop-directed pathway is independent of several major DNA repair pathways, including MMR, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and the Werner syndrome protein WRN. We also show that the two large loop repair pathways have different underlying mechanisms. Cell Culture and Nuclear Extract Preparation—HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine. HCT15, NALM6, and GM02345 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 and HEC-1A cells were grown in McCoys 5A with 10% fetal bovine serum. WS780 (obtained from Isabel Mellon, University of Kentucky) and AG08802 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1× essential amino acids, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 1× vitamins (Invitrogen). GM02345 and AG08802 were purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories. Monolayer cultures (HCT116, HCT15, HEC-1A, and AG08802) were harvested from 20 to 30 roller bottles and suspension cells (HeLa, NALM6, GM02345) were harvested from 6-liter cultures in spinner flasks. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (21.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 22.Parsons R.

Heteroduplex Substrate DNA Construction—Bacterial phage f1MR0 was created by digestion of phage f1MR1 (23.Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) double stranded DNA with XbaI and NheI, gel purification of the large fragment (6,423 bp), and ligation of the compatible ends. The resulting molecule contains a 30-bp deletion relative to phage f1MR24 DNA (22.Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Modrich P. Cell. 1993; 75: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The sequence of f1MR0 was verified by DNA sequencing. Creation of heteroduplex substrates was performed as previously described (21.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23.Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, double stranded DNA from one phage (e.g. f1MR0) was linearized by Sau96I, and annealed with single stranded DNA from another phage (e.g. f1MR24). The resulting 5′ nicked (in the complementary strand) heteroduplex was purified as described (23.Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a looped substrate with a 3′ nick, its corresponding 5′-nicked substrate was incubated with DNA ligase in the presence of ethidium bromide to form a supercoiled covalently closed circular (ccc) substrate. The later product was then incubated with glycoprotein II protein, an endonuclease that specifically nicks the viral strand at the site of the phage replication origin (24.Meyer T.F. Geider K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12642-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to yield a nick 3′ to the loop (see Fig. 1). The nomenclature of substrates follows the format: (nick position) - (loop size)(loop strand). For example, 5′-30V describes a substrate with a 5′ nick and 30-nt loop in the viral (V) strand (see Fig. 1). 5′ nicks are located 115 bp away from the loop site on the complementary (C) strand. 3′ nicks are located 175 bp away from the loop site on the V strand. Loop Repair Assays—Unless mentioned otherwise, large loop repair was assayed by Southern blot analysis as described (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng (24 fmol) of DNA substrate was incubated with 75 μg of nuclear extracts in 15-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 110 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm glutathione, and 0.1 mm each of the four dNTPs. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by protease K digestion (30 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and was then digested with SspI and BanII. The resulting products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea, 19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, 1× Tris-borate buffer), followed by electrotransferring to nylon membrane at 4 °C. Membranes were sequentially probed with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide 20-mer V5216–5235 (5′-ATTGTTCTGGATATTACCAG-3′) and a 32P-end-labeled 25-mer C5235–5259 (5′-GAAGAACTCAAACTATCGGCCTTGC-3′) to visualize the repair in the C and V strands, respectively. Probe V5216–5235 hybridizes to the C strand, whereas probe C5235–5259 hybridizes to the V strand. Autoradiographs were scanned by Kodak Image 2.0.2 software and band intensities were measured. Nonspecific probe binding was corrected for by subtracting “repair” values observed in substrate only or heat-inactivated extract controls. Variation between experiments was generally less than 10%. Where indicated, aphidicolin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and each of the four dideoxynucleotriphosphates (ddNTPs) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm each (equimolar with dNTPs in the reaction buffer). Reaction Intermediate Analysis—Reaction intermediates were trapped during in vitro repair assays by the omission of exogenous dNTPs, the addition of aphidicolin, or the addition of ddNTPs. Purified reaction products were digested with SspI, separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred onto a nylon membrane as described (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol.

The C strand was probed on the 3′ end of the SspI fragment (see Fig. 1) using oligonucleotide V5216–5235 (containing a V strand sequence, but hybridizing to the C strand), and the V strand was probed on the 5′ end of the fragment using oligonucleotide C5235–5259 (containing a C strand sequence, but hybridizing to the V strand). Size standards were created by digestion of f1MR24 double stranded DNA with SspI (754 bases), SspI and BanII (473 bases), SspI and XcmI (420 bases), or SspI and NheI (408 bases). To probe for single stranded DNA regions between the nick and the loop, repair intermediates trapped by limited DNA synthesis were alternately digested with 2 units each of BseRI and BanII (scoring enzyme). Resulting products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Band intensities were analyzed by digital photography using Kodak Image 2.0.2 software. Human Cells Possess Both Nick-dependent and -independent Large Loop Repair Pathways—To study the repair of large DNA loops in human cells, we constructed a set of DNA substrates containing a 30-nt loop and a strand break, where the loop was placed either on the nicked strand or on the continuous strand and the nick was either 5′ or 3′ to the heterology (Fig. 1). These substrates were tested for repair by nuclear extracts derived from several human cell lines. The repair was scored using Southern blot analysis by taking advantage of the 30-nt difference in size between looped and non-looped strands. In this assay, a DNA fragment encompassing the loop region was separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and sequentially probed for either the complementary strand or viral strand. A conversion of the strand size from a shorter strand to a longer strand or vice versa reflects the repair of the loop by using looped (30 nt longer) or non-looped (30 nt shorter) strands as the template for synthesis during the repair. First, we determined the extent of repair to each strand for all four nicked substrates using HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 2). As expected, significant repair of the nicked strand was observed for substrates containing a nick (in the C strand) 5′ to the loop. For the substrate 5′-30C, a new species with a size of 443-nt in length was detected in reactions containing active HeLa extract (Fig. 2A, i, HL) that was not seen for a reaction containing heat-inactivated extract (Fig. 2A, i, HI). In the case of the substrate 5′-30V, a new species 473 nt in size was observed after exposing to an active HeLa extract (Fig. 2A, ii, HL). These conversions indicate that repair excision occurred in the nicked strand, followed by repair resynthesis using the continuous strand (the V strand) as a template. These observations, which are consistent with a previous study (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and additional studies that we conducted (described below) suggest that this repair is largely nick-directed (i.e. excision occurs from the nick to the loop via an exonuclease). In contrast to the 5′ substrates, our results show that only certain looped substrates with a 3′-nick can undergo HeLa extract-catalyzed repair. A significant level of repair was detected in the nicked strand of the 3′-30V substrate as indicated by the fact that there was a conversion of the original longer fragment (473-nt) to a new but shorter fragment (443 nt) in the reaction containing an active HeLa extract (Fig. 2A, viii, HL). No repair of the nicked strand of the 3′-30C substrate was seen, however (Fig. 2A, vii, HL). The disparity between the results of the 3′-30C and 3′-30V substrates suggested to us that the repair observed for the 3′-30V substrate may not be nick-directed. Indeed, a previous study has indicated the presence of a non-nick directed, but loop-stimulated pathway for loop repair in yeast cell extracts (15.Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17605-17611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis of the presence of a loop-stimulated repair pathway in human extracts that is not nick-directed, we first examined the repair that occurred on the continuous strands of 5′-30V and 3′-30C substrates. If the loop itself can provoke repair, loop removal should occur on the V strand of substrate 5′-30V and the C strand of 3′-30C. Results indicate that loop-specific removal indeed occurred in these substrates (Fig. 2, A, iii, for 3′-30C, and vi, for 5′-30V). Little (if any) repair was observed in the continuous strand containing no loops (see Fig. 2A, iv and v). It is worth mentioning that a residual 473-nt band was detected in substrate 3′-30V by the C strand probe (Fig. 2A, iv, HL), which seemed to be a loop addition (12.Bill C.A. Taghian D.G. Duran W.A. Nickoloff J.A. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in the continuous strand. However, based on our experience in the preparation of 3′ substrates, which were derived from ligation of their corresponding 5′ substrates before nicking by glycoprotein II in the viral strand (see “Experimental Procedures” for 3′ substrate preparations), there is a very small fraction of unligated substrates, which still contain a 5′ nick. Therefore, the residual 473-nt is most likely derived from a background 5′ nick-directed repair of the unligated substrates. To confirm the presence of a nick-independent repair pathway in human cells, we tested for loop removal of two ccc substrates that contain a 30-nt loop either in the C (ccc-30C) or V strands (ccc-30V). As shown in Fig. 2B, conversion of the longer fragment to a shorter fragment occurred in the looped strand for both substrates. As expected, little repair was detected in the non-looped strand for both ccc substrates (data not shown). These results, together with the data described above, suggest that a large loop structure in human cells can be removed in a manner independent of a strand break. Therefore, human cells appear to possess at least two large loop repair pathways: one that is directed by a 5′ strand break, whereas the other is loop-directed loop removal and is nick-independent. In general, nicked-directed repair appears to be more efficient than looped-directed repair as the amount of the former is always higher than the latter (see Fig. 2C). The Loop-directed Repair Pathway Is Independent of MMR, NER, and WRN Proteins—To determine whether several major DNA repair pathways are involved in large DNA loop repair, we assayed cell lines deficient in various DNA repair pathways for their ability to process the 5′-30V substrate, which allows for detection of both nick-dependent and -independent pathways in a single reaction. The cell lines used in this analysis are deficient in MMR (HCT116, HCT15, and NALM6), NER (GM02345 and AG08802), or Werner syndrome protein WRN (WS780). The WRN protein has a 3′ → 5′ helicase activity as well as a 3′ → 5′ nuclease activity, and is believed to participate in recombination repair and double strand break repair (25.Prince P.R. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26.Saintigny Y. Makienko K. Swanson C. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6971-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Repair activities were compared with the levels found in HeLa extract, which is wild type for MMR (21.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 27.Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and WRN activity (29.Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6887-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that all cell lines tested, regardless of deficiency in MMR, NER, or WRN, showed some degree of activity for both nick-directed and nick-independent pathways (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3). For the nick-directed pathway, nuclear extracts derived from MLH1-deficient HCT116 (Table I), MSH6-deficient HCT15 (Table I), MSH2-deficient NALM6 (Table I, Figs. 2 and 3), and WRN-deficient WS780 (Table I) had levels of repair comparable with those of HeLa cells. Cells with mutations in NER genes XPA (GM02345) or XPG (AG08802) were capable of processing large DNA loops in a nick-directed manner, but the repair level was significantly lower than that in other cells (Fig. 3 and Table I). To determine whether these cells are partially defective in this loop repair pathway, complementation assays were performed by mixing these two extracts. Although there was a 10% increase in repair, the level was still not as high as in other cells tested (data not shown). However, all extracts displayed a similar level of ability for the nick-independent repair of the substrate (Fig. 3 and Table I). These results indicate that like the nick-directed pathway, loop-directed repair is also independent of the MMR and NER pathways, as well as the WRN protein.Table ILarge loop repair in DNA repair mutants Repair assays were performed using substrate 5′-30V and repair was scored by Southern blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Average ± S.E. are given for at least three independent reactions. Less than 10% variation in the results was observed with different extract preparations. The HeLa cell line is proficient in MMR, NER, and WRN pathways.

To assess the impact of DNA synthesis in large loop DNA repair, repair reactions were performed either in the absence of exogenous dNTPs or in the presence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin (an inhibitor for pol α, pol δ, and pol ϵ), or ddNTPs (chain elongation terminators). We first analyzed the requirement for DNA synthesis for the nick-dependent pathway of large DNA loop repair using substrates 5′-30V and 5′-30C. As shown in Fig. 4A, the nick-directed repair was completely blocked by any inhibitory factor regardless of whether the loop was on the nicked strand (substrate 5′-30C) or on the continuous strand (substrate 5′-30V), suggesting that like most DNA repair pathways, nick-directed large loop repair requires active DNA synthesis that may involve pol α, pol δ, and/or pol ϵ. This is consistent with a previous report implicating pol δ in MMR (30.Longley M.J. Pierce A.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Similar analysis was performed to determine the impact of DNA synthesis on the nick-independent pathway using substrates 5′-30V and 3′-30V. Surprisingly, the loop removal for both substrates was not completely inhibited in all three conditions of limited DNA synthesis, although the amount of repair was reduced, with an inhibition of 17% by the omission exogenous dNTPs, 58% by aphidicolin, and 67% by ddNTPs (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that nick-independent loop removal requires a greatly reduced amount of DNA synthesis compared with the nick-dependent system. Because DNA synthesis in DNA repair is preceded by strand excision, the limited inhibition of the loop-directed repair by DNA synthesis inhibitors also suggests a limited repair excision during this reaction. To explore this possibility, repair intermediates were monitored by Southern blot analysis as previously described (20.McCulloch S.D. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), under the conditions of limited DNA synthesis. Fig. 5, A and B, shows the analysis of nick-directed repair for both 5′-30V and 5′-30C substrates using a probe that binds to the 3′ end of the C strand of a fragment produced by digestion with SspI (also see Fig. 1, SspI fragment). As expected, under the normal repair conditions (lanes 1 and 5), only a band with the full size SspI fragment (the top band, 724 nt in length for lane 1, 754 nt in length for lane 5) and a band (524 nt in length for lane 1, and 554 nt in length for lane 5) corresponding to the originally nicked DNA fragment were detected. The top band in these cases represents both complete repair (excision of the loop, resynthesis, and ligation) and direct ligation of the nick prior to repair, whereas the lower band indicates the original substrate that was neither ligated, nor otherwise processed. Under the conditions of limited DNA synthesis (lanes 2–4 and 6–8), in addition to the whole SspI fragment (724 nt in Fig. 5A and 754 nt in Fig. 5B) and the fragment containing the original nick (524 nt in Fig. 5A and 554 nt in Fig. 5B), smaller bands between 524 and ∼400 nt were also observed, which represent the excision intermediates. Although a slightly different pattern of intermediate tracts between the nick and the loop was evident between these two substrates, prominent DNA fragments with ends that correspond very close to the loop site were clearly detected in both cases (between the 408- and 420-nt markers), particularly in reactions containing ddNTPs (lanes 4 and 8) and omitting exogenous dNTPs (lanes 2 and 6). Interestingly, at least 50% less repair intermediates were seen in the aphidicolin-containing reactions (lanes 3 and 7, discussed below). These results indicate that an extensive repair excision is associated with nick-directed loop repair and that the bulk of excision occurs between the nick and loop site. Similar experiments were performed to determine excision intermediates for the nick-independent loop repair pathway by using substrates 5′-30V and 3′-30V. The results from these experiments demonstrated that repair intermediates were difficult to detect. Even after prolonged exposure of the film, we were able to detect only very light bands centered on the loop, which had a similar intensity as many nonspecific repair bands above the loop site (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed using the 3′-30V substrate (not shown). Although less effective repair by the loop-directed pathway may partially contribute to undetectable excision intermediates, the data shown in Fig. 4 suggest to us that loop-directed loop removal is less sensitive to conditions of limited DNA synthesis, which would also explain the less detectable excision intermediates observed in Fig. 5. An Aphidicolin-sensitive DNA Polymerase Is Involved in Stimulating Repair Excision in the Nick-dependent Pathway—Our data show that an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase is apparently involved in nick-directed large loop repair, as judged by the fact that no repair products were observed in reactions containing aphidicolin (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, much less excision intermediates were observed in aphidicolin-containing reactions (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7) compared with other reactions that inhibit DNA synthesis. These results suggest that an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase may be required for loop repair-associated excision. To test this possibility, repair products from reactions with limited DNA synthesis were digested with BseRI and BanII. Whereas BseRI consistently linearizes the DNA substrate (see Fig. 1), digestion of the DNA substrate by BanII depends on the availability of its recognition sequence, because the BanII recognition sequence is located in between the nick and the loop (see SspI fragment in Fig. 1) and is subjected to excision during the repair reaction. Digestion by BanII would occur if there is no excision, or excision followed by resynthesis. If excision occurs without resynthesis in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors, a single strand DNA gap that spans the nick and the loop along the shorter distance would be generated, which prevents BanII from being able to cut. If both enzymes are able to digest the DNA under these conditions, fragments of 3.7 and 2.7 kb will be evident, indicating that the region of DNA in between the loop and pre-existing nick is double stranded and that repair excision does not occur in this region. As an example, a 5′ G-T heteroduplex was processed by HeLa nuclear extracts under various conditions of limited DNA synthesis. As expected, an increased prominence of the 6.4-kb band was observed regardless of how DNA synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 6, lanes 6–8), indicative of the presence of a single stranded DNA gap around the BanII sequences as a result of the mismatch-provoked excision and inhibited DNA synthesis. Similar assays were performed using the 5′-30C and 5′-30V substrates. As shown in Fig. 6, there were significant amounts (26%) of BanII-resistant species (6.4 kb in size) in reactions in the absence of dNTPs for both the 5′-30V (lane 11) and 5′-30C (lane 16) substrates, indicating production of a single stranded DNA gap within the BanII recognition sequence. However, the amount of the 6.4-kb species was significantly reduced in reactions containing aphidicolin (Fig. 6, lanes 13 and 18). These results suggest that the repair reaction was either completed or inhibited prior to excision. The former possibility is contradictory to the repair data shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, aphidicolin appears to be able to inhibit nick-directed excision as well as synthesis. In other words, an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase (pol α, δ, or ϵ) is potentially required for the excision step of nick-directed loop repair. The excision mechanism for the nick-directed loop repair pathway is apparently different from that for MMR. For example, regardless of the kinds of DNA synthesis inhibitors, at least a 20-fold increase in the amount of the 6.4-kb band was observed during the repair of a G/T mismatch (see lanes 5–8). For looped substrates, there is an ∼10-fold increase when omitting exogenous dNTPs (lanes 11 and 16), but an increase less than 3-fold in reactions containing aphidicolin. Control reactions using homoduplex DNA showed little BanII-resistant 6.4-kb species (Fig. 6, lanes 1–4), implying that the excision is provoked by a loop or a mismatch. The results presented here demonstrate that there are at least two distinct repair pathways for large DNA loops in human cells: one that is directed by a strand break (nickdirected repair) and the other that is directed by the loop itself (loop-directed repair). The loop-directed repair is a novel loop repair pathway in human cells. Using Southern blot analysis, we show that the repair pathway specifically removes the loop structure from DNA regardless of whether the loop is in the continuous strand or the nicked strand (see Fig. 2, A and B). We further show that the loop-directed pathway requires little DNA synthesis because the repair reaction is marginally sensitive to aphidicolin, ddNTPs, or the absence of exogenous dNTPs (see Fig. 4B), all of which strongly block DNA synthesis. The data in this study demonstrate that the nick-directed repair pathway relies on a nick 5′ (but not 3′) to the loop for repair, and the repair only occurs in the nicked strand, which is in agreement with a previous study in human cell extracts (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, our data suggest that an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase is somehow involved in the excision step of the nick-directed pathway (see Fig. 6). DNA large loop repair has been shown in yeast, and previous data suggest that this pathway requires components from both MMR and NER pathways. Kirkpatrick and Petes (10.Kirkpatrick D.T. Petes T.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 929-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the processing of a 26-nt loop requires the gene products of MSH2 and RAD1, MMR and NER components, respectively. Additionally, the purified RAD1-RAD10 complex is capable of enhancing in vitro repair of a 27-nt loop (15.Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17605-17611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results suggest, however, that loop repair pathways in human cells may occur through a mechanism that is not homologous to that seen in yeast. We demonstrate that both the nick-directed and the loop-directed pathways in human cells seem to be independent of the MMR, NER, and WRN pathways, as judged by the fact that cells defective in MSH2, MLH1, XPA, XPG, or WRN are competent in the repair of large looped heteroduplexes for both nick- and loop-directed mechanisms (see Table I and Fig. 3). Although we did not test the involvement of the XPF gene product (the homolog of yeast RAD1) in loop repair, a recent study has indicated that XPF is not required for nick-directed large loop repair (14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms are used to process large DNA loops in human and yeast cells. The analysis of excision intermediates and repair products under conditions of limited DNA synthesis indicates that MMR, the nick-directed loop repair, and the loop-directed loop repair pathways utilize distinct mechanisms for repair excision. Like MMR and small loop repair, the excision of the nick-directed large loop repair appears to initiate at the preexisting nick and proceeds toward the loop site (see Refs. 14.Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; and Fig. 5). However, unlike MMR, where the excision step can occur in the absence of a DNA polymerase, the nick-directed excision appears to depend on an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase (Figs. 5 and 6). For the MMR reaction, none of the three conditions causing limited DNA synthesis had an affect on gap formation between the nick and the mismatch, as a single stranded region that is refractory to BanII digestion is created under all conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 6–8). In the case of nick-directed large loop repair, aphidicolin decreases excision (Fig. 6, lanes 13 and 18), whereas lack of exogenous dNTPs (Fig. 6, lanes 11 and 16) or the presence of ddNTPs (Fig. 6, lanes 12 and 17) only slightly inhibits repair excision. This finding suggests that an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase is required for the excision step of nick-directed large loop repair. However, how such a polymerase may play a role in repair excision is a puzzle, as none of the known mammalian DNA polymerases contain a 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity (31.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication, 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). It is possible that a preformed complex of a polymerase and a nuclease is recruited to the nick, with DNA synthesis occurring immediately on the heels of digestion. Additionally, the nick-independent loop repair pathway appears to operate by a much different mechanism. The most obvious difference is that the loop-directed repair requires little DNA synthesis because all conditions of limited DNA synthesis only slightly reduce the repair (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the fact that only limited excision intermediates and a very small patch of excision can be detected in these reactions (Fig. 5C). Therefore, it seems likely that the loop in the loop-directed pathway is removed by incisions (rather than excision) from activities similar to XPG or XPF/ERCC1, but these activities would need to make incisions either to the immediate 5′ side of a loop, or on both sides of the loop, creating a strand break or a very small (several nucleotide) gap. The former case would create a flap DNA structure that could be processed by flap endonuclease 1 or a similar activity. In either case, only the looped DNA sequence is removed and there would be no need for extensive DNA synthesis. Clearly, much more work is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of the pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2074912610,"Members of the Stat transcription factor family are specifically activated by cytokines, and each Stat mediates its biological effects through the trans-activation of a unique profile of target genes. This specificity is achieved even when Stat proteins mediating opposite transcriptional effects bind to the same palindromic Stat sites in target genes. We show here that the non-conserved sequences of Stat transcription activation domains (TADs) contribute to specificity in promoter activation. Chimeric proteins in which the Stat6 TAD was replaced by that from Stat1α or Stat5 exhibited normal interleukin-4-inducible DNA binding activity, but at best modest trans-activation of reporters containing Stat6 binding sites, and a failure to activate the endogenous CD23 promoter in primary B cells. The p160 coactivator nuclear coactivator-1 (Src-1) was specifically recruited by and coactivated Stat6 but not the chimeric Stat6 molecules. Strikingly, transcriptional responses exhibited distinct requirements for the nuclear coactivator-1 interaction motif of the Stat6 C terminus. Together, these findings indicate that the Stat6 TAD contributes to promoter specificity by the differential recruitment of and requirement for a p160-class coactivator."

The mammalian metanephric kidney develops from the metanephrogenic mesenchyme, which appears in the region of the posterior intermediate mesoderm (1.Saxen L. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1987Crossref Google Scholar). It is well known that kidney development is induced by reciprocal signaling between the ureteric bud epithelium and the metanephric mesenchyme. On day 11 of mouse embryogenesis, the ureteric bud emerges near the caudal end of the Wolffian ducts and invades the metanephrogenic mesenchyme. Once the bud meets the mesenchyme, it begins to grow and branch repeatedly, thus generating the renal collecting duct system. At the same time, induction of the mesenchyme by signals from the bud initiates the condensation of the mesenchyme that differentiates to form the nephrons. In recent years, many important molecules that cooperatively function in the branching morphogenesis of the epithelial ureteric bud have been identified by in vitro and in vivo studies. These include transcription factors, secreted peptides, cell surface receptors, and extracellular matrices, which are expressed sequentially at specific sites of the developing kidney (2.Dressler G.

The gene ablation studies revealed that GDNF, GFRα1, and RET are required for the development of the kidney and the enteric nervous system. Gdnf–/–, Gfrα1–/–, or Ret–/– mice showed kidney aplasia or severe hypodysplasia and lacked enteric neurons in the whole intestinal tract, resulting in their death soon after birth (8.Schuchardt A.

GDNF is secreted from the metanephric mesenchyme, and RET and GFRα1 are expressed on the cell surface of the branching ureteric bud epithelium (11.Moore M.W. Klein R.D. Farinas I. Sauer H.

Thus, it turned out that the interaction between the ureteric bud epithelium and the metanephric mesenchyme that leads to activation of the GDNF/RET signaling system is essential for normal development of the kidney. Based on these findings, much attention has been paid to the genes that regulate the expression of GDNF and RET. It was suggested that transcription factors Pax2 and Eya-1 are responsible for Gdnf gene expression and that Emx2 is required to maintain the expression of both Gdnf and Ret in mouse metanephric kidney (2.Dressler G. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 390-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3.Piscione T.D. Rosenblum N.D.

In addition, Batourina et al. (17.Batourina E. Gim S. Bello N. Shy M. Clagett-Dame M. Srinivas S. Costantini F. Mendelsohn C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) reported that vitamin A signaling from stromal mesenchyme is necessary for Ret expression. However, it remains unknown which gene expression downstream of the GDNF/RET signaling is critical for renal development. In this report, we describe a novel GDNF-inducible gene with a BTB/POZ domain and zinc finger motifs that are highly expressed in the ureteric bud of the metanephric kidney. Analysis by the metanephric organ culture suggested that this gene plays a crucial role in the ureteric bud branching. Cell Lines—TGW and NB39 human neuroblastoma cells, Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Differential Display Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from TGW cells treated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) for 2 h using an RNA purification kit (Qiagen). After treating total RNAs with RNase-free DNase I to eliminate contaminated chromosomal DNA, differential display polymerase chain reaction was performed using TaKaRa rhodamine fluorescence differential display system (TaKaRa). The fluorescence products were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing urea-4% polyacrylamide gels. Differentially expressed bands were excised, sequenced, and compared with available public data bases. Nonredundant cDNA clones were used as probes for Northern blotting. Cloning of the Human GZF1 Gene—A human cDNA library was constructed using poly(A)+ RNA from TGW cells stimulated with GDNF and screened with a human GZF1 fragment isolated by differential display to obtain its full-length cDNA. Briefly, the TGW cDNAs were inserted into the ZAP Express predigested vector (Stratagene), and the resulting phage constructs were packaged using Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). The phages were infected into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′ strain, and the infected bacteria were plated for plaque hybridization. The library was screened with the [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human GZF1 fragment using the Gene Trapper cDNA positive selection system (Invitrogen). Northern Blotting—Total RNAs from GDNF-untreated or -treated TGW cells were separated on 1% agarose-formamide gels with formaldehyde and transferred onto Hybond-XL nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes containing RNAs from human and mouse multiple tissues were purchased from Clontech. A human or mouse GZF1 cDNA fragment utilized as a probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the High Prime DNA-labeling system (Roche Diagnostics), and Northern hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 2 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-GZF1 polyclonal antibody was developed against the 19 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of GZF1 and affinity-purified with the immunized peptide. Anti-α-tubulin and anti-pan cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Oct-1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-RET polyclonal antibody was described previously (18.Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blotting—TGW and NB39 cells were stimulated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h after 24 h of starvation and lysed in SDS sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue, and 80 mm dithiothreitol). The resulting lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (19.Watanabe T. Ichihara M. Hashimoto M. Shimono K. Shimoyama Y. Nagasaka T. Murakumo Y. Murakami H. Sugiura H.

GAL4-fused Reporter Gene-targeted Repression Assay—The generation of pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids has been described previously (20.Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and cotransfected with 40 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, 40 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and 320 ng of pSRα-GAL4-GZF1 fusion construct or pSRα-GAL4 by the LipofectAMINE PLUS method (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (20.Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with the pRL-TK plasmid was used to normalize all luciferase values. Mutations in the BTB/POZ domain were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Immunohistochemistry—Embryos (13.5–14.5 days post coitus) of ICR mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Four-μm sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. In the case of RET staining, these sections were subjected to microwave pretreatment for 12 min in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and cooled at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. The slides were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase-labeled polymer (EnVision+, Dako), and the reaction products were visualized with diaminobenzidine and H2O2. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Transfection of the Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide—Six antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were designed based on the predicted secondary structure of mouse GZF1 mRNA. We targeted the region near the initiation codon or the region forming loops. Six antisense phosphorothioated ODNs were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. One day before transfection, Neuro2a cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well of a 24-well plate and transfected with each antisense ODN at a final concentration of 200 nm. Transfections were performed using the OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GZF1 antibody. Metanephric Organ Culture—Metanephric organ culture was performed as described by Kanwar et al. (21.Kanwar Y.S. Kumar A. Ota K. Lin S. Wada J. Chugh S. Wallner E.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F953-F965Google Scholar). In brief, metanephroi were isolated from E11.5 ICR mouse embryos and cultured in Transwell-Clear (Costar) for 4 days in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The culture medium consisted of equal volumes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with transferrin (50 μg/ml), penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The medium was devoid of serum or any other growth factor. Sense, antisense, or scramble ODNs of mouse GZF1 were added to the medium daily at a concentration of 0.5–2.0 μm. The metanephric explants were photographed directly by stereomicroscope and then stained with anti-pan cytokeratin antibody to highlight ureteric bud derivatives. The rudiments in metanephric organ culture were fixed in 100% methanol, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The rudiments were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The metanephroi were incubated with anti-pan cytokeratin antibody diluted 1:50 at 4 °C overnight and then with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:100 at 4 °C overnight. After immunostaining, slides were mounted in PermaFluor (Shandon) and observed by a fluorescent microscope with a charge-coupled device camera (BX50, DP70, Olympus). To identify GDNF-inducible genes, we performed differential display analysis using RNA from a human neuroblastoma cell line, TGW, expressing RET and GFR α1. We detected 124 cDNA bands in which the intensity increased after GDNF stimulation. After isolating and sequencing these cDNA bands, 73 independent cDNA clones were identified and used for Northern blotting to confirm their increased expression after GDNF stimulation. As a consequence, we found the increased expression of 14 genes by GDNF, although the time course of the induction was different depending on the genes (data not shown). These included 10 known genes such as c-FOS, CREM, and cell division cycle-like kinase genes and four unpublished sequences. In this study, we focused on a new gene with a BTB/POZ domain and C2H2-type zinc finger motifs that was named GZF1 (GDNF-inducible zinc finger gene 1). We isolated its full-length cDNA from the library constructed from RNA of GDNF-treated TGW human neuroblastoma cells. The cDNA sequence revealed that it encodes a protein of 711 amino acids containing the BTB/POZ domain at the amino-terminal region and 10 C2H2-type zinc fingers (Fig. 1A). In addition, the GZF1 sequence contained a nuclear localization signal between the BTB/POZ domain and the zinc finger motifs. We also isolated its mouse ortholog cDNA from a mouse testis cDNA library with an amino acid sequence (706 amino acids) showing 84% identity with the human GZF1 sequence (Fig. 1A). The human and mouse GZF1 genes were located on chromosomes 20 and 2, respectively. When the GZF1 expression was examined in various human tissues, a single 4.8-kb mRNA was detected in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver tissues (Fig. 1B). In addition, it was expressed at relatively high levels in brain and kidney tissue among human fetal tissues examined (Fig. 1B). The GZF1 gene expression was also detected in several mouse tissues including kidney and in different stages of mouse embryos (7–17-day embryos). (Fig. 1C). The induction of the GZF1 gene in TGW cells showed two peaks at 1 h and at 24–48 h after GDNF stimulation by Northern blotting (Fig. 2A). This pattern of the GZF1 gene induction by GDNF was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis (data not shown). To further investigate the GZF1 protein expression, we developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the 19 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human GZF1. The antibody specifically detected 95- and 115-kDa proteins in TGW cells and a 115-kDa protein in Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2B). Because we were not able to detect either N-linked or O-linked glycosylation in these proteins (data not shown), the difference between expected and apparent molecular masses of GZF1 (80 kDa as expected molecular mass and 95 and 115 kDa as apparent molecular masses) may be caused by their peculiar protein conformations or other modifications. When the GZF1 expression was examined in GDNF-stimulated TGW and NB39 human neuroblastoma cells in which both RET and GFRα1 are expressed, its expression significantly increased 24–72 h after stimulation (Fig. 2C). The early induction of the GZF1 protein was not observed, probably because of transient up-regulation of GZF1 mRNA for a short period at an early phase (∼1–2 h after GDNF stimulation). To confirm that the bands detected by the antibody represent the GZF1 protein, we constructed the EGFP-GZF1 fusion gene and transfected it into HEK293T cells. Although the fusion gene encodes a protein of 976 amino acids in which the expected molecular mass is 107 kDa, Western blotting with anti-GZF1 and anti-GFP antibodies revealed that the fusion protein was detected mainly as a 140-kDa band (Fig. 2D). The difference (33 kDa) between expected and apparent molecular masses of the EGFP-GZF1 fusion protein was almost the same as that between expected and apparent molecular masses of the endogenous GZF1 protein (80 and 115 kDa), indicating that the bands recognized by anti-GZF1 antibody represent the GZF1 protein. The 95-kDa protein detected in human cells may be translated from another methionine (e.g. codon 192) that is present only in the human GZF1 gene or may be influenced by differences in modification or processing, although further investigation is necessary. Cell fractionation experiments revealed that the GZF1 protein was detected in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2E), although the nuclear expression was predominant. Because it is known that the BTB/POZ domain is involved in transcriptional repression (22.Melnick A. Carlile G. Ahmad K.F. Kiang C.L. Corcoran C. Bardwell V. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1804-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we next investigated the transcriptional activity of GZF1 by the luciferase reporter gene assay. The human GZF1 cDNA was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 3A, GAL4BD) in the expression plasmid containing the SRα promoter, and the resulting construct was transfected into HEK293T cells together with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing five tandem repeats of the GAL4-binding sequence, a binding site for the serum response element (SRE) and the thymidine kinase minimal (TKm) promoter (Fig. 3A) (20.Shimono Y. Murakami H. Hasegawa Y. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39411-39419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it turned out that expression of GZF1 reduced the luciferase activity by ∼80% as compared with that by expression of the GAL4BD only (Fig. 3C). It was reported that two conserved charged residues within the BTB/POZ domains of PLZF and Bcl-6 proteins are important for their transcriptionally repressive activity (22.Melnick A. Carlile G. Ahmad K.F. Kiang C.L. Corcoran C. Bardwell V. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1804-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, we replaced the corresponding amino acids (aspartic acid 32 and lysine 50 in Fig. 3B) in GZF1 with asparagine and aspartic acid, respectively (designated D32N and K50D). As shown in Fig. 3C, the introduction of each mutation resulted in a 1.6–1.7-fold increase of the luciferase activity. Moreover, when both mutations were introduced into GZF1, the activity further increased (about 2.2-fold), suggesting the importance of these two charged amino acids for transcriptional repressive activity of GZF1. To elucidate the importance of GZF1 on kidney development, we stained the mouse embryonic kidney with anti-GZF1 antibody. Interestingly, the ureteric bud epithelia of 13.5–14.5-day embryonic metanephroi were strongly stained (Fig. 4, B and D). Using serial sections, we detected the expression of GZF1 and RET in the same ureteric buds of 13.5–14.5-day metanephroi (Fig. 4, A–D). Both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of GZF1 were observed in the ureteric buds (Fig. 4, B and D). Like RET, the GZF1 expression significantly decreased in the kidney after birth (data not shown). When immunostaining was performed with protein A-purified rabbit IgG instead of the anti-GZF1 antibody as a negative control, no staining was observed in these tissues (data not shown). Finally, we investigated whether antisense phosphorothioated ODNs of the GZF1 gene impair the ureteric bud branching in the metanephric organ culture. We designed six antisense ODNs based on the mouse sequence (Fig. 5A). When mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a cells) were cultured in the presence of each antisense ODN for 2 days, it turned out that two antisense ODNs (designated AS-4 and AS-5) significantly decreased the expression of the mouse GZF1 protein in Neuro2a cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, sense and scramble ODNs corresponding to the AS-4 sequence (SS-4 and SC-4) did not affect the expression of GZF1 (Fig. 5B). Thus, metanephroi isolated from 11.5-day ICR mouse embryos were incubated in the presence of AS-4 or AS-5 for 4 days, and the ureteric bud branching was observed by staining with anti-pan cytokeratin antibody. Both AS-4 (Fig. 5C) and AS-5 (data not shown) markedly impaired the branching, whereas it normally occurred in the presence of SS-4 or SC-4 (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, four other antisense ODNs (AS-1, -2, -3, and -6) that did not decrease the GZF1 protein expression in Neuro2a cells showed no effect on the ureteric bud branching (data not shown). These findings demonstrated that the GZF1 gene is a novel GDNF-inducible gene that is required for renal branching morphogenesis. In the past 10 years, a variety of factors including transcription factors and secreted peptides have been reported to be involved in normal development of metanephric kidney (2.Dressler G. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 390-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 3.Piscione T.D. Rosenblum N.D.

Genetic evidence has established a crucial role for the GDNF/RET signaling in the ureteric bud development and branching. GDNF that is secreted from the metanephric mesenchyme is essential for correct outgrowth and branching of the ureteric bud in which RET and GFRα1 are expressed (8.Schuchardt A. D'Agati V.

It was demonstrated that several transcription factors including Pax2, Pax8, Eya-1, and Emx-2 are expressed in nephric duct and metanephric mesenchyme in spatial and temporal fashions and regulate the GDNF and/or RET expression in the developing kidney (23.Brophy P.D. Ostrom L. Lang K.M. Dressler G.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4747-4756PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bouchard M. Souabni A. Mandler M. Neubuser A. Busslinger M.

In addition, vitamin A signaling from the stromal mesenchyme (a third renal cell type) that activates the retinoic acid receptors, Rarα and Rarβ2, was required for RET expression in the ureteric bud (17.Batourina E. Gim S. Bello N. Shy M. Clagett-Dame M. Srinivas S. Costantini F. Mendelsohn C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), indicating that there are kidney-specific regulatory mechanisms for the activation of the GDNF/RET signaling system. Moreover, the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor, Foxd1 (27.Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Pod1 (28.Quaggin S.E. Schwartz L. Cui S. Igarashi P. Deimling J. Post M. Rossant J. Development. 1999; 126: 5771-5783PubMed Google Scholar), appeared to control the spatially restricted Ret expression during renal development. Foxd1–/– and Pod–/– mice showed a transition in Ret expression from the normal restricted pattern at tips of the branching ureteric buds to ectopic expression throughout the collecting duct system, resulting in decreased ureteric bud branching and renal hypoplasia. However, what gene expression (as regulated by the GDNF/RET signaling) is required for normal ureteric bud branching has not been elucidated so far. In this study, we identified for the first time a GDNF-inducible gene, GZF1, involved in ureteric bud branching. The facts that RET and GZF1 are highly expressed in the same ureteric buds and that antisense ODNs of GZF1 markedly impaired their branching in the metanephric organ culture strongly supported the view that GZF1 is an important branching factor that functions downstream of the GDNF/RET signaling pathway. The GZF1 gene contained the BTB/POZ domain as well as zinc finger motifs. It was reported that the BTB/POZ domains were found in 0.6 and 0.8% of total genes in the human and mouse genome, respectively (29.Waterston R.H. Lindblad-Toh K. Birney E. Rogers J. Abril J.F.

BTB/POZ domain-containing proteins comprise a large and diverse family of factors involved in multiple cellular processes including development and cell growth (30.Dent A.L. Shaffer A.L. Yu X.

Using a luciferase reporter gene assay, we also found that GZF1 has strong transcriptional repressive activity. Thus, further investigation of GZF1 functions and identification of the genes in which expression is regulated by GZF1 would promote our understanding of mechanisms of renal branching morphogenesis.

The role of membrane potential in the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion is not known. High K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization increases secretion from parathyroid cells. The paradox is that increased extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which inhibits secretion, has also been postulated to have a depolarizing effect. In this study, human parathyroid cells from parathyroid adenomas were used in patch clamp studies of K<sup>+</sup> channels and membrane potential. Detailed characterization revealed two K<sup>+</sup> channels that were strictly dependent of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. At high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a large K<sup>+</sup> current was seen, and the cells were hyperpolarized (–50.4 ± 13.4 mV), whereas lowering of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulted in a dramatic decrease in K<sup>+</sup> current and depolarization of the cells (–0.1 ± 8.8 mV, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Changes in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not alter K<sup>+</sup> currents when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was clamped, indicating that K<sup>+</sup> channels are activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The results were concordant in cell-attached, perforated patch, whole-cell and excised membrane patch configurations. These results suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<i><sub>o</sub></i> regulates membrane potential of human parathyroid cells via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels and that the membrane potential may be of greater importance for the stimulus-secretion coupling than recognized previously."
