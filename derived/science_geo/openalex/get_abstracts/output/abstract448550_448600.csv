https://openalex.org/W1982789056,"Cellular growth signals stimulate anabolic processes. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a protein kinase that senses growth signals to regulate anabolic growth and proliferation. Activation of mTORC1 led to the acute stimulation of metabolic flux through the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. mTORC1 signaling posttranslationally regulated this metabolic pathway via its downstream target ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which directly phosphorylates S1859 on CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase), the enzyme that catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Growth signaling through mTORC1 thus stimulates the production of new nucleotides to accommodate an increase in RNA and DNA synthesis needed for ribosome biogenesis and anabolic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2138672527,"Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise, coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent, population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak."

To further understand the central role of mTOR in cell physiology, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify substrates or downstream effectors of the two mTOR complexes. mTOR controlled the phosphorylation of 335 proteins, including CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). CAD catalyzes the first three steps in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. mTORC1 indirectly phosphorylated CAD-S1859 through S6 kinase (S6K). CAD-S1859 phosphorylation promoted CAD oligomerization and thereby stimulated de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and progression through S phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Thus, mTORC1 also stimulates the synthesis of nucleotides to control cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1972643286,"The diffraction of electrons through a nanoscale hologram that imprints a certain phase modulation on the electrons’ wavefunction produces a non-spreading electron Airy beam that follows a parabolic trajectory and can reconstruct its original shape after passing an obstacle. Light, as is widely known, travels in straight lines. Yet a few years ago it was shown that specially tailored light beams can follow a curved trajectory, without spreading. Such beams follow a waveform known from quantum mechanics, called the Airy function, a concept originally developed by the astronomer Sir George Biddell Airy in work on the trajectories of light in rainbows. Now, with the demonstration of Airy beams consisting of free electrons, new possibilities for manipulating electrons are in prospect. Airy electron beam arcs were generated by the diffraction of electrons through a nanoscale hologram, which imprints a specific phase modulation on the electrons' wavefunction. These beams can bend in space without any external force, stay localized over distances of up to 100 metres and self-heal after passing an obstacle. Possible applications include use in high-performance electron microscopes and as a basis for a new type of electron interferometer. Within the framework of quantum mechanics, a unique particle wave packet exists1 in the form of the Airy function2,3. Its counterintuitive properties are revealed as it propagates in time or space: the quantum probability wave packet preserves its shape despite dispersion or diffraction and propagates along a parabolic caustic trajectory, even though no force is applied. This does not contradict Newton’s laws of motion, because the wave packet centroid propagates along a straight line. Nearly 30 years later, this wave packet, known as an accelerating Airy beam, was realized4 in the optical domain; later it was generalized to an orthogonal and complete family of beams5 that propagate along parabolic trajectories, as well as to beams that propagate along arbitrary convex trajectories6. Here we report the experimental generation and observation of the Airy beams of free electrons. These electron Airy beams were generated by diffraction of electrons through a nanoscale hologram7,8,9, which imprinted on the electrons’ wavefunction a cubic phase modulation in the transverse plane. The highest-intensity lobes of the generated beams indeed followed parabolic trajectories. We directly observed a non-spreading electron wavefunction that self-heals10, restoring its original shape after passing an obstacle. This holographic generation of electron Airy beams opens up new avenues for steering electronic wave packets like their photonic counterparts, because the wave packets can be imprinted with arbitrary shapes5 or trajectories6."

Such close relationships require signaling between plant and pollinator. Coordination between plant signals and pollinator perception has been shown to exist in flower color, shape, and odor. Clarke et al. (p. 66 , published online 21 February) report the potential for a distinct mode of plant–pollinator communication, electric fields. Natural floral electric fields, which are impacted by visits from naturally charged bees, were easily discriminated by bees, based on their level, pattern, and structure, and improved the rate at which bees remembered the location of a nectar reward."
https://openalex.org/W2159133042,"Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known that other planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. Until fairly recently, we have been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution, and, since last year, to detect planets that are the size of Earth or somewhat smaller. Hitherto, no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see in the Solar System. Here we report a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star, which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to that of the Moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury."
https://openalex.org/W1987258429,"Schistosomiasis is among the most prevalent human parasitic diseases, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. The aetiological agents of this disease are trematode flatworms (Schistosoma) that live and lay eggs within the vasculature of the host. These eggs lodge in host tissues, causing inflammatory responses that are the primary cause of morbidity. Because these parasites can live and reproduce within human hosts for decades, elucidating the mechanisms that promote their longevity is of fundamental importance. Although adult pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts, drive long-term homeostatic tissue maintenance in long-lived free-living flatworms (for example, planarians), and neoblast-like cells have been described in some parasitic tapeworms, little is known about whether similar cell types exist in any trematode species. Here we describe a population of neoblast-like cells in the trematode Schistosoma mansoni. These cells resemble planarian neoblasts morphologically and share their ability to proliferate and differentiate into derivatives of multiple germ layers. Capitalizing on available genomic resources and RNA-seq-based gene expression profiling, we find that these schistosome neoblast-like cells express a fibroblast growth factor receptor orthologue. Using RNA interference we demonstrate that this gene is required for the maintenance of these neoblast-like cells. Our observations indicate that adaptation of developmental strategies shared by free-living ancestors to modern-day schistosomes probably contributed to the success of these animals as long-lived obligate parasites. We expect that future studies deciphering the function of these neoblast-like cells will have important implications for understanding the biology of these devastating parasites."
https://openalex.org/W2107383745,"Adding to the Antiviral Arsenal The envelope of influenza virus contains two immunodominant glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (NA). Existing antivirals like zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) target NA; however, the development of drug resistance is a problem. Kim et al. (p. 71 , published online 21 February) now report a different class of NA inhibitors. NA catalyzes the removal of sialic acids from the surface of host cells to initiate entry. Discovery of a NA–sialic acid intermediate led to the production of sialic acid analogs that bound covalently to NA and inhibited its enzymatic activity. These compounds showed activity against a wide variety of influenza strains, inhibited viral replication in cell culture, and were able to protect mice against influenza infection. Protection of mice was equivalent to protection seen from zanamivir. Moreover, the compounds showed activity against drug-resistant strains in vitro. These compounds represent a potentially useful addition to the arsenal of antivirals used to treat influenza infection."
https://openalex.org/W2104812091,"SAMHD1 is a dGTP-activated dNTPase that has been implicated as a modulator of the innate immune response. In monocytes and their differentiated derivatives, as well as in quiescent cells, SAMHD1 strongly inhibits HIV-1 infection and, to a lesser extent, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) because of their virion-associated virulence factor Vpx, which directs SAMHD1 for proteasomal degradation. Here, we used a combination of biochemical and virologic approaches to gain insights into the functional organization of human SAMHD1. We found that the catalytically active recombinant dNTPase is a dGTP-induced tetramer. Chemical cross-linking studies revealed SAMHD1 tetramers in human monocytic cells, in which it strongly restricts HIV-1 infection. The propensity of SAMHD1 to maintain the tetrameric state in vitro is regulated by its C terminus, located outside of the catalytic domain. Accordingly, we show that the C terminus is required for the full ability of SAMHD1 to deplete dNTP pools and to inhibit HIV-1 infection in U937 monocytes. Interestingly, the human SAMHD1 C terminus contains a docking site for HIV-2/SIVmac Vpx and is known to have evolved under positive selection. This evidence indicates that Vpx targets a functionally important element in SAMHD1. Together, our findings imply that SAMHD1 tetramers are the biologically active form of this dNTPase and provide new insights into the functional organization of SAMHD1."
https://openalex.org/W1993466365,"Background Red blood cells (RBC) possess a nitric oxide synthase (RBC-NOS) whose activation depends on the PI3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway. RBC-NOS-produced NO exhibits important biological functions like maintaining RBC deformability. Until now, the cellular target structure for NO, to exert its influence on RBC deformability, remains unknown. In the present study we analyzed the modification of RBC-NOS activity by pharmacological treatments, the resulting influence on RBC deformability and provide first evidence for possible target proteins of RBC-NOS-produced NO in the RBC cytoskeletal scaffold. Methods/Findings Blood from fifteen male subjects was incubated with the NOS substrate L-arginine to directly stimulate enzyme activity. Direct inhibition of enzyme activity was induced by L-N5-(1-Iminoethyl)-ornithin (L-NIO). Indirect stimulation and inhibition of RBC-NOS were achieved by applying insulin and wortmannin, respectively, substances known to affect PI3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) were additionally applied as NO positive and negative controls, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine phosphorylation and thus activation of RBC-NOS. As a marker for NO synthesis nitrite was measured in plasma and RBCs using chemiluminescence detection. S-nitrosylation of erythrocyte proteins was determined by biotin switch assay and modified proteins were identified using LC-MS. RBC deformability was determined by ektacytometry. The data reveal that activated RBC-NOS leads to increased NO production, S-nitrosylation of RBC proteins and RBC deformability, whereas RBC-NOS inhibition resulted in contrary effects. Conclusion/Significance This study first-time provides strong evidence that RBC-NOS-produced NO modifies RBC deformability through direct S-nitrosylation of cytoskeleton proteins, most likely α- and β-spectrins. Our data, therefore, gain novel insights into biological functions of RBC-NOS by connecting impaired RBC deformability abilities to specific posttranslational modifications of RBC proteins. By identifying likely NO-target proteins in RBC, our results will stimulate new therapeutic approaches for patients with microvascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2078675379,"This work explores the bactericidal effect of (+)-limonene, the major constituent of citrus fruits' essential oils, against E. coli. The degree of E. coli BJ4 inactivation achieved by (+)-limonene was influenced by the pH of the treatment medium, being more bactericidal at pH 4.0 than at pH 7.0. Deletion of rpoS and exposure to a sub-lethal heat or an acid shock did not modify E. coli BJ4 resistance to (+)-limonene. However, exposure to a sub-lethal cold shock decreased its resistance to (+)-limonene. Although no sub-lethal injury was detected in the cell envelopes after exposure to (+)-limonene by the selective-plating technique, the uptake of propidium iodide by inactivated E. coli BJ4 cells pointed out these structures as important targets in the mechanism of action. Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Microspectroscopy (ATR-IRMS) allowed identification of altered E. coli BJ4 structures after (+)-limonene treatments as a function of the treatment pH: β-sheet proteins at pH 4.0 and phosphodiester bonds at pH 7.0. The increased sensitivity to (+)-limonene observed at pH 4.0 in an E. coli MC4100 lptD4213 mutant with an increased outer membrane permeability along with the identification of altered β-sheet proteins by ATR-IRMS indicated the importance of this structure in the mechanism of action of (+)-limonene. The study of mechanism of inactivation by (+)-limonene led to the design of a synergistic combined process with heat for the inactivation of the pathogen E. coli O157:H7 in fruit juices. These results show the potential of (+)-limonene in food preservation, either acting alone or in combination with lethal heat treatments."

https://openalex.org/W2045104704,"The lipin gene family encodes a class of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatases involved in the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and triglycerides. Unlike other enzymes in the Kennedy pathway, lipins are not integral membrane proteins, and they need to translocate from the cytosol to intracellular membranes to participate in glycerolipid synthesis. The movement of lipin 1 within the cell is closely associated with its phosphorylation status. Although cellular analyses have demonstrated that highly phosphorylated lipin 1 is enriched in the cytosol and dephosphorylated lipin 1 is found on membranes, the effects of phosphorylation on lipin 1 activity and binding to membranes has not been recapitulated in vitro. Herein we describe a new biochemical assay for lipin 1 using mixtures of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylethanolamine that reflects its physiological activity and membrane interaction. This depends on our observation that lipin 1 binding to PA in membranes is highly responsive to the electrostatic charge of PA. The studies presented here demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates the ability of the polybasic domain of lipin 1 to recognize di-anionic PA and identify mTOR as a crucial upstream signaling component regulating lipin 1 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate how phosphorylation of lipin 1 together with pH and membrane phospholipid composition play important roles in the membrane association of lipin 1 and thus the regulation of its enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2099002964,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by neurodegeneration marked by loss of synapses and spines associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Accumulating amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in brain is linked to neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in AD. Here, we identify β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) that mediates Aβ-induced tau pathology. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 1-year-old transgenic mice with human familial mutant genes of presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor protein (PS1/APP), the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 Ser-262 and Thr-181, and the protein kinases including JNK, GSK3α/β, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is increased significantly. Deletion of the β2AR gene in PS1/APP mice greatly decreases the phosphorylation of these proteins. Further analysis reveals that in primary PFC neurons, Aβ signals through a β2AR-PKA-JNK pathway, which is responsible for most of the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 and Ser-262 and a significant portion of phosphorylation at Thr-181. Aβ also induces a β2AR-dependent arrestin-ERK1/2 activity that does not participate in phosphorylation of tau. However, inhibition of the activity of MEK, an upstream enzyme of ERK1/2, partially blocks Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation at Thr-181. The density of dendritic spines and synapses is decreased in the deep layer of the PFC of 1-year-old PS1/APP mice, and the mice exhibit impairment of learning and memory in a novel object recognition paradigm. Deletion of the β2AR gene ameliorates pathological effects in these senile PS1/APP mice.

Other metabolic pathways believed to augment insulin secretion have yet to be fully elucidated. To study metabolic changes during GSIS, liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry was used to determine levels of 87 metabolites temporally following a change in glucose from 3 to 10 mm glucose and in response to increasing concentrations of glucose in the INS-1 832/13 β-cell line. U-[13C]Glucose was used to probe flux in specific metabolic pathways. Results include a rapid increase in ATP/ADP, anaplerotic tricarboxylic acid cycle flux, and increases in the malonyl CoA pathway, support prevailing theories of GSIS. Novel findings include that aspartate used for anaplerosis does not derive from the glucose fuel added to stimulate insulin secretion, glucose flux into glycerol-3-phosphate, and esterification of long chain CoAs resulting in rapid consumption of long chain CoAs and de novo generation of phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Further, novel metabolites with potential roles in GSIS such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (ZMP), GDP-mannose, and farnesyl pyrophosphate were found to be rapidly altered following glucose exposure.

https://openalex.org/W1999532467,"The TGF-β pathway plays an important role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 18- to 25-nucleotide, small, noncoding RNAs that function by regulating gene expression. A number of miRNAs have been found to be regulated by the TGF-β pathway. However, the role of endothelial miRNAs in the TGF-β-mediated control of angiogenesis is still largely unknown. Here we investigated the regulation of endothelial microRNA-29a (miR-29a) by TGF-β signaling and the potential role of miR-29a in angiogenesis. MiR-29a was directly up-regulated by TGF-β/Smad4 signaling in human and mice endothelial cells. In a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, miR-29a overexpression promoted the formation of new blood vessels, and miR-29a suppression completely blocked TGF-β1-stimulated angiogenesis. Consistently, miR-29a overexpression increased tube formation and migration in endothelial cultures. Mechanistically, miR-29a directly targeted the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in endothelial cells, leading to activation of the AKT pathway. PTEN knockdown recapitulated the role of miR-29a in endothelial migration, whereas AKT inhibition completely attenuated the stimulating role of miR-29a in angiogenesis. Taken together, these results reveal a crucial role of a TGF-β-regulated miRNA in promoting angiogenesis by targeting PTEN to stimulate AKT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2011691419,"Tumor-associated macrophages have been shown to promote tumor growth. They may have an obligatory function in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis through release of inflammatory mediators. Their presence in ovarian cancer has been correlated with poor prognosis in these patients. The human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 (hCAP18)/LL-37 was originally identified as an effector molecule of the innate immune system. It is released by innate immune cells, such as macrophages, to combat microorganisms. Previous studies have characterized the hCAP18/LL-37 as a growth factor that has been shown to promote ovarian tumor progression. However, the role hCAP18/LL-37 has in macrophage-promoted ovarian tumor development and how its expression is controlled in this context remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in co-culture experiments of macrophages and ovarian cancer cells a significant increase in the in vitro proliferation and invasiveness of the tumor cells is observed. These enhanced growth and invasion properties correlated with hCAP18/LL-37 induction. HCAP18/LL-37 expression was diminished by addition of two neutralizing antibodies, TLR2 or TLR6, as well as Cyp27B1 or VDR inhibitors. Furthermore, either the TLR2 or TLR6 antibody reduced vitamin D3 signaling and tumor cell progression in vitro. Addition of Cyp27B1 or VDR inhibitors abrogated TLR2/6 activation-induced expression of hCAP18/LL-37 in macrophages. Knockdown of tumor-produced versican V1 by RNAi in these tumor cells led to a decreased induction of hCAP18/LL-37 in macrophages. Versican V1 knockdown also inhibited TLR2 and vitamin D3 signaling, as well as growth and invasiveness of these tumor cells in the in vitro co-culture. In summary, we have found that versican V1 enhances hCAP18/LL-37 expression in macrophages through activation of TLR2 and subsequent vitamin D-dependent mechanisms which promote ovarian tumor progression in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2055319601,"The androgen receptor (AR) is essential for diverse aspects of prostate development and function. Molecular mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PC) cells redirect AR signaling to genes that primarily support growth are unclear. A systematic search for critical AR-tethering proteins led to ELK1, an ETS transcription factor of the ternary complex factor subfamily. Although genetically redundant, ELK1 was obligatory for AR-dependent growth and clonogenic survival in both hormone-dependent PC and castration-recurrent PC cells but not for AR-negative cell growth. AR required ELK1 to up-regulate a major subset of its target genes that was strongly and primarily enriched for cell growth functions. AR functioned as a coactivator of ELK1 by association through its A/B domain, bypassing the classical mechanism of ELK1 activation by phosphorylation and without inducing ternary complex target genes. The ELK1-AR synergy per se was ligand-independent, although it required ligand for nuclear localization of AR as targeting the AR A/B domain to the nucleus recapitulated the action of hormone; accordingly, Casodex was a poor antagonist of the synergy. ELK3, the closest substitute for ELK1 in structure/function and genome recognition, did not interact with AR. ELK1 thus directs selective and sustained gene induction that is a substantial and critical component of growth signaling by AR in PC cells. The ELK1-AR interaction offers a functionally tumor-selective drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2087211233,"The retrovirus restriction factor SAMHD1 is the first identified mammalian dNTP triphosphohydrolase that is highly expressed in human myeloid lineage cells and CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Although SAMHD1 expression is variable in human cell lines and tissue types, mechanisms underlying SAMHD1 gene regulation have not been defined. Recent studies showed that SAMHD1 is highly expressed in human primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, but not in some CD4(+) T cell lines. Here, we report that SAMHD1 expression varies among four CD4(+) T cell lines and is transcriptionally regulated. Cloning and sequence analysis of the human SAMHD1 promoter revealed a CpG island that is methylated in CD4(+) T cell lines (such as Jurkat and Sup-T1), resulting in transcriptional repression of SAMHD1. We also found that the SAMHD1 promoter is unmethylated in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, which express high levels of SAMHD1, indicating a direct correlation between the methylation of the SAMHD1 promoter and transcriptional repression. SAMHD1 expression was induced in CD4(+) T cell lines by blocking DNA methyltransferase activity, suggesting that promoter methylation is one of the key epigenetic mechanisms by which SAMHD1 expression is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1974581269,"The enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPARγ in insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and plays an important role in β-oxidation in these tissues. In macrophages, however, ACSL1 mediates inflammatory effects without significant effects on β-oxidation. Thus, the function of ACSL1 varies in different tissues. We therefore investigated the signals and signal transduction pathways resulting in ACSL1 induction in macrophages as well as the consequences of ACSL1 deficiency for phospholipid turnover in LPS-activated macrophages. LPS, Gram-negative bacteria, IFN-γ, and TNFα all induce ACSL1 expression in macrophages, whereas PPAR agonists do not. LPS-induced ACSL1 expression is dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its adaptor protein TRIF (Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1) but does not require the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) arm of TLR4 signaling; nor does it require STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) for maximal induction. Furthermore, ACSL1 deletion attenuates phospholipid turnover in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Thus, the regulation and biological function of ACSL1 in macrophages differ markedly from that in insulin target tissues. These results suggest that ACSL1 may have an important role in the innate immune response. Further, these findings illustrate an interesting paradigm in which the same enzyme, ACSL1, confers distinct biological effects in different cell types, and these disparate functions are paralleled by differences in the pathways that regulate its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2046846689,"The topological and functional organization of the two isoforms of the small subunits of human serine palmitoyltransferase (hssSPTs) that activate the catalytic hLCB1/hLCB2 heterodimer was investigated. A variety of experimental approaches placed the N termini of the ssSPTs in the cytosol, their C termini in the lumen, and showed that they contain a single transmembrane domain. Deletion analysis revealed that the ability to activate the heterodimer is contained in a conserved 33-amino acid core domain that has the same membrane topology as the full-length protein. In combination with analysis of isoform chimera and site-directed mutagenesis, a single amino acid residue in this core (Met(25) in ssSPTa and Val(25) in ssSPTb) was identified which confers specificity for palmitoyl- or stearoyl-CoA, respectively, in both yeast and mammalian cells. This same residue also determines which isoform is a better activator of a mutant heterodimer, hLCB1(S331F)/hLCB2a, which has increased basal SPT activity and decreased amino acid substrate selectivity. This suggests that the role of the ssSPTs is to increase SPT activity without compromising substrate specificity. In addition, the observation that the C-terminal domains of ssSPTa and ssSPTb, which are highly conserved within each subfamily but are the most divergent regions between isoform subfamilies, are not required for activation of the heterodimer or for acyl-CoA selectivity suggests that the ssSPTs have additional roles that remain to be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2078861968,"Integrins exert a variety of cellular functions as heterodimers of two transmembrane subunits named α and β. Integrin βν, a β-subunit of Drosophila integrin, is involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and bacteria. Here, we searched for an α-subunit that forms a complex and cooperates with βν. Examinations of RNAi-treated animals suggested that αPS3, but not any of four other α-subunits, is required for the effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila embryos. The mutation of αPS3-encoding scb, deficiency, insertion of P-element, or alteration of nucleotide sequences, brought about a reduction in the level of phagocytosis. The defect in phagocytosis by deficiency was reverted by the forced expression of scb. Furthermore, flies in which the expression of both αPS3 and βν was inhibited by RNAi showed a level of phagocytosis almost equal to that observed in flies with RNAi for either subunit alone. A loss of αPS3 also decreased the activity of larval hemocytes in the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, a co-immunoprecipitation analysis using a Drosophila cell line treated with a chemical cross-linker suggested a physical association between αPS3 and βν.

Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (emerald ash borer) is a serious invasive insect pest that has killed tens of millions of North American ash (Fraxinus spp) trees and threatens the very existence of the genus Fraxinus. Adult A. planipennis are attracted to host volatiles and conspecifics; however, to date no molecular knowledge exists on olfaction in A. planipennis. Hence, we undertook an antennae-specific transcriptomic study to identify the repertoire of odor processing genes involved in A. planipennis olfaction. Methodology and Principal Findings We acquired 139,085 Roche/454 GS FLX transcriptomic reads that were assembled into 30,615 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs), including 3,249 isotigs and 27,366 non-isotigs (contigs and singletons). Intriguingly, the majority of the A. planipennis antennal transcripts (59.72%) did not show similarity with sequences deposited in the non-redundant database of GenBank, potentially representing novel genes. Functional annotation and KEGG analysis revealed pathways associated with signaling and detoxification. Several odor processing genes (9 odorant binding proteins, 2 odorant receptors, 1 sensory neuron membrane protein and 134 odorant/xenobiotic degradation enzymes, including cytochrome P450s, glutathione-S-transferases; esterases, etc.) putatively involved in olfaction processes were identified. Quantitative PCR of candidate genes in male and female A. planipennis in different developmental stages revealed developmental- and sex-biased expression patterns. Conclusions and Significance The antennal ESTs derived from A. planipennis constitute a rich molecular resource for the identification of genes potentially involved in the olfaction process of A. planipennis. These findings should help in understanding the processing of antennally-active compounds (e.g. 7-epi-sesquithujene) previously identified in this serious invasive pest."

Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is critical for cell growth and proliferation. Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain) is one of the most important upstream regulators of mTORC1. Here, we attempted to clarify the role of Rheb in the heart using cardiac-specific Rheb-deficient mice (Rheb(-/-)). Rheb(-/-) mice died from postnatal day 8 to 10. The heart-to-body weight ratio, an index of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in Rheb(-/-) was lower than that in the control (Rheb(+/+)) at postnatal day 8. The cell surface area of cardiomyocytes isolated from the mouse hearts increased from postnatal days 5 to 8 in Rheb(+/+) mice but not in Rheb(-/-) mice. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that sarcomere maturation was impaired in Rheb(-/-) hearts during the neonatal period. Rheb(-/-) hearts exhibited no difference in the phosphorylation level of S6 or 4E-BP1, downstream of mTORC1 at postnatal day 3 but showed attenuation at postnatal day 5 or 8 compared with the control. Polysome analysis revealed that the mRNA translation activity decreased in Rheb(-/-) hearts at postnatal day 8. Furthermore, ablation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in Rheb(-/-) mice improved mRNA translation, cardiac hypertrophic growth, sarcomere maturation, and survival. Thus, Rheb-dependent mTORC1 activation becomes essential for cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth after early postnatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2005839192,"Diaminopimelate (DAP) epimerase is involved in the biosynthesis of meso-DAP and lysine, which are important precursors for the synthesis of peptidoglycan, housekeeping proteins, and virulence factors in bacteria. Accordingly, DAP epimerase is a promising antimicrobial target. Previous studies report that DAP epimerase exists as a monomeric enzyme. However, we show using analytical ultracentrifugation, X-ray crystallography, and enzyme kinetic analyses that DAP epimerase from Escherichia coli exists as a functional dimer in solution and the crystal state. Furthermore, the 2.0-Å X-ray crystal structure of the E. coli DAP epimerase dimer shows for the first time that the enzyme exists in an open, active conformation. The importance of dimerization was subsequently probed by using site-directed mutagenesis to generate a monomeric mutant (Y268A). Our studies show that Y268A is catalytically inactive, thus demonstrating that dimerization of DAP epimerase is essential for catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the DAP epimerase monomer is inherently more flexible than the dimer, suggesting that dimerization optimizes protein dynamics to support function. Our findings offer insight into the development of novel antimicrobial agents targeting the dimeric antibiotic target DAP epimerase."

https://openalex.org/W2014454185,"This study was performed to gain insights into novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of heatstroke. The central nervous system regulates peripheral immune responses via the vagus nerve, the primary neural component of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reportedly suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine release in several models of inflammatory disease. Here, we evaluated whether electrical VNS attenuates severe heatstroke, which induces a systemic inflammatory response. Anesthetized rats were subjected to heat stress (41.5°C for 30 minutes) with/without electrical VNS. In the VNS-treated group, the cervical vagus nerve was stimulated with constant voltage (10 V, 2 ms, 5 Hz) for 20 minutes immediately after completion of heat stress. Sham-operated animals underwent the same procedure without stimulation under a normothermic condition. Seven-day mortality improved significantly in the VNS-treated group versus control group. Electrical VNS significantly suppressed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the serum 6 hours after heat stress. Simultaneously, the increase of soluble thrombomodulin and E-selectin following heat stress was also suppressed by VNS treatment, suggesting its protective effect on endothelium. Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue preparations obtained 6 hours after heat stress revealed that VNS treatment attenuated infiltration of inflammatory (CD11b-positive) cells in lung and spleen. Interestingly, most cells with increased CD11b positivity in response to heat stress did not express α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the spleen. These data indicate that electrical VNS modulated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway abnormalities induced by heat stress, and this protective effect was associated with improved mortality. These findings may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat severe heatstroke in the critical care setting."

The sperm surface architecture depends on correct localization of its components and highlights the importance of the sequence of the proteolytic processing of the sperm surface in the epididymal duct. The presence of several protease inhibitors from different families is consistent with the hypothesis that correctly timed epididymal protein processing is essential for proper sperm maturation. Here we show that the rat (Rattus norvegicus) epididymis-specific gene Spink13, an androgen-responsive serine protease inhibitor, could bind to the sperm acrosome region. Furthermore, knockdown of Spink13 in vivo dramatically enhanced the acrosomal exocytosis during the process of capacitation and thus led to a significant reduction in male fertility, indicating that Spink13 was essential for sperm maturation. We conclude that blockade of SPINK13 may provide a new putative target for post-testicular male contraceptives.

https://openalex.org/W2086978190,"Human chymotrypsin C (CTRC) is a pancreatic serine protease that regulates activation and degradation of trypsinogens and procarboxypeptidases by targeting specific cleavage sites within their zymogen precursors. In cleaving these regulatory sites, which are characterized by multiple flanking acidic residues, CTRC shows substrate specificity that is distinct from that of other isoforms of chymotrypsin and elastase. Here, we report the first crystal structure of active CTRC, determined at 1.9-Å resolution, revealing the structural basis for binding specificity. The structure shows human CTRC bound to the small protein protease inhibitor eglin c, which binds in a substrate-like manner filling the S6-S5' subsites of the substrate binding cleft. Significant binding affinity derives from burial of preferred hydrophobic residues at the P1, P4, and P2' positions of CTRC, although acidic P2' residues can also be accommodated by formation of an interfacial salt bridge. Acidic residues may also be specifically accommodated in the P6 position. The most unique structural feature of CTRC is a ring of intense positive electrostatic surface potential surrounding the primarily hydrophobic substrate binding site. Our results indicate that long-range electrostatic attraction toward substrates of concentrated negative charge governs substrate discrimination, which explains CTRC selectivity in regulating active digestive enzyme levels."

Changes in the hyperpolarized [1-13C]lactate signals observed in vivo following injection of pre-polarized [1-13C]pyruvate has recently been shown to be a marker for tumor progression or early treatment response. In this study, the feasibility of using 13C metabolic imaging with [1-13C]pyruvate to detect early radiation treatment response in a breast cancer xenograft model was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Significant decreases in hyperpolarized [1-13C]lactate relative to [1-13C]pyruvate were observed in MDA-MB-231 tumors 96 hrs following a single dose of ionizing radiation. Histopathologic data from the treated tumors showed higher cellular apoptosis and senescence; and changes in the expression of membrane monocarboxylate transporters and lactate dehydrogenase B were also observed. Hyperpolarized 13C metabolic imaging may be a promising new tool to develop novel and adaptive therapeutic regimens for patients undergoing RT."
https://openalex.org/W2076611652,"A putative driver of global amphibian decline is the panzootic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). While Bd has been documented across continental Africa, its distribution in West Africa remains ambiguous. We tested 793 West African amphibians (one caecilian and 61 anuran species) for the presence of Bd. The samples originated from seven West African countries - Bénin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone - and were collected from a variety of habitats, ranging from lowland rainforests to montane forests, montane grasslands to humid and dry lowland savannahs. The species investigated comprised various life-history strategies, but we focused particularly on aquatic and riparian species. We used diagnostic PCR to screen 656 specimen swabs and histology to analyse 137 specimen toe tips. All samples tested negative for Bd, including a widespread habitat generalist Hoplobatrachus occipitalis which is intensively traded on the West African food market and thus could be a potential dispersal agent for Bd. Continental fine-grained (30 arc seconds) environmental niche models suggest that Bd should have a broad distribution across West Africa that includes most of the regions and habitats that we surveyed. The surprising apparent absence of Bd in West Africa indicates that the Dahomey Gap may have acted as a natural barrier. Herein we highlight the importance of this Bd-free region of the African continent - especially for the long-term conservation of several threatened species depending on fast flowing forest streams (Conraua alleni (“Vulnerable”) and Petropedetes natator (“Near Threatened”)) as well as the “Critically Endangered” viviparous toad endemic to the montane grasslands of Mount Nimba (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis)."

Here, protein engineering was used to expand the repertoire of available immunoglobulin binding proteins via improvement of the binding strength between the widely used staphylococcal protein A-derived Z domain and the important immunoglobulin isotype mouse IgG1 (mIgG1). Addressing seven positions in the 58-residue three-helix bundle Z domain by single or double amino acid substitutions, a total of 170 variants were individually constructed, produced in E. coli and tested for binding to a set of mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The best variant, denoted ZF5I corresponding to a Phe to Ile substitution at position 5, showed a typical ten-fold higher affinity than the wild-type as determined by biosensor technology. Eight amino acid positions in the ZF5I variant were separately mutated to cysteine for incorporation of a photoactivable maleimide-benzophenone (MBP) group as a probe for site-specific photoconjugation to Fc of mIgG1, The best photocoupling efficiency to mIgG1 Fc was seen when the MBP group was coupled to Cys at position 32, resulting in adduct formation to more than 60% of all heavy chains, with no observable non-selective conjugation to the light chains. A similar coupling yield was obtained for a panel of 19 different mIgG1 mAbs, indicating a general characteristic. To exemplify functionalization of a mIgG1 antibody via site-specific biotinylation, the ZF5I-Q32C-MBP protein was first biotinylated using an amine reactive reagent and subsequently photoconjugated to an anti-human interferon-gamma mIgG1 mAb. When comparing the specific antigen binding ability of the probe-biotinylated mAb to that of the directly biotinylated mAb, a significantly higher bioactivity was observed for the sample biotinylated using the ZF5I-Q32C-MBP probe. This result indicates that the use of a site-specific and affinity probe-mediated conjugation strategy can result in antibody reagents with increased assay sensitivity."

Smad proteins are the basic intracellular transducers mediating the signal cascade after TGF-β family ligands bind to their cognate receptors. They are classified into three groups, receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad), common partner Smad (Co-Smad), and inhibitory Smad (I-Smad). Smad1, -5, -8 are R-Smad activated by the BMP subfamily; whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-β, activin, and Nodal. Upon activation, R-Smad are phosphorylated, form a complex with Smad4, accumulate in the nucleus, and consequently modulate the expression of target genes. Smad6 and Smad7 are components of the inhibitory Smad family that negatively regulate the signaling of TGF-β family members. Smad6 preferentially inhibits BMP signaling, whereas Smad7 antagonizes both TGF-β/activin- and BMP-mediated signaling by interfering with R-Smad binding to the receptors and the phosphorylation/activation of R-Smad (21Heldin C.H.

However, currently it is unknown whether Smad7 affects eye development. In this study, we found that deletion of Smad7 led to multiple defects in eye development including dysregulation of lens differentiation, alteration of periocular mesenchyme, disruption of the retina patterning, and changes in the optic stalk. Smad7 may trigger the proper temporal and spatial change of the BMP level for the developing eye, meanwhile regulating SHH signaling at certain stages. Here, we have shown that Smad7 is essential for the timely regulation of the distinct signaling pathways during embryonic eye development.

Mice carrying a null allele of Smad7 have been described previously (26Chen Q. Chen H. Zheng D. Kuang C. Fang H. Zou B. Zhu W. Bu G. Jin T. Wang Z. Zhang X. Chen J. Field L.J. Rubart M. Shou W. Chen Y. Smad7 is required for the development and function of the heart.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 292-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mice were crossed with the C57BL/6 strain for at least six generations. The presence of the Smad7-null allele was detected by primer 1 (5′-CAGAGCAGCCGATTGTCTGTTGTGC-3′) and primer 2 (5′-ACTTGGACTGGATTGATGTACCAGG-3′), resulting in a 500-bp PCR product. The wild type allele was detected by primers A and B (5′-TGTCCCGCTTGTCTTGTTCTTTGAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGACTCTCGTTTCCTGTCTTCG-3′, respectively), giving rise to a 154-bp product. To define the embryonic stage, noon of the day that a vaginal plug was found was recorded as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). The antibodies used in immunohistochemistry were as follows. The antibody for phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 was from Millipore (Billerica, MA), for Smad7 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, for phosphorylated Smad2 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), for BrdU from Sigma-Aldrich, and for TUJ1 from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. The TSATM Plus fluorescence system was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the Vectastain ABC kit was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Mouse embryos were harvested by cesarean section and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After dehydration through a series of graded ethanol baths, the embryos were infiltrated, embedded in wax, and then sectioned at 10 μm. The sections were dehydrated and subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Antibody staining was performed as described previously (33Pan Y. Woodbury A. Esko J.D. Grobe K. Zhang X. Heparan sulfate biosynthetic gene Ndst1 is required for FGF signaling in early lens development.Development. 2006; 133: 4933-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sample slides were heated in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) under sub-boiling conditions for 30 min. 3% H2O2 was used to quench endogenous peroxidase for 10 min. The section was blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight in a humidified chamber. The sections were treated sequentially with a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and ABC reagent for the next day and subjected to color reaction with a diaminobenzidine solution (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich). The image was visualized with an Olympus BX51 microscope. For BrdU staining, pregnant mice were injected with BrdU 2 h prior to sacrifice at 0.1 mg/1 gram body weight. The embryos were collected and treated as described above. The section was retrieved with citrate buffer followed by treatment with 1 n HCl for 90 min and then blocked and incubated in anti-BrdU antibody overnight. The secondary antibody was applied to the section, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). Smad7 staining was performed according to the instruction of the TSATM Plus fluorescence system. The images were observed under an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope. RNA whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out according to the standard protocol (34Zhang X. Friedman A. Heaney S. Purcell P. Maas R.L. Meis homeoproteins directly regulate Pax6 during vertebrate lens morphogenesis.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RNA in situ hybridization was performed on sections as described (35Pan Y. Carbe C. Powers A. Zhang E.E. Esko J.D. Grobe K. Feng G.S. Zhang X. Bud specific N-sulfation of heparan sulfate regulates Shp2-dependent FGF signaling during lacrimal gland induction.Development. 2008; 135: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight, embedded in OCT compound, and then sectioned at 10 μm on a Leica CM3050S cryostat. The RNA probes were denatured and applied to the cryosections in a humidified chamber at 65 °C for overnight incubation. The slides were then rinsed in wash buffer (1× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween 20) at 65 °C and MABT buffer (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature and then blocked in 20% heat-inactivated sheep serum, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) in MABT buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated in an anti-DIG antibody (Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for overnight and then washed in MABT buffer and stained with NBT/BCIP solution (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The following probes were used in the study: Sox2, Bmp7, shh, and Bmp4 (from Xin Zhang, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis), Pax2 (nucleotides 210–834, GenBankTM accession number NM_011037), Pax6 (nucleotides 1330–2074, GenBankTM accession number NM_001244202), Fgf15 (nucleotides 43–848, GenBankTM accession number NM_008003), Vax2 (nucleotides 295–933, GenBankTM accession number NM_011912), Vax1 (nucleotides 236–907, GenBankTM accession number NM_009501), Mitf (nucleotides 209–921, GenBankTM accession number NM_008601), Cx40 (nucleotides 899–1770, GenBankTM accession number NM_008121), Rx (nucleotides 404–1150, GenBankTM accession number NM_013833), Math5 (nucleotides 1–450, GenBankTM accession number NM_016864), Brn3b (727–1720, GenBankTM accession number NM_001039353), α-crystallin (313–1034, GenBankTM accession number NM_013501), β-crystallin (19–804, GenBankTM accession number NM_023695), γ-crystallin (34–605, GenBankTM accession number NM_007776), and Tbx5 (11Chapman D.L. Garvey N. Hancock S. Alexiou M. Agulnik S.I. Gibson-Brown J.J. Cebra-Thomas J. Bollag R.J. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Expression of the T-box family genes, Tbx1–Tbx5, during early mouse development.Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). TUNEL assays were performed with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, cryosections were processed for antigen retrieval as described above, incubated with blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3% BSA, 20% serum) for 30 min at room temperature and then with TUNEL reaction mixture for 2 h at 37 °C. The signal was detected under an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test for the analysis of cell apoptosis and cell proliferation, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determining the potential role of Smad7 during eye development, we examined the expression of Smad7 in the developing eyes at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1A). Smad7 transcript was detectable in the eye through E10.5 to E14.5 by RT-PCR but not in Smad7 null mice (data not shown). At E10.5, Smad7 protein was detected in the distal portion of the optic vesicle. Smad7 was strongly localized in the lens placode and the adjacent surface ectoderm. The signal was also visible in the surrounding mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1A, arrow). At E11.5, although still expressed in the lens vesicle, Smad7 protein expanded into the middle neural retina. At E14.5, Smad7 was distributed ubiquitously in the whole retina. Meanwhile, in the lens, Smad7 protein was restricted to the epithelial cells and the equatorial zone (Fig. 1A). Smad7 expression was present in the whole retina until at least the first day of birth (data not shown). These results, collectively, suggest that Smad7 is expressed in various eye regions during embryonic development. We next investigated the eye phenotype with the embryos that had homozygous deletion of the Smad7 gene as reported previously (26Chen Q. Chen H. Zheng D. Kuang C. Fang H. Zou B. Zhu W. Bu G. Jin T. Wang Z. Zhang X. Chen J. Field L.J. Rubart M. Shou W. Chen Y. Smad7 is required for the development and function of the heart.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 292-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The eye defect was detected first at E11.5, when RPE in the wild type embryos was well developed with only the optic fissure open on the ventral side. In contrast, the pigmentation in the Smad7-deleted embryos was overgrown in the dorsal region but absent on the ventral side (Fig. 1B, left panels). Normally, the optic fissures are closed at the ventral side at E12.5, but the optic fissure remained open in Smad7 mutant embryos even at E14.5 and pointed toward the ventral temporal direction (Fig. 1B, middle panels). At E18.5, Smad7 null embryos exhibited various degree of microphthalmia, with 50% of them appearing as unilateral or bilateral coloboma (4 of 8 embryos at E18.5) (Fig. 1B, right panels). A histologic examination of the transverse sections at E14.5 revealed that the pigmentation was invaded into the optic nerve in the mutant embryos (Fig. 1C, second panel), whereas discontinuity was observed at the distal region of the retina (Fig. 1C, fourth panel). In severe cases in Smad7-deleted embryos, the lens was completely absent (Fig. 1C, third panel). We also observed persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, a dense cell membrane between the lens and the retina in Smad7 mutant embryos (Fig. 1C, fourth panel). Collectively, these results indicate that Smad7 is required for eye development in mice. It is noteworthy that although Smad7 was expressed in the 129sv mice and shared a pattern similar to that of the C57BL/6 mouse (data not shown), the eye abnormality in Smad7 null embryos was distinct when Smad7-deficient mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 mouse strain but was barely seen on the 129/FVB hybrid background (data not shown). As deletion of Smad7 is associated with defects in eye development, we next addressed whether alterations in cell apoptosis and proliferation may underlie the observed defects. A TUNEL assay revealed cell apoptosis in the optic vesicle at E10.5 (Fig. 2A). The number of apoptotic cells in the retina was significantly elevated in Smad7-deleted embryos as compared with the controls (Fig. 2A). At the same time, we also noticed obvious cell death in POM in Smad7 mutant embryos (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, we assessed the cell proliferation rate by BrdU incorporation assay. We found that fewer BrdU-positive cells were detected in both the retina and lens in Smad7 mutants than in the wild type controls (Fig. 2B). However, no significant change in the cell proliferation profile was found in the mesenchyma around the eye (data not shown). At the same time, lens pitting was found to be reduced in the mutant embryos in comparison with the controls (Fig. 2B). Based on these data, we postulate that the decreased eye size observed in Smad7-depleted embryos was mainly because of alterations in cell apoptosis and proliferation during eye development. BMP signals are important for the induction and subsequent differentiation of the lens (8Furuta Y. Hogan B.L. BMP4 is essential for lens induction in the mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3764-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Wawersik S. Purcell P. Rauchman M. Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J.

Loss of maternal Smad5 in zebrafish embryos affects patterning and morphogenesis of optic primordia.Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test the potential role of Smad7 in the lens formation, we examined whether the loss of Smad7 would affect the induction and differentiation of lens. Pax6 and Sox2 function cooperatively as activation factors for the lens induction. It has been reported that BMP4 up-regulates Sox2 in the prospective lens ectoderm, whereas BMP7 is upstream of both genes during lens induction (8Furuta Y. Hogan B.L. BMP4 is essential for lens induction in the mouse embryo.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3764-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Wawersik S. Purcell P. Rauchman M. Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J. Maas R. BMP7 acts in murine lens placode development.Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In Smad7 mutant mice, we did not observe any change in Pax6 and Sox2 (Fig. 3, A–D), indicating that lens induction was not affected by Smad7 loss. However, Prox1, a gene implicated in differentiation of the primary lens cells (36Wigle J.T. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Oliver G. Prox1 function is crucial for mouse lens-fibre elongation.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), was obviously down-regulated in Smad7 null mice (Fig. 3, E and F). Consistently, the lens differentiation markers, α-, β-, and γ-crystallin, were all dramatically reduced in Smad7 mutants at E12.5 (Fig. 3, G–L). Consistently, we also observed that the elongation of lens fiber cells was defective in the mutant mice (Fig. 3, G–L). All of these data suggest that Smad7 is not required for lens induction but is essential for lens differentiation. It is known that POM affects differentiation of the optic neuroepithelium and anterior ocular tissue (19Cvekl A. Tamm E.R.

Reh T.A. Extraocular mesenchyme patterns the optic vesicle during early eye development in the embryonic chick.Development. 2000; 127: 4599-4609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Noticing the unusually increased rate of cell death in POM in Smad7 mutant embryos (Fig. 2A), we investigated whether morphogenesis of the periocular mesenchyme would be affected by Smad7 deletion. We investigated the expression of Pitx2, as it is crucial for development of neural crest-derived periocular mesenchyme (38Evans A.L. Gage P.J.

https://openalex.org/W1975557717,"Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a large metalloproteinase specifically cleaving insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins, causing increased IGF bioavailability and, hence, local regulation of IGF receptor activation. We have identified two highly conserved zebrafish homologs of the human PAPP-A gene. Expression of zebrafish Papp-a, one of the two paralogs, begins during gastrulation and persists throughout the first week of development, and analyses demonstrate highly conserved patterns of expression between adult zebrafish, humans, and mice. We show that the specific knockdown of zebrafish papp-a limits the developmental rate beginning during gastrulation without affecting the normal patterning of the embryo. This phenotype is different from those resulting from deficiency of Igf receptor or ligand in zebrafish, suggesting a function of Papp-a outside of the Igf system. Biochemical analysis of recombinant zebrafish Papp-a demonstrates conservation of proteolytic activity, specificity, and the intrinsic regulatory mechanism. However, in vitro transcribed mRNA, which encodes a proteolytically inactive Papp-a mutant, recues the papp-a knockdown phenotype as efficiently as wild-type Papp-a. Thus, the developmental phenotype of papp-a knockdown is not a consequence of lacking Papp-a proteolytic activity. We conclude that Papp-a possesses biological functions independent of its proteolytic activity. Our data represent the first evidence for a non-proteolytic function of PAPP-A."
https://openalex.org/W2036317814,"An x-ray study indicated that microsomal prostaglandin E synthase type 2 (mPGES2) is a heme-bound protein and catalyzes prostaglandin (PG) H2 degradation, but not PGE2 formation (Yamada, T., and Takusagawa, F. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 8414-8424). In response to the x-ray study, Watanabe et al. claimed that mPGES2 is a heme-free protein and that both the heme-free and heme-bound proteins have PGE2 synthesis activity in the presence of dithiothreitol (Watanabe, K., Ito, S., and Yamamoto, S. (2008) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 367, 782-786). To resolve the contradictory results, the heme-binding scheme of mPGES2 was further characterized in vivo and in vitro by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. A substantial amount of heme-bound mPGES2 was detected in cell extracts. The heme content in mPGES2 was increased along with an increase in Fe(3+) in the culture medium. Heme-free mPGES2 was converted to the heme-bound form by mixing it with pig liver extract, indicating that mPGES2 is capable of forming a complex with heme in mammalian cells. Heme binds to mPGES2 only in the presence of glutathione. The newly determined heme dissociation constant (2.9 nM) supports strongly that mPGES2 is a heme-bound protein in vivo. The bound heme was not dissociated by oxidation by H2O2 or reduction by glutathione or 2-mercaptoethanol. However, reduction by dithiothreitol (an artificial reducing compound) induced the bound heme to dissociate from mPGES2 and released heme-free mPGES2, which exhibited PGE2 synthesis activity in vitro. Imidazole bound to mPGES2 by stacking on the bound heme and inhibited heme oxidation by H2O2 and reduction by dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1974777405,"Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) can trigger an intense local inflammatory response at the site of infection, yet there is little specific immune response or development of immune memory. Gonococcal surface epitopes are known to undergo antigenic variation; however, this is unlikely to explain the weak immune response to infection since individuals can be re-infected by the same serotype. Previous studies have demonstrated that the colony opacity-associated (Opa) proteins on the N. gonorrhoeae surface can bind human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) on CD4+ T cells to suppress T cell activation and proliferation. Interesting in this regard, N. gonorrhoeae infection is associated with impaired HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses and with transient increases in plasma viremia in HIV-1-infected patients, suggesting that N. gonorrhoeae may also subvert immune responses to co-pathogens. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that play a key role in the induction of an adaptive immune response, we investigated the effects of N. gonorrhoeae Opa proteins on human DC activation and function. While morphological changes reminiscent of DC maturation were evident upon N. gonorrhoeae infection, we observed a marked downregulation of DC maturation marker CD83 when the gonococci expressing CEACAM1-specific OpaCEA, but not other Opa variants. Consistent with a gonococcal-induced defect in maturation, OpaCEA binding to CEACAM1 reduced the DCs’ capacity to stimulate an allogeneic T cell proliferative response. Moreover, OpaCEA-expressing N. gonorrhoeae showed the potential to impair DC-dependent development of specific adaptive immunity, since infection with OpaCEA-positive gonococci suppressed the ability of DCs to stimulate HIV-1-specific memory CTL responses. These results reveal a novel mechanism to explain why infection of N. gonorrhoeae fails to trigger an effective specific immune response or develop immune memory, and may affect the potent synergy between gonorrhea and HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2154988908,"The presentation of short viral peptide antigens by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on cell surfaces is a key step in the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which mediate the killing of pathogen-infected cells or initiate autoimmune tissue damage. HLA-B27 is a well known class I molecule that is used to study both facets of the cellular immune response. Using mass spectrometry analysis of complex HLA-bound peptide pools isolated from large amounts of HLA-B*2705(+) cells, we identified 200 naturally processed HLA-B*2705 ligands. Our analyses revealed that a change in the position (P) 2 anchor motif was detected in the 3% of HLA-B*2705 ligands identified. B*2705 class I molecules were able to bind these six GlnP2 peptides, which showed significant homology to pathogenic bacterial sequences, with a broad range of affinities. One of these ligands was able to bind with distinct conformations to HLA-B27 subtypes differentially associated with ankylosing spondylitis. These conformational differences could be sufficient to initiate autoimmune damage in patients with ankylosing spondylitis-associated subtypes. Therefore, these kinds of peptides (short, with GlnP2, and similar low affinity to all HLA-B27 subtypes tested but with unlike conformations in differentially ankylosing spondylitis-associated subtypes) must not be excluded from future researches involving potential arthritogenic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1973783024,"The direct trophic links between mammalian herbivores and plant-dwelling insects have been practically ignored. Insects are ubiquitous on plants consumed by mammalian herbivores and are thus likely to face the danger of being incidentally ingested by a grazing mammal. A few studies have shown that some herbivorous hemipterans are able to avoid this peril by dropping to the ground upon detecting the heat and humidity on the mammal's breath. We hypothesized that if this risk affects the entire plant-dwelling insect community, other insects that share this habitat are expected to develop similar escape mechanisms. We assessed the ability of three species (adults and larvae) of coccinellid beetles, important aphid predators, to avoid incidental ingestion. Both larvae and adults were able to avoid incidental ingestion effectively by goats by dropping to the ground, demonstrating the importance of this behavior in grazed habitats. Remarkably, all adult beetles escaped by dropping off the plant and none used their functional wings to fly away. In controlled laboratory experiments, we found that human breath caused 60–80% of the beetles to drop. The most important component of mammalian herbivore breath in inducing adult beetles and larvae to drop was the combination of heat and humidity. The fact that the mechanism of dropping in response to mammalian breath developed in distinct insect orders and disparate life stages accentuates the importance of the direct influence of mammalian herbivores on plant-dwelling insects. This direct interaction should be given its due place when discussing trophic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2082339006,"Recent studies indicate that caspase-2 is involved in the early stages of apoptosis, particularly before the occurrence of mitochondrial damage. Here we report the important role of the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on the activity of caspase-2 upstream of mitochondria in ethanol (EtOH)-treated corneal fibroblasts. After EtOH exposure, cells produce excessive reactive oxygen species formation, p53 expression, and most importantly, caspase-2 activation. After the activation of the caspase-2, the cells exhibited hallmarks of apoptotic pathway, such as mitochondrial damage and translocation of Bax and cytochrome c, which were then followed by caspase-3 activation. By pretreating the cells with a cell-permeable, biotinylated pan-caspase inhibitor, we identified caspase-2 as an initiator caspase in EtOH-treated corneal fibroblasts. Loss of caspase-2 inhibited EtOH-induced apoptosis. We further found that caspase-2 acts upstream of mitochondria to mediate EtOH-induced apoptosis. The loss of caspase-2 significantly inhibited EtOH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, Bax translocation, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The pretreatment of CoQ10 prevented EtOH-induced caspase-2 activation and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Our data demonstrated that by blocking caspase-2 activity, CoQ10 can protect the cells from mitochondrial membrane change, apoptotic protein translocation, and apoptosis. Taken together, EtOH-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is initiated by caspase-2 activation, which is regulated by CoQ10."
https://openalex.org/W2076084660,"Background IUGR increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in later life, due to reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired adaptation of insulin secretion. In IUGR rats, development of T2DM can be prevented by neonatal administration of the GLP-1 analogue exendin-4. We therefore investigated effects of neonatal exendin-4 administration on insulin action and β-cell mass and function in the IUGR neonate in the sheep, a species with a more developed pancreas at birth. Methods Twin IUGR lambs were injected s.c. daily with vehicle (IUGR+Veh, n = 8) or exendin-4 (1 nmol.kg-1, IUGR+Ex-4, n = 8), and singleton control lambs were injected with vehicle (CON, n = 7), from d 1 to 16 of age. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were measured in vivo during treatment (d 12–14). Body composition, β-cell mass and in vitro insulin secretion of isolated pancreatic islets were measured at d 16. Principal Findings IUGR+Veh did not alter in vivo insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity or β-cell mass, but increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. Exendin-4 treatment of the IUGR lamb impaired glucose tolerance in vivo, reflecting reduced insulin sensitivity, and normalised glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. Exendin-4 also reduced neonatal growth and visceral fat accumulation in IUGR lambs, known risk factors for later T2DM. Conclusions Neonatal exendin-4 induces changes in IUGR lambs that might improve later insulin action. Whether these effects of exendin-4 lead to improved insulin action in adult life after IUGR in the sheep, as in the PR rat, requires further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2003511414,"The motor protein nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) must undergo dynamic oligomerization into filaments to perform its cellular functions. A small nonhelical region at the tail of the long coiled-coil region (tailpiece) is a common feature of all dynamically assembling myosin II proteins. This tailpiece is a key regulatory domain affecting NMII filament assembly properties and is subject to phosphorylation in vivo. We previously demonstrated that the positively charged region of the tailpiece binds to assembly-incompetent NMII-C fragments, inducing filament assembly. In the current study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which the tailpiece regulates NMII-C self-assembly. Using alanine scan, we found that specific positive and aromatic residues within the positively charged region of the tailpiece are important for inducing NMII-C filament assembly and for filament elongation. Combining peptide arrays with deletion studies allowed us to identify the tailpiece binding sites in the coiled-coil rod. Elucidation of the mechanism by which the tailpiece induces filament assembly permitted us further investigation into the role of tailpiece phosphorylation. Sedimentation and CD spectroscopy identified that phosphorylation of Thr(1957) or Thr(1960) inhibited the ability of the tailpiece to bind the coiled-coil rod and to induce NMII-C filament formation. This study provides molecular insight into the role of specific residues within the NMII-C tailpiece that are responsible for shifting the oligomeric equilibrium of NMII-C toward filament assembly and determining its morphology."
