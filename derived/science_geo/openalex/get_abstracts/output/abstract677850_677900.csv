https://openalex.org/W3183475563,"Abstract Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure 1 . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold 2 , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3184558555,"Circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging biomarker for many cancers, but the limited sensitivity of current detection methods reduces its utility for diagnosing minimal residual disease. Here we describe phased variant enrichment and detection sequencing (PhasED-seq), a method that uses multiple somatic mutations in individual DNA fragments to improve the sensitivity of ctDNA detection. Leveraging whole-genome sequences from 2,538 tumors, we identify phased variants and their associations with mutational signatures. We show that even without molecular barcodes, the limits of detection of PhasED-seq outperform prior methods, including duplex barcoding, allowing ctDNA detection in the ppm range in participant samples. We profiled 678 specimens from 213 participants with B cell lymphomas, including serial cell-free DNA samples before and during therapy for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In participants with undetectable ctDNA after two cycles of therapy using a next-generation sequencing-based approach termed cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing, an additional 25% have ctDNA detectable by PhasED-seq and have worse outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate the application of PhasED-seq to solid tumors."

https://openalex.org/W3184559339,"Following the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China, undergraduate students may experience psychological changes. During emergency circumstances, social support is an important factor influencing the mental health condition among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province. This study aims to find the factors associated with mental health symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted from Feb 23 to Mar 7, 2020. A total of 1278 undergraduate students from the universities located in Shaanxi province participated in this study. The mental health symptoms were measured by 12-item Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) instruments. This survey showed that females receive more social support compared to males (t = -5.046, P<0.001); males have higher-level depression symptoms (t = 5.624, P<0.001); males have higher-level anxiety symptoms (t = 6.332, P<0.001), males have higher-level stress symptoms (t = 5.58, P<0.001). This study also found participants who have low social support was negatively correlated with mental health symptoms. In Conclusion, Males and low social support were associated with having the higher level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Therefore, it is suggested that people should supply more social support for undergraduate students in Shaanxi province during COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3183230352,"Current treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often ineffective in eliminating leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which perpetuate the disease. Here, we performed a metabolic drug screen to identify LSC-specific vulnerabilities and found that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors selectively killed LSCs, while sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Treatment with KPT-9274, a NAMPT inhibitor, suppressed the conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids, a reaction catalyzed by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzyme, resulting in apoptosis of AML cells. Transcriptomic analysis of LSCs treated with KPT-9274 revealed an upregulation of sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated genes, including SCD, which conferred partial protection against NAMPT inhibitors. Inhibition of SREBP signaling with dipyridamole enhanced the cytotoxicity of KPT-9274 on LSCs in vivo. Our work demonstrates that altered lipid homeostasis plays a key role in NAMPT inhibitor-induced apoptosis and identifies NAMPT inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for targeting LSCs in AML."
https://openalex.org/W3185805993,"Gene networks have yielded numerous neurobiological insights, yet an integrated view across brain regions is lacking. We leverage RNA sequencing in 864 samples representing 12 brain regions to robustly identify 12 brain-wide, 50 cross-regional and 114 region-specific coexpression modules. Nearly 40% of genes fall into brain-wide modules, while 25% comprise region-specific modules reflecting regional biology, such as oxytocin signaling in the hypothalamus, or addiction pathways in the nucleus accumbens. Schizophrenia and autism genetic risk are enriched in brain-wide and multiregional modules, indicative of broad impact; these modules implicate neuronal proliferation and activity-dependent processes, including endocytosis and splicing, in disease pathophysiology. We find that cell-type-specific long noncoding RNA and gene isoforms contribute substantially to regional synaptic diversity and that constrained, mutation-intolerant genes are primarily enriched in neurons. We leverage these data using an omnigenic-inspired network framework to characterize how coexpression and gene regulatory networks reflect neuropsychiatric disease risk, supporting polygenic models. The authors construct brain-wide coexpression networks to characterize regional versus global features, determine if disease susceptibility maps onto regional or brain-wide processes and assess how these networks capture genetic models of disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W3183433163,"Driver mutations in genes encoding histone H3 proteins resulting in p.Lys27Met substitutions (H3-K27M) are frequent in pediatric midline brain tumors. However, the precise mechanisms by which H3-K27M causes tumor initiation remain unclear. Here, we use human hindbrain neural stem cells to model the consequences of H3.3-K27M on the epigenomic landscape in a relevant developmental context. Genome-wide mapping of epitope-tagged histone H3.3 revealed that both the wild type and the K27M mutant incorporate abundantly at pre-existing active enhancers and promoters, and to a lesser extent at Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-bound regions. At active enhancers, H3.3-K27M leads to focal H3K27ac loss, decreased chromatin accessibility and reduced transcriptional expression of nearby neurodevelopmental genes. In addition, H3.3-K27M deposition at a subset of PRC2 target genes leads to increased PRC2 and PRC1 binding and augmented transcriptional repression that can be partially reversed by PRC2 inhibitors. Our work suggests that, rather than imposing de novo transcriptional circuits, H3.3-K27M drives tumorigenesis by locking initiating cells in their pre-existing, immature epigenomic state, via disruption of PRC2 and enhancer functions. The oncohistone H3.3-K27M decreases chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac at some active enhancers and downregulates nearby neurodevelopmental genes, while increasing transcriptional repression of a subset of PRC2-bound neurodevelopment genes."
https://openalex.org/W3185661610,"Objective To evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 preventive health behaviors among adults in Mexico City and the State of Mexico. Methods and findings We conducted a cross-sectional survey from June to October 2020 through a structured, internet-based questionnaire in a non-probabilistic sample of adults &gt;18 years living in Mexico City and the State of Mexico. The independent variables included sociodemographic and clinical factors; health literacy; access to COVID-19 information; and perception of COVID-19 risk and of preventive measures’ effectiveness. The dependent variable was COVID-19 preventive health behaviors, defined as the number of preventive actions adopted by participants. The data were analyzed through multivariate negative binomial regression analysis. The survey was completed by 1,030 participants. Most participants were women (70.7%), had a high school or above level of education (98.8%), and had adequate health literacy and access to COVID-19 information. Only 18% perceived having a high susceptibility to COVID-19, though 83.8% recognized the disease’s severity and 87.1% the effectiveness of preventive measures. The median number of COVID-19 preventive actions was 13.5 (range 0–19). The factors associated with preventive health behavior were being female, of older age, a professional worker, a homemaker, or a retiree; engaging in regular physical exercise; having high health literacy and access to COVID-19 information sources; and perceiving COVID-19 as severe and preventive measures as effective. Conclusion People with high education and internet access in Mexico City and the State of Mexico reported significant engagement in COVID-19 preventive actions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W3185675546,"HUWE1 is a universal quality-control E3 ligase that marks diverse client proteins for proteasomal degradation. Although the giant HECT enzyme is an essential component of the ubiquitin–proteasome system closely linked with severe human diseases, its molecular mechanism is little understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of Nematocida HUWE1, revealing how a single E3 enzyme has specificity for a multitude of unrelated substrates. The protein adopts a remarkable snake-like structure, where the C-terminal HECT domain heads an extended alpha-solenoid body that coils in on itself and houses various protein–protein interaction modules. Our integrative structural analysis shows that this ring structure is highly dynamic, enabling the flexible HECT domain to reach protein targets presented by the various acceptor sites. Together, our data demonstrate how HUWE1 is regulated by its unique structure, adapting a promiscuous E3 ligase to selectively target unassembled orphan proteins. The full-length structure of HUWE1 reveals the bipartite organization of a giant E3 ubiquitin ligase, comprising a catalytic HECT domain and a large, ring-shaped scaffold that provides docking sites for various substrates and regulates E3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3186200314,"Two commonly used approaches to study interactions among neurons are spike count correlation, which describes pairs of neurons, and dimensionality reduction, applied to a population of neurons. Although both approaches have been used to study trial-to-trial neuronal variability correlated among neurons, they are often used in isolation and have not been directly related. We first established concrete mathematical and empirical relationships between pairwise correlation and metrics of population-wide covariability based on dimensionality reduction. Applying these insights to macaque V4 population recordings, we found that the previously reported decrease in mean pairwise correlation associated with attention stemmed from three distinct changes in population-wide covariability. Overall, our work builds the intuition and formalism to bridge between pairwise correlation and population-wide covariability and presents a cautionary tale about the inferences one can make about population activity by using a single statistic, whether it be mean pairwise correlation or dimensionality."
https://openalex.org/W3186571564,"NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces the superoxide anion radical (O2-), which has functions in both cell signaling and immune defense. NOX2 is a multimeric-protein complex consisting of several protein subunits including the GTPase Rac. NOX2 uniquely facilitates an oxidative burst, which is described by initially slow O2- production, which increases over time. The NOX2 oxidative burst is considered critical to immune defense because it enables expedited O2- production in response to infections. However, the mechanism of the initiation and progression of this oxidative burst and its implications for regulation of NOX2 have not been clarified. In this study, we show that the NOX2 oxidative burst is a result of autoactivation of NOX2 coupled with the redox function of Rac. NOX2 autoactivation begins when active Rac triggers NOX2 activation and the subsequent production of O2-, which in turn activates redox-sensitive Rac. This activated Rac further activates NOX2, amplifying the feedforward cycle and resulting in a NOX2-mediated oxidative burst. Using mutagenesis-based kinetic and cell analyses, we show that enzymatic activation of Rac is exclusively responsible for production of the active Rac trigger that initiates NOX2 autoactivation, whereas redox-mediated Rac activation is the main driving force of NOX2 autoactivation and contributes to generation of ∼98% of the active NOX2 in cells. The results of this study provide insight into the regulation of NOX2 function, which could be used to develop therapeutics to control immune responses associated with dysregulated NOX2 oxidative bursts."
https://openalex.org/W3186231308,"Background Early studies on COVID-19 identified unequal patterns in hospitalization and mortality in urban environments for racial and ethnic minorities. These studies were primarily single center observational studies conducted within the first few weeks or months of the pandemic. We sought to examine trends in COVID-19 morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality over time for minority and rural populations, especially during the U.S. fall surge. Methods Data were extracted from a statewide cohort of all adult residents in Indiana tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2020, linked to electronic health records. Primary measures were per capita rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Age adjusted rates were calculated for multiple time periods corresponding to public health mitigation efforts. Comparisons across time within groups were compared using ANOVA. Results Morbidity and mortality increased over time with notable differences among sub-populations. Initially, hospitalization rates among racial minorities were 3–4 times higher than whites, and mortality rates among urban residents were twice those of rural residents. By fall 2020, hospitalization and mortality rates in rural areas surpassed those of urban areas, and gaps between black/brown and white populations narrowed. Changes across time among demographic groups was significant for morbidity and hospitalization. Cumulative morbidity and mortality were highest among minority groups and in rural communities. Conclusions The synchronicity of disparities in COVID-19 by race and geography suggests that health officials should explicitly measure disparities and adjust mitigation as well as vaccination strategies to protect those sub-populations with greater disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W3186134060,"Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the number and type of drugs used to treat depressive disorders in inpatient psychiatry and to analyse the determinants of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDI) and potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). Methods Our study was part of a larger pharmacovigilance project funded by the German Innovation Funds. It included all inpatients with a main diagnosis in the group of depressive episodes (F32, ICD-10) or recurrent depressive disorders (F33) discharged from eight psychiatric hospitals in Germany between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018 or between 1 January and 31 December 2019. Results The study included 14,418 inpatient cases. The mean number of drugs per day was 3.7 (psychotropic drugs = 1.7; others = 2.0). Thirty-one percent of cases received at least five drugs simultaneously (polypharmacy). Almost one half of all cases received a combination of multiple antidepressant drugs (24.8%, 95% CI 24.1%–25.5%) or a treatment with antidepressant drugs augmented by antipsychotic drugs (21.9%, 95% CI 21.3%–22.6%). The most frequently used antidepressants were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, followed by serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and tetracyclic antidepressants. In multivariate analyses, cases with recurrent depressive disorders and cases with severe depression were more likely to receive a combination of multiple antidepressant drugs (Odds ratio recurrent depressive disorder: 1.56, 95% CI 1.41–1.70, severe depression 1.33, 95% CI 1.18–1.48). The risk of any pDDI and PIM in elderly patients increased substantially with each additional drug (Odds Ratio: pDDI 1.32, 95% CI: 1.27–1.38, PIM 1.18, 95% CI: 1.14–1.22) and severity of disease (Odds Ratio per point on CGI-Scale: pDDI 1.29, 95% CI: 1.11–1.46, PIM 1.27, 95% CI: 1.11–1.44), respectively. Conclusion This study identified potential sources and determinants of safety risks in pharmacotherapy of depressive disorders and provided additional data which were previously unavailable. Most inpatients with depressive disorders receive multiple psychotropic and non-psychotropic drugs and pDDI and PIM are relatively frequent. Patients with a high number of different drugs must be intensively monitored in the management of their individual drug-related risk-benefit profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3184019768,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at ultrahigh field (UHF) offers the potential of high resolution and fast image acquisition. Both technical and physiological challenges associated with CMR at 7T require specific hardware and pulse sequences. This study aimed to assess the current status and existing, publicly available technology regarding the potential of a clinical application of 7T CMR.Using a 7T MRI scanner and a commercially available radiofrequency coil, a total of 84 CMR examinations on 72 healthy volunteers (32 males, age 19-70 years, weight 50-103 kg) were obtained. Both electrocardiographic and acoustic triggering were employed. The data were analyzed regarding the diagnostic image quality and the influence of patient and hardware dependent factors. 50 complete short axis stacks and 35 four chamber CINE views were used for left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV), mono-planar LV function, and RV fractional area change (FAC). Twenty-seven data sets included aortic flow measurements that were used to calculate stroke volumes. Subjective acceptance was obtained from all volunteers with a standardized questionnaire.Functional analysis showed good functions of LV (mean EF 56%), RV (mean EF 59%) and RV FAC (mean FAC 52%). Flow measurements showed congruent results with both ECG and ACT triggering. No significant influence of experimental parameters on the image quality of the LV was detected. Small fractions of 5.4% of LV and 2.5% of RV segments showed a non-diagnostic image quality. The nominal flip angle significantly influenced the RV image quality.The results demonstrate that already now a commercially available 7T MRI system, without major methods developments, allows for a solid morphological and functional analysis similar to the clinically established CMR routine approach. This opens the door towards combing routine CMR in patients with development of advanced 7T technology."
https://openalex.org/W3183472987,"The purpose of current study is to reveal spatiotemporal features of oscillatory EEG activities in response to emotional arousal induced by emotional video stimuli, and to find the characteristics of cortical activities showing significant difference according to arousal levels. The EEGs recorded during watching affective video clips were transformed to cortical current density time-series, and then, cluster-based permutation test was applied to determine the spatiotemporal origins of alpha- and beta-band activities showing significant difference between high and low arousal levels. We found stronger desynchronization of alpha-band activities due to higher arousal in visual areas, which may be due to stronger activation for sensory information processing for the highly arousing video stimuli. In precentral and superior parietal regions, the stronger desynchronization in alpha-and low beta-bands was observed for the high arousal stimuli. This is expected to reflect enhanced mirror neuron system activities, which is involved in understanding the intention of other’s action. Similar changes according to arousal level were found also in inter-regional phase synchronization in alpha- and beta-bands."
https://openalex.org/W3183824638,"The use of sensitive methods is key for the detection of target taxa from trace amounts of environmental DNA (eDNA) in a sample. In this context, digital PCR (dPCR) enables direct quantification and is commonly perceived as more sensitive than endpoint PCR. However, endpoint PCR coupled with capillary electrophoresis (celPCR) potentially embodies a viable alternative as it quantitatively measures signal strength after PCR in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). Provided comparable levels of sensitivity are reached, celPCR permits the development of cost-efficient multiplex reactions, enabling the simultaneous detection of several target taxa. Here, we compared the sensitivity of singleplex and multiplex celPCR to dPCR for species-specific primer pairs amplifying mitochondrial DNA (COI) of fish species occurring in European freshwaters by analyzing dilution series of tissue extracts as well as field-collected water samples. Both singleplex and multiplex celPCR and dPCR displayed comparable sensitivity with reliable positive amplifications starting at two to 10 target DNA copies per μl extract. celPCR was suitable for quantifying target DNA and direct inference of copy numbers from RFU was possible after accounting for primer effects in linear mixed-effects models and calibration via dPCR. Furthermore, multiplex celPCR and dPCR were successfully used for the detection and quantification of fish-eDNA in field-collected water samples, confirming the results of the dilution series experiment and exemplifying the high sensitivity of the two approaches. The possibility of detection and quantification via multiplex celPCR is appealing for the cost-efficient screening of high sample numbers. The present results confirm the sensitivity of this approach thus enabling its application for future eDNA-based monitoring efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3185981110,"Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic used in the clinic for treatment of severe enterococcal infections. Recent reports indicate that daptomycin targets active cellular processes, specifically, peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Within, we examined the efficacy of daptomycin against Enterococcus faecalis under a range of environmental growth conditions including inhibitors that target active cellular processes. Daptomycin was far less effective against cells in late stationary phase compared to cells in exponential phase, and this was independent of cellular ATP levels. Further, the addition of either the de novo protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol or the fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor cerulenin induced survival against daptomycin far better than controls. Alterations in metabolites associated with peptidoglycan synthesis correlated with protection against daptomycin. This was further supported as removal of peptidoglycan induced physiological daptomycin tolerance, a synergistic relation between daptomycin and fosfomycin, an inhibitor of the fist committed step peptidoglycan synthesis, was observed, as well as an additive effect when daptomycin was combined with ampicillin, which targets crosslinking of peptidoglycan strands. Removal of the peptidoglycan of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis also resulted in significant protection against daptomycin in comparison to whole cells with intact cell walls. Based on these observations, we conclude that bacterial growth phase and metabolic activity, as well as the presence/absence of peptidoglycan are major contributors to the efficacy of daptomycin."
https://openalex.org/W3183736666,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by the presence of insulin resistance, and women with PCOS have high prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM). Both conditions have been associated with increased risk for pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, preeclampsia and increased offspring birth weight. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of GDM in women with PCOS using both previous and new diagnostic criteria, and to analyse whether the risk of pregnancy complications increased with the presence of GDM. In addition, we aimed to assess the response to metformin treatment in PCOS women with GDM. We performed post-hoc analysis of three prospective, double blinded studies of altogether 791 pregnant women with PCOS randomized to either metformin or placebo treatment from first trimester to delivery. Glucose data allowing GDM classification after previous (WHO 1999) and new (WHO 2013 and Norwegian 2017) diagnostic criteria were available for 722 of the women. Complications such as preeclampsia, late miscarriage and preterm birth, birth weight and gestational age were correlated to the presence of GDM and metformin treatment. The prevalence of GDM was 28.3% (WHO 1999), 41.2% (WHO 2013) and 27.2% (Norwegian 2017). Having GDM already in first trimester associated with increased risk for late miscarriage (p<0.01). Having GDM according to newer criteria correlated to increased maternal age and BMI (p<0.001). Otherwise, having GDM (any criteria) correlated neither to the development of preeclampsia, nor to birth weight z-score or the proportion of offspring being large for gestational weight. Maternal age and BMI, parity and gestational weight gain, but not GDM or metformin treatment, were determinants for birth weight z-score. Conclusion: in pregnant women with PCOS, having GDM did not increase the risk for other pregnancy complications except for an increased risk for late miscarriage among those with GDM already in the first trimester."
https://openalex.org/W3184988799,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges in obstetric health care services. Preparedness, development, and implementation of new protocols were part of the needed response. This study aims to describe the strategies implemented and the perspectives of health managers on the challenges to face the pandemic in 16 different maternity hospitals that comprise a multicenter study in Brazil, called REBRACO (Brazilian network of COVID-19 during pregnancy). Methods Mixed-method study, with quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data on the infrastructure of the units, maternal and perinatal health indicators, modifications on staff and human resources, from January to July/2020. Also, information on total number of cases, and availability for COVID-19 testing. A qualitative study by purposeful and saturation sampling was undertaken with healthcare managers, to understand perspectives on local challenges in facing the pandemic. Results Most maternities early implemented their contingency plan. REBRACO centers reported 338 confirmed COVID-19 cases among pregnant and post-partum women up to July 2020. There were 29 maternal deaths and 15 (51.8%) attributed to COVID-19. All maternities performed relocation of beds designated to labor ward, most (75%) acquired mechanical ventilators, only the minority (25%) installed new negative air pressure rooms. Considering human resources, around 40% hired extra health professionals and increased weekly workload and the majority (68.7%) also suspended annual leaves. Only one center implemented universal screening for childbirth and 6 (37.5%) implemented COVID-19 testing for all suspected cases, while around 60% of the centers only tested moderate/severe cases with hospital admission. Qualitative results showed that main challenges experienced were related to the fear of the virus, concerns about reliability of evidence and lack of resources, with a clear need for mental health support among health professionals. Conclusion Study findings suggest that maternities of the REBRACO initiative underwent major changes in facing the pandemic, with limitations on testing, difficulties in infrastructure and human resources. Leadership, continuous training, implementation of evidence-based protocols and collaborative initiatives are key to transpose the fear of the virus and ascertain adequate healthcare inside maternities, especially in low and middle-income settings. Policy makers need to address the specificities in considering reproductive health and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic and prioritize research and timely testing availability."
https://openalex.org/W3185265446,"In response to oncogenic signals, Alternative Splicing (AS) regulators such as SR and hnRNP proteins show altered expression levels, subnuclear distribution and/or post-translational modification status, but the link between signals and these changes remains unknown. Here, we report that a cytosolic scaffold protein, IQGAP1, performs this task in response to heat-induced signals. We show that in gastric cancer cells, a nuclear pool of IQGAP1 acts as a tethering module for a group of spliceosome components, including hnRNPM, a splicing factor critical for the response of the spliceosome to heat-shock. IQGAP1 controls hnRNPM’s sumoylation, subnuclear localisation and the relevant response of the AS machinery to heat-induced stress. Genome-wide analyses reveal that IQGAP1 and hnRNPM co-regulate the AS of a cell cycle-related RNA regulon in gastric cancer cells, thus favouring the accelerated proliferation phenotype of gastric cancer cells. Overall, we reveal a missing link between stress signals and AS regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3186046320,"F-box proteins play critical roles in plant responses to biotic/abiotic stresses. In the present study, a total of 68 wheat F-box/Kelch (TaFBK) genes, unevenly distributed across 21 chromosomes and encoding 74 proteins, were identified in EnsemblPlants. Protein sequences were compared with those of Arabidopsis and three cereal species by phylogenetic and domain analyses, where the wheat sequences were resolved into 6 clades. In silico analysis of a digital PCR dataset revealed that TaFBKs were expressed at multiple developmental stages and tissues, and in response to drought and/or heat stresses. The TaFBK19 gene, a homolog of the Attenuated Far-Red Response (AFR) genes in other plant species, and hence named TaAFR, was selected for further analysis. Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out to determine tissue-specific, hormone and stress (abiotic/biotic) responsive expression patterns. Of interest, TaAFR was expressed most abundantly in the leaves, and its expression in response to leaf rust variants suggests a potential role in compatible vs incompatible rust responses. The protein was predicted to localize in cytosol, but it was shown experimentally to localize in both the cytosol and the nucleus of tobacco. A series of protein interaction studies, starting with a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) library screen (wheat leaf infected with incompatible leaf rust pathogens), led to the identification of three TaAFR interacting proteins. Skp1/ASK1-like protein (Skp1) was found to interact with the F-box domain of TaAFR, while ADP-ribosylation factor 2-like isoform X1 (ARL2) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were shown to interact with its Kelch domain. The data presented herein provides a solid foundation from which the function and metabolic network of TaAFR and other wheat FBKs can be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W3186103208,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a clinically and etiologically diverse developmental condition characterized by diminished social interactions, impaired communication, and repetitive and/or restrictive behaviors. Recent advances in ASD genetics pave the way for implementation of precision medicine in clinical management of autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a clinically and etiologically diverse developmental condition characterized by diminished social interactions, impaired communication, and repetitive and/or restrictive behaviors. Recent advances in ASD genetics pave the way for implementation of precision medicine in clinical management of autism. Over the last couple of decades, the promise of precision medicine has undergone a transformation. Once a fanciful aspiration, it has become an everyday part of medical treatment for patients with access to the appropriate diagnostic testing. Biomarkers have moved from an esoteric realm of pathologists into the lexicon of most physicians and even many patients. Most drug development now is aimed against a particular molecular target, and many drugs will primarily benefit patients with a specific molecular abnormality. These may include genetic mutations, dysregulated biomarkers, or even tissue-specific gene expression signatures. The success of precision medicine approaches has rested on several pillars, each of which is updated and enhanced with new technologies: (1) genotypic studies, (2) patient stratification, and (3) iterative research process (Fröhlich et al., 2018Fröhlich H. Balling R. Beerenwinkel N. Kohlbacher O. Kumar S. Lengauer T. Maathuis M.H. Moreau Y. Murphy S.A. Przytycka T.M. et al.From hype to reality: data science enabling personalized medicine.BMC Med. 2018; 16: 150Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Genotypic studies can help identify patients susceptible to toxicities or other poor outcomes (for example, abacavir hypersensitivity in patients carrying HLA-B∗5701 allele) and, when combined with relevant genetic pathway studies, can further elucidate the biological model of disease. Stratification of patient populations by phenotype, including biomarkers, can help direct therapies to those who should exhibit the best outcomes and away from those who would not benefit. To enable the iterative research process, a well-documented and longitudinal follow-through is required to create the kinds of databases that will, in turn, aid in the validation process for useful biomarkers and future drug targets. Although precision medicine has become a reality for a wide swath of patients, there remains much promise of precision medicine in many areas of disease, and possibly none more so than in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The challenges in this therapeutic area are intrinsically linked to the complex biology of NDDs and the vulnerability of these patient populations. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a high prevalence but a very limited armamentarium of pharmacological interventions. This paradox may be partly explained by the heterogeneity of the affected population and limited understanding of etiology in the majority of cases. The inherent complexity of social behavior in humans and the developmental and environmental variation in early childhood further contribute to the lack of robust clinical and biomarker endpoints associated with the long-term outcomes in ASD. Patient stratification based on genetics, clinical features, or biomarker profiles is a promising approach that may link novel treatments to individual patient subpopulations in a more precision-based approach. Some individuals with ASD are highly functioning and require little or no support to live independently; therefore, one may be inclined to argue that ASD is simply natural neurodiversity with no need of treatment. However, some individuals with autism are moderately-to-severely affected, so the quality of life for them and their families can be dramatically reduced. It is for these individuals that a precision medicine approach may lead to a critical shift in medical care. Historically, many and varied treatments, including applied behavior analysis, social skills training, occupational therapy, physical therapy, sensory integration therapy, and the use of assistive technologies, have improved the lives of affected individuals. At the same time, the number of pharmacological treatments approved for ASD is quite low and exclusively aimed at management of the associated symptom domains; for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and alpha agonists), irritability/aggression (risperidone and aripiprazole), sleep (melatonin), and weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic use (metformin). No disease-modifying therapies targeting the core symptom domains (social communication impairment and restrictive/repetitive behavior) are currently available (Anagnostou, 2018Anagnostou E. Clinical trials in autism spectrum disorder: evidence, challenges and future directions.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2018; 31: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although a majority of recent and ongoing clinical trials in ASD include precision medicine approaches (for example, trials in genetically defined populations), the lack of established relationships between biomarkers and clinical outcomes persists. Heterogeneity of clinical presentation and etiology of ASD have hindered the discovery of risk factors and pathophysiological underpinnings of this umbrella disorder. Although the heritability of autism was confirmed by twin studies in the 1970s, the precise genetic risk factors remained poorly understood for decades. More recently, the development of increasingly sophisticated high-throughput technologies and associated analytical pipelines shed light on risk factors for ASD. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated causative links between both genetic (additive and dominant) and environmental (shared and nonshared) factors and ASD. Further, it has been shown that common genetic variation underlies most of the risk for ASD at a population level (Gaugler et al., 2014Gaugler T. Klei L. Sanders S.J. Bodea C.A. Goldberg A.P. Lee A.B. Mahajan M. Manaa D. Pawitan Y. Reichert J. et al.Most genetic risk for autism resides with common variation.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, a number of individual high-risk genes have been identified in studies where specific de novo mutations were strongly associated with NDDs characterized by a high prevalence of autism. Recently, in the largest whole-exome sequencing study in ASD to date (∼35,000 samples, including ∼12,000 affected individuals), the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC; https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/) identified 102 genes contributing to ASD risk (Satterstrom et al., 2020Satterstrom F.K. Kosmicki J.A. Wang J. Breen M.S. De Rubeis S. An J.Y. Peng M. Collins R. Grove J. Klei L. et al.Autism Sequencing ConsortiumiPSYCH-Broad ConsortiumLarge-Scale Exome Sequencing Study Implicates Both Developmental and Functional Changes in the Neurobiology of Autism.Cell. 2020; 180: 568-584.e23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The results of these studies represent the beginnings of our understanding of gene networks in ASD and ultimately a new hope for patients affected by these genetic variants. The need to fully elucidate genetic factors for ASD remains a priority for autism researchers. While the high-risk genes tend to display high penetrance and appear to carry almost all of the risk in the affected families, understanding the polygenic factors in various genetic backgrounds remains relevant. To that end, identification of gene modifiers and epigenetic, transcriptional, and translational regulators of implicated genes is important for a more complete understanding of the genetic risk and the precise roles of specific variants. One can hope that further analyses and mining of the data generated in the currently ongoing sequencing studies in ASD (e.g., SPARK [https://sparkforautism.org/], ASC, and others), as well as general population studies (e.g., Pennsylvania’s Geisinger Healthcare System [https://www.geisinger.org/precision-health], Iceland’s DeCODE [https://www.decode.com/], the UK Biobank [https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/], and others), will generate new hypotheses. A majority of the high-risk ASD genes are expressed during brain development with roles in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, synaptic function, and neuronal communication. Noteworthy is the fact that the number of implicated genes far exceeds the number of clinically defined phenotypes. Thus, multiple genes are likely to converge on shared pathways, resulting in a similar ASD phenotype. Even more intriguingly, a relatively large overlap between the ASD genes and high-risk genes for other conditions (for example, intellectual disability and epilepsy) has been observed. Collectively, these results indicate that ASD phenotypes stem from a disruption of the sophisticated regulatory processes involving differential activity of multiple genes over the course of development. “Mapping” high-risk genes to biological pathways can be conducted in various in vitro models and further validated in animal models (Figure 1). The caveat is a limited translational concordance between preclinical models and autism in affected patients. Some of the genes identified by sequencing studies are highly penetrant and can be considered as largely monogenic disorders. One could argue that such monogenic disorders are distinct diseases with a specific molecular “fingerprint” and not autism per se. However, an attractive strategy is to look at these molecularly defined populations as the subsets of a larger population affected by ASD and utilize findings in these populations as reflective of similar pathways in idiopathic autism. Given the overlapping phenotypic characteristics, monogenic ASD offers a unique opportunity to study autism in a more homogeneous population and to evaluate clinical and surrogate endpoints for future clinical trials. One of the greatest challenges for drug development in ASD is a lack of reproducible, objective endpoints. Defining endpoints reflective of clinically meaningful improvements or better quality of life has not yet been successful. However, an approach of using clinician-rated measures such as clinical global impression (CGI) scales (Busner and Targum, 2007Busner J. Targum S.D. The clinical global impressions scale: applying a research tool in clinical practice.Psychiatry (Edgmont Pa.). 2007; 4: 28-37PubMed Google Scholar) could be a complement to simpler, more discreet endpoints. Another noteworthy approach is inclusion of endpoints to specifically capture effects of investigational therapies on non-psychiatric symptoms (for example, gastrointestinal symptoms, gait abnormalities, immune deficits), which nevertheless affect quality of life. These associated symptoms may be more easily quantifiable than complex behaviors yet important contributors to the overall treatment efficacy. However, evaluating proposed endpoints and their relationship in monogenic ASD comes with a set of challenges. The number of individuals carrying pathogenic variants of any given gene is much smaller than the overall ASD population, so recruitment into observational studies may be especially difficult and require a large screening effort. Moreover, not all mutations produce the same phenotype, with some having a clear haploinsufficiency effect while others may act as dominant-negative mutations. Many of the pathogenic variants result in a very severe phenotype, making clinical research in the affected population challenging and limiting the scope of reliable assessments. Studying monogenic ASD may also fuel discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches. Although mutations associated with ASD are believed to account for <10% of all ASD cases, the number of confirmed genetic diagnoses is much lower because of the limited use of whole-exome sequencing in the standard diagnostic algorithms. Thus, most of the monogenic ASD subtypes are classified as rare diseases (definitions in prevalence ranging from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 200,000). A favorable regulatory environment and an ever-growing number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies interested in rare diseases are important factors in making this approach feasible and expeditious. Therapeutics developed for monogenic forms of ASD may find new markets in a broader population that shares clinical or biomarker features with the individuals affected by the single-gene mutation. Expanding upon these initial indications to include a broader group of individuals with ASD or other NDD will not be trivial, and the establishment of predictive biomarker profiles is an imperative. Numerous biomarker studies using a wide range of modalities have attempted to identify—and some to fully validate—a variety of biomarker candidates in ASD. Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the best diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive (for available interventions) biomarkers yet. The difficulties in identification and implementation of the ASD biomarkers are reflected in the lack of ASD therapeutics. Given the special needs of the affected population, invasive methods, including, for example, a collection of cerebrospinal fluid, are not feasible on a large scale. Less-invasive methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking, and blood-based biomarker analysis (including RNA, protein, or metabolite markers), are better suited, especially for severely affected populations, but will likely vary between different subgroups. Standardization of the biomarker methodologies, including parsing heterogeneity and well-controlled cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, will be required to evaluate relationships between biomarker changes and clinical improvements. The power of the precision medicine approach derives from the integrative analysis of multidimensional datasets, including diverse modalities. A recent study demonstrated the potential for this approach by overlying diverse datasets, including healthcare claims, electronic health records, whole-exome sequencing, and transcriptome profiles, to identify a subpopulation of dyslipidemia-associated ASD (Luo et al., 2020Luo Y. Eran A. Palmer N. Avillach P. Levy-Moonshine A. Szolovits P. Kohane I.S. A multidimensional precision medicine approach identifies an autism subtype characterized by dyslipidemia.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the “big data” approach alone is not likely to resolve the challenges. In-depth genotype-phenotype analyses, as well as quantitative in vitro and in vivo ASD models, will be key for discovery of new therapeutics or repurposing of the existing ones. Of particular interest are in vitro models developed by using patient-derived pluripotent stem cells to generate neuronal cultures or organoids. This approach affords a unique opportunity to study biological processes in the context of neuronal function and in the genetic background of affected individuals (Soliman et al., 2017Soliman M.A. Aboharb F. Zeltner N. Studer L. Pluripotent stem cells in neuropsychiatric disorders.Mol. Psychiatry. 2017; 22: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These models can be used for identification of potential therapeutics in two major ways: phenotypic screening or testing of drug candidates targeting specific molecular entities. Extensive preclinical testing in well-characterized models is expected to provide guidance for treatment parameters such as optimal exposure or time of intervention. This precision medicine approach may improve the diagnosis and long-term prognosis in ASD. Earlier detection of ASD enables earlier or critical time point intervention, which, in turn, is associated with improved long-term prognosis. A key improvement may be to establish a correlation between markers readily assessable in infants; for example, pupil dilation fluctuations (Artoni et al., 2020Artoni P. Piffer A. Vinci V. LeBlanc J. Nelson C.A. Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Deep learning of spontaneous arousal fluctuations detects early cholinergic defects across neurodevelopmental mouse models and patients.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117: 23298-23303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a gold-standard diagnosis of ASD (by validated clinical instruments) later in life. Biomarker discovery could be potentially accelerated using electronic health records to perform comprehensive analysis of pre- and perinatal history along with the pediatricians’ reports during infancy for children who proceeded to be diagnosed with ASD versus a control group without NDDs. The main focus for potential diagnostic biomarkers should be on high feasibility, low false-positive rate, and low cost to allow for implementation across the entire population regardless of the healthcare access. Another understudied aspect of autism is the progression of disease throughout childhood and adolescence—and especially into adulthood. A number of conditions associated with ASD, including epilepsy, ADHD, anxiety, sleep disruption, gastrointestinal problems, feeding issues, and a host of others, have been documented in affected children. The most immediately addressable perhaps is the co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy in a subset of individuals, largely due to shared genetic factors contributing to both conditions (Jeste and Tuchman, 2015Jeste S.S. Tuchman R. Autism Spectrum Disorder and Epilepsy: Two Sides of the Same Coin?.J. Child Neurol. 2015; 30: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Understanding this well-established link is of vital importance as identifying risk factors for epilepsy in ASD patients, as well as siblings who are also at increased risk, may facilitate an earlier introduction of anti-convulsive therapy and better seizure control. While many of the comorbidities associated with ASD in childhood persist into adulthood, the toll of comorbidities on the quality of life changes with age. Furthermore, adolescents and adults with ASD are at increased risk for psychosis, depression, and suicide, as well as non-psychiatric health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. The precision medicine approach could help overcome gaps in our understanding of the factors leading to these poor outcomes. Early identification of individuals at high risk for development of comorbidities would allow for increased monitoring to prevent or delay the onset of additional symptoms. In summary, the personalized medicine approach to diagnosis and treatment of ASD, although just beginning, holds great promise for improving the lives of affected individuals. Widely implementing more reliable yet simplified diagnostic tools will allow for earlier and more efficient intervention, especially in underserved communities and marginalized societies. Further, systematic follow-up and accurate disease prognosis for each patient is needed to provide optimal care and sustained support to the patients and their caregivers. Perhaps most importantly, novel therapeutic approaches including personalized pharmacological intervention to provide relief in the core symptom domains and achieve disease-modifying effects may lie in the near future."

When attacks occur, both humans and large carnivores suffer, highlighting the need to characterize these conflicts toward mitigation of attacks. We investigated brown bear (Ursus arctos) and Persian leopard (Panthera pardus) attacks on humans across Iran using reports provided by the Government of Iran during 2012-2020. We characterized temporal and spatial patterns of attacks, as well as species-specific attributes. We identified 83 attacks resulting in 77 human injuries and 6 fatalities. Bears were responsible for more attacks (63%) than leopards (37%). Attacks occurred more frequently during defensive reactions by bears and leopards on adult male people while livestock herding during the day in spring and summer. Bears reportedly attacked people more often in western provinces of Iran, while leopards attacked more frequently in northern provinces. We recommend that the Iran Department of the Environment consider implementing a national reporting system to document bear and leopard attacks on people. We further suggest development of national bear and leopard management plans that emphasize mitigating human risk to improve human attitudes toward these carnivore species to facilitate their conservation."

Whether elevated FGF-23 levels are associated with an increased risk for contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing coronary angiography remain uncertain.In total, 492 patients receiving coronary angiography were enrolled. Their serum FGF-23 levels were measured before administration of contrast media. The occurrence of CA-AKI was defined as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% increase from the baseline value within 48 h after the procedure. All patients were followed up for at least 1 year or until the occurrence of MACE including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and ischemic stroke.Overall, CA-AKI occurred in 41 (8.3%) patients. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, there were 24 deaths, 3 nonfatal MIs, and 7 ischemic strokes. Compared with those in the lowest FGF-23 tertile, individuals in the highest FGF-23 tertile had a significantly higher incidence of CA-AKI (P < 0.001) and lower incidence of MACE-free survival (P = 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, higher FGF-23 level was found to be independently associated with a graded risk for CA-AKI (OR per doubling, 1.90; 95% CI 1.48-2.44) and MACE (HR per doubling, 1.25; 95% CI 1.02-1.52).Elevated FGF-23 levels were associated with an increased risk for CA-AKI and future MACE among patients undergoing coronary angiography. FGF-23 may play a role in early diagnosis of CA-AKI and predicting clinical outcomes after coronary angiography."

Total contact insole (TCI) is simple but effective in treating plantar fasciitis. Despite its effect, the cost and long duration for production have been the major flaws. Therefore, we developed a newly designed three-spike insole (TSI) that can be commercially productive and compared its clinical outcomes to TCI.Patients with plantar fasciitis refractory to conservative treatment for more than 6 weeks were candidates. We produced insoles with hardness of 58 ± 5 Shore-A. Twenty-eight patients were randomized with equal allocation to either TSI or TCI. The following assessment tools were used: visual analog scale (VAS), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle score, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score, Karlsson-Peterson (KP) score, Short Form-36 for quality of life, and Foot Function Index. Non-inferiority was declared if VAS was within the statistical variability of minimal important difference. A blinded assessor evaluated the groups at baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 weeks.The groups were homogenous for majority of variables at baseline. Overall patient-reported satisfaction showed improvement from mean 5.2 (range, 1-12) weeks of wearing and all clinical outcome scores showed significant improvements in both groups over time on Friedman test (p ≤.032). TSI showed non-inferiority to TCI at each time point. Post hoc analysis revealed that many scales showed significant superiority of TSI at 3 month (p ≤.008) and KP score at 6 month (p < .001).We reaffirmed that semi-rigid insole is effective in refractory plantar fasciitis and showed TSI restores pedal function more rapidly than TCI. TSI can be not only effective in deriving better clinical outcomes but also be manufactured for popularization to lower the price and producing time of orthosis."
https://openalex.org/W3148902691,"Cryptic and hybridizing species may lack diagnostic taxonomic characters leaving researchers with semi-diagnostic ones. Identification based on such characters is probabilistic, the probability of correct identification depending on the species composition in a mixed population. Here we test the possibilities of applying a semi-diagnostic conchological character for distinguishing two cryptic species of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus. These ecologically, stratigraphically and economically important molluscs co-occur and hybridize in many areas of the North Atlantic and the neighboring Arctic. Any cues for distinguishing them in sympatry without genotyping would save much research effort. Recently these species have been shown to statistically differ in the White Sea, where a simple character of the shell was used to distinguish two mussel morphotypes. In this paper, we analyzed the associations between morphotypes and species-specific genotypes based on an abundant material from the waters of the Kola Peninsula (White Sea, Barents Sea) and a more limited material from Norway, the Baltic Sea, Scotland and the Gulf of Maine. The performance of the ""morphotype test"" for species identification was formally evaluated using approaches from evidence-based medicine. Interspecific differences in the morphotype frequencies were ubiquitous and unidirectional, but their scale varied geographically (from 75% in the White Sea to 15% in the Baltic Sea). In addition, salinity-related variation of this character within M. edulis was revealed in the Arctic Barents Sea. For every studied region, we established relationships between the proportions of the morphotypes in the populations as well as between the proportions of the morphotypes in samples and the probabilities of mussels of different morphotypes being M. trossulus and M. edulis. We provide recommendations for the application of the morphotype test to mussels from unstudied contact zones and note that they may apply equally well to other taxa identified by semi-diagnostic traits."

The database also includes binarized images of manually segmented microvascular networks associated with each raw image. The participant demographic characteristics, health status, and social habits information such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, alcohol use, as well as previous medical history was collected. As proof of the concept, a smaller set of 10 color digital fundus images from healthy older participants is also included. Comparison of the microvascular parameters of these two sets of images demonstrate that digital fundus images recorded with a hand-held portable camera are able to capture the changes in patterns of microvascular network associated with aging. The raw images from the TREND database provide a standard that defines normal retinal anatomy and microvascular network geometry in young healthy people in Montenegro as it is seen with the digital hand-held portable non-mydriatic MiiS HORUS Scope DEC 200.This knowledge could facilitate the application of this technology at the primary level of health care for large scale telematic screening for complications of chronic diseases, such as hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy. In addition, it could aid in the development of new methods for early detection of age-related changes in the retina, systemic chronic diseases, as well as eye-specific diseases. The associated manually segmented images of the microvascular networks provide the standard that can be used for development of automatic software for image quality assessment, segmentation of microvascular network, and for computer-aided detection of pathological changes in retina.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the number of potentially infectious particles present during endoscopic procedures and find effective tools to eliminate the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection while performing them. Methods An experimental model which focused on aerosol problematics was made in a specialized laboratory. This model simulated conditions present during endoscopic procedures and monitored the formation of potentially infectious fluid particles from the patient’s body, which pass through the endoscope and are then released into the environment. For this reason, we designed and tested a prototype of a protective cover for the endoscope’s control body to prevent the release and spread of these fluid particles from its working channel. We performed measurements with and without the protective cover of the endoscope’s control body. Results It was found that liquid coming through the working channel of the endoscope with forceps or other instruments inside generates droplets with a diameter in the range of 0.1–1.1 mm and an initial velocity of up to 0.9 m/s. The average number of particles per measurement per whole measured area without a protective cover on the endoscope control body was 51.1; with this protective cover on, the measurement was 0.0, p&lt;0.0001. Conclusions Our measurements proved that fluid particles are released from the working channel of an endoscope when forceps are inserted. A special protective cover for the endoscope control body, made out of breathable material (surgical cap) and designed by our team, was found to eliminate this release of potentially infectious fluid particles."

But only a few cross-sectional studies have reported an association of NAFLD with working hours. This cohort study further examined the association between working hours and the development of NAFLD.We included 79,048 Korean adults without NAFLD at baseline who underwent a comprehensive health examination and categorized weekly working hours into 35-40, 41-52, 53-60, and >60 hours. NAFLD was defined as the presence of fatty liver, in the absence of excessive alcohol use, as observed by ultrasound.During a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 15,095 participants developed new-onset NAFLD (incidence rate, 5.55 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for confounders, the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for the development of NAFLD in 41-52, 53-60, and >60 working hours compared with that in 35-40 working hours were 1.07 (1.02-1.13), 1.06 (1.00-1.13), and 1.13 (1.05-1.23), respectively. Furthermore, the association remained significant after confounders were treated as time-varying covariates.In this large-scale cohort, long working hours, especially >60 working hours a week, were independently associated with incident NAFLD.

This study was performed to clarify the functional differences between these two populations, focusing on their susceptibility to radiation and response to stimulation via liver X receptors (LXRs), which are implicated in cholesterol metabolism and immune regulation. Liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) were obtained from C57BL/6 (WT) mice with or without 2 Gy irradiation, and the phagocytic activity against Escherichia coli (E . coli) as well as TNF-α production were compared between the two macrophage populations. To assess LXR functions, phagocytosis, TNF-α production, and endocytosis of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were compared after synthetic LXR ligand stimulation. Furthermore, LXRα/β knockout (KO) mice and LXRα KO mice were compared with WT mice. Irradiation decreased intracellular TNF-α production by recMφs but did not affect the phagocytic activity of resKCs. In vitro LXR stimulation enhanced E . coli phagocytosis by resKCs but decreased E . coli -stimulated TNF-α production by recMφs. Phagocytic activity and acetylated LDL endocytosis were decreased in both LXRα/β KO mice and LXRα KO mice, with serum TNF-α levels after E . coli injection in the former being higher than those in WT mice. In conclusion, resKCs and recMφs exhibited different functional features in response to radiation and LXR stimulation, highlighting their distinct roles liver immunity and lipid metabolism."

The aim of this study was to acquire up-to-date information regarding the arm, forearm and leg bone development in skeletally-immature large-sized dogs from 6 weeks to 16 weeks of age. Nine litters of 5 large-sized breeds (Boxer, German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, Saarloos Wolfdog, White Swiss Shepherd Dog) were included, for a total of 54 dogs, which were subject to radiographic examination on a bi-weekly basis. The appearance of 18 limb OCs was recorded and 14 radiographic measurements were performed; their relationship with age and body weight was investigated and any breed differences were analysed using different statistical non-parametric tests. The number of OCs present was significantly different at 6 and 8 weeks of age between the investigated breeds. The appearance of the OCs occurred earlier in the Saarloos Wolfdog, while the Labrador Retriever was the later breed. In Boxers and Labrador Retrievers, various OCs showed a delayed appearance compared to the data reported in the literature. The number of OCs was strongly and positively correlated to body weight. Breed differences were also observed in the relative increase of the measured OCs and were not limited to dogs of different morphotypes. Statistically significant differences were most frequently observed between Saarloos Wolfdogs and the other breeds. The OCs that showed a greater variability in their development were the olecranon tuber, the patella and the tibial tuberosity. Their increase was more strongly correlated with the dog's age and body weight. Our data strongly suggest that differences in limb development exist in dog breeds of similar size and morphotype."

To address this gap, we developed and user-tested a bar graph and compared it to icon arrays to assess its impact on understanding and preference for viewing risk information.To determine the: (i) formats' impact on participants' understanding of risk information; (ii) formats' impact on understanding and format preference across numeracy and graph literacy subgroups; (iii) rationale supporting participants' preference for each graphical display format.An online sample (evenly made up of participants with high and low objective numeracy and graph literacy) was randomized to view either the icon array or the bar graph. Each format conveyed the risk of major stroke and death five years after choosing surgery, a stent, or medication to treat carotid artery stenosis. Participants answered questions to assess their understanding of the risk information. Lastly, both formats were presented in parallel, and participants were asked to identify their preferred format to view risk information and explain their preference.Of the 407 participants, 197 were assigned the icon array and 210 the bar graph. Understanding of risk information and format preference did not differ significantly between the two trial arms, irrespective of numeracy and graph literacy proficiency. High numeracy and graph literacy proficiency was associated with high understanding (p<0.01) and a preference for the bar graph (p = 0.01).We found no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of one format over another on understanding. The majority of participants preferred viewing the risk information using the bar graph format."

We enrolled 24 individuals and requested them to carry out phone conversations either using only a mobile phone or using a mobile phone along with the Hugvie. All participants in both groups completed questionnaires designed to evaluate their self-confidence while talking on the phone, and also provided salivary cortisol samples four times each day. Our analysis revealed that the medium of communication was a significant factor, indicating that individuals with ASD who spoke with an unfamiliar person on the phone while hugging a Hugvie had stronger self-confidence and lower stress levels than those who did not use Hugvie. Hence, we recommend that huggable devices be used as adjunctive tools to support individuals with ASD during telephonic conversations with unfamiliar people."
https://openalex.org/W3184807020,"The acquisition of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT), such as high-power fiber or CO 2 laser cutting equipment, generally involves high investment levels. Its payback period is usually more extended, and there is a moderate-to-high risk involved in adopting these technologies. In this work, we present a robust model that optimizes equipment investing decisions, considers the process’s technical constraint and finds an optimal production plan based on the available machinery. We propose a linear investment model based on historical demand information and take physical process parameters for a LASER cutting equipment, such as cutting speed and gas consumption. The model is then transformed into a robust optimization model which considers demand uncertainty. Second, we determine the optimal production plan based on the results of the robust optimization model and assuming that demand follows a normal distribution. As a case study, we decided on the investment and productive plan for a company that offers Laser-Beam Cutting (LBC) services. The case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed model and proves the robustness of the solution. For this specific application of the model, results showed that the optimal robust solution could increase the company’s expected profits by 6.4%."

This study investigated the adjuvanticity of snail mucin with recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine (rHBsAg). Twenty-five (25) female mice distributed unbiasedly into 5 groups were used in the study and were administered different rHBsAg/Mucin formulation at 7 days intervals. Blood samples were collected a day following the administration for analysis. The results of liver function and body weight analysis were indications that snail mucin had no adverse effect on the mice. The treatment group (administer mucin and rHBsAg) showed significantly (P<0.05) higher mean titres of anti-HBsAg antibodies when compared with the negative controls and the positive control administered with two doses of rHBsAg after the boost doses (day 28). Furthermore, a comparable immune response to positive control administered with three doses rHBaAG was recorded. In silico prediction, studies of the protein-protein interaction of a homology modelled snail mucus protein and HBsAg gave an indication of enhanced HBV antigen-antibody interaction. Therefore, this study has shown that snail mucin possesses some adjuvant properties and enhances immune response towards rHBsAg vaccine. However, there is a need for further molecular dynamics studies to understand its mechanism of action."

Traditional methods of leukocyte enrichment have many significant limitations for current applications. It is demonstrated a novel 3D printing leukocyte sorting accumulator that combines with centrifugation to ensure label-free initial leukocyte enrichment based on cell density and size. The internal structure of leukocyte sorting accumulator (revealed here in a new design, leukocyte sorting accumulator-3, upgraded from earlier models), optimizes localization of the buffy coat fraction and the length of the period allocated for a second centrifugation step to deliver a higher recovery of buffy coats than earlier models. Established methodological parameters were evaluated for reliability by calculating leukocyte recovery rates and erythrocyte depletion rates by both pushing and pulling methods of cell displacement. Results indicate that leukocyte sorting accumulator-3 achieves a mean leukocytes recovery fraction of 96.2 ± 2.38% by the pushing method of layer displacement. By the pulling method, the leukocyte sorting accumulator-3 yield a mean leukocytes recovery fraction of 94.4 ± 0.8%. New procedures for preliminary enrichment of leukocytes from peripheral blood that avoid cellular damage, as well as avert metabolic and phase cycle intervention, are required as the first step in many modern clinical and basic research assays."
https://openalex.org/W3183534707,"Faced with the increasing demand for blood and greater restrictions on ensuring the safety of transfusions, voluntary donation is currently the only and best alternative for the health system to have a sustainable and safe blood supply. In this context, one of the primary strategies of blood transfusion centres is to increase the satisfaction of their active donors so that they maintain their intention to donate in the future and, in turn, make the necessary recommendations so that third parties can become new donors. That is why this paper raises a question for research concerning, what should the premises be to guide the management of blood transfusion centres to maintain and even increase the satisfaction and loyalty of their active donors? In order to respond to this issue, a change in paradigm is proposed based on a management model supported by donor orientation and service quality as basic pillars, as well as on the development of a number of key social capital resources that explain this orientation toward the donor. In both approaches, the donor becomes the cornerstone of decision-making, moving away from the traditional model which is focused more on achieving targets related to the collection of blood bags. Through the empirical analysis of a sample of 126 employees from various transfusion centres and 26,833 active donors in nine Spanish autonomous communities, we have been able to validate this proposed management model as a useful tool to blood promotion agents in their decision-making processes."
https://openalex.org/W3183652022,"Successes in neuroscience using a genetics-first approach to characterizing disorders such as autism have eclipsed the scientific and clinical value of a comprehensive phenotype-first—clinical or molecular—approach. Recent high-throughput phenotyping techniques using machine learning, electronic medical records, and even administrative databases show the value of a synthesis between the two approaches. Successes in neuroscience using a genetics-first approach to characterizing disorders such as autism have eclipsed the scientific and clinical value of a comprehensive phenotype-first—clinical or molecular—approach. Recent high-throughput phenotyping techniques using machine learning, electronic medical records, and even administrative databases show the value of a synthesis between the two approaches. In the beginning, there was the phenotype-first strategy. Expert investigators defined syndromes by their phenotype—such as the X-linked Fragile X syndrome—which led to the eventual identification of their genetic etiology, often decades later. High-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies, many developed to support the Human Genome Project, made the inversion of this strategy—a “genetics-first” approach—feasible. By 2012, the autism neuroscience research community could rightly pride itself on the success of this genetics-first strategy, one in which patients had been recruited because of their autism diagnosis. Many of these studies were funded by the Simons Foundation, which also included extensive neurodevelopmental phenotyping. Most of these studies (e.g., Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Lee Y.-H. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70: 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) focused on the genetic variants associated with autism and not phenotypic subtypes—neither the neurodevelopmental phenotypes nor the phenome-wide comorbidities. Once characterized by their genetics, the patients were then compared clinically and further studied. In this vein, in the last 10 years hundreds of genes have been implicated. Rare, highly penetrant mutations have been found in approximately 30% of cases of autism. Although common variants identified through association studies individually have small effects (typically odds ratios of 1.1 to 1.2), collectively they account for up to 50% of the heritable risk for autism. The impressive achievements of this genetics-first approach have obscured the clinical and basic science payoff that comprehensively going in the other direction—a “phenome-wide, phenotype-first” analysis—can provide. I illustrate this approach using autism as an example of a disorder that has relatively non-specific criteria. In this case, autism has been defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as including “persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts” and “restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities” presenting in early development and causing significant impairment in functioning. Yet these criteria are sufficiently capacious to include individuals ranging from the non-verbal who cannot live independently to high-functioning leaders in many disciplines, including neuroscience. The genetics-first approaches did include extensive and expensive phenotyping, but this was largely confined to a set of pre-defined neurobehavioral assessments. This pre-selection of phenotypes was akin to the hypothesis-driven candidate gene approaches of an earlier era with their attendant methodological risks and pitfalls. What was missing was a comprehensive phenome-wide phenotyping-first effort (e.g., including co-morbidities such as inflammatory bowel disease, dyslipidemia, or sinusitis) that electronic health records and other clinical databases have allowed us to explore, however imperfectly, as described below. Given the breadth and heterogeneity of the disorders covered by autism, several questions are immediately posed. What should we tell our patients or their parents to expect, and when, in the evolution of their autism disorder? When a specific single-gene-based autism diagnosis is made, what does it tell us about what neurological or non-neurological disorders to anticipate, and do we have that information for all etiologic variants? Which autism subpopulation do we select, sequence, and study to understand a specific mechanism of action of the disorder? Can we identify patients who are not included in an autism study but who share pathogenic mechanisms that manifest without autism? Short of universal sequencing, answering these questions with an exclusively genetics- or genomic-first approach limits our ability to answer these questions. It is not obvious until you try to clinically characterize patients with autism that it’s far cheaper to genotype and even whole-genome sequence a patient than provide the comprehensive clinical characterization that not only includes behavioral screens like the Autism Diagnostic Interview but also the full clinical history including medications over time, clinical co-morbidities, and their laboratory and imaging characterizations over time. Prospectively, the costs of such labor-intensive phenotyping by trained clinicians easily exceeds several thousand dollars per patient (Wright, 2011Wright J. Autism tests struggle to balance accuracy and speed. Spectrum News, November 8, 2011.2011https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-tests-struggle-to-balance-accuracy-and-speed/Google Scholar). This is in contrast to less than $100 for genome-wide genotyping or less than $1,000 for whole-genome sequencing. This explains, in part, why most of the early genome-wide association studies and even rare variant studies used very restricted subsets of potential phenotypes of interest for their case definitions. Where additional phenotyping was performed, it was mostly invested in time-intensive and expensive neurodevelopmental and behavioral characterizations. The full health record that encompasses extensive clinical variation over a much larger swathe of organ systems and pathophysiologies was scantily used in the genetics-first approach, if at all. Providing systematic and richer characterizations was unaffordable and infeasible at the scale of tens or hundreds of thousands of study subjects. Roughly coinciding with the announcement of the first human genome draft, the turn of the millennium marked the beginning of exponential growth in the use of electronic health records (EHRs) as well as administrative data such as insurance claims as a low-cost mechanism for deeper phenotyping of large populations. Part of this growth is explained by the increased size and availability of these data sources, but the major impetus was the development of machine learning techniques to turn these data sources into robust and richer clinical phenotypes. Some of these phenotypes were derived from the codified data in these databases (e.g., diagnostic billing codes, medications, or laboratory results, each with their own standardized vocabulary). Even more important for “softer” characterizations, often found in neurology and psychiatry (e.g., “treatment-resistant depression”), for which these codified data provided non-specific and non-sensitive proxies, the narrative text of clinical notes and reports (e.g., EEGs, MRIs) provide details that clinicians have entered in order to inform other clinicians involved in the care of the patient. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have advanced rapidly and can be used to turn these texts into codified phenotypes. In this way, the clinical characterization of hundreds of thousands of patients can be performed in minutes. Doing so reproducibly does require considerable knowledge of both the NLP techniques and the specific limitations and biases of the textual component of the medical record. To these extensively used databases, researchers in biomedical informatics are adding environmental exposome databases (Patel et al., 2016Patel C.J. Pho N. McDuffie M. Easton-Marks J. Kothari C. Kohane I.S. Avillach P. A database of human exposomes and phenomes from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Sci. Data. 2016; 3: 160096Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and several companies provide wearables that are being used in trials to characterize the neurological status and progression of patients based on their everyday activities (Perez et al., 2019Perez M.V. Mahaffey K.W. Hedlin H. Rumsfeld J.S. Garcia A. Ferris T. Balasubramanian V. Russo A.M. Rajmane A.

Med. 2019; 381: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Each of these data sources have their own specific biases and limitations (see Table 1 below), but with care they can be used effectively to perform studies that would otherwise be presently impossible and that provide an opportune set of questions that can then be further studied with genomic sequencing and other ‘omics technologies.Table 1Strengths and weaknesses of available phenotyping data sourcesData sourceAdvantagesPopulations availableLimitations/BiasesAccess requirementsElectronic health recordsResults of clinically ordered labs and diagnostic procedures.

Open table in a new tab NLP, environmental, and ‘omics databases notwithstanding, even the most basic administrative data can be used effectively to better characterize patients with neurological disorders. For example, we used a commercial insurance database covering 49 million patients to identify over 3,000 patients under 20 years of age with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) (Yu et al., 2018Yu K.-H. Miron O. Palmer N. Lemos D.R. Fox K. Kou S.C. Sahin M. Kohane I.S. Data-driven analyses revealed the comorbidity landscape of tuberous sclerosis complex.Neurology. 2018; 91: 974-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, we selected 500 patients matched for sex and age for each one of the TSC patients. In addition to the well-known comorbidities of TSC such as autism, benign neoplasms of the kidney, malignant neoplasms of the brain, or epilepsy, we could estimate less well-quantified comorbidities of TSC including ulcerative colitis (Odds Ratio [OR] 6.94, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 3.09, 15.6) and mood disorders (OR 3.37, 95% CI 2.49, 4.58). In contrast, patients with TSC have significantly less infectious mononucleosis (OR 0.410, 95% CI 0.184, 0.914) and perinatal jaundice (OR 0.720, 95% CI 0.540, 0.961). Proceeding to whole-genome and transcriptome studies in this population would shed light on the mechanisms of this disease that we view as monogenic, but with pleiomorphy that is a function of specific TSC mutations and modifier genes. For a common diagnosis such as autism, the payoff for a judicious phenome-wide characterization is much greater than with putatively monogenic diseases. Here, it’s not clear which are the distinct diseases lumped together under this broad DSM diagnosis. If the additional phenotypic findings outside the core autism phenotype are themselves uncommon, even the clinicians caring for the patients might not recognize that there exist groups of patients with archetypal clusters of these comorbidities. From a sample of 4,927 patients aged 15 years from a tertiary-care pediatric hospital (mean follow-up 11 years, standard deviation [SD] 4.8 years), we constructed a time series with 30 6-month windows from birth to age 15 (Doshi-Velez et al., 2014Doshi-Velez F. Ge Y. Kohane I. Comorbidity clusters in autism spectrum disorders: an electronic health record time-series analysis.Pediatrics. 2014; 133: e54-e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We labeled each of the 6-month windows with PheWAS codes (a simplified standard vocabulary [Denny et al., 2010Denny J.C. Ritchie M.D. Basford M.A. Pulley J.M. Bastarache L. Brown-Gentry K. Wang D. Masys D.R. Roden D.M. Crawford D.C. PheWAS: demonstrating the feasibility of a phenome-wide scan to discover gene-disease associations.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar] used in phenome-wide studies derived from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes that themselves are generated during billing for clinical care). We then clustered the patients so those who had similar co-morbidities at the same time in development would be lumped into the same cluster. This identified four clusters, one large heterogenous group and three other distinct ones: one characterized by seizures, one by multisystem disorders with immune dysregulation (e.g., infections and autoimmune diseases), and a third cluster of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, ADHD, anxiety). These three distinct clusters present distinct challenges for the patients and their families and were not revealed by the discovery of hundreds of genes identified in prior autism studies. Alone, this realization provides value to the families, much like for families with members with undiagnosed diseases, that the constellation of findings in the probands were part of a broader syndrome. The distinct clinical subgroups also provide a pathophysiological basis for genomic studies of a much more homogeneous group. This phenome-wide phenotype-first approach can be also used in molecular studies, as exemplified by our study of gene expression in the developing brain (Luo et al., 2020Luo Y. Eran A. Palmer N. Avillach P. Levy-Moonshine A. Szolovits P. Kohane I.S. A multidimensional precision medicine approach identifies an autism subtype characterized by dyslipidemia.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We specifically selected those genes that were the most divergent by sex in gene expression trajectories during development and then identified those that were discordant among affected family members in large multiplex studies of autism. Among the 33 neurodevelopmentally co-regulated, sex-differentially expressed clusters with autism-segregating deleterious variations, we identified a cluster involving lipid regulation and metabolism. After going from expression phenotype to genotype, we returned to phenotype by examining families with autism for evidence of dyslipidemia. Sorting through 2,750,021 patients seen at Boston Children’s Hospital, including 25,514 children with autism, we compared the results of common lipid lab tests between children with autism and matched individuals without autism. Several lipid profiles (e.g., cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides) were abnormal in the autism population, with odds rations from 1.33 to 1.69—all highly statistically significant differences. These odds ratios persisted after correcting for medication, obesity, and several other lipid-affecting disorders. Moreover, we used the family structures available in claims data to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia in 80,714 individuals with autism as compared to both unaffected siblings and unrelated matched controls. Here, we found highly significant odds ratios in the range of 1.3 to 1.5. Without the phenotype-genotype-phenotype investigational path we took here, this mechanistically related subgroup of autism would be non-obvious and difficult to extract. Yet understanding the disease mechanism in this subgroup will be important to their treatment and in anticipating the effectiveness of trials not specifically addressing the dyslipidemia. Although the low-cost phenotyping opportunities available through EHR and administrative/claims databases are useful and underused in exploring the architecture of neurological diseases, they have several shortcomings summarized in Table 1. Population researchers have therefore argued for more systematic accrual of data that includes both the genomic and phenotypic characterizations. One candidate for a better way is the UK Biobank— a large population cohort of adults aged 37 to 73 who underwent medical, sociodemographic, mental health, and cognitive assessment in 2006–2010. This national effort covers a half million individuals with extensive genomic data (ranging from SNP arrays to whole-exome and most recently, whole-genome sequencing). It combines both the low cost of EHR phenotyping as well as the prospective collection of formal questionnaires and a battery of standard blood tests and multiple disease registries. It further includes cognitive tests and high-quality cranial MRIs on at least 50,000 of the study participants. Most remarkably, all these data have been consented for broad sharing, and all that is required is a vetted IRB protocol and a nominal fee to conduct a previously impossible study that allows a highly iterative phenotype-genotype analysis to tease out the disease architecture of the common diseases. Because of the age range of the cohort at its inception, a small but steadily increasing fraction will be subject to neurodegenerative disease and will, therefore, present a unique opportunity. This will not be the case for diseases that are less common or in the pediatric age range. For example, if the prevalence of schizophrenia is 0.5%, we could expect approximately 2,500 cases in the UK Biobank, which is smaller than several existing cohorts. Other smaller biobanks in Estonia and Iceland, for example, have similar concerns, and the All Of Us cohort funded by the NIH will likely be only twice the size of the UK Biobank, although it will have a greater degree of diversity in the continents of origin of the participants. As impressive as these cohorts are, they do not provide neuroscience researchers with the kind of data on less common subgroups or even unique individuals that, through a prismatic example, can transform our understanding of basic mechanisms. For that, there is another rapidly growing opportunity that could cause a tectonic shift in our ability to quickly generate deeply phenotyped cohorts that include clinical results and documentation from hospitals. Until recently, the data that consumers had access to on their smartphones included the results from wearables and their own annotations, but not their clinical record. Led by Apple, now closely followed by Android, using the SMART-on-FHIR application programming interface (API), millions of US consumers (and recently, smaller numbers in the UK and Canada) now have full access to their clinical data on their smartphone from over 600 hospitals (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647). This also means that third-party apps on these smartphones, if authorized by the consumer, can share these data with researchers. This enables the creation of highly specific and targeted cohorts while taking advantage of the built-in low-cost clinical-grade, standardized phenotyping delivered through the API. It also enables direct communication, if consented, between researchers and patients without necessarily requiring the intermediary of a healthcare system. Use of these structured patient data with proper consent will open a new channel for very large-scale phenotyping, including fine-grained neurobehavioral characterizations absent from conventional health record systems as well as concurrent ‘omic characterization, without necessarily going through healthcare systems. In the last 15 years, the discoveries driven by a phenome-wide phenotype-first or phenotyping-concurrent-with-genomics characterization of patient populations have grown exponentially (e.g., from 2 to 82 publications per year) and will continue to grow, fueled by the increased availability of EHR and claims data. The challenge for the neuroscience research community is whether the cohorts currently available with low-cost and high-throughput phenotyping will be those of the greatest scientific interest and medical relevance. It may be that access to accurate and complete phenotyping data to match the growing trove of sequence data of the most relevant populations patients suffering from neurological disorders will require rethinking novel clinical research infrastructure, notably using direct-to-consumer outreach. Afforded by the democratization of the control of our own health data through smartphones and the rules emerging from the 21st Century Cures Act (and analogs in other countries), the neuroscience community now has the opportunity to establish a much broader platform that will not require prioritizing genomic sequencing or phenotyping but rather employ both approaches for the most robust integrative investigations."

Information on the process and impact of quality improvement at district and sub-district hospitals in India is limited. This implementation research was prioritized by the Haryana State (India) to improve the QoC for maternal and newborn care at the busy hospitals in districts.This study at nine district and sub-district referral hospitals in three districts (Faridabad, Rewari and Jhajjar) during April 2017-March 2019 adopted pre-post, quasi-experimental study design and plan-do-study-act quality improvement method. During the six quarterly plan-do-study-act cycles, the facility and district quality improvement teams led the gap identification, solution planning and implementation with external facilitation. The external facilitators monitored and collected data on indicators related to maternal and newborn service availability, patient satisfaction, case record quality, provider's knowledge and skills during the cycles. These indicators were compared between baseline (pre-intervention) and endline (post-intervention) cycles for documenting impact.The interventions closed 50% of gaps identified, increased the number of deliveries (1562 to 1631 monthly), improved care of pregnant women in labour with hypertension (1.2% to 3.9%, p<0.01) and essential newborn care services at birth (achieved ≥90% at most facilities). Antenatal identification of high-risk pregnancies increased from 4.1% to 8.8% (p<0.01). Hand hygiene practices improved from 35.7% to 58.7% (p<0.01). The case record completeness improved from 66% to 87% (p<0.01). The time spent in antenatal clinics declined by 19-42 minutes (p<0.01). The pooled patient satisfaction scores improved from 82.5% to 95.5% (p<0.01). Key challenges included manpower shortage, staff transfers, leadership change and limited orientation for QoC.This multipronged quality improvement strategy improved the maternal and newborn services, case documentation and patient satisfaction at district and sub-district hospitals. The processes and lessons learned shall be useful for replicating and scaling up."
https://openalex.org/W3185995575,"Moving in time with others-interpersonal coordination-increases affiliation, helping behaviours and gives rise to a host of other prosocial outcomes. Recent research suggests that merely imagining coordination may lead to similar social effects. In the present study, participants were asked to imagine walking with a crowd in a coordinated (versus uncoordinated) way to explore the effects of imagined coordination on individuals' perceptions of themselves and the crowd. Imagined coordination led to greater levels of deindividuation and affiliation. That is, participants were less likely to report seeing themselves as unique individuals, instead viewing themselves as a part of a group (deindividuation) and more likely to report a sense of emotional closeness (affiliation) with the imagined group. Deindividuation partially mediated the effect of imagined coordination on affiliation. This work establishes that imagined synchrony can be employed online to foster prosocial attitudes towards groups of people, and that a process of deindividuation might mediate this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3186357085,"It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an ""online television"" service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns."

Then, the specimens were drilled by a water jet or a high-speed dental drill. The cavities of 50 teeth were reconstructed digitally by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to measure the height and width. The cavities of 10 teeth were longitudinally incised and their surfaces were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). After the cavities were filled, 50 fillings were vertically incised. The bonding interface between tooth and filling was observed by SEM. 50 teeth with fillings were stained in 0.1% rhodamine B solution, and then the dye penetration between tooth and filling was observed under the stereomicroscope and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The bonding strength between enamel and filling of 50 teeth was simulated and predicted with finite element analysis (FEA). At 140-150 MPa and for 2-3 s, cavities were made with a depth of approximately 764 μm in each tooth. SEM showed the cavity surface in the water jet group had a more irregular concave and convex structure than that in the high-speed dental drill group. There was a trend that the microleakage and bonding width was smaller in the water jet group than in the high-speed dental drill group. FEA indicated that the stress on the resin surface was greater than on the enamel surface in the water jet group. Compared with the tooth drilled by a high-speed dental drill, the tooth drilled by a water jet gained better retention of the filling material and suffered less bonding strength on the enamel surface.

The prioritization by SecSel is based on evaluation of the local units of each feature. The evaluation metrics should be quantitative but need not be ratio scale. The minimum requirement of the input data is that they are ordinal. The conservation target is the number of local units with high values of each feature to be protected in the area. SecSel can handle conflicts among features, including conflicts between conservation and utilization of land or specific ecosystem functions. Before the selection procedure, one of a conflicting pair of features in a site is discarded. That decision is based on the dispensability of the local unit to fulfilling the conservation target of each feature. SecSel also considers the cost of including each site in the protected area and the compactness of the area in terms of total boundary length or the distance to the nearest site. To demonstrate the functionality of Secsel, we used it to design land use in an alpine region of northern Japan where conservation of alpine vegetation and its recreational use are important considerations."
https://openalex.org/W3185573384,"Auditory and visual percepts are integrated even when they are not perfectly temporally aligned with each other, especially when the visual signal precedes the auditory signal. This window of temporal integration for asynchronous audiovisual stimuli is relatively well examined in the case of speech, while other natural action-induced sounds have been widely neglected. Here, we studied the detection of audiovisual asynchrony in three different whole-body actions with natural action-induced sounds-hurdling, tap dancing and drumming. In Study 1, we examined whether audiovisual asynchrony detection, assessed by a simultaneity judgment task, differs as a function of sound production intentionality. Based on previous findings, we expected that auditory and visual signals should be integrated over a wider temporal window for actions creating sounds intentionally (tap dancing), compared to actions creating sounds incidentally (hurdling). While percentages of perceived synchrony differed in the expected way, we identified two further factors, namely high event density and low rhythmicity, to induce higher synchrony ratings as well. Therefore, we systematically varied event density and rhythmicity in Study 2, this time using drumming stimuli to exert full control over these variables, and the same simultaneity judgment tasks. Results suggest that high event density leads to a bias to integrate rather than segregate auditory and visual signals, even at relatively large asynchronies. Rhythmicity had a similar, albeit weaker effect, when event density was low. Our findings demonstrate that shorter asynchronies and visual-first asynchronies lead to higher synchrony ratings of whole-body action, pointing to clear parallels with audiovisual integration in speech perception. Overconfidence in the naturally expected, that is, synchrony of sound and sight, was stronger for intentional (vs. incidental) sound production and for movements with high (vs. low) rhythmicity, presumably because both encourage predictive processes. In contrast, high event density appears to increase synchronicity judgments simply because it makes the detection of audiovisual asynchrony more difficult. More studies using real-life audiovisual stimuli with varying event densities and rhythmicities are needed to fully uncover the general mechanisms of audiovisual integration."
https://openalex.org/W3186897205,"Substantial cross-sectional evidence and limited longitudinal research indicates that the availability of recreational facilities (e.g., parks, fitness centres) is associated with physical activity participation. However, few intervention trials have investigated how recreational infrastructure can be used to reduce inactivity levels in communities. The MOVE Frankston study aimed to assess the impact of low intensity strategies to promote use of a multi-purpose leisure and aquatic centre in a socioeconomically diverse, metropolitan community. This randomised controlled trial of two years' duration compared public awareness raising (control condition) with two interventions: mailed information about the centre and a free entry pass (I-O); and this minimal intervention supplemented by customer relations management support through telephone contact, mailed promotional materials and additional incentives (I+S). Participants (n = 1320) were inactive adults living in the City of Frankston, Melbourne Australia. There were 928 people (70.3%) followed up at 12 months (61.2% female, 52% ≥55 yrs). Compared with controls, attendance at the Centre once or more was higher in both the I-O (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28-2.50) and I+S groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.07). The proportion of people using the centre weekly did not differ by group. The odds of being in contemplation or preparation to use the Centre were higher in both the I-O (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.28-2.42) and I+S groups (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.06). Total physical activity and related social and cognitive factors did not differ between the groups. The findings show that the low intensity promotional strategies prompted occasional attendance and increased readiness to use this recreational facility, a level of behaviour change unlikely to reduce non-communicable disease risk. It is recommended that more frequent customer relations contact, and involvement of healthcare providers, be tested as strategies to encourage inactive adults to take up physical activity opportunities at recreational facilities of this type."
