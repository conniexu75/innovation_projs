https://openalex.org/W2014744284,"Giant Spin Hall One of the primary challenges in the field of spin-electronics, which exploits the electron's spin rather than its charge, is to create strong currents of electrons with polarized spins. One way to do this is to use a ferromagnet as a polarizer, a principle used in magnetic tunnel junctions; however, these devices suffer from reliability problems. An alternative is the spin Hall effect, where running a charge current through a material generates a spin current in the transverse direction, but the efficiency of this process tends to be small. Liu et al. (p. 555 ) now show that the spin Hall effect in Tantalum in its high-resistance β phase generates spin currents strong enough to induce switching of the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnet; at the same time, Ta does not cause energy dissipation in the ferromagnet. These properties allowed efficient and reliable operation of a prototype three-terminal device."

(p. 608 ) used a combination of microscopy, metagenomics, and metaproteomics to analyze samples from a North Sea diatom bloom over time. Distinct steps of polysaccharide degradation and carbohydrate uptake could be assigned to clades of Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which differ profoundly in their transporter profiles and their uptake systems for phosphorus. The phytoplankton/bacterioplankton coupling in coastal marine systems is of crucial importance for global carbon cycling. Bacterioplankton clade succession following phytoplankton blooms may be predictable enough that it can be included in models of global carbon cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2085256822,"The hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Hippocampal neurons in awake animals exhibit place field activity that encodes current location, as well as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity during which representations based on past experiences are often replayed. The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2088837665,"Give It Time Experimental ecological studies in recent years have provided a great deal of insight into how species diversify and influence ecosystem properties, but in most cases the experiments have been relatively brief (up to ∼5 years). Reich et al. (p. 589 ; see the Perspective by Cardinale ) performed two 13- and 15-year grassland experiments and found that the effects of plant species richness on community-level processes like biomass production tend to be saturating at early stages but that those impacts grow stronger and more linear as experiments run longer. Stronger influences through time were largely driven by increasing amounts of “complementarity” among species, and these trends were correlated with greater expression of functional diversity in multispecies assemblages. Thus, the effects of diversity grow stronger through time as species gain more and more opportunity to vary in their use of the limiting biological resources in their environment, which emphasizes the functional importance of maintaining diversity in ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2050302428,"Not Broken Until Repaired Humans, and indeed most eukaryotes, have linear chromosomes with two DNA ends, known as telomeres. Cells have evolved sophisticated systems to repair broken chromosomes, which specifically recognize DNA ends as damage. Telomeres are protected from these repair systems, which would otherwise wreak havoc in the cell, causing genome aberrations that, ironically, can lead to cancer. To understand all the possible threats to telomeres Sfeir and de Lange (p. 593 ) mutated components of the mouse shelterin protein complex, which forms a protective cap over the telomere ends, rendering telomeres completely devoid of the complex (and packaged only in nucleosomal chromatin). These “naked” telomeres were vulnerable to six DNA repair–related pathways: classical and alternative nonhomologous end joining; ATM and ATR signaling pathways; homology directed recombination; and unmitigated DNA resection."
https://openalex.org/W2048492290,"Blood Pressure Gauge Endothelial cells line blood vessels and, by interacting with smooth muscle, can help to control blood flow. Sonkusare et al. (p. 597 ; see the Perspective by Lederer et al. ) describe how signaling in endothelial cells controls contraction of surrounding smooth muscle cells, which provides an important mechanism for control of blood pressure. A calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein was expressed in endothelial cells of mouse arteries to image small changes in calcium concentration that appear to represent opening of single TRPV4 ion channels and consequent influx of calcium into the cell. Clustering of the channels allowed cooperative activation of a handful of channels, which appeared to produce a sufficient calcium signal to open another set of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. The resulting depolarization of the endothelial cells then passes an electrical connection to smooth muscle cells through gap junctions."

These tissues regenerate in response to damage. When the imaginal discs are injured or show tumor growth, they signal to the rest of the larval animal to slow down growth and delay morphogenesis. Garelli et al. (p. 579 ) and Colombani et al.

This collaboration ensures that adults attain the normal size and maintain appropriate proportions and symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2074327258,"Medical applications of nanotechnology typically focus on drug delivery and biosensors. Here, we combine nanotechnology and bioengineering to demonstrate that nanoparticles can be used to remotely regulate protein production in vivo. We decorated a modified temperature-sensitive channel, TRPV1, with antibody-coated iron oxide nanoparticles that are heated in a low-frequency magnetic field. When local temperature rises, TRPV1 gates calcium to stimulate synthesis and release of bioengineered insulin driven by a Ca(2+)-sensitive promoter. Studying tumor xenografts expressing the bioengineered insulin gene, we show that exposure to radio waves stimulates insulin release from the tumors and lowers blood glucose in mice. We further show that cells can be engineered to synthesize genetically encoded ferritin nanoparticles and inducibly release insulin. These approaches provide a platform for using nanotechnology to activate cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056756011,"Metabolic Networking Understanding complex biological networks, such as those underlying cellular metabolism, requires evaluation not only of the network connections but also the flux through the various biochemical pathways. Schuetz et al. (p. 601 ) explored the evolutionary constraints that appear to be most critical for the metabolic network in the bacteria Escherichia coli using a combination of experimental tests of reaction flux under various conditions along with mathematical modeling. As a pathway evolves, there are likely to be competing objectives that must be satisfied. Key objectives for the bacterium were strong performance under a given environmental condition, balanced by a requirement for adaptability—minimizing the adjustments required to respond to changed conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1970388843,"Not So Fast Recent observations of some of Greenland's outlet glaciers have shown large and rapid increases in the speeds at which their ice has streamed to the sea. Simple projections of ice loss and sea level rise, based only on these increases, result in alarmingly high values and correspondingly great public concern. In order to provide a more comprehensive and detailed picture of this type of ice sheet mass loss, Moon et al. (p. 576 ; see the cover) compiled a decade-long record of ice stream velocity measurements for nearly all of Greenland's major outlet glaciers. The pattern of flow variability around the ice sheet was both spatially and temporally complex, with clear differences between marine- and land-terminating types, as well as between regions. Furthermore, the integrated velocity of all of the outlet glaciers measured was considerably less than the upper bounds that have been proposed on the basis of a few rapidly accelerating locations, implying that sea level rise over the next century may be less than the 2 meters that have been suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2130888090,"To Silence or Not to Silence Repressed genes commonly have methylated DNA, and/or covalent histone modifications associated with silent chromatin, and/or associated small interfering (si)RNAs. All three features are components of gene-silencing systems (see the Perspective by Jacob and Martienssen ). In a screen for components of DNA methylation gene-silencing systems in the flowering plant, Moissiard et al. (p. 1448 , published online 3 May) identified the genes AtMoRC1 and AtMORC6 , which are homologs of the mouse Microrchidia1 gene. AtMORC1 and AtMORC6 are involved in silencing transposable elements and genes corresponding to DNA-methylated loci, and yet neither gene is required for maintenance of DNA methylation. Instead, AtMoRC1 and AtMORC6 are related to proteins that remodel chromatin superstructure, and they seem to control gene-silencing through the higher-order compaction of methylated and silent chromatin. Qian et al. (p. 1445 ) identified an Arabidopsis gene, IDM1 (increased DNA methylation 1), that is involved in regulating DNA methylation at loci enriched for repeats and multigene families containing highly homologous genes. IDM1 protects target genes from DNA silencing and recognizes both histone H3 and methylated DNA at target loci and is able to acetylate histone H3."

Unexpectedly, Khalil et al. (p. 1178 , published online 3 May; see the Perspective by Bannard and Cyster ) found that, in contrast to naïve B cells and B cells outside the germinal center, proximal signaling events are impaired downstream of the antigen receptor in mouse germinal center B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072660904,"Background HLA-DRB1*0401 is associated with susceptibility, while HLA-DRB1*0402 is associated with resistance to developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and collagen-induced arthritis in humans and transgenic mice respectively. The influence of gut-joint axis has been suggested in RA, though not yet proven. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used HLA transgenic mice carrying arthritis susceptible and -resistant HLA-DR genes to explore if genetic factors and their interaction with gut flora gut can be used to predict susceptibility to develop arthritis. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from the fecal microbiomes of DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0402 transgenic mice revealed that the guts of *0401 mice is dominated by a Clostridium-like bacterium, whereas the guts of *0402 mice are enriched for members of the Porphyromonadaceae family and Bifidobacteria. DRB1*0402 mice harbor a dynamic sex and age-influenced gut microbiome while DRB1*0401 mice did not show age and sex differences in gut microbiome even though they had altered gut permeability. Cytokine transcripts, measured by rtPCR, in jejuna showed differential TH17 regulatory network gene transcripts in *0401 and *0402 mice. Conclusions/Significance We have demonstrated for the first time that HLA genes in association with the gut microbiome may determine the immune environment and that the gut microbiome might be a potential biomarker as well as contributor for susceptibility to arthritis. Identification of pathogenic commensal bacteria would provide new understanding of disease pathogenesis, thereby leading to novel approaches for therapy."

Squyres et al. (p. 570 ) present a comprehensive analysis of the rim of this crater.

The size of the gap may depend on the position on the Fermi surface; in cuprates, the gap completely disappears at certain points. What happens in the pnictide superconductors is still a subject of debate, not least because there appear to be differences between the different pnictide families. Allan et al. (p. 563 ) used scanning tunneling spectroscopy to study the compound LiFeAs. The gap was mapped on three of the five bands on which the Fermi surface resides and was found to be anisotropic in momentum space."
https://openalex.org/W2020051447,"The platelet activation receptor CLEC-2 plays crucial roles in thrombosis/hemostasis, tumor metastasis, and lymphangiogenesis, although its role in thrombosis/hemostasis remains controversial. An endogenous ligand for CLEC-2, podoplanin, is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We and others have reported that CLEC-2-deficiency is lethal at mouse embryonic/neonatal stages associated with blood-filled lymphatics, indicating that CLEC-2 is essential for blood/lymphatic vessel separation. However, its mechanism, and whether CLEC-2 in platelets is necessary for this separation, remains unknown. We found that specific deletion of CLEC-2 from platelets leads to the misconnection of blood/lymphatic vessels. CLEC-2(+/+) platelets, but not by CLEC-2(-/-) platelets, inhibited LEC migration, proliferation, and tube formation but had no effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Additionally, supernatants from activated platelets significantly inhibited these three functions in LECs, suggesting that released granule contents regulate blood/lymphatic vessel separation. Bone morphologic protein-9 (BMP-9), which we found to be present in platelets and released upon activation, appears to play a key role in regulating LEC functions. Only BMP-9 inhibited tube formation, although other releasates including transforming growth factor-β and platelet factor 4 inhibited proliferation and/or migration. We propose that platelets regulate blood/lymphatic vessel separation by inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of LECs, mainly because of the release of BMP-9 upon activation by CLEC-2/podoplanin interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2081361522,"Accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) in cells from nonadipose tissues is known to induce lipotoxicity resulting in cellular dysfunction and death. The exact molecular pathways of PA-induced cell death are still mysterious. Here, we show that PA triggers autophagy, which did not counteract but in contrast promoted endothelial cell death. The PA-induced cell death was predominantly necrotic as indicated by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, absence of caspase activity, low levels of DNA hypoploidy, and an early ATP depletion. In addition PA induced a strong elevation of mRNA levels of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (CYLD), a known mediator of necroptosis. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CYLD significantly antagonized PA-induced necrosis of endothelial cells. In contrast, inhibition and knockdown of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) had no effect on PA-induced necrosis, indicating the induction of a CYLD-dependent but RIPK1-independent cell death pathway. PA was recognized as a strong and early inducer of autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy by both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic knockdown of the autophagy-specific genes, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34), and autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7), could rescue the PA-induced death of endothelial cells. Moreover, the initiation of autophagy and cell death by PA was reduced in endothelial cells loaded with the Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid-(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM), indicating that Ca(2+) triggers the fatal signaling of PA. In summary, we introduce an unexpected mechanism of lipotoxicity in endothelial cells and provide several novel strategies to counteract the lipotoxic signaling of PA."

Numerous experimental efforts to find a material with a truly fluctuating ground state have failed because ordering often sets in at a finite temperature owing to symmetry breaking. Nakatsuji et al. (p. 559 ; see the Perspective by Balents ) identify the compound Ba 3 CuSb 2 O 9 as a promising candidate for this state; the Cu-Sb dipoles reside on a hexagonal structure, forming fluctuating spin singlets. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the material does not order down to the millikelvin temperature range, remaining magnetically isotropic."

Nearly 20 years of research have uncovered roles for Htt in a wide range of cellular processes, and many of these discoveries stemmed from the identification of Htt-interacting proteins. However, no study has employed an impartial and comprehensive strategy to identify proteins that differentially associate with full-length wild-type and mutant Htt in brain tissue, the most relevant sample source to the disease condition. We analyzed Htt affinity-purified complexes from wild-type and HTT mutant juvenile mouse brain from two different biochemical fractions by tandem mass spectrometry. We compared variations in protein spectral counts relative to Htt to identify those proteins that are the most significantly contrasted between wild-type and mutant Htt purifications. Previously unreported Htt interactions with Myo5a, Prkra (PACT), Gnb2l1 (RACK1), Rps6, and Syt2 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Gene Ontology analysis of these and other Htt-associated proteins revealed a statistically significant enrichment for proteins involved in translation among other categories. Furthermore, Htt co-sedimentation with polysomes in cytoplasmic mouse brain extracts is dependent upon the presence of intact ribosomes. Finally, wild-type or mutant Htt overexpression inhibits cap-dependent translation of a reporter mRNA in an in vitro system.

SIRT1 activation is beneficial for several human diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, liver steatosis, and Alzheimer disease. We have recently shown that the protein deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) is a key regulator of SIRT1 activity in vivo. Furthermore, SIRT1 and DBC1 form a dynamic complex that is regulated by the energetic state of the organism. Understanding how the interaction between SIRT1 and DBC1 is regulated is therefore essential to design strategies aimed to activate SIRT1. Here, we investigated which pathways can lead to the dissociation of SIRT1 and DBC1 and consequently to SIRT1 activation. We observed that PKA activation leads to a fast and transient activation of SIRT1 that is DBC1-dependent. In fact, an increase in cAMP/PKA activity resulted in the dissociation of SIRT1 and DBC1 in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Pharmacological AMPK activation led to SIRT1 activation by a DBC1-dependent mechanism. Indeed, we found that AMPK activators promote SIRT1-DBC1 dissociation in cells, resulting in an increase in SIRT1 activity.

Although the literature regarding the physiological processes regulated by SIRT1 is vast, our knowledge about how this key enzyme is regulated in the cellular context is scarce. In this regard, several possible regulatory mechanisms have been described. One of the proposed mechanisms of SIRT1 regulation involves alterations in the intracellular concentration of NAD+. Because SIRT1 enzymatic activity is dependent on NAD+ (8Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Transcriptional silencing and longevity protein Sir2 is an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase.Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar), changes in the concentration of this nucleotide can lead to changes in SIRT1 activity. Indeed, modification of the two main enzymes responsible for the control of intracellular NAD+ levels, namely NamPT (9Revollo J.R. Grimm A.A. Imai S.

Moreover, it remains unknown whether global changes in NAD+ are reflected by similar changes in the nuclei where most SIRT1 is localized. Several authors have shown that SIRT1 can be regulated at the transcriptional level (7Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L.

So far it is unknown which are the molecular pathways that modulate the interaction between SIRT1 and DBC1 and consequently SIRT1 activity in vivo. Here, we show that the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway leads to SIRT1 activation through an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, this activation is DBC1-dependent and involves dissociation of the SIRT1-DBC1 complex. We propose that AMPK activation, either pharmacological or induced by PKA, results in the dissociation of SIRT1 from DBC1 and activation of SIRT1. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate the interaction between SIRT1 and DBC1 and may lead to newer pharmacological approaches to activate SIRT1.

HepG2, HEK 293T, and DBC1 and AMPK wild type (WT) and knock-out (KO) MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5 g/liter glucose), and A549 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, all of them supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For all the experiments, the cultures were serum-starved for 1 h before the treatments. AMPK α1/α2 WT and KO MEFs were a kind gift from Dr. Keith R. Laderoute. SIRT1 KO MEFS were kindly provided by Dr. David Sinclair. Transient overexpression of SIRT1 and DBC1 was performed under the conditions and using the vectors described previously (31Escande C. Chini C.C. Nin V. Dykhouse K.M. Novak C.M. Levine J. van Deursen J. Gores G.J. Chen J. Lou Z. Chini E.N.

The dominant-negative mutant of human AMPK α1 catalytic subunit (D157A) was kindly provided by Dr. David Carling. The constitutively active form of AMPK α1 was kindly provided by Dr. Benoit Viollet. Transient overexpression of these constructs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 h following the manufacturer's instructions. All siRNAs were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA duplex against DBC1 was 21 bp as follows: DBC1 siRNA sense strand, 5′-AAACGGAGCCUACUGAACAUU. SMARTpool siRNAs were used to knock down SIRT1. Non-targeting siRNA number 3 was used as a control (D001210-03-20). Transfections were performed with 150 nm siRNA using Darmaphect 1 (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 72 h after the transfection. Cultured cells were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 5 mm NaF, 50 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min under constant agitation and then centrifuged at 11,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 1–1.5 mg of protein were incubated with 20 μl of Protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and 1 μg of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. Nonspecific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was used as a control. Finally, immunoprecipitates were washed two times with cold NETN before addition of 2× Laemmli buffer. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies. Western blots were developed using secondary antibodies or protein A-HRP and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). SIRT1 activity was measured with a fluorometric assay (Enzo Life Sciences catalogue number BML-AK555-0001). Cells were extracted with NETN buffer as described above, and then the protein concentration in the lysates was quantified and equalized with deacetylase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C to allow for NAD+ degradation and incubated for 10 additional min with 2 μm DTT. Finally, 30–50 mg of protein of each sample were transferred to 6 wells of a 96-well plate, and a solution of deacetylase buffer containing 100 μm substrate and 5 μm trichostatin A was added to the wells. Half the wells included 100 μm NAD+. The reaction proceeded for 2 h at room temperature, and then the developer, prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations, was added for 1 h. Finally, the fluorescence was read with excitation of 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. SIRT1 activity was calculated as NAD+-dependent fluorescence. All the activity measurements were determined in the initial linear portion of the reaction. Cells were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS twice, harvested, and spun down. The cell pellet was extracted on ice with ice-cold 10% TCA and sonicated three times, and then the TCA was extracted with 2 volumes of an organic phase consisting of 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluroethane and trioctylamine in a 3:1 ratio. Both phases were vigorously vortexed for 15 s and then allowed to separate for 3 min. The pH of the top aqueous layer containing NAD+ was adjusted with 1 m Tris, pH 8. The NAD+ concentration was measured by means of an enzymatic cycling assay. Briefly, the aqueous layer was incubated with a 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8 buffer containing 0.76% ethanol, 4 mm flavine mononucleotide (FMN), 27 units/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 0.4 unit/ml diaphorase, and 8 μm rezarsurin. A standard curve for NAD+ was included. The fluorescence in the samples was followed with excitation at 544 nm and emission at 590 nm. Measurements were made in triplicates. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-SIRT1 or with FLAG-SIRT1 and constitutively active (CA) AMPK. After 48 of transfection, the medium was replaced with phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with H332PO4 (0.5 mCi/ml). Cells were incubated in this medium for 2 h. After that, the medium was replaced with regular DMEM. Cells were stimulated with the AMPK activator resveratrol for 2 h. After that, SIRT1 was immunoprecipitated, and 32P incorporation was evidenced by electrophoresis and autoradiography. Mutagenesis was performed on FLAG-SIRT1 using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit from Agilent Technologies following the manufacturer's instructions. Values are presented as mean ± S.E. of three to five experiments unless otherwise indicated. The significance of differences between means was assessed by ANOVA or two-tailed Student's t test as indicated. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Cellular SIRT1 activity and activation were determined with a SIRT1 fluorometric kit (Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay has been extensively characterized in our laboratory (14Aksoy P. Escande C. White T.A. Thompson M. Soares S. Benech J.C. Chini E.N.

https://openalex.org/W2003222358,"Most of the proteins carrying the 23-residue MutT-related sequence are capable of hydrolyzing compounds with a general structure of nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety X and are called the Nudix hydrolases. Among the 22 human Nudix proteins (identified by the sequence signature), some remain uncharacterized as enzymes without a defined substrate. Here, we reveal that the NUDT18 protein, whose substrate was unknown, can degrade 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua)-containing nucleoside diphosphates to the monophosphates. Because this enzyme is closely related to MTH1 (NUDT1) and MTH2 (NUDT15), we propose that it should be named MTH3. Although these three human proteins resemble each other in their sequences, their substrate specificities differ considerably. MTH1 cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP but not 8-oxo-dGDP, whereas MTH2 can degrade both 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dGDP, although the intrinsic enzyme activity of MTH2 is considerably lower than that of MTH1. On the other hand, MTH3 is specifically active against 8-oxo-dGDP and hardly cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP. Other types of oxidized nucleoside diphosphates, 2-hydroxy-dADP and 8-hydroxy-dADP, were also hydrolyzed by MTH3. Another notable feature of the MTH3 enzyme is its action toward the ribonucleotide counterpart. MTH3 can degrade 8-oxo-GDP as efficiently as 8-oxo-dGDP, which is in contrast to the finding that MTH1 and MTH2 show a limited activity against the ribonucleotide counterpart, 8-oxo-GTP. These three enzymes may function together to help maintain the high fidelity of DNA replication and transcription under oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W1996586389,"Heparan sulfate (HS) has been implicated in regulating cell fate decisions during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into advanced cell types. However, the necessity and the underlying molecular mechanisms of HS in early cell lineage differentiation are still largely unknown. In this study, we examined the potential of EXT1(-/-) mouse ESCs (mESCs), that are deficient in HS, to differentiate into primary germ layer cells. We observed that EXT1(-/-) mESCs lost their differentiation competence and failed to differentiate into Pax6(+)-neural precursor cells and mesodermal cells. More detailed analyses highlighted the importance of HS for the induction of Brachyury(+) pan-mesoderm as well as normal gene expression associated with the dorso-ventral patterning of mesoderm. Examination of developmental cell signaling revealed that EXT1 ablation diminished FGF and BMP but not Wnt signaling. Furthermore, restoration of FGF and BMP signaling each partially rescued mesoderm differentiation defects. We further show that BMP4 is more prone to degradation in EXT1(-/-) mESCs culture medium compared with that of wild type cells. Therefore, our data reveal that HS stabilizes BMP ligand and thereby maintains the BMP signaling output required for normal mesoderm differentiation. In summary, our study demonstrates that HS is required for ESC pluripotency, in particular lineage specification into mesoderm through facilitation of FGF and BMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2040273493,"Activation of PI3-K-AKT and ERK pathways is a complication of mTOR inhibitor therapy. Newer mTOR inhibitors (like pp242) can overcome feedback activation of AKT in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. We, thus, studied if feedback activation of ERK is still a complication of therapy with such drugs in this tumor model. PP242 induced ERK activation in MM cell lines as well as primary cells. Surprisingly, equimolar concentrations of rapamycin were relatively ineffective at ERK activation. Activation was not correlated with P70S6kinase inhibition nor was it prevented by PI3-kinase inhibition. ERK activation was prevented by MEK inhibitors and was associated with concurrent stimulation of RAF kinase activity but not RAS activation. RAF activation correlated with decreased phosphorylation of RAF at Ser-289, Ser-296, and Ser-301 inhibitory residues. Knockdown studies confirmed TORC1 inhibition was the key proximal event that resulted in ERK activation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of eIF-4E blunted pp242-induced ERK phosphorylation. Since pp242 was more potent than rapamycin in causing sequestering of eIF-4E, a TORC1/4E-BP1/eIF-4E-mediated mechanism of ERK activation could explain the greater effectiveness of pp242. Use of MEK inhibitors confirmed ERK activation served as a mechanism of resistance to the lethal effects of pp242. Thus, although active site mTOR inhibitors overcome AKT activation often seen with rapalog therapy, feedback ERK activation is still a problem of resistance, is more severe than that seen with use of first generation rapalogs and is mediated by a TORC1- and eIF-4E-dependent mechanism ultimately signaling to RAF.

Thus, although active site mTOR inhibitors overcome AKT activation often seen with rapalog therapy, feedback ERK activation is still a problem of resistance, is more severe than that seen with use of first generation rapalogs and is mediated by a TORC1- and eIF-4E-dependent mechanism ultimately signaling to RAF. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 2The abbreviations used are: mTORmammalian target of rapamycinTORCtarget of rapamycin complexeIFeukaryotic translation initiation factorMMmultiple myelomaRBDRas-binding domain. is critical for tumor growth and, thus, has become a popular target for new therapeutics (reviewed in Ref. 1Alessi D.R. Pearce L.R. Garcia-Martinez J.M. Early events of B cell activation by antigen.Science Signaling. 2009; 2: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, targeting mTOR therapeutically with rapamycin or related rapalogs, can be complicated by several feedback loops whereby compensatory pathways are activated. These drugs primarily target the TORC1 complex and inhibit by an allosteric mechanism. TORC1 inhibition prevents the ability of mTOR or its p70S6kinase substrate to inhibit insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The de-repression of IRS-1 hyperactivates the insulin growth factor-1(IGF-1) receptor/PI3-K/AKT signaling pathway and up-regulation of AKT activity limits anti-tumor effects of rapalog mTOR inhibitors. This occurs in multiple myeloma (MM) cells (2Shi Y. Yan H. Frost P. Gera J. Lichtenstein A.

MTOR also participates in a second kinase complex called TORC2. AKT is a TORC2 substrate with TORC2-mediated phosphorylation occurring on serine 473 of AKT. As Ser-473 phosphorylation is required for full activation of AKT, newer 2nd generation mTOR inhibitors, which competitively inhibit at the ATP-binding site of mTOR (termed active site mTOR inhibitors), have been developed that can inhibit TORC2 as well as TORC1. PP242 is an example of an active site inhibitor whose activity has been previously described (5Hoang B. Frost P. Shi Y. Belanger E. Benavides A. Pezeshkpour G. Cappia S. Guglielmelli T. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. Targeting TORC2 in multiple myeloma with a new mTOR kinase inhibitor.Blood. 2010; 116: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In a prior study (5Hoang B. Frost P. Shi Y. Belanger E. Benavides A. Pezeshkpour G. Cappia S. Guglielmelli T. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. Targeting TORC2 in multiple myeloma with a new mTOR kinase inhibitor.Blood. 2010; 116: 4560-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we demonstrated the ability of pp242 to inhibit TORC1 and TORC2 in MM cells and induce a significantly greater anti-MM effect when compared with rapamycin. Although newer 2nd generation TORC1/TORC2 inhibitors may overcome the PI3-K/AKT feedback loop by inhibiting AKT phosphorylation, a second potentially complicating compensatory pathway is the ERK MAPK cascade, which can also be activated subsequent to mTOR inhibition. Previous work (6Carracedo A. Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Rojo F. Salmena L. Alimonti A. Egia A. Sasaki A.T. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Papa A. Nardella C. Cantley L.C. Baselga J. Pandolfi P.P. Inhibition of mTORC1 leads to MAPK pathway activation through a PI3K-dependent feedback loop in human cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3065-3074PubMed Google Scholar) with rapalogs, like rapamycin and everolimus, have demonstrated such feedback activation. However, it is unknown whether ERK activation occurs with use of 2nd generation active site mTOR inhibitors. We, thus, initiated the current study to test if ERK activation also occurred in MM cells exposed to pp242 and to identify if this was a mechanism of resistance. Our results surprisingly demonstrate pp242 is considerably more effective than rapamycin on a molar basis as an ERK activator, that ERK activation was regulated by effects on 4E-BP1/eIF4E and RAF and that such activation restricts pp242's anti-MM efficacy. All MM lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) except for ANBL-6 which was a kind gift from Dr. Brian Van Ness (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). PP242 was purchased from Chemdea Pharmaceuticals (Ridgewood, NJ) and was dissolved in DMSO. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology unless otherwise specified. The short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)/pLKO.1 targeting rictor and raptor and the control scrambled sequence were obtained from Addgene and previously described (7Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Phosphorylation and regulation of Akt/PKB by the rictor-mTOR complex.Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Lentiviral shRNA production and infection was performed as previously described (8Sharma S. Nemeth E. Chen Y.H. Goodnough J. Huston A. Roodman G.D. Ganz T. Lichtenstein A. Involvement of hepcidin in the anemia of multiple myeloma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 3262-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After infection, clones were selected in puromycin. The HA-tagged eif4e full-length coding sequence was isolated from pHA-eif4e (obtained from Addgene, plasmid 17343) by PCR, using primers Spe1HA-eif4e (5-AAAGACTAGTATGTACCCATACGACGTCCC-3) and Xho1HA-eif4e (5-GATGCATGCTCGAGTTAAACA-3) to produce 5′-Spe1HA-eif4eXho1–3′ PCR product. Insert from pLenti6/gfp-lc3 vector was removed by Spe1/Xho1 digestion and replaced with Spe1/Xho1-digested HA-eif4e to yield pLenti6HA-eif4e. The pLenti6-ev (empty vector) plasmid was generated by removing the insert from pLenti6/gfp-lc3 with Spe1/Xho1. Lentivirus was produced by the UCLA Vector Core facility. To make HA-eif4e expressing stable lines, cells (1 × 106) were infected with empty vector (EV) or HA-eif4e lentivirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with polybrene (8 μg/ml) overnight. After virus was removed, cells were selected with 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) to generate stable cell lines. For transient transfection, cells were similarly infected and assayed 72 h later without selection in blasticidin. Primary MM cells were purified from bone marrow of patients by negative selection as described (2Shi Y. Yan H. Frost P. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors activate the AKT kinase in multiple myeloma cells by up-regulating the insulin-like growth factor receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascade.Mol.

The project was approved by the IRB of the VA and all participants gave written informed consent. Apoptosis was identified (as described in Ref. 5Hoang B. Frost P. Shi Y. Belanger E. Benavides A. Pezeshkpour G. Cappia S. Guglielmelli T. Gera J. Lichtenstein A.

The data is presented as % apoptosis above control (no drug exposure). The control apoptosis for 8226 and MM1.S cells was very low (always <10%). The caspase 3-PE and annexin-V-FITC antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Cell extracts were incubated with m7GTP-Sepharose to precipitate eIF-4E as previously described (9Shi Y. Gera J. Hu L. Hsu J.H. Bookstein R. Li W. Lichtenstein A. Enhanced sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells containing PTEN mutations to CCI-779.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5027-5034PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitate was then immunoblotted for eIF-4E, 4E-BP1, and eIF-4G. The ERK in vitro kinase assay (Cell Signaling) was performed as previously described (10Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. Cyclin D1 and c-myc internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation is regulated by AKT activity and enhanced by rapamycin through a p38 MAPK- and ERK-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Phospho-ERK was immunoprecipitated and tested for its ability to phosphorylate ELK-1 in vitro. ELK-1 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with a phospho-ELK-1 (Ser-383) antibody. The RAF in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously described (11Bondzi C. Grant S. Krystal G.W. A novel assay for the measurement of Raf-1 kinase activity.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5030-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated, RAF-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-RAF-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or nonspecific IgG and the immunoprecipitates were tested for their ability to phosphorylate recombinant MEK-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) determined by immunoblot with a polyclonal phospho-MEK antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass). Kinase activity was calculated by densitometric analysis of the ratio of phospho-MEK to the immunoprecipitated RAF. This ratio was arbitrarily made 1 in control cells (no pp242 treatment). To assay GTP loading of RAS, we used a GST-RAF pull-down assay kit from Millipore (Temecula, CA). As described (12Reynolds L.F. de Bettignies C. Norton T. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Tybulewicz V.L. Vav1 transduces T cell receptor signals to the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway via LAT, Sos, and RasGRP1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18239-18246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the GST-RAF fusion protein contains the RAS-binding domain of RAF which specifically binds to RAS-GTP (activated RAS) but not RAS-GDP (inactivated RAS). Cell lysates are incubated with beads coated with the GST-RAF fusion protein. Beads are washed, and bound protein was eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblot with a pan-RAS antibody. Quantitative increases in protein phosphorylation on Western blots were evaluated by densitometric analysis of ratio of phosphorylated-protein/total protein signal of treated MM cells. All Western blots were repeated 3–4 times and the mean fold increase (n = 3) in drug-treated groups versus non-treated cells is shown under the gels in the figures. The t test was used to determine significance of differences between groups. The viable recovery and apoptosis data shown in Fig. 7 are means (n = 4). The SDs of all groups were <5% of the means. Percent viable recovery is determined by enumeration of trypan blue-negative viable cells with comparison to that of cells not exposed to any drugs. Percent apoptosis is determined by FACs enumeration of activated caspase 3-positive cells or annexin-V-positive cells and presented as % apoptosis above control (cells not exposed to any drugs). Apoptosis of control cells was always <10%. The effect of combining pp242 with MEK inhibitors on induction of apoptosis was assessed by the median effect method using Calcusyn Software Version 1.1.1 (Biosoft). Combination indices (CI) values were calculated using the most conservative assumption of mutually nonexclusive drug interactions. CI values were calculated from median results of apoptosis assays. Initially, 8226 and MM1.S MM cell lines were exposed to increasing concentrations of either rapamycin (rap) or the TORC1/TORC2 active kinase inhibitor pp242 for 30 min. Fig. 1A is a representative experiment (n = 4) that demonstrates both mTOR inhibitors enhanced phosphorylation of ERK but that pp242 was much more effective on a molar basis. This dose response experiment was repeated three additional times with identical results. By densitometry, the mean increase (n = 4) in phosphorylated ERK expression (phospho-ERK/total ERK ratio) in these experiments is shown below the gels as “fold increase.” For 8226 cells, a significant increase in phosphorylation of ERK (p < 0.05 shown by * in the figures) is not seen until 500 nm of Rap is used while a significant increase is identified at 100 nm of pp242. For the MM1.S cell line, similar results are seen with an increase in phosphorylated ERK only present at 1000 nm rap but obvious at the lowest concentration (100 nm) of pp242. In our previous work (2Shi Y. Yan H. Frost P. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors activate the AKT kinase in multiple myeloma cells by up-regulating the insulin-like growth factor receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascade.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), much lower concentrations of rapamycin effectively activated the PI3K-AKT feedback pathway in these MM cell lines. Thus, ERK activation appears to be relatively resistant to rapamycin at least in MM cell lines. Additional experiments in two more MM cell lines (U266 and ANBL-6) demonstrated identical results (supplemental Fig. S1) with significant ERK phosphorylation present at the lowest concentration of pp242 (100 nm) while rapamycin was ineffective. Prior work (3O'Reilly K.E. Rojo F. She Q.B. Solit D. Mills G.B. Smith D. Lane H. Hofmann F. Hicklin D.J. Ludwig D.L. Baselga J. Rosen N. mTOR inhibition induces upstream receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and activates Akt.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar) demonstrates that rapalog-induced activation of PI3K-AKT can be secondary to inhibition of p70S6K, preventing P70's ability to negatively regulate IRS-1 signaling to PI3K. If a similar mechanism was involved in ERK activation, a plausible explanation for pp242's more potent activation could be that it causes a more profound inhibition of p70S6K. However, rapamycin was comparable to pp242 in preventing p70S6K phosphorylation on Thr-389. As shown in Fig. 1A (lowest gels), p70 phosphorylation was ablated by concentrations of 100 nm of both rapamycin and pp242. However, only pp242 activated ERK at these low concentrations. To more directly ascertain if induction of ERK phosphorylation results in activation of ERK activity, we performed an ERK in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, pp242 was considerably more effective than an equimolar concentration of rapamycin in increasing the ability of immunoprecipitated ERK to phosphorylate ELK-1. The increase in ERK kinase activity was comparable to that achieved with interleukin-6 (IL-6), a well established MM growth factor (13Kawano M. Hirano T. Matsuda T. Taga T. Horii Y. Iwato K. Asaoku H. Tang B. Tanabe O. Tanaka H. Kuramoto A. Kishimoto T. Autocrine generation and requirement of BSF-2/IL-6 for human multiple myelomas.Nature. 1988; 332: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C also demonstrates that pp242 can enhance ERK phosphorylation in primary MM cells. A previous study (6Carracedo A. Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Rojo F. Salmena L. Alimonti A. Egia A. Sasaki A.T. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Papa A. Nardella C. Cantley L.C. Baselga J. Pandolfi P.P. Inhibition of mTORC1 leads to MAPK pathway activation through a PI3K-dependent feedback loop in human cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3065-3074PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that rapamycin's ability to induce ERK phosphorylation was ablated by PI3-K inhibitors and p70S6K knock down. These data pointed to the well known p70S6K/PI3-K feedback loop as mediating ERK activation. However, as mentioned above, pp242-induced ERK activation did not correlate with p70S6K inhibition. To further test if feedback activation of PI3-K was involved, we co-incubated cell lines with pp242 ± the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin. Wortmannin, in the concentrations used, was very effective in preventing IGF-1-stimulated PI3-K-mediated AKT phosphorylation in these same cells (Fig 2A). However, wortmannin had little effect on IGF-1's ability to enhance MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) suggesting no connection between PI3-K and the MEK/ERK pathway at least for MM cells stimulated by IGF-1. More importantly, wortmannin also had little effect on pp242-induced ERK phosphorylation in MM1.S MM cells (Fig. 2B). PP242 effectively activated ERK phosphorylation (compare control lane A to lanes H & I). Addition of wortmannin at 0.25 μm, a concentration that prevented PI3K activity in IGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A), had no effect against 0.25 μm pp242 (compare lanes C–H) and little effect against 1 μm pp242 (compare lanes D and I) in MM1S cells. Similar data were obtained in 8226 cells (supplemental Fig. S2) where the higher concentration of wortmannin, 1 μm, had no inhibitory effect against pp242-activated ERK, although a lower concentration (0.25 μm) had a modest unexplained effect. Collectively, these data indicated that PI3K activity was not involved in pp242-induced ERK activation. To independently gain further support for the notion that the PI3K pathway is not involved in ERK activation in MM cells exposed to pp242, we tested effects of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NEV-BEZ 235 (Fig. 2C). NEV-BEZ is an active site mTOR inhibitor (i.e. competitive inhibition at the ATP-binding site) with additional negative effects on PI3-K activity when used in MM cells (14McMillin D.W. Ooi M. Delmore J. Negri J. Hayden P. Mitsiades N. Jakubikova J. Maira S.M. Garcia-Echeverria C. Schlossman R. Munshi N.C. Richardson P.G. Anderson K.C. Mitsiades C.S. Antimyeloma activity of the orally bioavailable dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5835-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) Treatment of MM1.S cells with BEZ at 100 nm inhibited TORC1 activity, shown as inhibited S6 phosphorylation, and inhibited PI3K-AKT activation shown as inhibited AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). However, even with inhibition of PI3K-AKT, ERK activation was identified in NEV-BEZ-treated cells albeit after a longer incubation duration (3.2× fold increase at 3 h). Collectively, these data indicate that feedback activation of ERK subsequent to inhibition of mTOR with active-site inhibitors is not mediated by stimulation of the PI3K pathway. To initially test if ERK activation required input from MEK, we used the U0126 MEK inhibitor at 0.25, 1, and 5 μm. In both MM cell lines, U0126 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in pp242-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). PP242 was used at 500 nm in these experiments to induce a robust activation of ERK. ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by >70% when both pp242-treated cell lines were co-cultured with 250 nm U0126, inhibited by 90% when 1 μm U0126 was used, and completely ablated when 5 μm was used. As U0126 at these concentrations can inhibit both MEK 5 as well as MEK 1/2, we also tested a MEK inhibitor, CI1040 (15Solit D.B. Garraway L.A. Pratilas C.A. Sawai A. Getz G. Basso A. Ye Q. Lobo J.M. She Y. Osman I. Golub T.R. Sebolt-Leopold J. Sellers W.R. Rosen N. BRAF mutation predicts sensitivity to MEK inhibition.Nature. 2006; 439: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) with relative specificity for MEK 1/2 when used at concentrations of 250 nm to 2 μm (i.e. CI1040-induced MEK 5 inhibition requires 100× fold higher concentrations (16Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. Effects of MAP kinase cascade inhibitors on the MKK5/ERK5 pathway.FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). CI1040 is also more clinically relevant and is currently in clinical trials. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3, CI1040 at 250 or 1000 nm abrogated pp242-ERK activation. The finding that the MEK inhibitors prevented pp242-enhanced ERK phosphorylation suggested that MEK 1/2 was activated immediately upstream of ERK. As shown in Fig. 3B, pp242 exposure results in enhanced MEK phosphorylation (6.2 and 7.1× fold increase at 250 and 1000 nm pp242) which was comparable to that resulting from IGF-1 stimulation. To test for RAF activation upstream of MEK, we performed an in vitro kinase assay where immunoprecipitated RAF was tested for its ability to phosphorylate MEK 1/2. As shown in Fig. 3C, RAF kinase activity was significantly increased by pp242 at 250 and 1000 nm, with even greater effects than seen with IGF-1, used as a positive control. In addition, pretreatment with several raf inhibitors for 1 h prevented ERK phosphorylation by pp242 (Fig. 3D). These include sorafenib (17Wilhelm S.M. Carter C. Tang L. Wilkie D. McNabola A. Rong H.

Sharma S.V. Shioda T. McDermott U. Ulman M. Ulkus L.E. Dias-Santagata D. Stubbs H. Lee D.Y. Singh A. Drew L. Haber D.A. Settleman J.

Differential effects of kinase cascade inhibitors on neoplastic and cytokine-mediated cell proliferation.Leukemia. 2003; 17: 1765-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The latter two RAF inhibitors are of particular interest because of their relative RAF specificity. These results further support a pp242-induced Raf activation paradigm. To test if RAF/MEK activation was downstream of RAS stimulation, we assayed the ability of a GST-RAF fusion protein to pull-down RAS from cell lysates (Fig. 3E). GST-RAF contains the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf and, only if RAS is activated and GTP-bound, will it be capable of binding to GST-RAF. MM cells were treated with or without pp242 or with IGF-1 as a positive control. Cell lysates were then incubated with GST-RAF and associated GTP-bound RAS assessed by immunoblot assay with a pan-RAS antibody. GST-RAF pull down from lysates of MM cells treated with IGF demonstrates a modest but significant increase in associated RAS versus control non-treated cells. However, exposure of cells to pp242, which activated ERK in whole cell lysates, demonstrates no increase in RAS bound to GST-RAF. Immunoblot of whole cell lysates also confirm equal quantities of Ras were present in lysates before GST-RAF pull-down. Thus, although pp242 activates RAF, MEK, and ERK, it does not stimulate GTP-loading of RAS. Since the phosphorylated state of specific residues on RAF can regulate the activation status of RAF (20Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Mechanisms of regulating the Raf kinase family.Cellular Signalling. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), we assessed the phosphorylation profile on pp242-treated cells by immunoblot (fig 4). Ser-338 is a RAS-inducible activating phosphorylation site and is critical for RAF activation. Its phosphorylation was not significantly affected by pp242 treatment (Fig. 4A) in line with the previous data indicating absence of associated RAS activation (Fig. 3E). Ser-259 and Ser-621 are 14-3-3 interacting sites on RAF which facilitate binding to 14-3-3 which maintains RAF in an auto-inhibited state. In addition, Ser-259 is an AKT substrate and, since pp242 rapidly inhibits TORC2-induced AKT activation, we strongly considered the possibility that Ser-259 phosphorylation could be dampened, resulting in RAF activation. However, the 14-3-3 sites, Ser-259 and Ser-621, were not affected in their phosphorylation status (Fig. 4A). Additional experiments that demonstrated no significant effect of pp242 on the ability of 14-3-3 to bind RAF (supplemental Fig. S4) further support that RAF activation does not occur by alteration of these phosphorylation sites. We next analyzed inhibitory RAF residues that are involved in negative feedback regulation (21Dougherty M.K. Müller J. Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Zhou X.Z. Copeland T.D. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Lu K.P. Morrison D.K. Regulation of Raf-1 by direct feedback phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Ser-29, Ser-43, Ser-289, Ser-296, Ser-301, and Ser-642 are phosphorylated by ERK with resulting inhibition of activity. These phosphorylation events are also regulated by the PP2A phosphatase (21Dougherty M.K. Müller J. Ritt D.A. Zhou M. Zhou X.Z. Copeland T.D. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Lu K.P. Morrison D.K. Regulation of Raf-1 by direct feedback phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 215-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Using two independent antibodies, phosphorylation of these residues was significantly decreased by pp242 in both cell lines (Fig. 4B). This is most clearly seen with the Ser-296 phosphospecific antibody but also with the second phospho-specific antibody, especially in 8226 cells. Presumably, this effect releases RAF from an inhibitory influence of basal ERK phosphorylation. Because we never observed an ERK inhibition preceding pp242-induced activation, a good possibility is that pp242 is activating the PP2A phosphatase. We also considered the possibility that the mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242 was inducing RAF activation in a similar mechanism to what occurs when B-RAF kinase inhibitors are used which induces paradoxical C-RAF activation via enhanced B-RAF:C-RAF dimerization (22Heidorn S.J. Milagre C. Whittaker S. Nourry A. Niculescu-Duvas I. Dhomen N. Hussain J. Reis-Filho J.S. Springer C.J. Pritchard C. Marais R.

https://openalex.org/W1980884932,"The rate-limiting step of folding of the collagen triple helix is catalyzed by cyclophilin B (CypB). The G6R mutation in cyclophilin B found in the American Quarter Horse leads to autosomal recessive hyperelastosis cutis, also known as hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia. The mutant protein shows small structural changes in the region of the mutation at the side opposite the catalytic domain of CypB. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of the mutant CypB is normal when analyzed in vitro. However, the biosynthesis of type I collagen in affected horse fibroblasts shows a delay in folding and secretion and a decrease in hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine. This leads to changes in the structure of collagen fibrils in tendon, similar to those observed in P3H1 null mice. In contrast to cyclophilin B null mice, where little 3-hydroxylation was found in type I collagen, 3-hydroxylation of type I collagen in affected horses is normal. The mutation disrupts the interaction of cyclophilin B with the P-domain of calreticulin, with lysyl hydroxylase 1, and probably other proteins, such as the formation of the P3H1·CypB·cartilage-associated protein complex, resulting in less effective catalysis of the rate-limiting step in collagen folding in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rate-limiting step of folding of the collagen triple helix is catalyzed by cyclophilin B (CypB). The G6R mutation in cyclophilin B found in the American Quarter Horse leads to autosomal recessive hyperelastosis cutis, also known as hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia. The mutant protein shows small structural changes in the region of the mutation at the side opposite the catalytic domain of CypB. The peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of the mutant CypB is normal when analyzed in vitro. However, the biosynthesis of type I collagen in affected horse fibroblasts shows a delay in folding and secretion and a decrease in hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl hydroxylysine. This leads to changes in the structure of collagen fibrils in tendon, similar to those observed in P3H1 null mice. In contrast to cyclophilin B null mice, where little 3-hydroxylation was found in type I collagen, 3-hydroxylation of type I collagen in affected horses is normal. The mutation disrupts the interaction of cyclophilin B with the P-domain of calreticulin, with lysyl hydroxylase 1, and probably other proteins, such as the formation of the P3H1·CypB·cartilage-associated protein complex, resulting in less effective catalysis of the rate-limiting step in collagen folding in the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2050417522,"Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) promotes renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo and the expression of mesenchymal genes in vitro; however, most of its direct targets in epithelial cells are still elusive. In a screen for genes directly activated by TGF-β, we found that components of the Wnt signaling pathway, especially Wnt11, were targets of activation by TGF-β and Smad3 in primary renal epithelial cells. In gain and loss of function experiments, Wnt11 mediated the actions of TGF-β through enhanced activation of mesenchymal marker genes, such as Zeb1, Snail1, Pai1, and αSMA, without affecting Smad3 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Wnt11 by receptor knockdown or treatment with Wnt inhibitors limited the effects of TGF-β on gene expression. We found no evidence that Wnt11 activated the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in renal epithelial cells; rather, the function of Wnt11 was mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Consistent with the in vitro results, all the TGF-β, Wnt11, and JNK targets were activated in a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of renal fibrosis in vivo. Our findings demonstrated cooperativity among the TGF-β, Wnt11, and JNK signaling pathways and suggest new targets for anti-fibrotic therapy in renal tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2084841940,"Human HTRA1 is a highly conserved secreted serine protease that degrades numerous extracellular matrix proteins. We have previously identified HTRA1 as being up-regulated in osteoarthritic patients and as having the potential to regulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in synovial fibroblasts through the generation of fibronectin fragments. In the present report, we have extended these studies and investigated the role of HTRA1 in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. HTRA1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in degenerated disc tissue and was associated with increased protein levels. However, these increases did not correlate with the appearance of rs11200638 single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the HTRA1 gene, as has previously been suggested. Recombinant HTRA1 induced MMP production in IVD cell cultures through a mechanism critically dependent on MEK but independent of IL-1β signaling. The use of a catalytically inactive mutant confirmed these effects to be primarily due to HTRA1 serine protease activity. HTRA1-induced fibronectin proteolysis resulted in the generation of various sized fragments, which when added to IVD cells in culture, caused a significant increase in MMP expression. Furthermore, one of these fragments was identified as being the amino-terminal fibrin- and heparin-binding domain and was also found to be increased within HTRA1-treated IVD cell cultures as well as in disc tissue from patients with IVD degeneration. Our results therefore support a scenario in which HTRA1 promotes IVD degeneration through the proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin and subsequent activation of resident disc cells.

The pathogenesis of degeneration is a highly complex and poorly understood process with many different genetic, biological, and mechanical influences playing key roles in the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) components (3Freemont A.J. Watkins A. Le Maitre C. Jeziorska M. Hoyland J.A. Current understanding of cellular and molecular events in intervertebral disc degeneration. Implications for therapy.J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The predominant means by which ECM is degraded is thought to be due to the proteolytic actions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases (ADAMTS). A number of MMPs, including MMP-1, -3, -7, -9, and -13, as well as ADAMTS-4, have been shown to increase in the IVD during disc degeneration and are responsible for the breakdown of several matrix components, the most notable being aggrecan and collagen (4Le Maitre C.L.

Both MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMP-1, -2, and -3) have been localized to the resident chondrocyte-like cells of the nucleus pulposus and inner fibrosus compartments of the IVD (4Le Maitre C.L. Freemont A.J. Hoyland J.A. Localization of degradative enzymes and their inhibitors in the degenerate human intervertebral disc.J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), thus implicating these cells in disease pathogenesis. The secretion of MMPs by human IVD cells is mediated in part through the stimulatory effects of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, the most prominent of which is IL-1β (8Millward-Sadler S.J.

In addition, fibronectin peptide fragments of the ECM have also been shown to induce MMP production by IVD cells (9Anderson D.G. Li X. Balian G. A fibronectin fragment alters the metabolism by rabbit intervertebral disc cells in vitro.Spine. 2005; 30: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and are potent instigators of experimental disc degeneration (10Greg Anderson D.

It has recently been shown in a Japanese population study that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the HTRA1 promoter is associated with spinal disc degeneration, where increases in spinal disc narrowing were observed in patients without the G allele (AA) as compared with those bearing at least one G allele (GG + GA) (21Urano T.

It would therefore appear that HTRA1 may also play a role in disc pathology, although its influence on disease and its mechanism of action have not yet been elucidated. Observations from our own studies examining the role of HTRA1 in osteoarthritis imply that HTRA1 may actually have a detrimental effect on the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disease. Elevated levels of HTRA1 protein were measured in the synovial fluid from osteoarthritic patients, and primary synovial fibroblasts isolated from diseased patients were identified as being a major source of HTRA1 (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6124-6129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The addition of proteolytically active HTRA1 to fibroblast cultures resulted in marked up-regulation of various MMPs, including MMP-1 and MMP-3, both of which have been implicated in cartilage and joint destruction in arthritic patients. Further experiments confirmed that the stimulatory effects of HTRA1 on MMP expression were protease-dependent and were related to the formation of fibronectin fragments due to extracellular degradation. Such observations are therefore strongly suggestive of a central role for HTRA1 in joint degeneration through its proteolytic actions on ECM components and thus may also be indicative of its role in other disease pathologies, such as disc degeneration. In the current study, we used IVD tissue and cell samples from surgical patients in order to further investigate the potential involvement of HTRA1 in IVD degeneration. Our findings implicate HTRA1 as a key factor in the underlying pathology associated with IVD degeneration. HTRA1 may therefore represent a novel target for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to treat this debilitating condition. Human fibronectin and rabbit IgG were purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Monoclonal antibodies against the fibronectin carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain (Mab1935) and the amino-terminal fibrin- and heparin-binding domain (Mab1936) were from Chemicon International. A polyclonal anti-HTRA1 antibody was generated as described previously (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6124-6129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies and normal serum were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Suffolk, UK). DAPI was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Collagenase NB4 was purchased from Serva/Promega (Duebendorf, Switzerland), and dispase II was from Roche Applied Science (Rotkreuz, Switzerland). IVD tissue and/or blood was obtained from a total of 39 patients undergoing spinal surgery for symptomatic degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, or spinal trauma following informed consent in accordance with the local ethical guidelines (carried out at the SRH Clinic Karlsbad-Langensteinbach, Karlsbad, Germany). The degree of IVD degeneration in patients was assessed prior to surgical intervention by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a four-level grading system based on Pfirrmann's classification of disc degeneration (22Pfirrmann C.W. Metzdorf A. Zanetti M. Hodler J. Boos N. Magnetic resonance classification of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration.Spine. 2001; 26: 1873-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). Degeneration grades were assigned as follows: grade 1, non-degenerated (normal disc height); grade 2, mild degeneration (slight decrease in disc height); grade 3, moderate degeneration (moderate decrease in disc height); grade 4, severe degeneration (collapsed disc space). Human IVD cells were isolated from the discs of a total of 14 patients undergoing spinal surgery for disc herniation (carried out at Balgrist University Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland) as described previously (23Wuertz K. Urban J.P. Klasen J. Ignatius A. Wilke H.J. Claes L. Neidlinger-Wilke C. Influence of extracellular osmolarity and mechanical stimulation on gene expression of intervertebral disc cells.J. Orthop. Res. 2007; 25: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, IVD tissue was enzymatically digested (0.2% collagenase NB4, 0.3% dispase II) for 4–8 h, and cells were thereafter cultured in growth medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (25 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and used at passages 2–3. Purified recombinant His-tagged HTRA1 in which the amino-terminal mac25 homology domain was absent (termed HTRA1Δmac) was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2+-NTA chromatography as described previously (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol.

The enzymatically inactive mutated form of HTRA1Δmac, termed HTRA1ΔmacSA, was generated through conversion of residue serine 328 to alanine by mutagenesis. IVD cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well and serum starved for 2 h prior to stimulation. Cells were incubated in medium alone or in medium supplemented with either HTRA1Δmac (5 μg/ml) or HTRA1ΔmacSA (5 μg/ml) for up to 24 h. Concentrations used were based on previous observations using human synovial fibroblasts (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6124-6129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). After this time, RNA and culture supernatants were harvested for further analysis. In the case of inhibition studies, IVD cells were preincubated with either PD98059 (10 μm), U0126 (10 μm), or IL-1RA (250 ng/ml) for 2 h prior to stimulation. Total RNA was isolated from either intact IVD tissue or cells and purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen AG, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen AG) and random hexanucleotide primers (Promega AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland). Quantification of mRNA expression was performed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) (supplemental Table 1) using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and values were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and presented as -fold change according to the 2−ΔΔCT method. In cases where individual patients (n = 36) were compared for expression levels of HTRA1 and FN mRNA in IVD tissue, data were normalized to TBP and presented as 2−ΔCT. Each 10-μl reaction consisted of 1× TaqMan fast universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 1× TaqMan gene expression assay, and 10 ng of cDNA (based upon initial RNA concentrations). All reactions were performed in triplicate in fast optical 96-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems) at 95 °C for 20 s and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 20 s. A total of 35 patients were genotyped using a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay specific for the SNP, rs11200638, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Patients were grouped according to their individual genotypes, and association studies were performed in order to determine the influence of the rs11200638 (A) risk allele on susceptibility to IVD degeneration. The influence of rs11200638 on HTRA1 expression in IVD tissue was also assessed in patients from whom both RNA and DNA samples were obtained (n = 32). Patient IVD samples (n = 12) were selected based on degeneration grade. Protein was extracted using CelLytic M (Sigma-Aldrich) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and protein amounts were determined initially by a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Reinach, Switzerland). Protein samples were boiled for 5 min in loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, 0.002% bromphenol blue), and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Further corrections to the loading volumes were made following densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained gels, thus allowing for accurate comparisons to be made between individual patient samples. Protein was then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo blotting system (Bio-Rad) and incubated in 5% skim milk, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either rabbit anti-human HTRA1 (1:2000) or mouse anti-fibronectin amino-terminal fibrin- and heparin-binding domain (Mab1936) (1 μg/ml). After washing in TBST three times for 5 min each, membranes were incubated with a HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following a further washing step, peroxidase activity was detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Lausanne, Switzerland). Unfixed frozen IVD tissue sections were air-dried for 20 min, blocked with normal goat serum (1:10), and incubated with polyclonal anti-HTRA1 (1:50) or control rabbit IgG (2 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, 1% BSA for 16 h at 4 °C. Tissue samples containing HTRA1 were then identified using goat anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:400). Sections were mounted in Mowiol/DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (Sigma-Aldrich) containing DAPI (0.5 g/ml), and images were captured using the Leica DMI6000B automated inverted research microscope system (Leica Microsystems). MMP-3 protein levels in culture supernatants were determined using an MMP-3-specific ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems). Degradation of fibronectin by HTRA1Δmac was determined using methods described previously (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6124-6129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, HTRA1Δmac and recombinant human fibronectin, in an equimolar ratio, were incubated together in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.5, for 16 h at 37 °C. In some reactions, HTRA1Δmac was replaced by proteolytically inactive HTRA1ΔmacSA. Fibronectin, HTRA1Δmac, and HTRA1ΔmacSA were also incubated separately under the same conditions and served as controls. In order to assess whether HTRA1Δmac could also generate fibronectin fragments in IVD cell cultures, supernatants (20 ml) were harvested from cells treated with HTRA1Δmac (5 μg/ml) or HTRA1ΔmacSA (5 μg/ml) for 24 h and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off filter units (Millipore). Fibronectin fragments were analyzed on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast gels (Bio-Rad) by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting using either mouse anti-fibronectin carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain (Mab1935) (1 μg/ml) or mouse-anti-fibronectin amino-terminal fibrin- and heparin-binding domain (Mab1936) (1 μg/ml) as described above. The EnzCheck elastase kit (Molecular Probes, Basel, Switzerland) was used to confirm the proteolytic activity of recombinant HTRA1 proteins according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equimolar concentrations of fibronectin (20 μg) and HTRA1Δmac (5 μg) were incubated under the conditions described above. Control reactions were also performed and included TBS, pH 8.5, alone or in combination with either fibronectin or HTRA1Δmac. Samples were then diluted into equilibration buffer containing TBS, pH 7.6, with 20 mm imidazole and incubated with 50 μl of pre-equilibrated HisPur Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) in spin columns (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h at 4 °C. Columns were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1600 rpm, and the affinity column flow-through fraction was collected, dialyzed in TBS for 4 h at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis devices (3500 molecular weight cut-off) (Thermo Scientific), and then incubated with IVD cells for up to 24 h, after which time MMP expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Parametric analysis of normally distributed data were performed using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc tests for multiple-group comparisons. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of selected genes in patient tissue samples. The χ2 test was used to compare allele frequencies in patients with or without IVD degeneration (1 degree of freedom). In all cases, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We have previously demonstrated that HTRA1 plays a central role in the regulation of MMP expression in synovial fibroblasts from arthritic patients and that its stimulatory effects may be linked to the generation of fibronectin fragments (19Grau S. Richards P.J. Kerr B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Williams A.S. Junker U. Jones S.A. Clausen T. Ehrmann M. The role of human HtrA1 in arthritic disease.J. Biol.

In the present report, we further investigated this property of HTRA1 in IVD cell cultures and aimed to establish its potential role in IVD degeneration. HTRA1 mRNA levels within IVD tissue samples from patients with varying degrees of disc degeneration were normalized to TBP and presented as 2−ΔCT. Expression levels significantly correlated (r = 0.375; p = 0.024) with patient degeneration grade and were found to be markedly increased in patients with severity scores of 3 (4-fold; p = 0.015) and 4 (3-fold; p = 0.2) as compared with control patients (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of IVD protein samples using a polyclonal antibody against HTRA1 identified two main species of HTRA1 protein migrating at ∼50 kDa (closed arrowhead) and ∼42 kDa (open arrowhead), which most likely represented the full-length and processed forms of HTRA1, respectively (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1) (25Nie G.

Dyn. 2005; 233: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 50-kDa HTRA1 was found at varying levels in the majority samples tested, whereas the 42-kDa form of HTRA1 was identified in degenerated IVD protein samples only and was noticeably increased in the more severely affected discs. HTRA1 protein was also identified within both the cells and ECM of frozen IVD tissue sections, as determined by immunofluorescence staining, and levels were found to be increased in the more severely affected patients as compared with the control trauma patients (Fig. 1C). In light of the recent evidence linking the rs11200638 SNP (G>A) in the HTRA1 gene promoter and spinal disc degeneration in Japanese women (21Urano T. Narusawa K. Kobayashi S. Shiraki M. Horie-Inoue K. Sasaki N. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Nakamura T. Inoue S. Association of HTRA1 promoter polymorphism with spinal disc degeneration in Japanese women.J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2010; 28: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the rs11200638 risk allele frequency between patient groups used in the current study was associated with susceptibility to IVD degeneration. DNA from a total of 35 patients was subjected to SNP genotyping using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay specific for rs11200638 SNP. Contrary to previous expectations, we were unable to demonstrate any significant differences in SNP allele frequencies between control patients without disc degeneration (25%) and patients with degeneration grades of 2 (14.3%; p = 0.4), 3 (15%; p = 0.37), or 4 (15%; p = 0.37) (Table 1). We also performed a comparative analysis of HTRA1 expression levels in IVD tissue from 32 patients of known genotype. However, no significant associations could be made between HTRA1 expression levels and the rs11200638 genotype (Table 1).TABLE 1rs11200638 SNP Genotyping of European patients with and without IVD degenerationGenotypeDegeneration gradenRelative HTRA1 expressionaComparisons were made between HTRA1 expression levels ± S.E. in IVD tissue and genotype frequency in patients where both RNA and DNA samples were available (n = 32).p valuebStudent's t test was used to compare HTRA1 expression levels between patients carrying the risk allele (GA/AA) and those homozygous for the wild type allele (GG).1 (n = 8)2 (n = 7)3 (n = 10)4 (n = 10)GG557723204.1 ± 35.6GA22338307 ± 87.30.20AA1000114.9GA + AA32339274.5 ± 83.50.37G allele12121717A allelecPercentages refer to risk allele (A) frequency.4 (25%)2 (14.3%)3 (15%)3 (15%)p = 0.4dThe χ2 test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in risk allele (A) frequency between patients with IVD degeneration (grades 2–4) and control patients without IVD degeneration (grade 1) (n = 35).p = 0.37dThe χ2 test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in risk allele (A) frequency between patients with IVD degeneration (grades 2–4) and control patients without IV"

We show here that filamin-binding LIM protein 1 (FBLP-1, also known as migfilin), a kindlin- and filamin-binding focal adhesion protein, is essential for proper control of bone remodeling. Genetic inactivation of FBLIM1 (the gene encoding FBLP-1) in mice resulted in a severe osteopenic phenotype. Primary FBLP-1 null bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) exhibited significantly reduced extracellular matrix adhesion and migration compared with wild type BMSCs. Loss of FBLP-1 significantly impaired the growth and survival of BMSCs in vitro and decreased the number of osteoblast (OB) progenitors in bone marrow and OB differentiation in vivo. Furthermore, the loss of FBLP-1 caused a dramatic increase of osteoclast (OCL) differentiation in vivo. The level of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), a key regulator of OCL differentiation, was markedly increased in FBLP-1 null BMSCs. The capacity of FBLP-1 null bone marrow monocytes (BMMs) to differentiate into multinucleated OCLs in response to exogenously supplied RANKL, however, was not different from that of WT BMMs. Finally, we show that a loss of FBLP-1 promotes activating phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation substantially suppressed the increase of RANKL induced by the loss of FBLP-1. Our results identify FBLP-1 as a key regulator of bone homeostasis and suggest that FBLP-1 functions in this process through modulating both the intrinsic properties of OB/BMSCs (i.e., BMSC-extracellular matrix adhesion and migration, cell growth, survival, and differentiation) and the communication between OB/BMSCs and BMMs (i.e., RANKL expression) that controls osteoclastogenesis.

Bone remodeling is a dynamic process whose balance is maintained through precise control of two functionally opposing events, namely bone formation and resorption. Imbalance of bone formation and resorption is a causal factor of many human metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis. At the cellular level, bone formation is controlled by osteoblasts (OBs), 6The abbreviations used are:OBosteoblastBMSCbone marrow stromal cellECMextracellular matrixOCLosteoclastRANKLreceptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligandBMMbone marrow monocyteCFU-Fcolony forming unit-fibroblastCFU-OBcolony forming unit-OBOsx (+) Ob.nb/BPmOsx-positive cells on trabecular bone surfaces counted and normalized to trabecular bone perimeterTRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphataseMBPmaltose-binding protein. a population of bone matrix-producing cells derived from BMSCs. The behavior of BMSCs (e.g., ECM adhesion and migration) therefore exerts profound effects on bone formation. Bone resorption, on the other hand, is mediated by OCLs, which originate from the bone marrow monocyte (BMM)/macrophage lineage (1Ash P. Loutit J.F. Townsend K.M. Osteoclasts derived from haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 1980; 283: 669-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The formation and maturation of OCLs are closely regulated by factors produced by OBs/BMSCs such as RANKL, a member of the TNF cytokine family, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor that blocks RANKL binding to RANK and thereby inhibits OCL differentiation (2Lacey D.L.

Whereas bone formation and resorption are dynamic processes that are executed through actions of different cell populations (i.e., OB/BMSC and OCL), there is intimate communication between these cell populations, which is essential for orchestrating the balance of bone formation and resorption (10Matsuo K.

Thus, OBs/BMSCs not only are responsible for bone formation but also play an important role in regulation of bone resorption via control of the expression of key OCL differentiation factors such as RANKL. Despite the importance, factors that control RANKL expression in OBs/BMSCs are incompletely understood. FBLP-1 (also known as migfilin or Mig2-interacting protein) is a multidomain adaptor protein that we identified in a search for binding partners of kindlin-2 (also known as mitogen-inducible gene-2 or Mig-2) (15Tu Y.

To address this question, we have inactivated FBLIM1 (the gene encoding FBLP-1) in mice and determined the functional consequences. Our studies reveal, for the first time, that FBLP-1 is critical for maintenance of bone homeostasis. Using primary BMSCs derived from FBLP-1 KO mice, we show that FBLP-1 is required for proper BMSC-ECM adhesion and migration. Furthermore, we have found that FBLP-1 is critical for control of OCL differentiation in vivo. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that FBLP-1 functions in this process through regulation of signaling events in OBs/BMSCs that control RANKL expression rather than altering intrinsically the differentiation potential of OCL precursors. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing mouse FBLP-1 were prepared using a GST fusion protein containing mouse FBLP-1 residues 1–222 as an antigen based on a previously described method (15Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Migfilin and Mig-2 link focal adhesions to filamin and the actin cytoskeleton and function in cell shape modulation.Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were initially screened for anti-FBLP-1 activity by ELISA using an MBP fusion protein containing mouse FBLP-1 residues 1–222. Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing MBP-FBLP-1 in ELISA were further tested by Western blotting using human HEK 293 cells overexpressing GFP-tagged mouse FBLP-1. Monoclonal antibody (clone 43.9) recognizing MBP- and GFP-tagged mouse FBLP-1 was selected and used in subsequent experiments. Mouse FBLP-1 genomic DNA amplified from mouse embryonic stem cells (129/SvJ) was used to generate a FBLIM1 targeting construct (Fig. 1A) following a protocol that we described (30Liang X. Zhou Q. Li X. Sun Y. Lu M. Dalton N. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. PINCH1 plays an essential role in early murine embryonic development but is dispensable in ventricular cardiomyocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Specifically, one LoxP site was inserted into intron 6, and a second LoxP site together with a neomyocin (Neo) cassette flanked by two FRT sites were inserted into intron 7. DTA cassette was used to assist homologous recombinant. The targeting vector was linearized with restriction enzyme NotI and electroporated into R1 embryonic stem cells derived from 129/SvJ mice. Homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blotting. Genomic DNA from neo-positive cells was digested with restriction enzyme BamHI and hybridized with the radiolabeled 5′-probe as indicated in Fig. 1A. The WT allele is represented as a 12.1-kb band, whereas an 8.2-kb band represents the targeted allele (Fig. 1B). Two independent homologous recombinant ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Male chimeras were bred with female Black Swiss mice (Taconic Inc., Hudson, NY) to generate germ line-transmitted heterozygous mice carrying neo cassette (FBLIM1fneo/+), which were confirmed by PCR of mouse tail DNA following a protocol that we described (31Cheng H. Kimura K. Peter A.K. Cui L. Ouyang K. Shen T. Liu Y. Gu Y. Dalton N.D. Evans S.M. Knowlton K.U. Peterson K.L. Chen J. Loss of enigma homolog protein results in dilated cardiomyopathy.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To generate FBLIM1−/− mice, we crossed the FBLIM1fneo/+ mice with Protamine-Cre mice (32O'Gorman S. Dagenais N.A. Qian M. Marchuk Y. Protamine-Cre recombinase transgenes efficiently recombine target sequences in the male germ line of mice, but not in embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), resulting in mice that were doubly heterozygous (Pro-Cre; FBLIM1fneo/+). Cre expression in Pro-Cre mice is restricted to male germ cells undergoing spermatogenesis (32O'Gorman S. Dagenais N.A. Qian M. Marchuk Y. Protamine-Cre recombinase transgenes efficiently recombine target sequences in the male germ line of mice, but not in embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14602-14607Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Therefore Pro-Cre; FBLIM1fneo/+ males were crossed to female WT mice to generate germ line heterozygous null mutant offspring (+/−). Heterozygous mice were interbred to generate homozygous FBLIM1−/− mice. Offspring were genotyped by PCR with following primer sets: WT allele primers (P1: 5′-AAT ACT CGT GGG TGG AGG TG-3′ and P2: 5′-AAG CCT TTT GTG TGC CAA GT-3′) and knock-out allele primers (Frtneo: 5′-AAT GGG CTG ACC GCT TCC TCG T-3′ and P4: 5′-CAC AGC CTG GTT ATG TGG TG-3′). A loss of FBLP-1 in cells derived from FBLIM1−/− but not WT control mice was confirmed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody recognizing mouse FBLP-1 (see “Results”). WT and FBLIM1−/− mice were euthanized, and tibiae were fixed in 10% formalin at 4 °C for 24 h, decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 10–14 days, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of tibiae from WT FBLIM1−/− mice were used for TRAP staining as described previously (33Cao H. Yu S. Yao Z. Galson D.L. Jiang Y. Zhang X. Fan J. Lu B. Guan Y. Luo M. Lai Y. Zhu Y.

Femurs and tibias were isolated, and the epiphyses were cut. Marrow was flushed with α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen formula 01-0133DJ) containing 20% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin into a 100-mm dish, and the cell suspension was aspirated up and down with a 20-gauge needle to break clumps of marrow. The cell suspension was then cultured in a T75 flask in the same medium. After 10 days, the cells reached confluence and were used for experiments. Cell-ECM adhesion was analyzed using a quantitative centrifugal force assay based on a protocol that we previously described (38Qu H. Tu Y. Shi X. Larjava H. Saleem M.A. Shattil S.J. Fukuda K. Qin J.

The cells (4 × 104 cells/well) were plated in triplicate in type I collagen- or fibronectin-coated 96-well plates. The plates were sealed with sealing films (USA Scientific) and centrifuged with a Sorvall RT7 Plus centrifuge equipped with a microplate carrier at 600 rpm, 4 °C for 3 min to facilitate cell settlement. The cells were observed under an Olympus IX70 microscope and recorded with a digital camera (four randomly selected fields in each well were photographed; >300 cells/field). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then inverted and centrifuged at 600 rpm, 37 °C for 5 min. After inverted centrifugation, the sealing films were removed, and the number of cells that remained was recorded again with the digital camera. Cell adhesion was calculated as the number of cells recorded after inverted centrifugation divided by the number of cells recorded before inverted centrifugation. The adhesion of FBLIM1−/− BMSCs was compared with that of WT control BMSCs (normalized to 100%). Cell migration was assessed by the ability of cells to migrate into a cell-free area in a scratch assay as we described (22Zhang Y. Tu Y. Gkretsi V. Wu C.

Briefly, primary BMSCs from WT and FBLIM1−/− mice were cultured in dishes that were precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. The cell monolayers were wounded by scratching with a plastic pipette tip. After washing, the cells were incubated in α-minimum essential medium containing 2% FBS and 10 μg/ml mitomycin C (to minimize cell proliferation) for 6.5 h. Images of five different segments of the cell-free area were recorded, and the distances traveled by the cells at the front in five different segments of the wound were measured. The distances traveled by FBLIM1−/− BMSCs were compared with those of WT control BMSCs (normalized to 100%).

https://openalex.org/W2165204216,"Increasing evidence demonstrates the dissociation of fat deposition, the inflammatory response, and insulin resistance in the development of obesity-related metabolic diseases. As a regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2, encoded by PFKFB3) protects against diet-induced adipose tissue inflammatory response and systemic insulin resistance independently of adiposity. Using aP2-PFKFB3 transgenic (Tg) mice, we explored the ability of targeted adipocyte PFKFB3/iPFK2 overexpression to modulate diet-induced inflammatory responses and insulin resistance arising from fat deposition in both adipose and liver tissues. Compared with wild-type littermates (controls) on a high fat diet (HFD), Tg mice exhibited increased adiposity, decreased adipose inflammatory response, and improved insulin sensitivity. In a parallel pattern, HFD-fed Tg mice showed increased hepatic steatosis, decreased liver inflammatory response, and improved liver insulin sensitivity compared with controls. In both adipose and liver tissues, increased fat deposition was associated with lipid profile alterations characterized by an increase in palmitoleate. Additionally, plasma lipid profiles also displayed an increase in palmitoleate in HFD-Tg mice compared with controls. In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of PFKFB3/iPFK2 recapitulated metabolic and inflammatory changes observed in adipose tissue of Tg mice. Upon treatment with conditioned medium from iPFK2-overexpressing adipocytes, mouse primary hepatocytes displayed metabolic and inflammatory responses that were similar to those observed in livers of Tg mice. Together, these data demonstrate a unique role for PFKFB3/iPFK2 in adipocytes with regard to diet-induced inflammatory responses in both adipose and liver tissues."

The major exception to this are the Flower Garden Banks (FGB). Corals are known to have colonized oil/gas platforms around the FGB, facilitating biogeographic expansion. We ask the question, what are the patterns of genetic affinity in these coral populations. We sampled coral tissue from populations of two species occurring on oil and gas platforms: Madracis decactis (hermatype) and Tubastraea coccinea (invasive ahermatype). We sampled 28 platforms along four transects from 20 km offshore to the continental shelf edge off 1) Matagorda Island, TX; 2) Lake Sabine, TX; 3) Terrebonne Bay, LA; and 4) Mobile, AL. The entire population of M. decactis was sampled between depths of 5 m and 37 m. T. coccinea populations were sub-sampled. Genetic variation was assessed using the PCR-based Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Data were analyzed via AFLPOP and STRUCTURE. Genetic connectivity among M. decactis platform populations was highest near the FGB and decreased to the east. Connectivity increased again in the eastern sector, indicating isolation between the populations from different sides of the Mississippi River (Transects 3 and 4). A point-drop in genetic affinity (relatedness) at the shelf edge south of Terrebonne Bay, LA indicated a population differing from all others in the northern GOM. Genetic affinities among T. coccinea were highest in the west and decreased to the east. Very low genetic affinities off Mobile, AL indicated a dramatic difference between those populations and those west of the Mississippi River, apparently a formidable barrier to larval dispersal."

https://openalex.org/W2115218339,"Different environmental stresses induce the phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2∼P), repressing global protein synthesis coincident with preferential translation of ATF4. ATF4 is a transcriptional activator of genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake, antioxidation, and regulation of apoptosis. Because ATF4 is a common downstream target that integrates signaling from different eIF2 kinases and their respective stress signals, the eIF2∼P/ATF4 pathway is collectively referred to as the integrated stress response. Although eIF2∼P elicits translational control in response to many different stresses, there are selected stresses, such as exposure to UV irradiation, that do not increase ATF4 expression despite robust eIF2∼P. The rationale for this discordant induction of ATF4 expression and eIF2∼P in response to UV irradiation is that transcription of ATF4 is repressed, and therefore ATF4 mRNA is not available for preferential translation. In this study, we show that C/EBPβ is a transcriptional repressor of ATF4 during UV stress. C/EBPβ binds to critical elements in the ATF4 promoter, resulting in its transcriptional repression. Expression of C/EBPβ increases in response to UV stress, and the liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) isoform of C/EBPβ, but not the liver-enriched activating protein (LAP) version, represses ATF4 transcription. Loss of the liver-enriched inhibitory protein isoform results in increased ATF4 mRNA levels in response to UV irradiation and subsequent recovery of ATF4 translation, leading to enhanced expression of its target genes. Together these results illustrate how eIF2∼P and translational control combined with transcription factors regulated by alternative signaling pathways can direct programs of gene expression that are specifically tailored to each environmental stress.

Environmental stresses induce rapid changes in gene expression designed to alleviate cell damage and return cells to homeostasis. For example, protein synthesis is rapidly reduced in response to different stresses, allowing for conservation of cellular resources and a reprogramming of gene expression designed to enhance cell survival. Central to this translational control is a family of protein kinases that phosphorylates the α subunit of the initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α) (1Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G.

The eIF2 complexed with GTP and the initiator Met-tRNAiMet associates with the 40 S ribosomal subunit to facilitate recognition of the start codon. Prior to the joining of the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits, the GTP associated with eIF2 is hydrolyzed, leading to a release of eIF2-GDP, which is recycled to the active GTP-bound form by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 blocks the exchange of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, resulting in a repression of initiation of protein synthesis (1Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G.

In this case, eIF2α∼P delays translation reinitiation, allowing scanning ribosomes to bypass an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) located in the 5′-leader of the ATF4 mRNA.

Therefore, the ISR has both translational and transcriptional control features that regulate gene expression designed to alleviate stress damage. These features of the ISR are shared with GCN4 translational control and the general amino acid control pathway in yeast, emphasizing its evolutionarily conserved role in remediation of environmental stresses (11Hinnebusch A.G.

This indicates that differential induction of eIF2α∼P and the ISR in response to certain environmental stresses can be critical for remediation of stress damage. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulation of ATF4 provides an explanation for how induction of eIF2α∼P does not necessarily elicit the same pattern of gene expression for each stress. The levels of each transcript subject to preferential translation by eIF2α∼P can be selectively diminished, thus allowing different sets of mRNAs to be selectively translated depending on the precise stress arrangement (25Dey S. Baird T.D. Zhou D. Palam L.R. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C. Both transcriptional regulation and translational control of ATF4 are central to the integrated stress response.J. Biol.

We are interested in the mechanisms controlling the levels of mRNAs encoding for key ISR factors, such as ATF4, and the role that these regulatory processes play in generating unique gene expression profiles directed by eIF2α∼P during different environmental stresses. The ISR is suggested to be regulated by different transcription factors, which can function downstream of alternative stress response pathways. One such bZIP transcription factor whose function can be regulated during stress is C/EBPβ, which facilitates diverse physiological processes, including adipogenesis, immunity, and bone and liver functions (30Nerlov C.

C/EBPβ can heterodimerize with ATF4, which is suggested to enhance expression of ISR target genes (33Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V.

Interestingly, translation of the C/EBPβ mRNA can give rise to three different isoforms, namely liver-enriched activating protein (LAP), LAP*, and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) (30Nerlov C.

The carboxyl-terminal bZIP domain is conserved in each of the isoforms, but the LAP/LAP* isoforms contain an amino-terminal trans-activation domain that is missing in the shorter LIP isoform. The expression of these C/EBPβ isoforms is a consequence of the utilization of different start codons in the mRNA, which can be altered during stress (39Calkhoven C.F. Müller C. Leutz A.

Here we report a new role for C/EBPβ in the regulation of the ISR in response to UV irradiation. We show that C/EBPβ functions as a transcriptional repressor of ATF4 during UV stress. C/EBPβ binds to critical elements in the ATF4 promoter, resulting in its transcriptional repression. As a consequence, there is significantly reduced ATF4 expression accompanying enhanced eIF2α∼P. Furthermore, we show that C/EBPβ expression is enhanced following UV irradiation and that the LIP isoform of C/EBPβ, but not the LAP version, directly represses ATF4 transcription. Loss of the LIP isoform results in increased ATF4 mRNA levels in response to UV irradiation and subsequent recovery of ATF4 translation, leading to enhanced expression of its target genes. Together these results illustrate how a common regulatory process, eIF2α∼P and translational control, combined with different stress-regulated transcriptional mechanisms can direct patterns of gene expression that are specifically tailored to each environmental stress.

Their unique activation pathway relies on structurally distinct regulatory domains including one transmembrane voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and two intracellular high affinity Ca(2+)-sensing sites per subunit (located in the RCK1 and RCK2 domains). Four pairs of RCK1 and RCK2 domains form a Ca(2+)-sensing apparatus known as the ""gating ring."" The allosteric interplay between voltage- and Ca(2+)-sensing apparati is a fundamental mechanism of BK channel function. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry and UV photolysis of intracellular caged Ca(2+), we optically resolved VSD activation prompted by Ca(2+) binding to the gating ring. The sudden increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) induced a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of both channel opening and VSD activation, reported by a fluorophore labeling position 202, located in the upper side of the S4 transmembrane segment. The neutralization of the Ca(2+) sensor located in the RCK2 domain abolished the effect of [Ca(2+)](i) increase on the VSD rearrangements. On the other hand, the mutation of RCK1 residues involved in Ca(2+) sensing did not prevent the effect of Ca(2+) release on the VSD, revealing a functionally distinct interaction between RCK1 and RCK2 and the VSD. A statistical-mechanical model quantifies the complex thermodynamics interplay between Ca(2+) association in two distinct sites, voltage sensor activation, and BK channel opening."

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the Elp4–6 subcomplex of yeast. The overall structure of Elp4–6 revealed that Elp6 acts as a bridge to assemble Elp4 and Elp5. Detailed structural and sequence analyses revealed that each subunit in the Elp4–6 subcomplex forms a RecA-ATPase-like fold, although it lacks the key sequence signature of ATPases. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analyses indicated that the Elp4–6 subcomplex can assemble into a hexameric ring-shaped structure in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1978336426,"As a human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus must cope with oxidative stress generated by the human immune system. Here, we report that CymR utilizes its sole Cys-25 to sense oxidative stress. Oxidation followed by thiolation of this cysteine residue leads to dissociation of CymR from its cognate promoter DNA. In contrast, the DNA binding of the CymRC25S mutant was insensitive to oxidation and thiolation, suggesting that CymR senses oxidative stress through oxidation of its sole cysteine to form a mixed disulfide with low molecular weight thiols. The determined crystal structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of CymR revealed that Cys-25 is oxidized to Cys-25-SOH in the presence of H(2)O(2). Deletion of cymR reduced the resistance of S. aureus to oxidative stresses, and the resistance was restored by expressing a C25S mutant copy of cymR. In a C25S substitution mutant, the expression of two genes, tcyP and mccB, was constitutively repressed and did not respond to hydrogen peroxide stress, whereas the expression of the genes were highly induced under oxidative stress in a wild-type strain, indicating the critical role of Cys-25 in redox signaling in vivo. Thus, CymR is another master regulator that senses oxidative stress and connects stress responses to virulence regulation in S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W1988402211,"Catalases are enzymes that play critical roles in protecting cells against the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. They are implicated in various physiological and pathological conditions but some of their functions remain unclear. In order to decipher the role(s) of catalases during the life cycle of Podospora anserina, we analyzed the role of the four monofunctional catalases and one bifunctional catalase-peroxidase genes present in its genome. The five genes were deleted and the phenotypes of each single and all multiple mutants were investigated. Intriguingly, although the genes are differently expressed during the life cycle, catalase activity is dispensable during both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in laboratory conditions. Catalases are also not essential for cellulose or fatty acid assimilation. In contrast, they are strictly required for efficient utilization of more complex biomass like wood shavings by allowing growth in the presence of lignin. The secreted CATB and cytosolic CAT2 are the major catalases implicated in peroxide resistance, while CAT2 is the major player during complex biomass assimilation. Our results suggest that P. anserina produces external H2O2 to assimilate complex biomass and that catalases are necessary to protect the cells during this process. In addition, the phenotypes of strains lacking only one catalase gene suggest that a decrease of catalase activity improves the capacity of the fungus to degrade complex biomass."
https://openalex.org/W1985537894,"Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a severe malignancy with no effective treatment. HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) play a major role in ATLL development, by interfering with cellular functions such as CD4(+) T-cell survival. In this study, we observed that the expression of Bfl-1, an antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is restricted to HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and to T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ proteins. We showed that Tax-induced bfl-1 transcription through the canonical NF-κB pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that Tax cooperated with c-Jun or JunD, but not JunB, transcription factors of the AP-1 family to stimulate bfl-1 gene activation. By contrast, HBZ inhibited c-Jun-induced bfl-1 gene activation, whereas it increased JunD-induced bfl-1 gene activation. We identified one NF-κB, targeted by RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52, and two AP-1, targeted by both c-Jun and JunD, binding sites in the bfl-1 promoter of T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ. Analyzing the potential role of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival, we demonstrated that these cells are differentially sensitive to silencing of Bfl-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2. Indeed, both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) knockdowns decreased the survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, although no cell death was observed after Bcl-2 knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bfl-1 knockdown sensitizes HTLV-1-infected T-cells to ABT-737 or etoposide treatment. Our results directly implicate Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival and suggest that both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) represent potential therapeutic targets for ATLL treatment."

VUR is part of the spectrum of Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT). We performed an extensive association study for primary VUR using a two-stage, case-control design, investigating 44 candidate genes in the ureteric budding pathway in 409 Dutch VUR patients. The 44 genes were selected from the literature and a set of 567 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) capturing their genetic variation was genotyped in 207 cases and 554 controls. The 14 SNPs with p<0.005 were included in a follow-up study in 202 cases and 892 controls. Of the total cohort, ~50% showed a clear-cut primary VUR phenotype and ~25% had both a duplex collecting system and VUR. We also looked for association in these two extreme phenotype groups. None of the SNPs reached a significant p-value. Common genetic variants in four genes (GREM1, EYA1, ROBO2 and UPK3A) show a trend towards association with the development of primary VUR (GREM1, EYA1, ROBO2) or duplex collecting system (EYA1 and UPK3A). SNPs in three genes (TGFB1, GNB3 and VEGFA) have been shown to be associated with VUR in other populations. Only the result of rs1800469 in TGFB1 hinted at association in our study.

Although N-TAD is known as a solitary transactivation domain for GATA1, clinical observations in Down syndrome leukemia suggest that there may be additional transactivation domains. In this study, we found in reporter co-transfection assays that transactivation activity of GATA1 was markedly reduced by deletion of the C-terminal 95 amino acids without significant attenuation of the DNA binding activity or self-association potential. We therefore generated transgenic mouse lines that expressed GATA1 lacking the C-terminal region (GATA1-ΔCT). When we crossed these transgenic mouse lines to the Gata1-deficient mouse, we found that the GATA1-ΔCT transgene rescued Gata1-deficient mice from embryonic lethality. The embryos rescued with an almost similar level of GATA1-ΔCT to endogenous GATA1 developed beyond embryonic 13.5 days, showing severe anemia with accumulation of immature erythroid cells, as was the case for the embryos rescued by endogenous levels of GATA1 lacking N-TAD (GATA1-ΔNT).

Although the ATR-Chk1 kinase cascade was associated with hypoxia-induced p53 activation, molecules that directly link this hypoxia-ATR-Chk1 pathway to p53 activation have been elusive. Here, we showed that hypoxia could induce phosphorylation of MDMX at Ser-367 and enhance the binding of this phosphorylated MDMX to 14-3-3γ, consequently leading to p53 activation. A Chk1 inhibitor or knockdown of ATR and Chk1 inhibited the phosphorylation of MDMX at Ser-367 and impaired the binding of MDMX to 14-3-3γ in addition to p53 activation in response to hypoxia. In primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells that harbor a mutant MDMX, including the S367A mutation, hypoxia also failed to induce the binding of this mutant MDMX to 14-3-3γ and to activate p53 and its direct targets. These results demonstrate that hypoxia can activate p53 through inactivation of MDMX by the ATR-Chk1-MDMX-14-3-3γ pathway."

We developed, verified and used high-definition infrared hyperspectral imaging of cartilage sections at physiological conditions, to quantify collagen and its orientation, noncollagenous proteins, and chondroitin chains, and their sulfation with 6-μm spatial resolution and without labeling. We found that chondroitin sulfation across the proximal femur cartilage varied dramatically in dtd, but not in the wild type. Corresponding undersulfation of dtd was mild in most regions, but strong in narrow articular and growth plate regions crucial for bone development. This undersulfation correlated with the chondroitin synthesis rate measured via radioactive sulfate incorporation, explaining the sulfation normalization with age.

The dtd mouse reveals an unusual progression for genetic disorders. A primary biochemical defect, net undersulfation of chondroitin, which is the dominating sulfated species of cartilage, is slightly below normal at birth (0.7 sulfate/disaccharide in dtd versus 0.9 in wild type) and approaches normal values with age (8Forlino A.

Conversely, dtd mice have barely detectable clinical phenotype at birth and develop skeletal abnormalities and severe articular cartilage degradation by 2 months, similar to young human adults (8Forlino A.

Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 939-960Crossref Google Scholar). In this work, we focused on primary defects associated with extracellular matrix. We studied epiphyseal cartilage of the dtd mouse at birth when mechanical loads and their secondary effects on degradation of undersulfated cartilage should be negligible. We examined all regions between the articular surface and the mineralizing front of the epiphyseal cartilage. At birth, these regions are continuous hyaline cartilage. Yet, they are involved in different functions of articular cartilage development, preparation for subchondral bone formation, and longitudinal bone growth, all of which are abnormal in DTD (18Superti-Furga A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 939-960Crossref Google Scholar). As in many disorders compatible with life, early dtd abnormalities are mild, but may vary across functionally different regions separated by a few tens of micrometers. Such spatial resolution is not easily achievable by existing quantitative techniques, whereas mild defects are difficult to track by conventional histology. To track mild defects, we advanced infrared (IR) hyperspectral imaging, which detects chemical groups via their characteristic peaks in the IR absorption spectra recorded with micrometer spatial resolution (see Refs. 19Potter K.

Samples for this technique are usually dehydrated to eliminate strong absorption of IR light by water. However, the dehydration distorts the tissue and macromolecular structure and introduces multiple nonphysiological interactions between collapsed macromolecules, smearing spectral peaks (24Dukor R.K. Chalmers J.M. Griffiths P.R. Applications of Vibrational Spectroscopy in Life, Pharmaceutical and Natural Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, New York2002: 3335-3361Google Scholar) and reducing the number of resolved molecular components. We used a specially designed chamber with thermomechanical stabilization of spectral distortions in sections maintained in physiological-like solution (25Mertz, E. L., Sullivan, J. V., (2008) Flow-through, thermal expansion-compensated cell for light spectroscopy. United States patent 7,355,697.Google Scholar, 26Mertz E.L. Leikin S. Interactions of inorganic phosphate and sulfate anions with collagen.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14901-14912Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Combining this setup with spectral analysis based on purified and characterized model compounds, we devised a high-definition approach, which increased spectral reproducibility and the number of resolved molecular components, resulting in quantitative, label-free, “histological” images of multiple components from a single recording. Using this new method and autoradiographic imaging of chondroitin synthesis, we found several extracellular abnormalities across functionally different cartilage regions. The findings provided insights into DTD, in vivo sulfation, orientation of matrix collagen, and bone elongation. This section outlines nonstandard methods. Supplemental Materials describes further details and standard techniques. Materials were bought from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Newborn (0.5 day old) dtd mice with knocked-in homozygous A386V substitution in the Slc26a2 gene (8Forlino A. Piazza R. Tiveron C. Della Torre S. Tatangelo L. Bonafè L. Gualeni B. Romano A. Pecora F. Superti-Furga A. Cetta G. Rossi A. A diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter (SLC26A2) mutant mouse. Morphological and biochemical characterization of the resulting chondrodysplasia phenotype.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and their wild type (wt) and heterozygous littermates were used. The mice were inbred progeny of F1 generation of C57Bl/6J and 129/SV backgrounds, which provided full penetration of the dtd phenotype. Whole femurs were incubated in a medium with 33 μCi/ml of [35S]sulfate and total inorganic sulfate concentration of 0.8 mm (similar to that in mouse serum) for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The explants were fixed in 2% formaldehyde solution and cryosectioned to 12 μm in the mid-coronal plane. The cryosections deposited onto glass slides were exposed on phosphoimaging screens, and autoradiographic and autofluorescence images of the sections were recorded with an FLA-5000 scanner (Fujifilm) with 25/50-μm nominal/actual spatial resolution. Visible transmission images of the sections with 0.5-μm resolution were also recorded with a microscope (Fig. 1). The radiographic, fluorescence, and transmission images were registered to within ∼13 μm (confirmed via overlaid positions of thin radioactive debris on the slides). Cell positions at the transmission images were marked manually, and cell density and radiographic intensity profiles along the lines in Fig. 1 were evaluated using ImageJ software (NIH) (Fig. 1). The radiographic profiles were deconvoluted (to evaluate intensity near cartilage boundaries) and normalized by cell density. Infrared hyperspectral imaging of cartilage composition in sections was performed in the “high definition” (HDIR) mode, in which accuracy and peak resolution, key factors in spectral analyses, were increased by advanced procedures for sample handling, spectra recording and analyses, and purification and characterization of model compounds. Advantages of our and previous analyses are compared in supplemental Materials. Proximal halves of the femurs were fixed mildly (1% formaldehyde in PBS for 4–8 h at 22 ± 2 °C), and 12-μm midcoronal cryosections were cut under a hard-tissue protocol. Sections were photographed to determine position of mineralizing cartilage and, then, demineralized in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, for 5 min. A section was placed between two 2-mm BaF2 windows (avoiding section stretching) and mounted in a thermomechanically stabilized, flow-through chamber (25Mertz, E. L., Sullivan, J. V., (2008) Flow-through, thermal expansion-compensated cell for light spectroscopy. United States patent 7,355,697.Google Scholar) and kept at 20 ± 0.1 °C. Sections were equilibrated with an excess of 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 ± 0.1 solution (CNC) flushed into the chamber. Model compounds solutions in CNC at pH 7–8 were flushed into a 4–6-μm gap between assembled windows or deposited as a 0.5-μl droplet before assembly, and kept at 20 ± 0.1 °C. CNC contained calcium to maintain BaF2 windows passivation and prevent adsorption and decomposition of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by barium. CNC had no buffer to avoid its interfering spectral contributions. Constancy of pH of samples in CNC was confirmed. IR absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Hyperion 3000 microscope attached to a Vertex 70 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer equipped with ×15, 0.4 NA objective and condenser, low-pass 3850 cm−1 filter, holographic ZnSe polarizer inserted before the sample, and focal plane 128 × 128 array of detectors (Bruker Optics). The spectra were collected with 4 cm−1 spectral resolution in the 820–3950 cm−1 range by averaging 1000 scans accumulated for 60 min. Several hardware precautions were made to increase spectra quality. Our spectral analysis was based on model compounds representing major components of cartilage extracellular matrix. Model compounds were carefully selected, purified, and prepared at aggregation state and conditions resembling those of the cartilage sections. Model chondroitins, unsulfated (C0S), -4-sulfate (C4S), and -6-sulfate (C6S), were analyzed in detail, as these GAGs dominated in our samples. Several commercial chondroitins were analyzed by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (8Forlino A. Piazza R. Tiveron C. Della Torre S. Tatangelo L. Bonafè L. Gualeni B. Romano A. Pecora F. Superti-Furga A. Cetta G. Rossi A. A diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter (SLC26A2) mutant mouse. Morphological and biochemical characterization of the resulting chondrodysplasia phenotype.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and three compounds were selected based on their purity (90–95%) and enrichment with a particular sulfated form (83–94%) (supplemental Table S1). Purity from low molecular weight compounds and residual buffer salts with interfering spectral contributions was confirmed by dialysis. Spectra of the selected chondroitins at ∼2% concentrations were normalized by the IR light path length and decomposed onto individual C0S, C4S, and C6S components based on their HPLC determined concentrations. The individual spectra (Fig. 2B) were used to predict spectra of chondroitin compounds with lower enrichment (63–80%). The predicted and measured spectra agreed to within their purity (80–90%). Spectra of 0.5 and 2% solutions of hyaluronate from rooster comb and dermatan sulfate from porcine mucosa (Fig. 2B) were recorded “as is” because their content was small in our samples (“Results”). Because of the limited quantity, purity, and calibration of mouse cartilage collagens, we used several collagen sources: pepsin-treated bovine type II (Elastin Products), a mixture of acid-soluble mouse type II and type I (Sigma), and mouse and rat type I from tail tendons. We removed impurities, degradation products, and proteoglycans from these samples by collagen precipitation induced by slow in vitro fibrilogenesis (26Mertz E.L. Leikin S. Interactions of inorganic phosphate and sulfate anions with collagen.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14901-14912Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (supplemental Materials). Purity (99%) and collagen types of these preparations were confirmed by electrophoresis, CNBr peptides, chondroitinase ABC digestion, and HDIR. The bovine type II collagen reconstituted into fibers (Fig. 2A) was found to be a suitable model for isotropic spectra of mouse type II collagen dominating in cartilage (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2). HDIR absorptivity and concentration of the model type II collagen were calibrated via HDIR and circular dichroism spectra of solutions of pepsin-treated rat type I collagen monomers (supplemental Fig. S2). This calibration was confirmed by HDIR measurement of the water volume fraction in the fibers. Spectra of the selected models represented the triple helical motif of most collagen types because this motif is conserved and constitutes almost entire collagen molecules. To model NCP, we purified from smaller molecules by dialysis proteoglycans decorin, biglycan, and aggrecan (PG) abundant in cartilage and a “garden variety” protein bovine serum albumin (BSA, 99% pure) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). We used several proteins because total mass of NCP in newborn cartilage matrix is not dominated by any particular protein: In agreement with data for bovine nasal cartilage (27Torchia D.A. Hasson M.A. Hascall V.C. Investigation of molecular motion of proteoglycans in cartilage by 13C magnetic resonance.J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3617-3625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our HDIR analysis indicated that the measured mass ratio NCP/GAG ∼ 0.5 was higher than NCP/GAG ∼ 0.1 expected for aggrecan, which is the most abundant NCP and the main carrier of GAG chains (Fig. 4, A and C). After removing GAG contributions from the PGs spectra, we found that spectral characteristics of the PG cores and BSA were sufficiently similar and evaluated model NCP characteristics (supplemental Table S2). Concentrations of the cores and BSA were measured via integral intensities of the amide II band and BSA absorbance at 279 nm. Prior to spectral analysis, model compound and cartilage spectra were corrected for contributions from liquid water and residual atmospheric H2O and CO2 (supplemental Fig. S1). We evaluated concentrations (cj) of major extracellular matrix components by decomposing the spectra onto individual components. We used Beer's law, cartilage section thickness (h), and baseline-corrected integral intensities (Ai) of selected peaks in unpolarized spectra of the sample. cj=∑i∈ji−1Ai/h(Eq. 1) This decomposition accounted for overlap of peaks of individual components via the elements ϵji−1 of the inverse of square matrix of absorptivities ϵim whose elements ϵim = Aim/(cmlm) are the integral intensities Aim of the ith peak of mth model compound normalized by the concentration of the compound cm and path length lm. To increase accuracy, the peaks and their integration limits were selected so that the intensities Aim of a peak i were maximized for one compound and minimized for the others (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S2). A set of four peaks marked in Fig. 3A was used in the main text analysis. The other peaks were composed into independent sets and used for verification of the method. Collagen orientation was evaluated from dependence of IR absorption on the orientation of the absorbing chemical group with respect to IR light polarization. The dichroic difference spectra (A‖ − A⊥) (Fig. 3C) recorded with IR light polarization parallel (‖) and perpendicular (⊥) to a selected direction were recorded and collagen orientation order parameters P and p were evaluated. P=Cc<(2cos2θ−1)cos2η>≈(A∥−A⊥)/I(A∥−A⊥)0/(I0c0)′p=P/Cc(Eq. 2) These parameters are related to angles between the collagen molecular axis and its projection onto the section plane, η, and between the projection and a selected direction in the plane, θ. Angle brackets 〈…〉 denote averaging over the effective illuminated volume (∼6 × 6 × 12 μm3) determined by the actual spatial resolution and the sample thickness l; cc is collagen concentration in this volume measured by the decomposition of depolarized spectra: (A‖ + A⊥)/2. We used baseline-corrected integral intensity (A‖ − A⊥) of the three bands in the amide III region (1135–1350 cm−1) whose vibration dipoles are nearly parallel to the collagen helix axis (Fig. 3B). The A‖ − A⊥ spectra are dominated by collagen because chemical groups of the other components have quasi-random orientations (Fig. 3C). The sample intensity was normalized by the corresponding intensity (A‖ − A⊥)0 of a stretched, washed mouse tendon fiber and its collagen concentration c0 and thickness l0. The concentration was determined from isotropic spectrum (A‖ + 2A⊥)0/3. The fiber was a suitable model because it is composed of ∼95% type I collagen whose spectra are similar to the spectra of collagen from all cartilage regions (Fig. 3C and supplemental Table S2). Extracellular matrix areas (2–10 pixels) were selected based on visible images and HDIR hyperspectral images distinguishing matrix from cells (supplemental Fig. S4). The matrix areas were sampled in ∼100-μm wide regions along the lines shown in Fig. 1 with a density of ∼100 areas per mm2. At the articular surface, 20–30 areas (2 × 2 pixels) were sampled on the inferomedial side every 8 μm. Accidentally damaged regions were excluded. HDIR and autoradiographic characteristics were averaged at selected positions of cartilage zones for each section. The continuous epiphyseal cartilage of 0.5-day-old mice was divided into articular and growth plate regions based on their resemblance to articular cartilage and growth plate, which become separated by the secondary ossification center after 7–14 days. Each region was divided into zones defined morphologically (Fig. 1). The articular region was divided into the articular (A) zone, where cells were flattened, and the subarticular (S) zone, which began where most cells became round (about 140 μm below the articular surface). The boundary between the S and columnar (C) zones of the growth plate region was where most cells became flat and organized into stacks of two or more cells. The enlargement (E) zone began where the thickness (diameter along the bone axis) of most cells became 1.5 times larger than the thickness of the thinnest columnar cells. The hypertrophic (H) zone began where the thickness of most cells was ⅓ of the average thickness of cells where cell enlargement ceased and cartilage mineralization started. The mineralizing cartilage (M) zone began where septa of the mineralizing matrix appeared. The growth plate region ended at bone marrow where chondrocytes could no longer be distinguished. Within such definition, prehypertrophic zone is expected between the beginnings of the E and H zones. For data plotting, the growth plate zones of dtd were shifted so that the H zone beginning of dtd coincided with that of wt.

https://openalex.org/W1966218741,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes such as growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. Functionally important interactions between HS and a variety of proteins depend on specific structural features within the HS chains. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is frequently applied as a model organism to study HS function in development. Previous structural studies of Drosophila HS have been restricted to disaccharide composition, without regard to the arrangement of saccharide domains typically found in vertebrate HS. Here, we biochemically characterized Drosophila HS by selective depolymerization with nitrous acid. Analysis of the generated saccharide products revealed a novel HS design, involving a peripheral, extended, presumably single, N-sulfated domain linked to an N-acetylated sequence contiguous with the linkage to core protein. The N-sulfated domain may be envisaged as a heparin structure of unusually low O-sulfate content."
https://openalex.org/W2057547479,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch DNA recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) are critical for the maturation of the antibody response. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR and SHM by deaminating deoxycytidines (dCs) in switch (S) and V(D)J region DNA, respectively, to generate deoxyuracils (dUs). Processing of dUs by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) yields abasic sites, which are excised by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases, eventually generating double strand DNA breaks, the obligatory intermediates of CSR. Here, we found that the bivalent iron ion (Fe(2+), ferrous) suppressed CSR, leading to decreased number of switched B cells, decreased postrecombination Iμ-C(H) transcripts, and reduced titers of secreted class-switched IgG1, IgG3, and IgA antibodies, without alterations in critical CSR factors, such as AID, 14-3-3γ, or PTIP, or in general germline I(H)-S-C(H) transcription. Fe(2+) did not affect B cell proliferation or plasmacytoid differentiation. Rather, it inhibited AID-mediated dC deamination in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition of intrinsic AID enzymatic activity by Fe(2+) was specific, as shown by lack of inhibition of AID-mediated dC deamination by other bivalent metal ions, such as Zn(2+), Mn(2+), Mg(2+), or Ni(2+), and the inability of Fe(2+) to inhibit UNG-mediated dU excision. Overall, our findings have outlined a novel role of iron in modulating a B cell differentiation process that is critical to the generation of effective antibody responses to microbial pathogens and tumoral cells. They also suggest a possible role of iron in dampening AID-dependent autoimmunity and neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2034178323,"Human P2X2 receptors (hP2X2) are strongly inhibited by zinc over the range of 2-100 μM, whereas rat P2X2 receptors (rP2X2) are strongly potentiated over the same range, and then inhibited by zinc over 100 μM. However, the biological role of zinc modulation is unknown in either species. To identify candidate regions controlling zinc inhibition in hP2X2 a homology model based on the crystal structure of zebrafish P2X4.1 was made. In this model, His-204 and His-209 of one subunit were near His-330 of the adjacent subunit. Cross-linking studies confirmed that these residues are within 8 Å of each other. Simultaneous mutation of these three histidines to alanines decreased the zinc potency of hP2X2 nearly 100-fold. In rP2X2, one of these histidines is replaced by a lysine, and in a background in which zinc potentiation was eliminated, mutation of Lys-197 to histidine converted rP2X2 from low potency to high potency inhibition. We explored whether the zinc-binding site lies within the vestibules running down the central axis of the receptor. Elimination of all negatively charged residues from the upper vestibule had no effect on zinc inhibition. In contrast, mutation of several residues in the hP2X2 middle vestibule resulted in dramatic changes in the potency of zinc inhibition. In particular, the zinc potency of P206C could be reversibly shifted from extremely high (∼10 nM) to very low (>100 μM) by binding and unbinding MTSET. These results suggest that the cluster of histidines at the subunit interface controls access of zinc to its binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2133171429,"A series of arylidene anabaseines were synthesized to probe the functional impact of hydrogen bonding on human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation and desensitization. The aryl groups were either hydrogen bond acceptors (furans), donors (pyrroles), or neither (thiophenes). These compounds were tested against a series of point mutants of the ligand-binding domain residue Gln-57, a residue hypothesized to be proximate to the aryl group of the bound agonist and a putative hydrogen bonding partner. Q57K, Q57D, Q57E, and Q57L were chosen to remove the dual hydrogen bonding donor/acceptor ability of Gln-57 and replace it with hydrogen bond donating, hydrogen bond accepting, or nonhydrogen bonding ability. Activation of the receptor was compromised with hydrogen bonding mismatches, for example, pairing a pyrrole with Q57K or Q57L, or a furan anabaseine with Q57D or Q57E. Ligand co-applications with the positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 produced significantly enhanced currents whose degree of enhancement was greater for 2-furans or -pyrroles than for their 3-substituted isomers, whereas the nonhydrogen bonding thiophenes failed to show this correlation. Interestingly, the PNU-120596 agonist co-application data revealed that for wild-type α7 nAChR, the 3-furan desensitized state was relatively stabilized compared with that of 2-furan, a reversal of the relationship observed with respect to the barrier for entry into the desensitized state. These data highlight the importance of hydrogen bonding on the receptor-ligand state, and suggest that it may be possible to fine-tune features of agonists that mediate state selection in the nAChR. A series of arylidene anabaseines were synthesized to probe the functional impact of hydrogen bonding on human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation and desensitization. The aryl groups were either hydrogen bond acceptors (furans), donors (pyrroles), or neither (thiophenes). These compounds were tested against a series of point mutants of the ligand-binding domain residue Gln-57, a residue hypothesized to be proximate to the aryl group of the bound agonist and a putative hydrogen bonding partner.
