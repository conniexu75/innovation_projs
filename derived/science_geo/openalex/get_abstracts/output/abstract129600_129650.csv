https://openalex.org/W1978518304,"DNA-damaging agents signal to p53 through as yet unidentified posttranscriptional mechanisms. Here we show that phosphorylation of human p53 at serine 15 occurs after DNA damage and that this leads to reduced interaction of p53 with its negative regulator, the oncoprotein MDM2, in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, using purified DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), we demonstrate that phosphorylation of p53 at serines 15 and 37 impairs the ability of MDM2 to inhibit p53-dependent transactivation. We present evidence that these effects are most likely due to a conformational change induced upon phosphorylation of p53. Our studies provide a plausible mechanism by which the induction of p53 can be modulated by DNA-PK (or other protein kinases with similar specificity) in response to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2031311732,"Chemokines have been convincingly implicated in actuating inflammatory leukocyte emigration. To affect the circulating leukocytes, tissue-derived chemokines have to traverse the endothelial cells (ECs). This was thought to be accomplished by chemokine diffusion through the intercellular gaps. On the contrary, we show by electron microscopy that the prototype chemokine IL-8 is internalized by venular ECs abluminally and transcytosed to the luminal surface. Here, it is presented to the adherent leukocytes on the EC membrane, predominantly in association with the EC projections. The intact C terminus of IL-8, the molecule's “immobilization” domain, is required for the EC binding, transcytosis, and consequently, the in vivo proemigratory activity of IL-8, indicating that the described subcellular interactions of IL-8 with the ECs are functionally relevant."

https://openalex.org/W1982453928,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) is required to initiate eukaryotic DNA replication and also engages in transcriptional silencing in S. cerevisiae. We observed a striking preferential but not exclusive association of Drosophila ORC2 with heterochromatin on interphase and mitotic chromosomes. HP1, a heterochromatin-localized protein required for position effect variegation (PEV), colocalized with DmORC2 at these sites. Consistent with this localization, intact DmORC and HP1 were found in physical complex. The association was shown biochemically to require the chromodomain and shadow domains of HP1. The amino terminus of DmORC1 contained a strong HP1-binding site, mirroring an interaction found independently in Xenopus by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Finally, heterozygous DmORC2 recessive lethal mutations resulted in a suppression of PEV. These results indicate that ORC may play a widespread role in packaging chromosomal domains through interactions with heterochromatin-organizing factors."
https://openalex.org/W2036530157,"Mitosis requires dynamic attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This interaction is mediated largely by kinetochores. During prometaphase, forces exerted at kinetochores, in combination with polar ejection forces, drive congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. A major question has been whether kinetochore-associated microtubule motors play an important role in congression. Using immunodepletion from and antibody addition to Xenopus egg extracts, we show that the kinetochore-associated kinesin-like motor protein CENP-E is essential for positioning chromosomes at the metaphase plate. We further demonstrate that CENP-E powers movement toward microtubule plus ends in vitro. These findings support a model in which CENP-E functions in congression to tether kinetochores to dynamic microtubule plus ends."

Xolloid-treated Chordin protein was unable to antagonize BMP activity. Furthermore, Xolloid digestion released biologically active BMPs from Chordin/BMP inactive complexes. Injection of dominant-negative Xolloid mRNA indicated that the in vivo function of Xolloid is to limit the extent of Spemann's organizer field. We propose that Xolloid regulates organizer function by a novel proteolytic mechanism involving a double inhibition pathway required to pattern the dorsoventral axis: [formula in text]."
https://openalex.org/W2003197964,"Recent studies have suggested that global intracellular Ca2+ signals arise from the summation and coordination of subcellular elementary release events (e.g., “Ca2+ puffs”), although the modes of recruitment of such signals are unknown. In order to understand how cells utilize elementary Ca2+ release events, we imaged Ca2+ transients evoked through the phosphoinositide pathway in HeLa cells using confocal microscopy. During the pacemaker phase leading to the global Ca2+ signal, elementary Ca2+ release events were recruited in (1) frequency, (2) amplitude, and (3) spatial domains. Since each digital elementary event contributes to a small change of the analog cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, the net effect of the advancement in the three domains is to drive the ambient Ca2+ concentration toward a threshold where the signal becomes regenerative, resulting in a global Ca2+ wave."
https://openalex.org/W2051260092,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma and a rare B cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma. The KSHV gene ORF K9 encodes vIRF which is a protein with low but significant homology to members of the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) family responsible for regulating intracellular interferon signal transduction (Moore PS, Boshoff C, Weiss RA and Chang Y. (1996). Science, 274, 1739 – 1744). vIRF inhibits IFN-β signal transduction as measured using an IFN-responsive ISG54 reporter construct co-transfected with ORF K9 into HeLa and 293 cells. vIRF also suppresses genes under IFN regulatory control as shown by inhibition of the IFN-β inducibility of p21WAF1/CIP1, however, no direct DNA-binding or protein-protein interactions characteristic for IRF repressor proteins were identified. Stable transfectant NIH3T3 clones expressing vIRF grew in soft agar and at low serum concentrations, lost contact inhibition and formed tumors after injection into nude mice indicating that vIRF has the properties of a viral oncogene. Since vIRF is primarily expressed in KSHV-infected B cells, not KS spindle cells, this study suggests that vIRF is a transforming oncogene active in B cell neoplasias that may provide a unique immune escape mechanism for infected cells. This data is consistent with tumor suppressor pathways serving a dual function as host cell antiviral pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2026813670,"We have isolated two Xenopus relatives of murine Sox17 expressed in gastrula presumptive endoderm. Xsox17alpha and -beta expression can be induced in animal caps by activin, but not by FGF. Ectopic expression of these genes in animal caps induces the expression of endoderm markers; this induction is blocked by overexpression of a fusion of the Xsox17beta HMG domain to the Drosophila Engrailed repressor domain, as is induction of endoderm markers by activin and the expression of endodermal markers in whole embryos and isolated vegetal poles. These experiments, as well as the effects of the mRNAs on embryo phenotypes, suggest that the Xsox17 genes mediate an activin-induced endoderm differentiation pathway in animal caps and are involved in normal endoderm differentiation in embryos."

https://openalex.org/W1968263279,"During early Drosophila embryogenesis, several zygotic gene products act to establish a posttranscriptional activity gradient of the morphogen DPP. Among these molecules, Tolloid, a putative metalloprotease related to BMP-1, enhances DPP function, while SOG, an ortholog of the Xenopus organizer Chordin, inhibits DPP function. Using epistasis tests and a Xenopus secondary axis induction assay, we show that TLD negates the inhibitory effects of SOG/CHD on DPP/BMP-type ligands. In transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that TLD cleaves SOG and that cleavage is stimulated by DPP. We propose that formation of the embryonic DPP activity gradient involves the opposing effects of SOG inhibiting DPP and TLD processing SOG to release DPP from the inhibitory complex."

https://openalex.org/W1980225897,"The crystal structure of the δ′ subunit of the clamp-loader complex of E. coli DNA polymerase III has been determined. Three consecutive domains in the structure are arranged in a C-shaped architecture. The N-terminal domain contains a nonfunctional nucleotide binding site. The catalytic component of the clamp-loader complex is the γ subunit, which is homologous to δ′. A sequence-structure alignment suggests that nucleotides bind to γ at an interdomain interface within the inner surface of the “C.” The alignment is extended to other clamp-loader complexes and to the RuvB family of DNA helicases, and suggests that each of these is assembled from C-shaped components that can open and close the jaws of the “C” in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2052996930,"Calmodulin (CAM) participates in a variety of intracellular transduction processes by modulating signaling molecules in response to calcium changes. We report the characterization of Drosophila Cam mutants and the role of CAM in photoreceptor cell function. Contrary to current models of excitation and TRP channel function, we demonstrate that the transient phenotype of trp mutants can be explained by CAM regulation of the TRPL channel rather than by the loss of a store-operated conductance leading to depletion of the internal stores. We also analyzed light responses in a variety of mutant and transgenic backgrounds and demonstrate the importance of calmodulin in mediating calcium-dependent negative regulation of phototransduction. Our results show that CAM coordinates termination of the light response by modulating receptor and ion channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085016183,"In the presence of both the RecF and RecR proteins, RecA filament extension from a single strand gap into adjoining duplex DNA is attenuated. RecR protein alone has no effect, and RecF protein alone has a reduced activity. The RecFR complexes bind randomly, primarily to the duplex regions of the DNA, and the extension of the RecA filament is halted at the first complex encountered. A very slow lengthening of RecA filaments observed in the presence of RecFR is virtually eliminated when RecF is replaced with an RecF mutant protein that does not hydrolyze ATP. These observations are incorporated into an expanded model for the functions of RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins in the early stages of postreplication DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2329249786,"We have investigated the role of the NFκB complex in the process of thyroid carcinogenesis by analysing thyroid carcinoma cell lines. A significant increase in p65 NFκB mRNA and protein expression, compared to normal thyroid cultures or tissue, was found in all of the cancer cell lines. Conversely, only a modest increase in the p50 NFκB mRNA and protein was found in most, but not all carcinoma cell lines. The block of p65 protein synthesis with specific antisense oligonucleotides greatly reduced the ability of two undifferentiated carcinoma cell lines to form colonies in agar and reduced their growth rate. On the other hand, no effect was observed in the same cell lines when treated with p50 specific antisense oligonucleotides. These inhibitory effects seem to be mediated by the suppression of c-myc gene expression, since treatment with antisense oligonucleotides for p65 gene interfered negatively with c-myc gene expression. Our results indicate that activation of the NFκB complex by overexpression of p65 plays a critical role in the process of thyroid cell transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2328093310,"It has been suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene activates X gene expression by disrupting the function of p53 tumor suppressor gene (Takada et al., 1996). To find out their connection, effect of X protein expression on the nuclear localization of p53 protein in human hepatoma cells was examined by the immunofluorescent double-staining technique. The location of transiently-expressed p53 protein was examined in X gene-transfected cells, where X protein was detected in the cytoplasm. The nuclear location of transiently-expressed p53 protein was changed to the cytoplasm by X protein co-expression. Endogenous p53 protein was also observed in the cytoplasm by X protein expression. The transcriptional activation domain of X protein and the carboxy-terminal region of p53 protein were found mutually responsible for the cytoplasmic retention of p53 protein in X gene-transfected cells. Therefore, the cytoplasmic retention of p53 protein may be closely correlated to the function of X protein expressed in transfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2314235576,"The products (p21) of the three mammalian H-, N- and K-ras genes play important roles in intracellular signal transduction, linking membrane receptor kinases to the nuclear pathway through raf and mitogen activated protein kinase. They are involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, and activating mutations of these genes are commonly associated with human cancers. Two p21 proteins are encoded by the K-ras gene (p21K-rasA and p21K-rasB) due to alternative splicing of the last exon. While the four p21ras proteins are highly homologous, their sequences diverge significantly at the C-termini, to which distinct biochemical and perhaps even functional differences may be ascribed. However, H-, N- and K-rasB appear to be ubiquitously expressed, with little evidence of tissue-specific or developmental regulation. In contrast, we now demonstrate that the expression of K-rasA is strikingly different. K-rasA is induced during differentiation of pluripotent embryonal stem cells in vitro. Its expression during early embryogenesis is limited temporally and spatially in a tissue-specific distribution which is largely maintained as an adult. This suggests a distinct biological role for p21K-rasA."

https://openalex.org/W2326838035,"Bcl-2 family proteins and ICE/CED-3 family proteases (caspases) are regarded as the basic regulators of apoptotic cell death. They are evolutionarily conserved and implicated in a variety of apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism by which these two families interact to regulate cell death is not yet known. In this study, we found that the overexpression of the Bcl-2 family member Bax induced apoptotic cell death in COS-7 cells through the activation of CPP32 (caspase-3)-like proteases that cleaved the DEVD tetrapeptide. This apoptotic cell death was suppressed by the viral proteins CrmA and p35, as well as by the chemically synthesized caspase inhibitors Z-Asp-CH2-DCB and zVAD-fmk. We also found that the Bax-induced apoptosis of COS-7 cells was suppressed by Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, though both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 similarly prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis in COS-7 cells. In addition, Bcl-xL inhibited the activation of caspase-3-like proteases accompanying Bax-induced COS-7 cell death but Bcl-2 did not. These results indicate that the caspase activation is essential for Bax-induced apoptosis, and that the ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to prevent the Bax-induced caspase activation and apoptosis in COS-7 cells could be differentially regulated. Our results also suggest that Bcl-2 family proteins function upstream of caspase activation and control apoptosis through the regulation of caspase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2329475265,"The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1, encodes a transcription factor in the zinc finger family, which binds to GC-rich sequences and functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor. The WT1 protein plays a crucial role in urogenital development in mammals and its function is thought to be conserved during vertebrate evolution. Although accumulating evidence suggests that WT1 regulates a subset of genes including growth factor and growth factor receptor genes, little is known about regulators or signal cascades that could modulate the function of WT1. In this study, we show that the WT1 protein expressed exogenously in fibroblasts was phosphorylated in vivo, and that treatment with forskolin, which activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in vivo, induced phosphorylation of additional sites in WT1. We identified the forskolin-induced phosphorylation sites as Ser-365 and Ser-393, which lie in the zinc finger domain in zinc fingers 2 and 3, respectively. PKA phosphorylated WT1 at Ser-365 and Ser-393 in vitro, as well as at additional sites, and this phosphorylation abolished the DNA-binding activity of WT1 in vitro. Using WT1 mutants in which Ser-365 and Ser-393 were mutated to Ala individually and in combination, we showed that phosphorylation of these sites was critical for inhibition of DNA binding in vivo. Thus, coexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit with wild type WT1 reduced the level of WT1 DNA-binding activity detected in nuclear extracts, and decreased transcriptional repression activity in vivo. In contrast to wild type WT1, all of the phosphorylation site mutants retained significant DNA-binding activity and repression activity in the presence of PKA. Analysis of the mutants showed that phosphorylation of Ser-365 and Ser-395 had additive inhibitory effects on WT1 DNA-binding in vivo and that phosphorylation at both sites was required for neutralization of repression activity. Therefore, we conclude that PKA modulates the activity of WT1 in vivo through phosphorylation of Ser-365 and Ser-393, which inhibits DNA binding. This in turn results in a decrease in WT1 transcriptional repression. Our findings provide the first evidence that the function of WT1 can be modulated by its phosphorylation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2335497392,"Bak has been shown to both promote apoptosis and to inhibit cell death while two other members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 delay apoptosis induced by various stimuli including chemotherapeutic agents. We generated clones with stable expression of Bak wild-type (wt) and Bak with its BH3 (Δ78-86) domain deleted (ΔBH3) in FL5.12 cells or FL5.12 cells expressing either Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 to determine if Bak could accelerate apoptosis and antagonize the death repressor activity of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We found that Bak accelerated cell death in FL5.12 cells treated with etoposide, fluorouracil or taxol. In FL5.12 cells expressing Bcl-XL and Bak wt or Bak ΔBH3, both Bak wt or Bak ΔBH3 were able to antagonize the protective effect of Bcl-XL when treated with etoposide or fluorouracil. Bak wt or Bak ΔBH3 were also able to abrogate the protective effect of Bcl-2 in cells expressing Bcl-2 and Bak wt or Bak ΔBH3 when challenged by etoposide or fluorouracil. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that deletion of BH3 disrupted heterodimerization between Bak and Bcl-XL and that both Bak wt and Bak ΔBH3 failed to interact with Bcl-2. These results demonstrate that Bak does not require its BH3 domain to promote apoptosis in stably transfected cells. Furthermore, Bak can accelerate chemotherapy-induced cell death independently of its heterodimerization with Bcl-XL and Bcl-2."

https://openalex.org/W2333607073,"SH3-containing proteins are involved in signal transduction by a number of growth factor receptors and in the organization of the cytoskeleton. The recently identified Eps8 protein, which contains an SH3 domain, is coupled functionally and physically to the EGFR and is tyrosine phosphorylated by this receptor and other receptors as well. Here, we examined the regulation of eps8 expression in response to mitogenic or differentiative signals. We show that Eps8 is expressed at low levels in resting fibroblasts, but its expression is strongly induced during activation by serum, phorbol esters and the v-src oncogene. Conversely, expression of Eps8, but not of other EGFR substrates such as Shc or Eps15, is virtually extinguished in non-proliferating, terminally differentiated murine myogenic cells. The putative role of Eps8 protein as a v-Src substrate was analysed in murine fibroblasts and in quail myogenic cells expressing a temperature-sensitive variant of the tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps8 was detected only at the permissive temperature. A non-myristylated, transformation-defective mutant of v-Src did not phosphorylate Eps8, whereas it phosphorylated Shc. Together, these findings indicate that Eps8 may be a critical substrate of v-Src. They further establish Eps8 as an example of a signal transducer whose expression senses the balance between growth and differentiation and might, therefore, be involved in the determination of the phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2405191088,"The Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors controls the expression of a wide variety of genes that are implicated in immune and inflammatory responses and cellular proliferation. Disregulation of NF-kappaB is associated with cellular transformation and the maintenance of a high anti-apoptotic threshold in transformed cells. NF-kappaB activity is in turn regulated by its sequestration in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor I kappaB. I kappaB alpha, the most abundant and well-characterized member of the I kappaB multiprotein family, is rapidly degraded in response to multiple physiologic stimuli. In the present study we show that not only the amino-terminus, but also the carboxy-terminus of I kappaB alpha contain transferable signals that must be simultaneously present in an unrelated protein to render it susceptible to activation-induced, proteasome-mediated degradation. We show here that I kappaB alpha amino-terminal modifications occur independently of the carboxy-terminus. Moreover, we present evidence indicating a critical role for the carboxy-terminal region in facilitating proteolysis by the catalytic core of the proteasome. When incubated with 20S proteasome extracted from rat liver, I kappaB alpha was quickly degraded while a deletion mutant lacking the carboxy-terminus was resistant to proteolysis. Likewise, chimeric proteins of beta-galactosidase with the I kappaB alpha carboxy-terminus were degraded in vitro independently of the presence of the I kappaB alpha amino-terminus, whereas chimeric proteins lacking the I kappaB alpha carboxy-terminus were stable. Our results identify the carboxy-terminus of I kappaB alpha as a domain critical for degradation through interaction with an as yet unidentified component of the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W2060640805,"The Tg737 gene was investigated for gross alterations in a series of rodent/human liver tumors and human tumorigenic cell lines. The Tg737 gene was found to be altered in approximately 40% of the rodent chemically-induced liver tumors, 40% of the human liver tumors, and in liver, kidney and pancreatic human tumor cell lines. Ectopic re-expression of the Tg737 gene in a Tg737 deleted mouse liver tumor cell line resulted in suppression of tumorigenic growth, without altering in vitro cell culture growth. Treatment of mice which are either homozygous normal or heterozygous deleted at the Tg737 locus with the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine resulted in an increase in preneoplastic foci formation in the Tg737 heterozygous deleted mice. Ectopic expression of the Tg737 gene results in multinucleated cells, loss of Tg737 gene expression results in the proliferation of liver stem cells (oval cells) without concomitant differentiation, and reexpression of the Tg737 gene reestablished responsiveness to external differentiation factors. We believe this is the first report demonstrating tumor suppression activity for a tetratricopeptide repeat gene family member and provides insights into the function of this family of genes in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2319271253,"The SH3-SH3-SH3-SH2 adapter protein Nck links receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGF and PDGF receptors, to downstream signaling pathways, among which p21cdc42/rac-activated kinase cascade, Sos-activated Ras signaling and the human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp)-mediated actin cytoskeleton changes, have been implicated. In EGF stimulated cells, Nck co-immunoprecipitates with a number of phosphotyrosine proteins including the EGF receptor (Li et al., 1992 Mol. Cell. Biol. 12: 5824-2833). To identify the phosphotyrosine protein(s) that directly interacts with Nck and to distinguish it from indirectly associated proteins, preexisting phosphoytrosine protein complexes in the cell lysate were dissociated by heat and SDS prior to the test for binding to Nck. We found that Nck does not directly bind to EGF receptor, instead it binds via its SH2 domain to a 62 kDa phosphotyrosine protein. We present evidence demonstrating that the Nck-bound p62 is related to the previously identified GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-associated phosphotyrosine protein p62. (1) The Nck-bound and the GAP-bound p62 proteins co-migrate with each other in SDS-PAGE. (2) SH2 domains from Nck and GAP compete for binding to p62 in vitro. (3) Purified GST-Nck-SH2 binds directly to the GAP-associated p62. Under these conditions, SH2 domains from PLCgamma, PI-3 kinase, SHC, and Grb2 did not bind p62. (4) Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the Nck- and the GAP-associated p62 proteins are identical. However, Nck and GAP do not co-immunoprecipitate with each other and apparently bind to different pools of p62. This study suggests that the GAP-associated p62 acts as an SH2 domain docking protein and mediates the interaction between Nck and EGF receptor in response to EGF stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2326329615,"AF4 is the 4q21 gene involved in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated t(4;11)(q21;q23) where it forms a fusion gene with MLL. In order to gain insight into AF4's role in leukemogenesis we have studied its functional domains and expression pattern during murine development. We have cloned the murine homolog, Af4. We have demonstrated that 5′ half of Af4 encodes a region with transcriptional transactivation activity which is disrupted by the t(4;11) in human leukemias. We have also localized the murine AF4 protein to the nucleus supporting a role for AF4 in transcription. The developmental expression pattern of Af4 was determined in situ hybridization and suggests Af4 plays an important role in the development of the hematopoietic, cardiovascular, skeletal and central nervous systems. A repeating pattern of Af4 expression in development is down-regulation with differentiation of a tissue. Among the cell types where this pattern of down-regulation is noted are B-lymphocytes. These findings raise the possibility that the disruption of normal AF4 function by the translocation may contribute to leukemogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2318311987,"Retinoic acid (RA) plays a major role in embryogenesis of the nervous system and has been reported to induce differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines. To identify RA signaling pathways involved in such differentiation processes, two RA-sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines (LA-N-5 and SH-SY5Y) were extensively studied. Northern blot experiments determined that of the three RAR mRNAs, only RARα was significantly expressed, with respectively weak or undetectable levels of RARγ and RARβ. RXRs (α and β) receptors were weakly expressed. Western blotting analysis confirmed the constitutive expression of RARα and absence of RARβ and weak levels of RXRα. Treatment with all-trans-RA up-regulated RARα and induced a drastic increase of RARβ (both at the RNA and protein level). To further characterize the function of RARα, RARβ and RXRα in NB cells, nuclear extracts from LA-N-5 cells were analysed by EMSA studies. Three specific retarded complexes were observed which were significantly decreased or shifted in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to RARα, RARβ and RXRα. RA treatment dramatically induced a DR5-binding RXRα-RARβ heterodimer. Treatment with combinations of RARα or RARβ agonists with a RXRα agonist or with a RARα agonist alone, induced neurite-outgrowth supporting the probability that both RXRα-RARα or RXRα-RARβ heterodimers are involved in RA-mediated differentiation of NB cells. The availability of novel synthetic RA-specific receptor ligands should provide the possibility of tissue specific therapeutic regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2333011916,"We have previously shown that the src-family protein-tyrosine kinase Hck is localized on the azurophil granules of human granulocytes, translocates towards the phagosomes during phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan and is activated during this process. Hck is also activated upon cell stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187, but not with PMA or the chemotactic peptide fMLP. Here, we investigated whether the src-family kinases Lyn and Fgr are activated under the same conditions. Upon stimulation of human neutrophils or retinoic acid-differentiated NB4 cells with fMLP, only Lyn is activated. Cell stimulation with opsonized zymosan or A23187 leads to simultaneous activation of Lyn and Fgr. In cell fractionation experiments with differentiated NB4 cells, the kinases show a similar subcellular localization: Both co-fractionate quantitatively with plasma-membrane marker in two fractions that sediment at 11 000 g and 200 000 g. Lyn is selectively activated in the 200 000 g fraction, whereas Fgr is activated in the 11 000 g fraction and distinct sets of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are found in these fractions. The results suggest that these kinases exert their functional roles in distinct cellular compartments in human granulocytic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2328711865,"While it is known that the constitutive activity of a variety of signal transduction molecules leads to cell transformation, a key unresolved question is whether these wirings converge to a common intermediate(s) that dictates transformation. In this study, we investigated whether NIH3T3 and Rat-1 cells transformed by human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), c-Ha-rasVal12 and temperature-sensitive v-src oncogene display common alteration(s) in the components that relay PDGF-mediated signals in normal fibroblasts. The ras- and ODC-transformed cells did not show constitutively elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of the phospholipase Cgamma-1 (PLCgamma-1), RasGTPase-activating protein (GAP), phosphotyrosine phosphatase Syp, Shc proteins, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) or activation of the MAP kinase (Erk1 and Erk2), p70 S6 kinase or the Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein-1 pathways. Instead, the Ras nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1 and Raf-1 kinase exhibited constitutive phosphorylations, as deduced from their electrophoretic mobility shifts in polyacrylamide gels. Hence a kinase distinct from Erk1 and Erk2, previously known to feedback phosphorylate Sos-1 and Raf-1, is responsible for the phosphorylation of these molecules in the transformants. We also demonstrate that the ras- and ODC-transformed cells exhibit loss of both the PDGF alpha- and beta-receptors, while the v-Src-transformants show a predominant reduction in the beta-receptors. Moreover, all the transformed cell lines were found to display a constitutive increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun on serines 63 and 73, which appears to be governed by an as yet unknown kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2332494992,"Apoptotic cell death is driven by ICE family proteases (caspases) and negatively regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. Although it has been shown that Bcl-2 exerts anti-apoptotic activity by blocking a step(s) leading to the activation of caspases, a role for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL downstream of the caspase cascade has remained unclear. Here, we show that purified active caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain) and caspase-1 (ICE) induces apoptosis when microinjected into the cytoplasm of cells, confirming our recent observations, and that the apoptosis is not at all prevented by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are overexpressed more than sufficiently to prevent Fas-mediated and overexpressed procaspase-1-mediated apoptosis.

To investigate this apparent paradox, we analysed in vitro the responses of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells to γ-irradiation in the presence and absence of Bcl-2. High-level expression of Bcl-2 was shown to promote BL cell survival following irradiation. However, a significant proportion of Bcl-2-rescued cells subsequently underwent apoptosis after an extended period in culture. In addition, in different BL lines, Bcl-2 was found either to promote or to inhibit long-term proliferative activity following γ-irradiation. This differential regulation of proliferation correlated both with differential effects of Bcl-2 on the cell cycle and with differences in p53 status. Thus, by one week after irradiation, BL cells expressing only wild-type p53 (wt/wt) had arrested in G1, whereas those with a mutant allele (wt/mu) were arrested in all phases of the cell cycle. The proportion of Bcl-2-rescued cells that subsequently underwent apoptosis was reduced by ligation of CD40 at the time of irradiation in wt/wt BL cells, but not in wt/mu cells. CD40-ligation reduced both G1-arrest and apoptosis in parallel. These results indicate that, whilst Bcl-2 can delay apoptosis in BL cells following γ-irradiation, the protein can also cause growth-arrest and thereby promote apoptosis. Long-term survival following Bcl-2-mediated rescue of γ-irradiated cells may depend on p53 status and require additional death-repressing or growth-promoting signals."
https://openalex.org/W2325328007,"The C3H/HeJ (C3H), A/J and BALB/cByJ (BALB) mouse strains are respectively resistant, sensitive and intermediate regarding the induction of lung tumors by urethane. The phenotypic difference between C3H and A/J is largely determined by the Pas1 (Pulmonary adenoma susceptibility 1) gene on chromosome 6, the A/J allele of which dominantly increases the tumor burden. We recently found that BALB mice possess a unique lung tumor resistance gene on chromosome 18, designated Par2 (Pulmonary adenoma resistance 2), which partially, but dominantly suppresses the sensitive phenotype of A/J mice (Oncogene 13: 1599-1604, 1996). It has, however, remained unclear why BALB mice carrying the Par2 gene are significantly more sensitive to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis than C3H mice that have no dominant lung tumor resistance genes. In the present study, using (C3H x BALB)F1 x C3H backcross mice treated with urethane, we demonstrated that BALB mice possess the disease allele of the Pas1 gene despite their 15-fold more resistance relative to A/J mice (LOD = 22.6). The BALB Par2 allele only significantly reduced the mean lung tumor multiplicity (LOD = 4.4) in the backcross population carrying the BALB allele of Pas1, indicating that the intermediate BALB phenotype may at least in part be the result of interactions between these two dominant genes. While the BALB Pas1 allele increased both the mean multiplicity and size of lung tumors, the BALB Par2 allele affected only the mean tumor multiplicity, implying that they are involved in different stages of multi-step lung carcinogenesis. In addition, we found that 68% of lung tumors from the BALB Pas1-positive backcross mice contained activating point mutations of the Kras2 oncogene, tightly linked to the Pas1 locus, whereas these genetic alterations were absent in tumors from BALB Pas1-negative mice. The Par2 genotype exhibited no effect on this parameter. Since the activating point mutations were observed exclusively in the BALB allele as already reported with lung tumors in (C57BL/6J x BALB/cJ)F1 mice, BALB Pas1 or possibly Kras2 itself may confer selective growth advantage on the affected urethane-initiated lung lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2331904054,"It is presently unclear if ovarian cancers arise through malignant transformation of pre-existing benign tumours. The apparent rarity of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) reported for benign tumours has led to speculation that they lack malignant potential and represent a biological entity distinct from ovarian carcinoma. We reasoned that the absence of detectable LOH may be due to the masking of such losses by contamination with normal tissue present in excess in the majority of benign tumour biopsies. Therefore we utilized a microdissection technique to examine for LOH using 14 microsatellite markers on chromosome arms 6q, 7p, 7q, 9p, 11q and 17p in 31 solitary benign epithelial ovarian tumours. LOH was detected on all chromosome arms with the most frequent LOH occurring on 7p (27%) and 9p (26%). In addition, a point mutation in codon 157 of TP53 was detected in one tumour which is the first report of a TP53 mutation in a solitary benign ovarian tumour. In total 48% of tumours harboured genetic alterations which supports the idea that all benign ovarian tumours may carry a genetic predisposition to malignancy and are therefore not inherently different from their malignant counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2330709326,"Abnormal production of erythropoietin (Epo) has been described in several human and murine erythroleukemia. The murine IW32 cell line is derived from an F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia. An autocrine Epo production due to the rearrangement of one Epo allele has been previously described (Beru et al., 1989). However, the exact mechanism leading to the transcriptional activation of the abnormal Epo gene was unknown. In this study, we show that this deregulated expression results from a deletion within chromosome 5. The Epo gene in the abnormal allele is under the control of the G-protein beta2 subunit gene promoter and the expressed mRNA results from the fusion of the non coding exon 1 of the G-protein beta2 subunit gene to a truncated Epo exon 1 gene. This resulting abnormal cDNA allows the expression of a normal Epo protein."
