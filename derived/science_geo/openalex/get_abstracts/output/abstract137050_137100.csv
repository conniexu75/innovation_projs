https://openalex.org/W2093856853,"Quantum teleportation of optical coherent states was demonstrated experimentally using squeezed-state entanglement. The quantum nature of the achieved teleportation was verified by the experimentally determined fidelity Fexp = 0.58 +/- 0.02, which describes the match between input and output states. A fidelity greater than 0.5 is not possible for coherent states without the use of entanglement. This is the first realization of unconditional quantum teleportation where every state entering the device is actually teleported."
https://openalex.org/W1998038367,"PTEN is a tumor suppressor with sequence homology to protein tyrosine phosphatases and the cytoskeletal protein tensin. mPTEN-mutant mouse embryos display regions of increased proliferation. In contrast, mPTEN-deficient immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit decreased sensitivity to cell death in response to a number of apoptotic stimuli, accompanied by constitutively elevated activity and phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt, a crucial regulator of cell survival. Expression of exogenous PTEN in mutant cells restores both their sensitivity to agonist-induced apoptosis and normal pattern of PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, PTEN negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate in cells and dephosphorylates it in vitro. Our results show that PTEN may exert its role as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the PI3'K/PKB/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2135951244,"Diploid cells of budding yeast produce haploid cells through the developmental program of sporulation, which consists of meiosis and spore morphogenesis. DNA microarrays containing nearly every yeast gene were used to assay changes in gene expression during sporulation. At least seven distinct temporal patterns of induction were observed. The transcription factor Ndt80 appeared to be important for induction of a large group of genes at the end of meiotic prophase. Consensus sequences known or proposed to be responsible for temporal regulation could be identified solely from analysis of sequences of coordinately expressed genes. The temporal expression pattern provided clues to potential functions of hundreds of previously uncharacterized genes, some of which have vertebrate homologs that may function during gametogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2157513658,"The mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin induces neurodegeneration were investigated using a cellular model that recapitulates features of neurodegeneration seen in Huntington's disease. When transfected into cultured striatal neurons, mutant huntingtin induces neurodegeneration by an apoptotic mechanism. Antiapoptotic compounds or neurotrophic factors protected neurons against mutant huntingtin. Blocking nuclear localization of mutant huntingtin suppressed its ability to form intranuclear inclusions and to induce neurodegeneration. However, the presence of inclusions did not correlate with huntingtin-induced death. The exposure of mutant huntingtin-transfected striatal neurons to conditions that suppress the formation of inclusions resulted in an increase in mutant huntingtin-induced death. These findings suggest that mutant huntingtin acts within the nucleus to induce neurodegeneration. However, intranuclear inclusions may reflect a cellular mechanism to protect against huntingtin-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2021549542,"Transgenic mice carrying the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene, a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, develop ataxia with ataxin-1 localized to aggregates within cerebellar Purkinje cells nuclei. To examine the importance of nuclear localization and aggregation in pathogenesis, mice expressing ataxin-1[82] with a mutated NLS were established. These mice did not develop disease, demonstrating that nuclear localization is critical for pathogenesis. In a second series of transgenic mice, ataxin-1[77] containing a deletion within the self-association region was expressed within Purkinje cells nuclei. These mice developed ataxia and Purkinje cell pathology similar to the original SCA1 mice. However, no evidence of nuclear ataxin-1 aggregates was found. Thus, although nuclear localization of ataxin-1 is necessary, nuclear aggregation of ataxin-1 is not required to initiate pathogenesis in transgenic mice."

A new plan, for 1998–2003, is presented, in which human DNA sequencing will be the major emphasis. An ambitious schedule has been set to complete the full sequence by the end of 2003, 2 years ahead of previous projections. In the course of completing the sequence, a “working draft” of the human sequence will be produced by the end of 2001. The plan also includes goals for sequencing technology development; for studying human genome sequence variation; for developing technology for functional genomics; for completing the sequence of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and starting the mouse genome; for studying the ethical, legal, and social implications of genome research; for bioinformatics and computational studies; and for training of genome scientists."

https://openalex.org/W2102337085,"Directional sensing by eukaryotic cells does not require polarization of chemoattractant receptors. The translocation of the PH domain-containing protein CRAC in D. discoideum to binding sites on the inner face of the plasma membrane reflects activation of the G protein-linked signaling system. Increments in chemoattractant elicit a uniform response around the cell periphery. Yet when cells are exposed to a gradient, the activation occurs selectively at the stimulated edge, even in immobilized cells. We propose that such localized activation, transmitted by the recruitment of cytosolic proteins, may be a general mechanism for gradient sensing by G protein-linked chemotactic systems including those involving chemotactic cytokines in leukocytes."

Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the thermodynamic controls on carbonate growth and to measure the dependence of step speed on step length and the dependence of critical step length on supersaturation in precisely controlled solutions. These data were used to test the classic Gibbs-Thomson relationship and provided the step edge free energies and free energy barriers to one-dimension nucleation for calcite. Addition of aspartic acid, a common component in biomineralizing systems, dramatically affected growth morphology and altered the magnitude of the surface energy."

https://openalex.org/W2028183921,"Sonic hedgehog signaling controls the differentiation of motor neurons in the ventral neural tube, but the intervening steps are poorly understood. A differential screen of a cDNA library derived from a single Shh-induced motor neuron has identified a novel homeobox gene, MNR2, expressed by motor neuron progenitors and transiently by postmitotic motor neurons. The ectopic expression of MNR2 in neural cells initiates a program of somatic motor neuron differentiation characterized by the expression of homeodomain proteins, by neurotransmitter phenotype, and by axonal trajectory. Our results suggest that the Shh-mediated induction of a single transcription factor, MNR2, is sufficient to direct somatic motor neuron differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2001221569,"Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is necessary for stage-specific expression of the human beta-globin gene. We show that EKLF requires a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex, EKLF coactivator-remodeling complex 1 (E-RC1), to generate a DNase I hypersensitive, transcriptionally active beta-globin promoter on chromatin templates in vitro. E-RC1 contains BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, and INI1 (BAF47) homologs of yeast SWI/SNF subunits, as well as a subunit unique to higher eukaryotes, BAF57, which is critical for chromatin remodeling and transcription with EKLF. E-RC1 displays functional selectivity toward transcription factors, since it cannot activate expression of chromatin-assembled HIV-1 templates with the E box-binding protein TFE-3. Thus, a member of the SWI/SNF family acts directly in transcriptional activation and may regulate subsets of genes by selectively interacting with specific DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2038599420,"Flap endonuclease (FEN-1) removes 5' overhanging flaps in DNA repair and processes the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis. The crystal structure of Pyrococcus furiosus FEN-1, active-site metal ions, and mutational information indicate interactions for the single- and double-stranded portions of the flap DNA substrate and identify an unusual DNA-binding motif. The enzyme's active-site structure suggests that DNA binding induces FEN-1 to clamp onto the cleavage junction to form the productive complex. The conserved FEN-1 C terminus binds proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and positions FEN-1 to act primarily as an exonuclease in DNA replication, in contrast to its endonuclease activity in DNA repair. FEN-1 mutations altering PCNA binding should reduce activity during replication, likely causing DNA repeat expansions as seen in some cancers and genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2060601033,"The role of inhibitory Golgi cells in cerebellar function was investigated by selectively ablating Golgi cells expressing human interleukin-2 receptor α subunit in transgenic mice, using the immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting technique. Golgi cell disruption caused severe acute motor disorders. These mice showed gradual recovery but retained a continuing inability to perform compound movements. Optical and electrical recordings combined with immunocytological analysis indicated that elimination of Golgi cells not only reduces GABA-mediated inhibition but also attenuates functional NMDA receptors in granule cells. These results demonstrate that synaptic integration involving both GABA inhibition and NMDA receptor activation is essential for compound motor coordination. Furthermore, this integration can adapt after Golgi cell elimination so as not to evoke overexcitation by the reduction of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1994775909,"A Rietveld structural analysis of stishovite, with angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, confirmed a CaCl2 form of stishovite distortion at 54 +/- 1 gigapascals but confirmed no further phase transformation up to 120 gigapascals. The deviatoric stress that is usually encountered at such pressures was relaxed after yttrium-aluminum-garnet-laser heating. A single Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fits volumes of stishovite and a CaCl2 form, showing that the tetragonal distortion occurs without a substantial change in volume. At the 54-gigapascal transition, the pressure-induced lattice modifications were similar to those found in a Landau-type temperature-induced transition. It is proposed that, above the transition pressure, the critical temperature increases above 300 kelvin, so that the lower entropy form becomes stable."
https://openalex.org/W2005580242,"We report here on a novel metallothionein-I (MT)/ret transgenic mouse line in which skin melanosis, benign melanocytic tumor and malignant melanoma metastasizing to distant organs develop stepwise. The process of tumor development and its malignant transformation in this line may resemble that of the human giant congenital melanocytic nevus that is present at birth and that frequently gives rise to malignant melanoma during aging. We observed an increase in the expression level and activity of the ret transgene during the disease progression. That increase in transgene expression accompanied an activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Jun as well as matrix metalloproteinases. These results suggest that progressive dysregulation of the expression level of the ret transgene might play a crucial role in the malignant transformation of melanocytic tumors developed in the MT/ret transgenic mouse line."

https://openalex.org/W1986656102,"We present evidence that excision of the nonreplicative transposon Tn10 involves three distinct chemical steps, first-strand nicking, hairpin formation, and hairpin resolution. This three-step mechanism makes it possible for a single protein-active site to cleave two DNA strands of opposite polarity, as appears to be the case in this reaction. We infer the existence of alternating bifunctionality within the active site with suitable modulation of substrate components between steps. DNA double-strand breaks are also made by a ""hairpin mechanism"" in V(D)J recombination, possibly reflecting the same basic constraints faced in the Tn10 system. Similarities in the basic chemical steps in Tn10 transposition and V(D)J recombination suggest that the V(D)J mechanism may have evolved from a bacterial transposition system."

https://openalex.org/W2093213790,"Most inflammatory agents activate nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) which results in expression of genes for cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes involved in amplification and perpetuation of inflammation. Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is an active component from the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum that has been reported to exhibit antiinflammatory properties but the mechanism is not known. In the present study we investigated the effects of emodin on the activation of NF-κB in human umbelical vein endothelial cells (EC). Treatment of EC with TNF activated NF-κB; preincubation with emodin inhibited this activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Emodin did not chemically modify NF-κB subunits but rather inhibited degradation of IκB, an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB. Since the promoter regions of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ELAM-1 contain NF-κB binding sites and these adhesion molecules are involved in the attachment of leukocytes to EC, the effect of emodin on the adhesion of monocytes to EC and the expression of these adhesion molecules was also studied. Treatment of EC with TNF for 6 h increased the adhesion of monocytes to EC, which correlated with increases in cell surface expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ELAM-1. Pretreatment of EC for 1 h with emodin inhibited both monocyte-EC attachment and expression of ICAM-1, ELAM-1 and VCAM-1. These results indicate that emodin is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation and expression of adhesion molecules and thus could be useful in treating various inflammatory diseases."

This involves either a direct interaction between the viral movement protein and the nucleic acid or an indirect interaction involving host factors. The bipartite geminiviruses possess two movement proteins, BV1 and BC1, that coordinate movement of viral DNA across nuclear and plasmodesmal boundaries, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both BV1 and BC1 interact directly with DNA and, in addition, that they have the unique property to recognize DNA on the basis of form and size rather than sequence. This is a novel feature for plant virus movement proteins and raises the possibility that BV1 and BC1 may be determinants of genome size in the bipartite geminiviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2018745636,"Fission yeast Mei2p is an RNA-binding protein required for both premeiotic DNA synthesis and meiosis I. Mei2p binds to a polyadenylated RNA molecule, meiRNA, loss of which blocks meiosis I. Mei2p forms a dot in meiotic prophase nuclei. Here, we show that meiRNA is required for the nuclear localization of Mei2p and is detectable in the dot. However, Mei2p carrying a nuclear localization signal can produce a nuclear dot and promote meiosis I in the absence of meiRNA. Mei2p expressed in cultured mammalian cells stays in the cytoplasm, but it accumulates in the nucleolus if meiRNA is coexpressed. These results indicate that meiRNA contributes to the promotion of meiosis I exclusively as a cofactor that assists nuclear transport of Mei2p."
https://openalex.org/W1998650805,"Rho proteins are a branch of GTPases that belongs to the Ras superfamily which are critical elements of signal transduction pathways leading to a variety of cellular responses. This family of small GTPases has been involved in diverse biological functions such as cytoskeleton organization, cell growth and transformation, cell motility, migration, metastasis, and responses to stress. We report that several human Rho proteins including Rho A, Rho C and Rac 1, are capable of inducing apoptosis in different cell systems like murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the human erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Since K562 cells are devoid of p53, apoptosis induced by Rho in this system is independent of p53. Rho-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the generation of ceramides, and it is drastically inhibited by ectopic expression of Bcl2, both under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Furthermore, the human oncogenes vav and ost that have been shown to function as guanine exchange factors for Rho proteins, were also able to induce apoptosis under similar conditions. Finally, we also report that the levels of endogenous Rho proteins are increased when U937 myeloid leukemia cells are exposed to apoptosis-inducing conditions such as TNFα treatment. Furthermore, TNFα-induced apoptosis in these cells is inhibited by expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac 1 but it is not affected by a similar mutant of Rho A. These results suggest that Rho proteins play an important role in the physiological regulation of the apoptotic response to stress-inducing agents."

A broad zone of low S velocity (−4 percent with respect to standard models), which may correspond to the base of a thermal “plume,” narrows and is deflected as it extends to about 1000 kilometers above the core-mantle boundary. To the east of this zone, a localized region of fast S velocity (+5 percent) suggests strong heterogeneity or anisotropy related to the presence of high pressure and temperature assemblages, which may or may not involve core material. Its presence could also explain the observation of precursors to core reflected phases in this region."

https://openalex.org/W1979697890,"In 1994, Conrad et al. reported initial results that rekindled the debate about the involvement of an infectious agent in type 1 diabetes. They analyzed the T cell (antigen) receptor repertoire of T lymphocytes that had invaded the pancreatic islets of two recently deceased, acutely diabetic patients. Antigen receptors carrying the Vβ7 variable region were shown to be strikingly enriched in the T cells, evoking the involvement of a superantigen (SAG). Recently5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar (see also 1Benoist C Mathis D Nature. 1997; 388: 833-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) described the isolation of a hitherto unknown endogenous HERV-K10-like retroviral genome, IDDMK1,222, related to mouse mammary tumor virus, whose env gene encoded a SAG. The SAG stimulated Vβ7-bearing T cells, but not those that expressed other Vβ genes. Transcripts derived from, or at least related to, the IDDMK1,222 genome were detectable by RT-PCR in the plasma of 10/10 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, but not from 10 age-matched, nondiabetic control individuals. In order to detect IDDMK1,222 RNA5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar performed RT-PCR on total RNA purified from EDTA plasma using QIAmp Qiagen Kit. All RT and PCR reagents (1 unit AMV reverse transcriptase, 10 units Rnasin, 0.5 mM DTT, 2.6 units Taq/Pwo, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 300 nM primer, 1× buffer, and 1.6 mM MgCl2) were added to the same reaction tube. The RT reaction was performed at 50°C for 30 min for the generation of cDNA, directly followed by a step-down PCR, in which the annealing temperature (68°C) was reduced by 1.3°C for each of 10 cycles, to 55°C for the remaining 25 cycles. Two sets of oligonucleotide primer were used: U3 (5′ AGGTATTGTCCAAGGTTTCTCC 3′) and R (5′ CTTTACAAAGCAGTATTGCTG 3′ or 5′ GTAAAGGATCAAGTGCTGTGC 3′) or U3-R-poly(A) (5′ TTTTTGAGTCCCCTTAGTATTTATT 3′). They stated that the U3 and R primer detected genomic IDDMK1,222, whereas U3 and R-poly(A) primer detected only viral transcripts. In an attempt to reproduce these latter data, we report here the results of experiments carried out independently in laboratories in Melbourne, Pittsburgh, and London. It must be emphasized that the three laboratories only attempted to reproduce and extend the results of 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar on peripheral blood and not those on the isolation of retroviral particles from islets and islet-infiltrating lymphocytes from patients with type 1 diabetes. In Melbourne, we used the exact protocol of 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, or modified protocols, to confirm that IDDMK1,222 transcripts are present in the plasma of individuals with preclinical or clinical type 1 diabetes. We purified total RNA from EDTA plasma of two individuals with preclinical type 1 diabetes (a male aged 7 and a female aged 18, each of whom had a sibling with type 1 diabetes and circulating antibodies to the islet antigens, insulin and glutamic acid decarboxylase [GAD]), three recently-diagnosed patients (females age 5, 9, and 10, diagnosed for less than three weeks), and four healthy adult controls. All subjects were of Caucasoid extraction. RT-PCRs, with the 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar protocol and reagents, generated a band of the expected size (489 bp) for IDDMK1,222 with U3-R-poly(A) primer from all samples, but in both the presence and absence of RT. The U3-R-poly(A) primer also generated a 489 bp band from genomic DNA samples. The RT-PCR product hybridized with the U3-R probe, as reported by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar. However, DNase treatment of the RNA samples prevented generation of the PCR product and its detection by Southern blot. We could not achieve specificity for RNA, by extending 5′ the U3-R-poly(A) primer from four to 11Ts and/or by subtracting eight of the 3′ nucleotides, whereas the Pittsburgh and London laboratories (see below) detected viral RNAs with modified primer, although these were also not disease specific. It should be noted, however, that the various modified primer were not identical. 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar added RT and PCR reagents to the same reaction tube. When we added the PCR reagents after the RT reactions, the yield of the U3-R-poly(A) product significantly increased, but again it was not specific for RNA. The increased yield was most likely due to separation of Pwo, a DNA polymerase with 3′–5′ exonuclease proofreading activity, from the RT reaction. Pwo could degrade primer and dNTPs during the RT section, resulting in a lower yield of PCR product. Finally, we made primer to the SAG sequence of IDDMK1,222 and found also that these amplified only genomic DNA and not DNase-treated RNA samples. Thus, we have not been able to confirm the statement of 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar that “the signal generated with the U3-R-poly(A) primer pair could be diminished below background by RNase treatment and was not detected when genomic DNA was used as a template (data not shown).” In our hands, the U3-R-poly(A) primer pair does not detect transcribed IDDMK1,222 endogenous retrovirus in EDTA plasma. All PCR product from plasma RNA appears to derive from contaminating DNA and is not type 1 diabetes (preclinical or clinical)-specific. Our results do not, however, necessarily refute the proposition that endogenous retroelements, identical or similar to IDDMK1,222, might encode a SAG responsible for skewing of the T cell receptor Vβ repertoire in the islet infiltrate of the type 1 diabetes patients as reported by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar. In Pittsburgh, in order to extend the results of 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, we designed primer that amplify the sequence encoding the reported superantigen of IDDMK1,222. The sequences of the primer, CCTCCACGGAGATGGTAA and TCGAGGTGCCTAATCTATAATAGT, matched the sequence in the region of the ATG and TAG, start and stop codons, and were first tested on genomic DNA. Cloning and sequencing of the amplified products yielded eight unique sequences from nine clones, one of which was identical to the reported SAG. We then tested, by RT-PCR, RNA extracted from sera and EDTA plasma and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of five Caucasoid high-risk individuals (siblings of diabetic probands, carrying type 1 diabetes susceptibility HLA class II alleles, positive for autoantibodies to the islet antigens GAD65 and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2, and with impaired glucose tolerance), ten recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients (within one week of clinical diagnosis) and 12 age-matched nondiabetic controls. Thus, our tested samples came from patients at the same stage of their disease as those tested by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar. Poly(A)-RNA was separated from total RNA that had first been treated with DNase. It was then reverse transcribed using the R-poly(A) primer described by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar. After PCR amplification using the above primer, bands of 489 bp were frequently, though not always, found in patient samples (100% of high-risk individuals and 50% of recent-onset patients). Most importantly, however, they were also found in seven out of twelve (58%) of control samples. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products revealed two dominant sequences, present in some samples from both patients and controls, which were very similar to HERV-K10 and to IDDMK1,222. These sequences mismatched HERV-K10 by 8 and 4 nucleotides and IDDMK1,222 by 8 and 13 nucleotides. None of the clones contained a sequence that exactly matched the IDDMK1,222 sequence. When the PCR was performed with either of two alternative primer, which are downstream of the stop codon, TCCCAAGGGTAGAAAGACTG and the U3-R-poly(A) primer, the same two sequences were again most frequent. In addition, they were found to not encode the stop codon characteristic of IDDMK1,222, but rather the same codon, TGG, which is present in HERV-K10. Again, none of the other less frequently obtained clones matched exactly the IDDMK1,222 sequence. Thus, based on the amplification of purified genomic DNA, we confirmed the presence of an endogenous sequence matching that which would encode the reported superantigen. However, if the corresponding RNA is expressed, it is frequently not the most abundantly expressed HERV-K10-like species and, therefore, may not easily be detected in the presence of the other more abundant sequences. Furthermore, these very similar sequences are not specifically expressed in type 1 diabetes, as they are frequently detected in control samples. We do not interpret these findings to necessarily negate a potential etiological role of retroviruses or superantigens in type 1 diabetes, rather to question the epidemiologic value of nonspecific retroviral sequence detection in patients’ plasma. In London, we initially performed survey studies, by means of genomic PCR and RT-PCR based on the published primer sequences from the IDDMK1,222 novel retroviral genome. Genomic DNA was subjected to PCR with the U3 and R primer. Primer U3 R1 and U3 R2 amplified products of the size described by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar (300 and 395 bp) on DNA samples extracted from PBL of 10 age-matched normal individuals and five newly diagnosed (within one week of clinical onset) type 1 diabetes patients. The patients, two Caucasoids and three Africans, were sero-positive for islet cell antibodies (ICA), by indirect immunofluorescence on sections of human blood group 0 pancreas, and for antibodies to GAD and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2, and all carried type 1 diabetes susceptibility HLA class II alleles. Subsequently, the U3-R-poly(A) primer amplified the expected product of 489 bp by RT-PCR on RNA extracted from PBL of four out of five newly diagnosed patients. However, ribonuclease A treatment did not prevent amplification, suggesting the presence of DNA contamination in the samples. Ribonuclease treatment eliminated the RT-PCR product from positive control RNA (supplied in Access RT-PCR Kit, cat. no 1260, Promega, USA). The U3-R-poly(A) primer also amplified a product of 489 bp, using the same PCR conditions, but without the RT step, on DNA extracted from the same PBL of newly diagnosed patients. When an RNA sample positive in RT-PCR with the U3-R-poly(A) primer was pretreated with RNase-free DNase, the 489 bp product was eliminated. With the same conditions, it was still possible to obtain amplification from the positive control RNA, showing that the elimination of the signal was not due to RNase contaminating the DNase. Hence, in our hands, the U3-R-poly(A) primer amplified DNA and we suggest that the amplification we observed in our RT-PCR samples was due to trace contamination of DNA. The same RT-PCR conditions were used with the U3 primer and a novel viral RNA-specific oligo-dT primer of the sequence 5′–3′ TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGTC. A product of approximately 489 bp size was obtained with RNA from two out of three PBL samples from newly diagnosed patients and was eliminated by ribonuclease treatment. In order to confirm specificity for RNA, PCR was performed without the RT step and was negative on DNA from the same PBL. The same RT-PCR conditions were also applied using the U3 primer together with a long oligo dT primer [5′ pd(T)25–30 3′]. A product of approximately 489 bp was again obtained with the same PBL RNA from two out of three newly diagnosed patients. PCR performed on DNA in the same conditions, but without the RT step, detected a product of the same size in one out of five samples of newly diagnosed patients. This sample was also positive in RT-PCR and possibly contains an integrated (endogenous) retrovirus with poly(A) tail. When RNA from PBL of normal individuals were analyzed, with either the U3-oligo dT virus–specific primer or the oligo dT 25–30 primer, products of approximately 489 bp were obtained in two of three and three of three cases, respectively; i.e., the product, in this case, was not disease specific. In summary, our experiments indicate that the U3-R-poly(A) primer described by 5Conrad B Weissmahr R.N Boeni J Arcari R Schuepbach J Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar are not RNA specific, but also amplify DNA, and we could detect viral RNA sequences in both newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients and normal controls using our modified RNA-specific primer. RNA transcripts for multiple endogenous retroviral elements are expressed in normal and disease tissues (7Nakagawa K Brusic V McColl G Harrison L.C Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The genomic complexity and multiple potential pathogenic mechanisms of endogenous retroviruses (6Nakagawa K Harrison L.C Immunol. Rev. 1996; 152: 193-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that experimental strategies will need to be refined, in order to unravel their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (2Bottazzo G.F Diabetes. 1993; 42: 778-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2027884200,"We previously demonstrated that P16Ink4a (p16) expression in p16-deficient U343 astrocytoma cells causes a G1 cell cycle arrest, profound changes in cytoskeletal proteins and alterations in expression and activity of the pRB and E2F family proteins. We examine here the effects of expressing wild type or mutant versions of the downstream targets of p16 in U343 astrocytomas. We first attempted to block proliferation of U343 cells using the dominant mutant of pRB, Δp34. Expression of this mutant in the human osteosarcoma, SAOS-2, potently blocked proliferation but did not affect the cell cycle of U343 cells. We next showed that expression of E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3 and E2F-4 are each able to overcome this p16-dependent cell cycle arrest but exhibit distinct biological activities. Adenoviral-mediated expression of E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, or E2F-4 overcame the p16-dependent cell cycle block and induced alterations in cell morphology. E2F-5, only in conjunction with DP1, promoted cell cycle progression. For both E2F-1 and E2F-2, but not E2F-3 or E2F-5/DP1, cell cycle re-entry was associated with almost quantitative cell death. Only small numbers of dying cells were observed in E2F-4-expressing cultures. Expression of the different E2F's altered the expression of distinct sets of cell cycle regulatory proteins. E2F-1 induced endogenous E2F-4 expression and also caused an increase in pRB, p107 and cyclin E levels. Expression of E2F-4 caused a weak increase in E2F-1 levels but also strongly induced pRB, p107, p130 and cyclin E. However, E2F-1 and E2F-4 clearly regulate expression of distinct genes, demonstrated when E2F-4 caused a threefold increase in the levels of cdk2 whereas E2F-1 failed to increase in this cyclin dependent kinase. Similarly, expression of E2F-1 or E2F-2 were shown to have distinct effects on the expression of cdk2, cyclin E and pRB despite both of these closely related E2F-family members potently inducing cell death. Thus, E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3 and E2F-4 are able to overcome the p16-dependent proliferative block in U343 astrocytoma cells. While overcoming this cell cycle block, each of the E2F's uniquely affect the expression of a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins and have distinct abilities to promote cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1974274215,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is an inherited disorder characterized by a predisposition to multiple intracranial tumors. The protein encoded by the NF2 gene has striking similarities to ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) proteins which link membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. Therefore, it can be speculated that the disruption of cytoskeletal organization by alterations in the NF2 gene is involved in the development of tumors. It has been reported that the majority of NF2 mutations were nonsense or frameshift mutations that result in premature termination of translation. To facilitate the detection of these mutations, we performed protein truncation test and found that 11 of 14 NF2 patients had truncational mutations (79%). Seven of the 11 patients (64%) had a splicing abnormality which lead to absence of exons in the ERM homology domain. To examine the biological significance of the exon-missing mutations in the ERM homology domain, we expressed the wild-type (wt-NF2) and the various mutant NF2s (mu-NF2s) in a fibroblast cell line by using both liposome-mediated transfection and nuclear microinjection of the expression plasmids. The wt-NF2 showed intense punctate staining in the perinuclear cytoplasm in addition to overall staining of the submembranous area, whereas the mu-NF2s lacking exons in the ERM homology domain showed granular staining at the perinuclear region without any accumulation at the submembrane region. Microinjection of wt-NF2 cDNA into the nucleus of VA13 cells revealed that wt-NF2 protein induced a progressive elongation of cell processes. Furthermore, cells that expressed mu-NF2 had decreased adhesion, which resulted in detachment from the substratum. These findings suggested that the exon-missing mutations in the ERM-homology domain may affect cell membrane-cytoskeleton signaling and consequently disrupt cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2078111565,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a β cell–specific, T cell–mediated autoimmune disease. Last year, Bernard Conrad and coworkers proposed that the β cell destruction is caused by the systemic activation of autoreactive T cells due to the expression of a superantigen encoded by an endogenous retrovirus (HERV-K) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (2Conrad B. Weissmahr R.N. Böni J. Arcari R. Schüpbach J. Mach B Cell. 1997; 90: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The search for this putative superantigen had been initiated by the observation of a pancreatic enrichment of the Vβ7 family of T cell receptor chains in two patients. Here we present findings contradicting this intriguing hypothesis. HERV-K is an endogenous retrovirus family of old world monkeys and humans with homologies to type B and D retroviruses. Within the approximately 50 proviral copies of this HERV family only very few of the full-length genomes (designated type 2) have retained colinear coding capacity. As this HERV family codes for the human teratocarcinoma-derived retrovirus (HTDV), it was tentatively designated HTDV/HERV-K to discriminate it from other MMTV-related HERV families with primer-binding sites for tRNA lysine (HERV-K). A subclass of HTDV/HERV-K proviruses (type 1) is characterized by a deletion affecting the C terminus of the integrase domain and the amino terminus of the envelope (Env), the signal peptide region (reviewed by 6Löwer R. Löwer J. Kurth R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 5177-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The deletion also eliminates the first exon of the corf gene, an accessory gene that enhances the expression of structural proteins. This function is lacking in cell types in which only type 1 proviruses are expressed. In addition, many type 1 proviruses do not exhibit env splicing (5Löwer R. Tönjes R.R. Korbmacher C. Kurth R. Löwer J Virology. 1995; 69: 141-149Google Scholar). Most of the HTDV/HERV-K proviruses carry stop codons in their env genes preventing expression of functional Env proteins. Sequence comparison clearly shows that the truncated IDDMK1,222 env sequence identified by Conrad et al. stems from one of these proviruses. It is a type 1 element similar to the proviruses K10 and K18 described previously (7Ono M J. Virol. 1986; 58: 937-944PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence information available for IDDMK1,2 shows a 3% difference to K10 in env and in the long terminal repeats (LTRs), the most variable regions of a virus, and a near identity to the LTRs of K18. In summary Conrad et al. have identified one of the proviruses of a well-studied HERV family. In human teratocarcinoma cell lines, it is easy to detect virus particles by electron microscopy or viral transcripts by Northern blots (Figure 1) although the level of expression is significantly lower than that seen with exogenous retroviruses. To measure reverse transcriptase activity, concentration of particles by ultracentrifugation is required for even the most sensitive of assays. A simple explanation may be that many HTDV/HERV-K proviral RT genes do not code for enzymatically active proteins when studied in recombinant expression systems (11Tönjes R.R. Löwer R. Boller K. Denner J. Hasenmaier B. Kirsch H. König H. Korbmacher C. Limbach C. Lugert R. et al.J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 13: S261-S267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HTDV/HERV-K sequences only are detected in RNA isolated from HTDV particle preparations (10Simpson G.R. Patience C. Löwer R. Tönjes R.R. Moore H.D.M. Weiss R.A. Boyd M.T Virology. 1996; 222: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although no evidence for the physical presence of particles or of virus transcripts is presented, Conrad et al. also describe a low level of RT activity in the supernatant of cell lines derived from IDDM islets with a similar extremely sensitive test system (8Pyra H. Böni J. Schüpbach J Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, using a modified version (14Weissmahr R.N. Böni J. Schüpbach J J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3005-3012PubMed Google Scholar) of the RU5-PCR approach published previously (4Löwer R. Löwer J. Tondera-Koch C. Kurth R Virology. 1993; 192: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), they surprisingly amplified not only HTDV/HERV-K sequences in the IDDM particle fractions but also a variety of other HERV-K families such as an element identified in the complement (C4) locus. If the 100-fold increase in RT activity in the islet supernatant described by Conrad et al. had originated from the presence of viral particles, one would have expected a similar accumulation of the matching viral genome as in HTDV particles. The lack of such a specific enrichment may indicate that the collected material, although banding at the density of a retrovirus, merely contains polyribosomes or nucleoproteins associated with a variety of diverse endogenous retrovirus transcripts. In addition, there is no real proof that an IDDMK1,222 provirus exists at all. In the multistep, nested PCR approach to clone IDDMK1,222, only the primer in the R region of the 3′LTR used to amplify the 3′ part of the genome is specific for IDDMK1,222- or K18-like proviruses. The 5′ part may be derived from any other provirus as the primer will amplify many HTDV/HERV-K sequences. It is not clear from the publication whether a full-length cDNA had been the template for IDDMK1,222 or whether this sequence was generated using the overlapping 5′ and 3′ amplicons as templates. The latter procedure most probably would have resulted in a mosaic element. As no controls for the RT-PCR reactions are shown, the template for the entire procedure may also have been contaminating DNA. Thus, IDDMK1,222 may be identical to the K18 provirus or it may turn out to be a composite sequence due to the cloning procedure. At the moment, only portions of the sequence are published or deposited in the databases. Even if the IDDMK1,222 provirus would code for an RT protein, an enzymatic activity remains speculative until demonstrated. In summary, the data presented by no means exclude that the RT activity detected in the IDDM supernatants originated from HTDV/HERV-K proviruses other than IDDMK1,222 or from other HERV families. LINE elements expressed in T cell lines are another likely source for the RT activity. Taking precautions not to amplify contaminating DNA, we repeated the epidemiological study of plasma RNA levels in a panel of diabetes patients and healthy blood donors with the primer described by Conrad et al. (located exclusively in the 3′LTR) and with HERV-K-specific primer designed to amplify other regions of the genome, especially the env gene. In this study no difference was observed in the prevalence of HERV-K plasma RNA in IDDM patients (n = 14, of which 9 were of recent onset) versus healthy blood donors . The failure to assign specific HERV-K expression to diabetes patients is not unexpected as we have found that full-length and even spliced transcripts of this endogenous retrovirus family are present at low level in a variety of normal tissues including lymphocytes (see Figure 1). Taking into account that during the onset of diabetes autoreactive T cells are activated, an early rise in plasma RNA level could merely reflect increased numbers of decaying cells. However, because no differences in patients versus healthy controls were detected, an additional quantitative RT-PCR approach was not performed. The primer used by Conrad et al. for the epidemiological study are located in highly conserved parts of the U3 and R regions as judged from the many LTR sequences we have studied so far. Thus, they are not specific for the IDDMK1,222 sequence in contrast to the R primer used to clone the 3′ part of the genome. Although the action of a superantigen may not necessarily correlate with the induction of a humoral immune response to viral structural proteins, the presence of virus particles as indicated by Conrad et al. certainly would do so. More than 40 sera collected from patients with IDDM have been tested for HERV-K-specific antibodies using the following test systems: (a) immunofluorescence staining of a virus-producing teratocarcinoma cell line, (b) Western blot analyses using virus particle preparations or recombinant Env protein as antigen, and (c) ELISA reactivity against diagnostic synthetic Gag and Env peptides. All these test systems are routinely used to screen panels of sera from diverse groups of patients and healthy blood donors. Among these we usually see 3% reactivity in normal blood donors with tests (a) and (c) (1Boller K. Janssen O. Schuldes H. Tönjes R.R. Kurth R J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4581-4588PubMed Google Scholar). The same rate of reactivity is detected in IDDM patients, yet there is no concordance of results between the test systems. Using recombinant Env protein as antigen in Western blots (12Tönjes R.R. Limbach C. Löwer R. Kurth R J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2747-2756PubMed Google Scholar), we detect a higher percentage of positive reactions (20%–25%) in both IDDM patients and healthy controls. Similar results have been reported with different panels of patient sera (13Vogetseder W. Dumfahrt A. Mayersbach P. Schonitzer D. Dierich M.P K. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, these findings are in agreement with the observation that HERV-K plasma RNA levels are similar in IDDM and healthy blood donors and raise the question whether the antibody reactions are based on the expression of HERV-K proteins or are induced by a cross-reacting antigen of unknown origin. Remarkably, the anti-Env Western blot reactivity detected in IDDM patients and healthy controls is not associated with a corresponding reactivity to Gag proteins, again arguing against the presence of virus particles. In contrast, with all the test systems used an antibody response with high titers is consistently detected in approximately 80% of patients with testicular tumors. This is probably the consequence of upregulation of HTDV/HERV-K proteins, which are easily detected in testicular tumor cell lines and in thin sections of germ cell tumors stained with polyclonal and monoclonal antisera specific for recombinant Gag, Env, and cORF proteins and patient’s sera. Patients with testicular tumors always develop a strong anti-Gag immune response in addition to anti-Env antibodies (6Löwer R. Löwer J. Kurth R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 5177-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar; Sauter et al., 1966). Conrad et al. stated that the sequence of the truncated IDDMK1,222 env gene encoded a superantigen. Sequence comparison with a variety of additional HTDV/HERV-K env sequences revealed extensive homologies with only a few nucleic acid substitutions. The superantigen sequences encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) also differ between virus strains, in particular within the COOH-terminal residues that may contribute to their Vβ specificity. As the IDDMK1,222 expression clone was not available to test for superantigen function, we amplified and cloned an HTDV/HERV-K sequence using a 5′ primer corresponding to the IDDMK1,222 superantigen sequence and the 3′ primer R-poly(A) described by Conrad et al. As the 3′ R-poly(A) primer was not RNA specific, we used genomic DNA as the template. The Env sequence obtained differed from IDDMK1,222 by six amino acids. One exchange abrogated the premature Env termination signal leading to a longer putative superantigen protein; the other changes were G46→V, H48→R, T115→P, G123→E, and V140→A. Preliminary attempts to use the THP1 cell line for expression of the Env protein failed due to insufficient transfection efficiency (less than 1% transfectants with a reporter gene using different transfection methods). We therefore used a well-established murine system (3Günzburg W.H. Heinemann F. Wintersberger S. Miethke T. Wagner H. Erfle V. Salmons B Nature. 1993; 364: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that allows for higher transfection efficiencies (30%–40% using electroporation). There is as yet no evidence that superantigens are species specific and, indeed, Conrad et al. recently reported similar results using human and murine test systems (Symposium on “Retroviruses and Autoimmunity,” 1998, London). However, murine A20 cells transiently transfected with the IDDMK1,222-related expression clone did not stimulate corresponding BALB/c T cells in a Vβ-specific fashion while A20 cells transfected with an MMTV superantigen induced a Vβ14-selective expansion of T cells. Truncating the longer Env sequence to the size of IDDMK1,222 did not alter the negative result. Clearly, further studies including more HTDV/HERV-K sequences as well as the expression clone established by Conrad et al. are needed to either confirm or refute the hypothesis that a superantigen is encoded by this HERV family. If the superantigen exists, its involvement in the onset or progression of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus needs to be examined. With regard to other bacterial and especially viral superantigens, it seems very unlikely that the sequence published by Conrad et al. would be unique amongst all HTDV/HERV-K proviruses in encoding a superantigen."

https://openalex.org/W2123058454,"The cloning of a full-length cDNA for the gene (ATM) mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) has been described recently. This cDNA, as well as a fragment representing a functional region from ATM, are capable of rescuing various aspects of the radiosensitive phenotype in A-T cells. We have subcloned full-length ATM cDNA in the opposite orientation in an EBV-based vector under the control of an inducible promoter to determine whether this anti-sense construct might sensitize control lymphoblastoid cells to ionizing radiation. The effectiveness of expression of this construct in control cells was monitored by loss of ATM protein which was evident over a period 6–12 h after induction. Under these conditions radiosensitivity was enhanced approximately threefold in control cells, approaching the degree of radiosensitivity observed in A-T cells. Expression of the anti-sense construct also increased the number of radiation-induced chromosomal breaks and led to the appearance of radioresistant DNA synthesis in these cells. Abrogation of the G1/S checkpoint was evident from the loss of the p53 response and that of its downstream effector, p21/WAF1, post-irradiation. The extent of accumulation of transfected cells in G2/M phase at 24 h post-irradiation was similar to that observed in A-T cells and the induction of stress-activated protein kinase by ionizing radiation was prevented by antisense ATM cDNA expression. These data demonstrate that full-length ATM anti-sense cDNA, by reducing the amount of ATM protein, is effective in imposing a series of known defects characteristic of the A-T phenotype. This inducible system provides an experimental model to further investigate mechanisms underlying radiosensitivity and cell cycle control."

Chromosomal rearrangements of trkC have been recently reported in congenital fibrosarcoma and it has been proposed that abnormal activation of this gene might be involved in tumor development. To facilitate the search for new mutations and rearrangements in the human trkC locus we have partially characterized its genomic organization by restriction mapping and have obtained the complete intron-exon structure. Our results show that human trkC consists of 20 exons, including two that encode the inserts present in the extracellular and tyrosine kinase domains, and another two that encode the carboxyl-terminal tail of the truncated TRKC isoform. Analysis of the 5' flanking region revealed the absence of TATA box, a very high content in C/G compatible with a CpG island and the presence of putative binding sites for the AP1, AP2, GC, ATF, BRN2, AML1 and Nkx2.5 transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1989880468,"We first showed that the introduction of a bcr–abl transcription unit into the 32D murine myeloid cell line (P210bcrabl32D) converts this cell line from an IL3 dependent cell line to an IL3 growth independent cell line. We next cloned a fragment of the bcr–abl cDNA, which codes for the bcr oligomerization domain and neighboring regions. To test for a transformation inhibitory effect of this oligomerization inhibitory peptide transcription unit on the p210bcr–abl mediated IL3 independent growth of the P210bcrabl32D cell line, we transiently co-electroporated into the growth factor dependent 32D cells, mixtures of plasmids which contained varying ratios of the plasmid expression vectors for the bcr oligomerization inhibitory peptide along with a smaller amount of the plasmid expression vector for the full length p210bcr–abl. (The P210bcr–abl protein converts the 32D from a growth factor dependent into a growth factor independent cell line.) We then showed that the oligomerization domain containing fragment from the bcr and bcr–abl proteins, can be used to inhibit the IL3 independent growth of p210bcr–abl positive 32D cells. These studies may be of eventual interest for those investigators whose goal is to design molecular therapeutic approaches to CML based on the use of peptidomimetic chemical functionalities, which mimic the structure and the inhibitory binding properties of the oligomerization domain containing fragment so as to inhibit the transforming function of the P210bcr–abl oncoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2325047804,"We previously reported that ras and polyoma middle T (PyMT), a constitutive activator of the src proto-oncogene product, up-regulated Caco-2 cell proliferation along with protein kinase C (PKC) alpha expression and PKC activity. We aimed to investigate whether oncogene-induced up-regulation of Caco-2 cell proliferation involved stimulation of the autocrine IGF-II/IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) loop described in these cells and if so, to analyse the role of overexpressed and activated PKC. Compared with control vector transfected Caco-2 cells, ras- and PyMT-transfected cells exhibited increased expression of the 6.0 and 4.8 kb IGF-II transcripts. This was due to increased activity of the P3 and P4 promoters of the IGF-II gene which correlated with increased expression and DNA-binding activity of Sp1, a transcription factor interacting with several specific sites in P3 and P4 promoters. Oncogene-transfected cells displayed enhanced autocrine IGF-II production, which was fully responsible for the oncogene-induced increase in their proliferation since this increase was blunted by anti-human IGF-II and IGF1R (αIR3) antibodies. PKC mediated oncogene activation of the IGF-II gene presumably through action on Sp1 since (i) PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased Sp1 expression, P3 and P4 activity and IGF-II mRNA in control but not in oncogene-transfected cells; and (ii) PKC inhibition by the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 reduced Sp1, P3 and P4 activity and IGF-II mRNA in all three cell lines. This is the first evidence that ras- and PyMT/src oncogenes up-regulate Caco-2 cell proliferation through a PKC-mediated pathway which stimulates IGF-II gene transcription and thereby increases autocrine IGF-II production. The mechanisms underlying IGF-II gene activation by PKC most probably involve action on Sp1."
