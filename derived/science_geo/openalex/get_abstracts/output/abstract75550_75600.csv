https://openalex.org/W1671858740,"The effects of several nucleoside triphosphates as activators and inhibitors of the enzymic reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxynucleotides was studied. The enzyme was a partially purified preparation of the ribonucleotide reductase system from the Novikoff ascites rat tumor, with dithioerythritol used as a model reducing agent. The reduction of cytidine diphosphate and uridine diphosphate to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides required activation of the enzyme by adenosine triphosphate; reduction of guanosine diphosphate required activation by low concentrations of deoxythymidine triphosphate with ATP giving further stimulation; and reduction of ADP required activation by low concentrations of dGTP or dTTP. Reduction of CDP and UDP was inhibited by dTTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dATP; reduction of GDP was inhibited by dGTP and dATP; and reduction of ADP was inhibited by dATP. Only slight inhibition by dCTP was seen. The results are interpreted in terms of metabolic control of the biosynthesis of deoxynucleotides by these nucleoside triphosphates serving as regulatory effectors."

https://openalex.org/W50422710,"1. Bromthymol blue added to rat liver mitochondria at concentrations in the range 0.4 to 4.0 mµmoles per mg of protein is tightly bound as indicated by centrifugation and washing of the mitochondria. 2. The absorbance of the dye is increased on adding Ca++ or Mn++ to the mitochondria in the absence of a permeant anion. The extent of increase is 0.03 cm-1 for 167 µ m Ca++ at 618 mµ for 0.5 mµmole of bromthymol blue per mg of protein. 3. The spectrum of the indicator bound to the mitochondria has shifted only slightly to longer wave lengths than in the solution. The indicator shows very nearly the same absorbance changes on alkalinization of the mitochondrial suspension as it does upon addition of small amounts of calcium to the mitochondria. 4. The absorbance increase is independent of the pH of the suspension medium (6.5 to 7.4) and of its buffer capacity from 2.0 m m to 0.3 m sodium succinate. 5. At low protein concentrations (1 to 2 mg per ml), the kinetics of the absorbance increase is compared with the glass electrode recordings and indicates an equal and opposite pH change in the suspension medium of a similar time course. 6. At higher protein concentrations (5 to 10 mg per ml), a similar phenomenon is observed, but only after several prior additions of Ca++; endogenous material (termed Hi+) present, in terms of Ca++, at levels of approximately 40 mµmoles per mg of protein counteracts the initial absorbance increase. A small amount of added phosphate readily serves as Hi+, and endogenous phosphate at 8 mµmoles per mg of protein would afford an appropriate source of Hi+. However, the endogenous material may be phospholipid. 7. The absorbance increase on calcium additions with bromthymol blue as an indicator can be counteracted and even reversed with a 30-fold excess of bovine serum albumin, suggesting that the indicator can be removed from the mitochondrial membranes. 8. The Ca++-induced absorbance increase is nullified rapidly by additions of permeant anions such as phosphate or acetate. Ammonium ions at a 3 m m concentration do not prevent the acidification caused by acetate, and 0.1 m concentrations only slightly facilitate the alkalinization on addition of Ca++. 9. It is concluded that rapid accumulation of a cation such as Ca++ in the absence of a permeant anion can result in an intramitochondrial alkalinization and a pH gradient of about 1 pH unit across the mitochondrial membrane. This gradient develops only as a consequence of cation accumulation in the absence of a permeant anion. In the presence of permeant anions, particularly phosphate under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation, there is no evidence of a measurable pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. 10. The intramitochondrial location of the indicator and of the site of calcium accumulation is tentatively assigned to the intracristal space because of the insensitivity of the bromthymol blue response to changes of osmolarity from 0.1 to 0.8 m . 11. The reaction mechanism for cation accumulation based upon the reaction with the X ∼ I intermediate of energy transfer meets the needs of the available experimental data."

The factors influencing the band width of the protons of the polar head of phosphatidylcholines are surveyed. It is found that the band widths vary with solvent and that this variation can perhaps be correlated with the micellar properties of the phospholipid. The dipolar ionic structure for phosphatidylethanolamines in solution is discussed in terms of nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared evidence."
https://openalex.org/W1520189306,"Abstract The kinetics of the catalysis of Fe(II) oxidation by crystalline human ferroxidase (ceruloplasmin) has been studied under various conditions at 30°. Two Km values with respect to Fe(II), Km1 = 0.6 µm and Km2 = 50 µm, were obtained at pH 6.5, at which ferroxidase gave the maximum activity of 550 Fe(II) per ferroxidase per min in an acetate buffer. Competition between the two substrates, p-phenylenediamine and Fe(II), was observed. The stoichiometry of Fe(II), ferroxidase, and oxygen, determined from the experimental data, was 4:1:1."
https://openalex.org/W1509389866,"Abstract A method is described for the quantitative determination of S-adenosylethionine (AEt) in perchloric acid extracts of liver. The administration of ethionine to female rats is followed by the rapid accumulation of AEt in the liver. The concentration of AEt increases with increasing doses of ethionine up to about 0.25 to 0.35 mg per g of body weight. The AEt concentration remains at a maximum level for at least 24 hours after a single injection of ethionine. The concentration of free ethionine in the liver and blood is sufficiently high to account for this persistence of maximal AEt levels over this period of time. A close inverse relationship has been found between the concentration of adenosine triphosphate and AEt when measured as a function of time after injection of ethionine. However, a discrepancy exists between the concentrations of ATP and AEt when measured as a function of the dose of ethionine. A maximum liver concentration of AEt is obtained at a dosage level of ethionine which induces only a moderate decrease in ATP concentration. The ATP level continues to fall as the amount of ethionine administered is increased above this level. The basis for this discrepancy has been studied and found to be a progressive inhibition of synthesis of adenine nucleotides de novo with large doses of ethionine associated with the decreasing levels of ATP. The data concerning the various effects of ethionine upon the concentrations of hepatic AEt and ATP and in the induction of various biochemical lesions are consistent with the hypothesis that the primary effect of ethionine is to trap adenosine as AEt by reacting with ATP. With low doses of ethionine, the trapping effect is largely compensated for by a large increase in the rate of synthesis of adenosine monophosphate de novo. With increasingly larger doses of ethionine, the rate of trapping exceeds the rate of synthesis de novo with a resultant decrease in the concentration of adenine nucleotides including ATP. This, in turn, further compromises the new formation of AMP, leading to a progressive decrease in ATP concentration. A new steady state is established at a low level of ATP. During this steady state, AEt is not stable but is continuously broken down and resynthesized. The administration of methionine several hours after ethionine inhibits the further synthesis of AEt, thus allowing the partial resynthesis of ATP from adenosine liberated during transethylation from AEt. This accounts for the partial reversal of those biochemical lesions resulting from the decrease in ATP such as inhibition of protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis and accumulation of excess triglyceride in the liver (fatty liver). The biochemical and structural changes in the liver induced by ethionine offer an interesting example of biochemical lesions induced primarily by lethal synthesis, as enunciated by Peters."

https://openalex.org/W1570621372,"Abstract Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia oncopelti, Crithidia luciliae, Crithidia sp. from Arilus cristatus, Crithidia acanthocephali, Blastocrithidia culicis, Leishmania tarentolae, and Leptomonas leptoglossi were grown under axenic conditions in chemically defined media, and their fatty acids were determined. Palmitic, stearic, and a C19 cyclopropane acid were the major saturated fatty acids. Oleic, linoleic, and γ-linolenic were the major unsaturated fatty acids. α-Linolenic acid could not be detected in any of these organisms. Monounsaturated fatty acids were synthesized by direct oxidative desaturation of the corresponding saturated acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were synthesized by progressive desaturation and chain elongation of the monoenoic acids. The major lipids of C. fasciculata and C. oncopelti— triglycerides, sterol esters, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine—were identical. Phosphatidylethanolamine contained the bulk of the cyclopropane acid found in C. fasciculata. Ergosterol was the major sterol of Crithidia, Blastocrithidia, and Leishmania species. Methionine served as a source of methyl groups for the biosynthesis of both ergosterol and the cyclopropane acid."
https://openalex.org/W1496550987,"Human transferrin was isolated by two different methods from both fresh plasma and outdated blood bank plasma. The resulting preparations were shown to be homogeneous by the criteria of polyacrylamide electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, absorption spectra between the wave lengths of 400 mµ and 460 mµ, sedimentation velocity, and concurrence of the weight and number average molecular weights. The molecular weights of these preparations were all between 73,200 and 76,000 by sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation and diffusion, osmotic pressure, and maximum iron-binding capacity. This molecular weight is significantly lower than the usually accepted value of 90,000. The sedimentation coefficient was found to decrease below pH 5.0 from 4.92 S to 2.75 S at pH 2.1. The molecular weight was independent of pH in the pH range of 2 to 8."
https://openalex.org/W2107032282,SUMMARY The administration of DL-ethionine to female rats inhibits liver ribonucleic acid synthesis up to 90 to 95%. The inhibition of RNA synthesis follows in time the decrease in adenosine triphosphate concentration and precedes the inhibition of protein synthesis. The degree of inhibition of RNA synthesis is a function of the dose of ethionine. The curve for this inhibition parallels closely the curves for the decrease in ATP concentration and for the inhibition of protein synthesis with varying dosages of ethionine. The simultaneous administration of methionine reverses to a considerable extent the inhibition of RNA synthesis by ethionine.
https://openalex.org/W1548747649,"Abstract Rat livers were perfused 6 hours with defibrinated rabbit blood with dl-lysine-1-14C and 250 mg of glucose infused for the first 4 hours. Net changes in rat albumin and fibrinogen in perfusate plasma were measured serologically. Fibrinogen was also measured chemically by clotting with thrombin. Puromycin (15 mg at outset plus 15 mg infused) stopped virtually all 14C incorporation into plasma and hepatic proteins after 30 min; net rat serum albumin and fibrinogen increased until 2 hours, indicating release of preformed plasma proteins from the liver. Average synthesis rates (milligrams per g of liver per hour) in control perfusions, estimated from net increases above those in puromycin perfusions, were: 0.47 ± 0.05 for rat serum albumin; 0.58 ± 0.15 for fibrinogen, measured serologically; and 0.64 ± 0.20 for fibrinogen, measured chemically. Actinomycin D (117 µg at outset plus 117 µg infused) was added to perfusions of livers from normal rats and from rats that had been injected intraperitoneally with actinomycin D (150 µg/100 g) 3 hours before perfusion. Decreases in protein synthesis rates after treatment with actinomycin D were interpreted as secondary to decay of messenger ribonucleic acid following inhibition of its synthesis, allowing the following estimates of average messenger ribonucleic acid half-life: rat serum albumin, 2 to 4 hours; fibrinogen, 1½ to 2 hours; plasma proteins synthesized by the liver other than rat serum albumin and fibrinogen, 3 to 4 hours; and hepatic proteins, less than 6 hours. Net changes in urea, glucose, and α-amino acids in perfusate were similar in actinomycin D and control perfusions, but were elevated in puromycin perfusions. In comparison with control perfusions, both inhibitors caused similar increases in the rate of oxidation of l-lysine-1-14C to 14CO2."
https://openalex.org/W1564770717,"Abstract Two major heme protein components have been identified in cytochrome b5 preparations from calf liver by electrophoresis and have been separated chromatographically. These two forms of cytochrome b5 differ in that one contains a carboxyl-terminal glutamylserine peptide sequence which is absent from the second. Tryptic digestion of either heme protein species yields the same core heme peptide by the cleavage of two peptides, one from the carboxyl-terminal and one from the amino-terminal end. The amino acid sequence of the small peptides released by trypsin and the peptide sequence in cytochrome b5 was determined. The core heme peptide contains 81 amino acid residues and is indistinguishable in its spectral and catalytic properties from the original cytochrome b5 preparations. This heme peptide thus provides the simplest unit for a complete analysis of the catalytic properties and the structure of cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1596563158,"Abstract The effect of cupric ions on the activity, fluorescence, and absorbance, and on the sulfhydryl and flavin adenine dinucleotide contents, of lipoyl dehydrogenase has been examined. The changes take place in two phases during the reaction of the enzyme with copper ions. In the first phase, the lipoic activity of the enzyme decreases to about 10% of its initial value, while its diaphorase activity increases about 15 times. Diaphorase activity is defined in terms of the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol at the expense of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. Two sulfhydryl groups are oxidized to a disulfide at this stage, and a slight change in the absorption spectrum occurs, but no change in fluorescence or FAD content takes place. Oxidation of sulfhydryl groups to disulfides continues at a slow rate after the added copper ions have been removed. Changes taking place during this phase of the reaction can be reversed by treatment with cysteine. Longer exposure of the enzyme to cupric ions leads to a decrease in the diaphorase activity, a decrease in flavin content and fluorescence, and an increase in the fluorescence of aromatic amino acid residues. Further oxidation of sulfhydryl groups occurs which cannot be accounted for entirely by an increase in disulfide content. Changes taking place during this phase of the reaction occur less rapidly at low pH and cannot be reversed by cysteine. It is concluded that the oxidation of two sulfhydryl groups to a disulfide is responsible for the changes in catalytic properties of the enzyme and that further oxidation results in denaturation, associated with changes in fluorescence and FAD content."
https://openalex.org/W1590446381,"The α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate has been studied at pH 7 and 25° in isopropyl alcoholwater and dioxane-water mixtures. It was found that the initial reaction in which the enzyme is acylated follows second order kinetics rather than Michaelis-Menten kinetics as previously reported. The second order rate constant for this reaction is markedly decreased by addition of either isopropyl alcohol or dioxane in a manner which can be formally attributed to either competitive or noncompetitive inhibition. The rate of the steady state reaction increases with substrate concentration in a manner which can be formally described in terms of substrate activation. After correction for this effect, the rate at substrate saturation is increased by organic solvents (by a factor of 3.5 in 20% (v/v) dioxane); the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant is also greatly increased (by a factor of 150 in 20% (v/v) dioxane). The primary amine tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, which was used as buffer, is shown to have a strong inhibitory effect on the pre-steady state reaction, and to be very much more effective than water as an acyl acceptor. Although several of these effects can be expressed in reasonably quantitative terms, it is not possible to offer convincing explanations for them. Organic solvents such as dioxane may produce more or less extensive changes in the enzyme, perhaps conformational in character, which drastically alter its kinetic properties; they may also exert an influence by disrupting the water structure in the vicinity of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1496727412,"Abstract Isolated frog sartorius muscles were incubated with insulin at 19°, and changes in permeability to sugar were studied, with the use of 3-methylglucose as a model substrate. After incubation of muscles with different concentrations of insulin in the range of 20 to 500 or 1000 microunits per ml for 3½ hours, permeability attained a value that was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the concentration. No decrease of permeability occurred when muscles that had been exposed to insulin were later washed with Ringer's solution at 0°, but when washing was performed at 19°, the hormonal effect was reversed. In order to investigate the relationship of these findings to the binding of insulin, frog sartorius muscles were incubated with insulin-131I. More insulin-131I was found in incubated tissues than could be accounted for by their content of extracellular fluid, and this excess material has been referred to as insulin-131I. When muscles that had accumulated insulin-131I were washed with Ringer's solution at 0°, only the insulin-131I of the extracellular fluid was removed, and the accumulated material was retained without appreciable loss. Thus, when washing was conducted at 0°, a firm binding of insulin-131I to muscle was demonstrable. On the other hand, when washing was carried out at 19°, insulin-131I in the muscle was degraded to a form that was soluble in trichloracetic acid, and the amount that was retained fell progressively. Thus, degradation of insulin during washing at 19° may facilitate removal of the hormone from the cells and thereby permit reversal of the effect on permeability. At 19°, accumulation of insulin-131I was detectable soon after addition of the muscle to the incubation medium, but there was an absolute lag period of approximately 20 min before insulin began to enhance permeability to sugar. At 0°, accumulation of insulin-131I occurred almost as readily as at 19°, but permeability was not altered by insulin at this temperature during several hours of observation. Thus, the effect of insulin on permeability appears to involve a temperature-dependent reaction that occurs after initial binding of the hormone to the tissue. When studies of accumulation were carried out at different concentrations of insulin-131I, part of the accumulation process exhibited a high affinity for the hormone, and the tissue became saturated at a concentration of hormone, generally 1000 microunits per ml or less, which was sufficient to cause a maximal change in permeability to sugar. This type of accumulation has been referred to as specific in order to distinguish it from a concomitantly occurring nonspecific form which continued to increase in extent as the concentration of insulin-131I was raised to levels that greatly exceeded the physiological range."
https://openalex.org/W88801959,"Abstract The reverse reaction catalyzed by creatine kinase has been studied at pH 8.0 to determine the effects of modifying separately the base, sugar, and phosphate moieties of the magnesium-adenosine diphosphate complex. On the basis that the reaction mechanism is rapid equilibrium, random, irrespective of the nucleotide substrate, dissociation constants have been determined for the reaction of nucleotide analogues with both the free enzyme and the enzyme-phosphocreatine complex. The following magnesium-nucleotide complexes were found to function as substrates with maximum velocities in the order MgADP- g MgdADP- ≃ MgIDP- g MgCDP- ≃ MgUDP- g MgGDP-. The affinity of free enzyme for these complexes was shown to decrease in the order MgADP- ≃ MgdADP- g MgIDP- ≃ MgGDP- ≃ MgCDP- ≃ MgUDP-. The substrates studied can be grouped into three classes according to whether interaction with the free enzyme is greater, equal to, or less than the interaction with the enzyme-phosphocreatine complex. MgCDP-, MgUDP-, and MgGDP- were also studied as inhibitors of the reaction. The dissociation constants determined by this approach were essentially similar to those evaluated from their reactions as substrates. The role of the phosphate chain in the binding of MgADP- to the enzyme has been studied by investigating adenosine, AMP, and magnesium-inorganic pyrophosphate as inhibitors of the reaction. The results are in accord with the hypothesis that a conformational change occurs at the active site of the enzyme as a result of the combination of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1647789083,"Abstract A rapid and convenient method was developed for the measurement of the enzyme activity catalyzing the transphosphorylation reaction between a nucleoside diphosphate and a nucleoside triphosphate. With use of this method, a nucleoside diphosphokinase was purified 2800-fold from calf thymus and the purified enzyme was characterized with respect to substrate specificity, metal ion requirement, pH optimum, and kinetic constants. All nucleoside di- and triphosphates related to nucleic acids were found to be active as phosphate acceptors and donors, respectively. The purified preparation contained two forms of enzyme which differ significantly from each other in their chromatographic behavior on diethylaminoethyl cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1559800918,"Abstract Iodate is almost immediately reduced to iodide following its intravenous administration to rats or rabbits. Even when it is given in relatively large doses, reduction is complete within 2 to 3 min. Following oral administration also, radioiodate is so rapidly transformed to radioiodide that 2-hour thyroid 131I uptakes in rats that received radioiodate by stomach tube were not significantly different from those of rats that received radioiodide by the same route. These findings support the view that iodate can substitute for iodide in all instances in which supplementary iodine is required for human or animal nutrition. Whole blood, resuspended washed red cells, and various tissue extracts reduce iodate to iodide very rapidly in vitro. However, plasma is much less effective than whole blood in reducing iodate. Iodate is rapidly reduced by glutathione at pH 7.4, but not by a number of other biological reducing agents. The stoichiometry of the reaction between GSH and iodate indicates that the reaction proceeds as follows. 6 GSH + IO3- → 3 G—S—S—G + I- + 3 H2O Because red cells and most tissues contain a fairly high concentration of GSH, it might appear that GSH is the active agent in blood and tissues responsible for reducing iodate. However, the iodate-reducing capacity of red cells and of tissue extracts far exceeds their potential GSH content, and it is suggested that —SH groups in hemoglobin and in other proteins may also be oxidized by iodate. Results of incubations carried out at 0° suggest that iodate reduction in blood is not enzymatic, at least for iodate levels below 1 x 10-3 m."
https://openalex.org/W1566559355,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine, l-phenylalanine, and some of their derivatives was investigated in the ultraviolet region as a function of solvent, pH, and temperature. All aromatic transitions accessible to study were found to be optically active, but the rotatory strength was found to be low. The long wave length tyrosine bands at 280 mµ showed a 100-fold lower rotatory strength when compared to the n - π* transition of the peptide bond. The greatly increased rotatory strength of aromatic transitions in some proteins must thus be due to vicinal perturbations having their source in the conformation of protein. Investigation of solvent and temperature dependence of amino acid rotation showed that only a change in the charge on the molecule produced measurable increase in the rotatory strength. It is proposed that the enhanced aromatic Cotton effects in some proteins are produced by interaction of the aromatic residue with a neighboring charge or other polarizable group. Since long wave length Cotton effects (250 to 350 mµ) are accompanied by a system of strong Cotton effects at the low wave length transitions of the aromatic residues, the usual estimates of α-helix may be difficult or impossible in protein showing enhanced aromatic rotation."
https://openalex.org/W1492610068,"Abstract Threonine deaminase (l- threonine hydrolyase (deaminating), EC 4.2.1.16) has been purified approximately 700-fold from extracts of Clostridium tetanomorphum. Both threonine and serine can serve as substrates, but threonine is deaminated 5 to 10 times more rapidly than serine. Pyridoxal phosphate, a reducing agent, and alkaline pH are required for the deamination of either amino acid. A plot of the rate of reaction at increasing substrate concentration gives a sigmoidal curve. Addition of adenosine diphosphate stimulates the reaction markedly at low substrate concentrations and yields a curve approaching a rectangular hyperbola. Kinetic analysis using the empirical Hill equation indicates the existence of cooperative effects between substrate sites in the absence of ADP and little interaction, if any, in the presence of ADP. ADP may be replaced by guanosine and inosine diphosphates and less effectively by uridine and cytosine diphosphates; dATP and thymidine diphosphates have little stimulatory activity. Experiments with 14C-ADP show that the enzyme binds ADP. The enzyme is inhibited by pyridoxal phosphate binding agents, by sulfhydryl reagents, urea, detergents, and substrate analogues. ADP protects the enzyme against low concentrations of sulfhydryl inhibitors and hydrogen bond-breaking agents but not against other inhibitors. ADP (and the other nucleotides mentioned above), phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, divalent cations, and, to a lesser extent, monovalent cations, protect the enzyme against inactivation by heat and against loss of activity on dilution. Dialysis of enzyme preparation at an alkaline pH decreases the ability of the enzyme to bind 14C-ADP and reduces the catalytic response to ADP. Conversely, addition of agents that combine with pyridoxal phosphate inhibits catalysis but does not inhibit the binding of 14C-ADP. These differential effects suggest that the substrate and allosteric effector are bound to separate sites on the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1616164048,"Abstract Following infection of Escherichia coli with MS2, synthesis of parental type viral strands was preceded by the formation of complementary strands. Twenty-two minutes after infection, when the synthesis of progeny ribonucleic acid was well under way, the rate of synthesis of plus strands greatly exceeded that of minus strands. At this time there was a turnover of plus strands and little or no turnover of minus strands in MS2-specific double-stranded RNA. These results provide further support for the view that the replication of MS2 RNA proceeds in two steps. Minus strands are first synthesized with strands as template. The resulting replicative intermediate then acts as a template for the asymmetrical synthesis of progeny plus strands. In the latter process, newly formed plus strands displace their counterparts from the replicating complex."

All three components were biologically active and displayed similar amino acid compositions.
https://openalex.org/W2124637740,"The biosynthesis of desmosine and isodesmosine was studied with chick embryo aortas in tissue culture. Radioactivity was incorporated into desmosine and isodesmosine when uniformly labeled lysine-14C was added to the medium, but no activity could be incorporated into these amino acids from aspartic acid-14C, glutamic acid-14C, or threonine-14C. The labeled desmosine and isodesmosine obtained after the incorporation of radioactivity from lysine-14C were subjected to the action of strong sodium hydroxide solutions. This treatment liberates the pyridinium nitrogen along with its side chain in the form of lysine. The lysine thus liberated from the labeled desmosine or isodesmosine was found to contain one-fourth of the total activity of the parent compound. The distribution of radioactivity in the carboxyl carbons of these compounds was also studied. These results strongly support the hypothesis that 4 lysine molecules condense to form 1 desmosine or isodesmosine molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2398006964,"Abstract The modification of α- and e-amino groups in cytochrome b5 with acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene 1-sulfonic acid (trinitrobenzene sulfonate) was described. Acylation of these residues increases the rate of heme dissociation from the protein in the presence of urea, without altering the spectrum or enzymatic reduction of the cytochrome. Trinitrophenylation of all of the α- and e-amino groups results in a marked alteration of the protein structure. Even more extensive changes in the protein structure occurred when trinitrophenylation was carried out in the absence of the heme. The kinetics of trinitrophenylation showed that 3 of the lysyl residues in cytochrome b5 are particularly reactive. These residues are largely confined to the heme peptide core rather than to the lysyl residues near the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the protein. Because the completely acetylated apocytochrome b5 recombines with heme to yield a cytochrome b5 with unaltered spectral properties, the α- and the e-amino groups are not involved directly in either heme binding or the catalytic activity of cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1552143443,"Abstract A mast cell protease has been purified over 260-fold from rat thyroid homogenates. The purified enzyme hydrolyzes denatured thyroglobulin, denatured hemoglobin, and fibrinogen. It also rapidly hydrolyzes the ester substrates, benzoyltyrosine ethyl ester, benzoylphenylalanine ethyl ester, and acetyltyrosine ethyl ester. The pH optimum for thyroglobulin and benzoyltyrosine ethyl ester hydrolysis is 7.8. The enzyme is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, diphenylcarbamyl chloride and l-(1-tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone. The inhibition by diphenylcarbamyl chloride is prevented by indole. The molecular weight of the protease, based on sucrose density gradient centrifugation, is 23,000.

https://openalex.org/W1505831285,"The amino-terminal sequence of rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase has been investigated in an attempt to determine the number of polypeptide chains in this protein. Quantitative dinitrophenylation and phenylthiocarbamylation experiments carried out under a wide variety of conditions yielded only submolar quantities of amino-terminal residues. The conditions used included those which lead to the dissociation of lactate dehydrogenases and those which cause extensive unfolding of the polypeptide chains. The acetylation status of rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase was investigated by means of a microenzymatic method developed during this study. The presence of 6 to 8 moles of acetate per mole of rat liver lactate dehydrogenase was shown. Bovine heart H4 and bovine heart MH3 lactate dehydrogenases also contained 7 to 8 moles of acetate per mole. Chicken heart H4 lactate dehydrogenase contained 3 to 4 moles of acetate per mole. All the acetyl groups in rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase are N-acetyl residues. Rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase also contains a quantity of a carbohydrate-like material which is not easily removed by dialysis, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, or repeated Bio-Gel chromatography. These data, combined with the lack of reactivity of rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase toward leucine aminopeptidase (62), lead to the conclusion that the amino-terminal residues of rat liver M4 lactate dehydrogenase are not readily available for reaction with amino-terminal labeling reagents and are probably acetylated. The large number of acetyl residues suggests the presence of more than one polypeptide chain per subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1529885474,"Abstract Dissociation of the threonine deaminase of Clostridium tetanomorphum occurs upon exposure to heat, to alkaline pH, or to denaturing agents, or when preparations are diluted or allowed to age at -20°. Dissociation in the presence of urea, detergents, or an alkaline pH may be prevented by addition of adenosine diphosphate, threonine, phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, or monovalent or divalent cations. Association of isolated lower molecular weight materials, obtained in partially purified form by gel filtration, is promoted by ADP and threonine. The ability to be aggregated by ADP may be lost by prolonged exposure to dissociating agents. ADP is more efficient than threonine in preventing dissociation or promoting association. At least eight molecular species, detected by a sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration, have been derived from purified preparations of the enzyme. Seven of these are enzymatically active; the smallest forms, produced by alkylation following treatment with urea and β-mercaptoethanol, are enzymatically inactive. The kinetic properties and heat stability of the fully polymerized enzyme and three of the dissociated forms have been compared."

Eight variants were also observed when the protein thiol of the α1-acid glycoprotein was subjected to zone electrophoresis in a denaturing and reducing buffer. The data indicate that the electrophoretic differences between the variants is not a result of differences in the primary or tertiary structures."
https://openalex.org/W1600301278,"The yellow colored sulfhydryl reagent, N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide, was used in the isolation of the peptide containing the reactive sulfhydryl group of chymopapain. Titration of cyanide-activated chymopapain B with p-chloromercuribenzoate at pH 4.6 indicated that there is a maximum of 1.4 moles of sulfhydryl per mole of the enzyme. Alkylation of half of the p-chloromercuribenzoate-titratable sulfhydryl groups led to the total inactivation of chymopapain. Pepsin digestion of the N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide-treated enzyme and the subsequent isolation of the labeled peptide showed that the label was predominantly in one peptide with the sequence, Lys-Arg-Val-Pro-Asp-Ser-Gly-Glu-Cys-Tyr. This sequence differed from those of the peptides containing the reactive sulfhydryl groups of papain and ficin, although all three enzymes are sulfhydryl proteases."

https://openalex.org/W1581628664,"Abstract The relative reactivity toward iodination of each of the 4 tyrosine residues in chymotrypsin was determined. The results showed that the reactivities of the tyrosine residues in native uniodinated chymotrypsin are in the order 146 g 94 g 171 g 229 with relative reactivities of 1:0.4 and 0.2:0.02, respectively. The relative reactivities indicate that one of the C chain tyrosines, namely 229, is buried since it is at most only 10% as reactive as the next least reactive tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1596818992,"Abstract The incorporation in vitro of acetate-1-14C into digitonin-precipitable sterols in rat liver homogenates is markedly inhibited by small amounts of rat bile. The incorporation in vitro of mevalonate-2-14C into digitonin-precipitable sterols in the same enzyme system is much less sensitive to bile, suggesting that the major site of action of bile in suppressing sterol biosynthesis from acetate is at a pre-mevalonate step in the biosynthetic pathway. Fasting, which is known to suppress the rate of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis from acetate in the rat, results in a 2-fold increase in the inhibitory activity of bile. A major part of the inhibitory activity appears to be associated with the protein fraction of bile. This inhibitory protein fraction of bile has been partially purified and characterized. An approximate molecular weight of 19,000 has been determined for the inhibitory protein from the results of gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1598003050,"Abstract A rapid and reproducible chromatographic method for the partial resolution of the basic soluble proteins in rat liver cytoplasm has been devised. The method involves the successive fractionation of the soluble proteins by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and by ion exchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. With the use of this method, a weakly basic protein (proteins) has been isolated which binds preferentially a metabolite (metabolites) of the carcinogenic aromatic amide, N-2-fluorenylacetamide-9-14C. The physical properties of this protein (proteins) suggest that it is related to or identical with the h2 proteins isolated from rat liver cytoplasm by means of column electrophoresis by Sorof and his associates."
https://openalex.org/W1486705244,"Abstract The specific and total activities of ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase in extracts of Lactobacillus leichmannii are increased as the period of linear growth of the culture before harvesting is increased. Extracts from cells harvested toward the end of the linear phase have the highest total and specific activity, and the activity of extracts is lower the longer the time of harvesting is delayed beyond this point. Stationary phase cells give extracts without significant reductase activity. The increase in specific and total activities as the period of linear phase growth is extended before harvesting appears to indicate a rapid rate of synthesis of reductase since chloramphenicol and actinomycin D arrest this increase. The decrease in reductase activity of the extracts from cells harvested in the stationary phase does not appear to result from the presence of an increased amount of proteolytic enzymes in the extracts nor from incomplete liberation of enzyme from such cells. The specific and total activities of the reductase in extracts of L. leichmannii harvested at the end of the linear phase of growth are lower when higher concentrations of deoxyribosyl compounds or of cyanocobalamin are present in the growth medium. This is interpreted as indicating that deoxyribosyl compounds act as corepressors in the synthesis of the reductase and that cyanocobalamin indirectly represses such synthesis through its ability to increase the intracellular pool of acid-soluble deoxyribosyl compounds. Neither thymine nor deoxyribose causes repression of the synthesis of this enzyme."

It is found that the mixture is more effective, as an adapting field, than either component when used alone. This experiment, along with others, supports the following: although the most efficient stimulus for eliciting a visual sensation is ""compact"" in space, time, and wavelength, the most efficient adapting stimulus tends to be dispersed in each of these dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2060504182,"THE adults of Moniliformis dubius Meyer live as parasites in the small intestine of rats. Because they do not possess an alimentary canal, acanthocephalans, like cestodes, must obtain all their food through the surface of their bodies. It is known that M. dubius is able to absorb directly through its surface a number of simple sugars1, 2 and some amino-acids, the latter sometimes against a concentration gradient3,4."
https://openalex.org/W1485110819,"Crystalline i-urobilinogen has been isolated from the feces of two individuals at appropriate intervals after discontinuance of tetracycline. The crystals from the first case were completely separated from dihydromesobilirubin and were highly similar to synthetic mesobilirubinogen in respect to a number of physical properties. Both are optically inactive from 600 to 200 mµ. A dextrorotatory component of the i-urobilin, formed by simple dehydrogenation of the recrystallized i-urobilinogen, separated by crystallization, leaving an l component in the mother liquor. The i-urobilinogen crystallized from the feces of the second case, although having the same crystal habit as synthetic mesobilirubinogen, could not be separated entirely from dihydromesobilirubin. Nevertheless the crystalline i-urobilin prepared after oxidative elimination of dihydromesobilirubin separated into optically active components, although this separation was less complete, even on recrystallization, than with the urobilin from the first case. Possible reasons for this difference and for the greater difficulty in resolving synthetic i-urobilin are discussed. Crystalline d-urobilinogen (H44) was prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of d-urobilinogen from feces. This is readily distinguished, on the basis of several physical properties, from i-urobilin or synthetic mesobilirubinogen. The d-urobilin (H42) prepared from it was identical in respect to a number of physical properties with d-urobilin obtained from i-urobilin."
https://openalex.org/W1496388670,"Changes in temperature and in viscosity affect dye-poly Glu63Lys37 (No. 3) conjugates in different ways. Variation of temperature in solutions of different initial viscosities (up to 9 centipoise at 10°) shows a constant transition temperature (10°) for the polypeptide above which there is accelerated depolarization; at higher viscosities no such thermal transition occurs. In contrast, the transition to accelerated depolarization cannot be induced by changes of viscosity alone. Changes in viscosity at a series of constant temperatures show separate effects due to the dye moiety and to the polypeptide chain. The plot of (1/p + 1/3) against 1/e shows two distinct relaxation times for the 1-dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl-labeled polymer, and for the fluorescein-labeled polymer it shows a series of straight lines, each of which has a different slope and a slight deviation concave to the 1/e axis at high viscosities. The rotational relaxation time of the polypeptide conjugated with 1-dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl chloride is twice that measured with the fluorescein conjugate in aqueous solution, but not in glycerol solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2069958999,"INVESTIGATIONS carried out here with the selective herbicide ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile)1 have shown its mode of action to be complex. The compound inhibits the Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts, strongly uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, inhibits photo-synthetic phosphorylation and when exposed to ultraviolet light there is evidence that free radicals are produced with the loss of iodine from the moleculo2,3. In further investigations of the breakdown of ioxynil in soil and plant we have found that hydrolysis to 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid occurs with the amide as an intermediate product. The liberation of iodine in these systems has also been demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2008332834,"PREPARATION of antibodies is greatly facilitated by the use of insoluble immuno-adsorbents. We have found that cross-linkage of soluble antigens with formaldehyde readily yields adsorbents having a high antibody capacity and which are insoluble over a wide range of pH. Most experiments have been carried out with an antigen (BSA–CPE) prepared by coupling the diazotized p-amino-phenylether of choline to bovine serum albumin (10 mols/mole). An insoluble polymer of the BSA–CPE was prepared by slowly adding an equal volume of formaldehyde solution (40 per cent; pH 3.1) to a stirred 20 per cent solution of the antigen in 0.15 M sodium chloride. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 25° C before the insoluble floccules of antigen polymer were separated by centrifuging. The floccules were washed exhaustively to remove excess formaldehyde with a solution containing 2 M sodium chloride and 0.01 M ammonium chloride adjusted to pH 9.0 with ammonium hydroxide, and finally with 0.15 M sodium chloride."
https://openalex.org/W2041449139,"IT was previously shown1,2 that testosterone is a powerful inhibitor of histamine and SRS* responses, and in view of the varying age incidence of status asthmaticus in the two sexes it was thought testosterone levels might have aetiological significance. Dutch workers have thought along similar lines3. Accordingly blood levels were measured in male and female subjects (by courtesy of Dr. J. Coghlan and Prof. Hudson) immediately after a severe attack. In two males the levels were 0.87 and 1.03 µg/ 100 ml. (high and one above normal: range 0.37–1.00) while in four females the levels were 0.13, 0.16, 0.19, and 0.29 µg/100 ml. (above normal: range 0.04–0.12). In another asthmatic subject, in the interval between attacks, the level was 0.24 µg/100 ml. (male), which is significantly low. I am now investigating the possibility that the level may be low in asthmatics, but that as a reaction to the stress of an attack, possibly associated with anoxia and hypercapnia, the levels rise high temporarily. Corticoid and also oestrin levels will be measured, as sometimes oestrins enhance histamine responses."
https://openalex.org/W1499081241,"Abstract Administration of actinomycin D to rats, 24 hours after phenobarbital pretreatment, did not sustain or enhance the phenobarbital-induced increased activity of two hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes. This was true whether the phenobarbital was given as a single dose or as multiple doses and at either of two doses of actinomycin D. No evidence for a repressor of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes was obtained in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W1513299030,"Abstract A cell-free system was prepared from rat liver which catalyzed the incorporation of cysteine and the analogue of cysteine, S-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)-l-cysteine, into ribosomal protein. Fractionation of this system with (NH4)2SO4 resulted in the separation of the cysteinyl soluble ribonucleic acid synthetase (cysteinyl-sRNA synthetase) from the aminoacyl-sRNA synthetases, presumably those for valine and isoleucine, that catalyzed the transfer of the S-substituted cysteine analogue to sRNA. Furthermore, in incubation media that contained the synthetases for cysteine and analogue transfer, an excess of unlabeled cysteine did not inhibit aminoacylation of sRNA by the 3H- or 35S-labeled analogue. However, the addition of either valine or isoleucine produced a marked inhibition of the transfer of radioactive tetrahydrohydroxynaphthylcysteine to sRNA. These observations were consistent with the concept that valyl- and isoleucyl-sRNA synthetases and their respective transfer RNAs are operational for the cysteine analogue. In contrast, the reaction of 1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene with cysteinyl-sRNA resulted in formation of the analogue attached to the cysteine transfer RNA. The incorporation of (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)-l-cysteine into protein should occur in a position determined by the species of sRNA that is acting as the transfer agent."
