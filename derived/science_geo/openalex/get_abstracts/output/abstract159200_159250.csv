https://openalex.org/W2062116934,"Direct printing of functional electronic materials may provide a new route to low-cost fabrication of integrated circuits. However, to be useful it must allow continuous manufacturing of all circuit components by successive solution deposition and printing steps in the same environment. We demonstrate direct inkjet printing of complete transistor circuits, including via-hole interconnections based on solution-processed polymer conductors, insulators, and self-organizing semiconductors. We show that the use of substrate surface energy patterning to direct the flow of water-based conducting polymer inkjet droplets enables high-resolution definition of practical channel lengths of 5 micrometers. High mobilities of 0.02 square centimeters per volt second and on-off current switching ratios of 10(5) were achieved."

https://openalex.org/W2061798607,"We show a simple, robust, chemical route to the fabrication of ultrahigh-density arrays of nanopores with high aspect ratios using the equilibrium self-assembled morphology of asymmetric diblock copolymers. The dimensions and lateral density of the array are determined by segmental interactions and the copolymer molecular weight. Through direct current electrodeposition, we fabricated vertical arrays of nanowires with densities in excess of 1.9 x 10(11) wires per square centimeter. We found markedly enhanced coercivities with ferromagnetic cobalt nanowires that point toward a route to ultrahigh-density storage media. The copolymer approach described is practical, parallel, compatible with current lithographic processes, and amenable to multilayered device fabrication."

We used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to examine gene expression in Arabidopsis and found that 6% of the more than 8000 genes on the array exhibited circadian changes in steady-state messenger RNA levels. Clusters of circadian-regulated genes were found in pathways involved in plant responses to light and other key metabolic pathways. Computational analysis of cycling genes allowed the identification of a highly conserved promoter motif that we found to be required for circadian control of gene expression. Our study presents a comprehensive view of the temporal compartmentalization of physiological pathways by the circadian clock in a eukaryote."

https://openalex.org/W2081840182,"Large segmental duplications cover much of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Little is known about their origins. We show that they are primarily due to at least four different large-scale duplication events that occurred 100 to 200 million years ago, a formative period in the diversification of the angiosperms. A better understanding of the complex structural history of angiosperm genomes is necessary to make full use of Arabidopsis as a genetic model for other plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2018843440,"Class I major histocompatibility complex (class I MHC) molecules, known to be important for immune responses to antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent, long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Here, we show that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC or for a class I MHC receptor component, CD3zeta, refinement of connections between retina and central targets during development is incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) is enhanced, and long-term depression (LTD) is absent. Specific class I MHC messenger RNAs are expressed by distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal functions. These results demonstrate an important role for these molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous system (CNS)."
https://openalex.org/W2003877984,"The retinoid X receptor (RXR) is a nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor. Little is known about the ligands that activate RXR in vivo. Here, we identified a factor in brain tissue from adult mice that activates RXR in cell-based assays. Purification and analysis of the factor by mass spectrometry revealed that it is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid that is highly enriched in the adult mammalian brain. Previous work has shown that DHA is essential for brain maturation, and deficiency of DHA in both rodents and humans leads to impaired spatial learning and other abnormalities. These data suggest that DHA may influence neural function through activation of an RXR signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1976150853,"A comparison of observations with simulations of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model shows that both natural and anthropogenic factors have contributed significantly to 20th century temperature changes. The model successfully simulates global mean and large-scale land temperature variations, indicating that the climate response on these scales is strongly influenced by external factors. More than 80% of observed multidecadal-scale global mean temperature variations and more than 60% of 10- to 50-year land temperature variations are due to changes in external forcings. Anthropogenic global warming under a standard emissions scenario is predicted to continue at a rate similar to that observed in recent decades."

https://openalex.org/W1988006762,"Metallic molybdenum (Mo o ) wires with diameters ranging from 15 nanometers to 1.0 micrometers and lengths of up to 500 micrometers (0.5 millimeters) were prepared in a two-step procedure. Molybdenum oxide wires were electrodeposited selectively at step edges and then reduced in hydrogen gas at 500Â°C to yield Mo o . The hemicylindrical wires prepared by this technique were self-uniform, and the wires prepared in a particular electrodeposition (in batches of 10 5 to 10 7 ) were narrowly distributed in diameter. Wires were obtained size selectively because the mean wire diameter was directly proportional to the square root of the electrolysis time. The metal nanowires could be embedded in a polystyrene film and lifted off the graphite electrode surface. The conductivity and mechanical resiliency of individual embedded wires were similar to those of bulk molybdenum."
https://openalex.org/W1978147067,"We show that elastomeric surfaces can be tailored using ""mechanically assembled monolayers"" (MAMs), structures that are fabricated by combining self-assembly of surface grafting molecules with mechanical manipulation of the grafting points in the underlying elastic surface. The versatility of this surface modification method is demonstrated by fabricating MAMs with semifluorinated (SF) molecules. These SF-MAMs have superior nonwetting and barrier properties in that they are ""superhydrophobic"" and nonpermeable. We also establish that these material characteristics do not deteriorate even after prolonged exposure to water, which usually causes surface reconstruction in conventionally prepared SF self-assembled monolayers."
https://openalex.org/W3103710998,"Observations of distant galaxies are important both for understanding how galaxies form and for probing the physical conditions of the Universe at early times. It is, however, very difficult to identify galaxies at redshifts z > 5, because they are so faint and have few spectral characteristics. We previously reported the probable identification of a galaxy at z = 6.68, based on one line and an apparent break in the spectrum just shortwards of that, which we interpreted as Lyman alpha emission and the Lyman alpha break, where photons with shorter wavelengths are absorbed by the intervening neutral hydrogen gas. Here we present optical photometry that shows moderate detections of light in the B- and V-band images, which are inconsistent with the expected absence of flux shortwards of the Lyman alpha break for alpha galaxy at z > 5, and inconsistent with the previous flux measurement. Moreover, the spectral energy distribution for this object cannot readily be fitted by any known galaxy spectral template at any redshift, so the redshift is undetermined."
https://openalex.org/W1976110793,"This report presents full-genome evidence that bacterial cells use discrete transcription patterns to control cell cycle progression. Global transcription analysis of synchronized Caulobacter crescentus cells was used to identify 553 genes (19% of the genome) whose messenger RNA levels varied as a function of the cell cycle. We conclude that in bacteria, as in yeast, (i) genes involved in a given cell function are activated at the time of execution of that function, (ii) genes encoding proteins that function in complexes are coexpressed, and (iii) temporal cascades of gene expression control multiprotein structure biogenesis. A single regulatory factor, the CtrA member of the two-component signal transduction family, is directly or indirectly involved in the control of 26% of the cell cycle-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1990276200,"Aging is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. In a study of longevity in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found that five independent P-element insertional mutations in a single gene resulted in a near doubling of the average adult life-span without a decline in fertility or physical activity. Sequence analysis revealed that the product of this gene, named Indy (for I'm not dead yet), is most closely related to a mammalian sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter-a membrane protein that transports Krebs cycle intermediates. Indy was most abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly. Excision of the P element resulted in a reversion to normal life-span. These mutations may create a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown to extend life-span."

https://openalex.org/W1975463463,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical in both initiating adaptive immune responses and maintaining tolerance to self antigens. These apparently contradictory roles have been suggested to depend on different subsets of DCs that arise from either myeloid or lymphoid hematopoietic origins, respectively. Although DC expression of CD8Î± is attributed to a lymphoid origin, here we show that both CD8Î± + and CD8Î± â DCs can arise from clonogenic common myeloid progenitors in both thymus and spleen. Thus, expression of CD8Î± is not indicative of a lymphoid origin, and phenotypic and functional differences among DC subsets are likely to reflect maturation status rather than ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1611608360,"Humpbacks have picked up a catchy tune sung by immigrants from a distant ocean. The song patterns of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) depend on where they live, with populations inhabiting different ocean basins normally singing quite distinct songs. Here we record a unique and radical song change in the song of humpback whales in the Pacific Ocean off the Australian east coast. Their song was replaced rapidly and completely by the song of the Australian west coast population from the Indian Ocean, apparently as a result of the introduction of only a small number of 'foreign' singers. Such a revolutionary change is unprecedented in animal cultural vocal traditions and suggests that novelty may stimulate change in humpback whale songs."

The primary sequence of RANTES contains two clusters of basic residues, <sup>44</sup>RKNR<sup>47</sup> and<sup>55</sup>KKWVR<sup>59</sup>. The first is a BB<i>X</i>B motif common in heparin-binding proteins, and the second is located in the loop directly preceding the C-terminal helix. We have mutated these residues to alanine, both as point mutations as well as triple mutations of the 40s and 50s clusters. Using a binding assay to heparin beads with radiolabeled proteins, the<sup>44</sup>AANA<sup>47</sup> mutant demonstrated an 80% reduction in its capacity to bind heparin, whereas the<sup>55</sup>AAWVA<sup>59</sup> mutant retained full binding capacity. Mutation of the <sup>44</sup>RKNR<sup>47</sup> site reduced the selectivity of RANTES binding to different GAGs. The mutants were tested for their integrity by receptor binding assays on CCR1 and CCR5 as well as their ability to induce chemotaxis <i>in vitro</i>. In all assays the single point mutations and the triple 50s cluster mutation caused no significant difference in activity compared with the wild type sequence. However, the triple 40s mutant showed a 80-fold reduction in affinity for CCR1, despite normal binding to CCR5. It was only able to induce monocyte chemotaxis at micromolar concentrations. The triple 40s mutant was also able to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity, but consistent with its abrogated GAG binding capacity, it no longer induced enhanced infectivity at high concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2025367112,"Anandamide is an endogenous compound that acts as an agonist at cannabinoid receptors. It is inactivated via intracellular degradation after its uptake into cells by a carrier-mediated process that depends upon a concentration gradient. The fate of anandamide in those cells containing an amidase called fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is hydrolysis to arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The active site nucleophilic serine of FAAH is inactivated by a variety of inhibitors including methylarachidonylfluorophosphonate (MAFP) and palmitylsulfonyl fluoride. In the current report, the net uptake of anandamide in cultured neuroblastoma (N18) and glioma (C6) cells, which contain FAAH, was decreased by nearly 50% after 6 min of incubation in the presence of MAFP. Uptake in laryngeal carcinoma (Hep2) cells, which lack FAAH, is not inhibited by MAFP. Free anandamide was found in all MAFP-treated cells and in control Hep2 cells, whereas phospholipid was the main product in N18 and C6 control cells when analyzed by TLC. The intracellular concentration of anandamide in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells was up to 18-fold greater than the extracellular concentration of 100 nm, which strongly suggests that it is sequestered within the cell by binding to membranes or proteins. The accumulation of anandamide and/or its breakdown products was found to vary among the different cell types, and this correlated approximately with the amount of FAAH activity, suggesting that the breakdown of anandamide is in part a driving force for uptake. This was shown most clearly in Hep2 cells transfected with FAAH. The uptake in these cells was 2-fold greater than in vector-transfected or untransfected Hep2 cells. Therefore, it appears that FAAH inhibitors reduce anandamide uptake by cells by shifting the anandamide concentration gradient in a direction that favors equilibrium. Because inhibition of FAAH increases the levels of extracellular anandamide, it may be a useful target for the design of therapeutic agents.

After being transported into the cell, anandamide is subsequently broken down into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by an endoplasmic reticular integral membrane-bound enzyme called fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH),1anandamide amidase, or anandamide amidohydrolase (for review see Ref.17Di Marzo V.

Employing these inhibitors, we show that the net movement of anandamide into the cells is coupled to the activity of intracellular FAAH. We propose that the inhibition of anandamide breakdown results in its intracellular build-up and the attainment of equilibrium between free intracellular and extracellular anandamide, and this disfavors further net uptake. N18TG2 neuroblastoma, C6 glioma (kindly provided by Allyn Howlett and Joel Levine, respectively), and human laryngeal carcinoma cells (Hep2), provided by our in-house cell culture facility, were grown in 35 Ã 10-mm dishes in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). All cells were grown at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. For all experiments, the number of cells plated for Hep2 and C6 was â¼1.7 Ã 106, and the number of cells plated for N18 was â¼7 Ã 105. The exact cell numbers were determined for comparison of the uptake rates in N18 neuroblastoma, C6 glioma, and Hep2 carcinoma (see below and Fig.3). The effects of MAFP and PSF on anandamide uptake were measured using arachidonyl-[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]ethanolamide called [3H]anandamide (172 Ci/mmol, 62.2 nCi/Î¼l) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences as substrate. Growth medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 750 Î¼l of supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 40 nCi[3H]anandamide (100 nm anandamide). The cells were incubated for 1â6 min at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2. To account for nonspecific binding to cellular membrane, parallel incubations were carried out at 4 Â°C. The counts from the nonspecific binding were subtracted from the total amount of anandamide taken up after each incubation so only the carrier-mediated transport uptake was represented in the data. To study whether MAFP affected the cellular uptake of anandamide, incubations were carried out after a 10-min preincubation of the cells with 1 Î¼mMAFP (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or 100 nmpamitylsulfonyl fluoride (provided by Alex Makriyannis, University of Connecticut) in the medium at 37 Â°C. After the incubation, the medium was immediately removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were scraped from the plate after the addition of 0.4 ml of 2 mmEDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. This procedure was repeated two additional times to maximize yield. The labeled compounds were then extracted from both the medium and the cells by the addition of 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:1) (Fisher) mixed thoroughly and spun down in a clinical centrifuge for 5 min. Finally, 100 Î¼l of the organic layer from both the cell and medium extractions were placed in scintillation vials with 3.0 ml of ScintiVerse II scintillation fluid (Fisher). The samples were counted in an LKB Rack beta scintillation counter. Saturation kinetics were determined in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells plated at a minimal density of 1 Ã 106cells. They were incubated for either 3 s (to determine nonspecific binding) or 60 s at 37 Â°C. For N18 and C6 cells, these experiments were performed with[lsqb]3H]anandamide (0.09â3.0 nm) and unlabeled anandamide to yield total concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 Î¼m anandamide. For Hep2 cells,[lsqb]3H]anandamide (0.01â5.5 nm) was added to unlabeled anandamide over a concentration range of 0.25â100 Î¼m anandamide. The same procedure was used for these experiments as for the time course of anandamide uptake with the exception that the experiment was terminated by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was then immediately removed. Experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and repeated two or three separate times. Calculations were performed by subtracting the nonspecific binding at 3 s from the 60-s incubation, and the picomoles taken up were corrected for the number of cells. To determine theK m and V max, the data were analyzed employing a Lineweaver-Burk plot using the linear regression program of Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The same procedure described above for the time course experiments was employed for these 5-min incubations, with the exception that the level of radioactivity was increased to 600 nCi/dish to have enough counts for thin layer chromatography analysis. After the 5-min incubation, the labeled anandamide was extracted from both the medium and the cells by the addition of 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mixed thoroughly and spun down in a clinical centrifuge for 5 min. 100 Î¼l of the organic layer were removed for counting from both the cellular (1.2 ml total) and medium (750 Î¼l) extracts. The remaining portions of the organic extracts from the cells and medium were dried down. The residue was resuspended in 40 Î¼l of chloroform:methanol (1:1), and this was spotted on silica-based thin layer chromatography plates provided by Analtech (Newark, DE). The solvent consisted of a 6:3:1 mixture of ethyl acetate, hexane, and acetic acid (Fisher). Arachidonic acid and anandamide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) standards were run alongside the experimental samples. The plate was then treated with EN3HANCE autoradiography spray provided by PerkinElmer Life Sciences and exposed on Kodak X-Omat AR film. After film development, the areas corresponding to the bands on the x-ray film were scraped off the plates and placed in scintillation vials with scintillation fluid to quantify the products of the TLC analysis (anandamide, phospholipids, and arachidonic acid). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Following the time course experiments and TLC analysis, the raw results were corrected to account for the percentages of the organic layer, which was taken from each sample.

The remainder of the sample was used for thin layer chromatography analysis as shown in Fig. 2. To statistically quantify the uptake rates in these three cell lines, the percentage of the total anandamide taken up by each cell line was compared after 5 min of incubation under identical conditions at the same time. The amount of uptake was then related to the total number of cells, thus allowing the comparison of uptake rates among different cell lines. Each experiment was performed in triplicate on 35-mm plates, which were â¼50% confluent. A fourth plate was run in parallel to determine the number of cells/plate. The enzyme assay for FAAH activity in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells was conducted as described previously (24Omeir R.L. Chin S. Hong Y. Ahern D.G. Deutsch D.G. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice cold PBS and scraped in ice-cold Tris-EDTA, pH 7.6. The cells were then disrupted by sonication. Incubations were performed in triplicate at 37 Â°C in a water bath with shaking. Each incubation contained 10 Î¼l of 50 mg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin in H2O, 50 Î¼l of the cellular extract, 30 Î¼m anandamide (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI), and 0.01 mCi of 120 mCi/mmol arachidonyl[ethanolamine-1,2-14C]ethanolamide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The control tubes contained everything except the cell extract. The reactions were terminated after 30 min by the addition of 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The radioactivity in the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The number of cells/plate was determined with a hemacytometer. The specific activity was expressed as nanomoles of anandamide hydrolyzed/106 cells/h. This was more meaningful than activity based on the amount of protein because protein levels varied widely among the different cell types. Cells were seeded at 3 Ã 105 cells/35-mm dish on day 1. On day 2, cells were transfected with 2.5 Î¼g of DNA using 2.5 Î¼l of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). On day 4, cells were either harvested in 150 Î¼l of Tris-EDTA, pH 7.4, for FAAH assays or used for uptake experiments. The control Hep2 cells were either untransfected and serum-starved or were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the experimental Hep2 cells were transfected with rat pcDNA3-FAAH cDNA (30Arreaza G. Devane W.A. Omeir R.L. Sajnani G. Kunz J. Cravatt B.F. Deutsch D.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To quantify the anandamide uptake rates of untransfected, vector-transfected, and FAAH-transfected cells, the total anandamide taken up was compared after 5 min of incubation under identical conditions. The cells were used for uptake 48 h after transfection. The same procedure that was used for the time course experiments was used for these incubations, with the exception that 200 nCi/dish was used, nonspecific binding to the cellular membrane was determined by incubating parallel plates in 37 Â°C uptake medium for 3 s, and all incubations were stopped by adding 4 Â°C medium. Anandamide uptake in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells was saturable and temperature- and time-dependent. The apparentK m and V max values were 1.8 Î¼m and 17.4 pmol/min/106 cells for N18 cells, 0.7 Î¼m and 3.9 pmol/min/106 cells for C6 cells, and 20.9 Î¼m and 5.9 pmol/min/106 cells for Hep2 cells, respectively. Time course experiments with N18, C6, and Hep2 cells were conducted to qualitatively determine the effects of two FAAH inhibitors, MAFP and PSF, on anandamide uptake. Fig.1 A shows that after preincubating C6 cells with MAFP for 10 min, the amount of anandamide that enters the cell is reduced at each time point from 2 to 6 min. At 6 min, cellular net uptake of labeled anandamide in the control without inhibitor is about double the net cellular uptake of labeled anandamide in the presence of MAFP. The results of the N18 cell time course experiment in Fig. 1 C demonstrate that the effect of MAFP on cellular uptake is not restricted to C6 cells. After 6 min, the control cells have taken up approximately twice as much labeled anandamide as did the MAFP-treated cells. To study the effects of PSF, the other hydrolase inhibitor used in these studies, on anandamide uptake, identical experiments were conducted in N18 and C6 cell lines. Fig. 1,B and D, shows that preincubating C6 and N18 cells with 100 nm PSF for 10 min also reduces the amount of anandamide entering the cell at each time point from 2 up to 6 min. In experiments similar to those described above for C6 and N18 cells, uptake in Hep2 cells was characterized in the presence of MAFP and PSF. In contrast to the results found with N18 and C6 cells, net uptake was not decreased in the presence of either inhibitor (Fig. 1, Eand F). The shapes of the curves resulting from the time course experiments are interesting. First, anandamide is accumulated at a greater rate during the first min than during the rest of the experiment, and the amount taken up is approximately the same with or without the inhibitor. Second, the cells with uninhibited FAAH show a linear uptake after 1 min, whereas those that are inhibited or lack FAAH appear to level slowly to a plateau. The results in Fig. 1 are qualitatively representative of at least three experiments conducted with N18, C6, and Hep2 cells. To more accurately characterize the effect of FAAH inhibition on anandamide uptake, the total cellular radioactivity resulting from anandamide incorporation was quantified in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells after an incubation of 5 min in the absence or presence of MAFP (TableI). MAFP inhibited the incorporation by â¼40% in both N18 and C6, and this effect was highly significant for both of these cell lines (p = 0.0001). However, MAFP did not inhibit anandamide incorporation in Hep2. In fact, it seemed to cause a slight stimulation, although this effect was not quite significant (p = 0.0553). Whereas 1 Î¼mMAFP was chosen for these experiments, similar results were observed at 100 nm (data not shown). The observed inhibition in N18 and C6 cells in the presence of MAFP was not due to toxicity because cells exposed to MAFP do not exhibit decreased viability as observed after trypan blue staining (data not shown). To determine the fate of [lsqb]3H]anandamide (arachidonyl[5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15-3H]ethanolamide) after being taken up by the cells, thin layer chromatography was performed on those control and experimental C6, N18, and Hep2 cells, which were quantified in Table I. After incubation of C6 and N18 with anandamide in the absence of inhibitor (â), the main radioactive product formed inside the cell was phospholipids (83% for C6, 93% for N18), which remain at the origin in this TLC development system (Fig.2). For the C6 and N18 cells, only 14 and 3% of the radioactivity in the cell was free anandamide, respectively, and only 3% of the radioactivity was detected as arachidonic acid in the C6 cells and none in the N18 cells. Because of overexposure, the TLC chromatogram for N18 cells (Fig. 2) gives the impression of quite high anandamide levels in the samples without inhibitor (â), although counting of the samples scraped from the plate actually shows only 3% free anandamide. In the presence of MAFP (+), the entire radioactivity in the C6 and N18 cells is accounted for by anandamide (Fig. 2). Anandamide accumulated in these cells because the breakdown reaction by FAAH was rendered inactive. These experiments raise the possibility that MAFP exerts its effect by inhibiting the transporter. However, it seems unlikely that MAFP exerts its effect in this way as shown by the TLC experiments with Hep2 cells (Fig. 2). The anandamide transport mechanism is operational in these cells in the absence of MAFP (â). However, unlike the situation with control C6 and N18 cells, anandamide is not broken down (>90% of the radioactivity in the cell is anandamide) after being transported into the cells because these cells lack FAAH (5Deutsch D.G. Chin S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Significantly, in the presence of MAFP (+) transport is not inhibited because there is no significant difference in the amount of anandamide on the TLC, and as mentioned above (Table I), there seems to be a slight stimulation. The TLC pattern for Hep2 cells with (+) or without (â) MAFP treatment is the same as that observed in N18 and C6 cells that have been treated with MAFP. An experiment was performed to make a side by side comparison of N18, C6, and Hep2 in terms of their uptake and enzyme activity. Interestingly, the absolute rate of uptake was found to vary among the different cell types when the cell numbers were carefully quantified, and this correlated approximately with the amount of FAAH activity (Fig. 3). The N18 cells had the greatest total uptake with the C6 and Hep2 cells having â¼64 and 51% of the uptake of the N18, respectively. The FAAH activity in C6 was found to be approximately 60% of that found in N18, although there was no measurable FAAH activity in Hep2 cells as mentioned above. FAAH transfection experiments were undertaken to demonstrate that uptake is dependent upon FAAH activity in Hep2 cells. The Hep2 cells, which have no measurable FAAH activity, were transfected with a pcDNA3 vector as a control or with pcDNA3-FAAH cDNA (Fig.4). The vector-transfected Hep2 cells had no measurable FAAH activity, whereas the Hep2 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FAAH cDNA were very active (2.92 nmol Â± 0.19/h/106 cells), demonstrating the expression of FAAH (p < 0.0001). Significantly, anandamide uptake in the transfected cells doubled (8.27 Â± 1.0 pmol for transfectedversus 4.28 Â± 0.21 pmol for untransfected cells and 4.29 Â± 0.34 pmol for vector-transfected cells) (Fig. 4). This finding demonstrates that uptake is dependent upon FAAH activity. The intracellular concentration of anandamide was calculated for each of the cell types (Table II). The intracellular concentration of anandamide in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells was determined to be â¼5-, 7-, and 18-fold greater, respectively, than the extracellular concentration of 100 nm that was used in these experiments. These data strongly suggest some sequestering mechanisms for accumulating anandamide inside cells without FAAH or when FAAH is inhibited with MAFP.Table IIIntracellular concentrations of anandamide in the presence of inhibitorCell lineUptake of anandamide/cellIntracellular volumeExtracellular concentration of anandamideIntracellular concentration of anandamide-Fold intracellular accumulationpmollitersnmnmN18TG24.28 Ã 10â68.5100503.85C65.31 Ã 10â67.5100707.97Hep27.90 Ã 10â64.51001756.118The intracellular concentrations of anandamide were calculated in N18, C6, and Hep2 cells after a preincubation with 1 Î¼m MAFP for 10 min followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 Â°C in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 nmanandamide and 1 Î¼m MAFP.

Burchell J. Miles D.W. Dalziel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The MUC1 mucin is a membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular domain made up largely of tandem repeats of 20 amino acids, each of which contains potential O-glycosylation sites (2Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 268: 3801-3804Google Scholar, 3Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Lalani E.N.

The aberrant glycosylation has been well documented in breast cancers where it has been shown (4Lloyd K.O. Burchell J. Kudryashov V. Yin B.W.T. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. J. Biol.

Recent data suggest that not only the composition but the number of O-glycans added to MUC1 is altered in breast cancer (6Muller S. Alving K. Peter-Katalinic J. Zachara N. Gooley A.A. Hanisch F.G. J.

Thus, the cancer-associated glycoprotein is antigenically distinct from the normally processed mucins (7Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in antigenic profile is detected by the antibody SM3 (8Burchell J. Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou T. Girling A. Lewis A. Millis R. Lamport D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5476-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 9Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Int. J.

Analysis of the O-glycans attached to the mucin produced by the normal lactating breast and by breast cancer cell lines has shown that the oligosaccharides added to the normal mucin are core 2-based structures (11Hanisch F.G.

As illustrated in Fig.1, core 1 (GalÎ²1,3GalNAc-Ser/Thr) can be a substrate for enzymes adding GlcNAc in the Î²1,6 linkage to GalNAc to form core 2 or for sialyltransferases adding sialic acid in Î±2,3 linkage to galactose. These early steps in O-glycan synthesis are crucial to the final definition of O-glycan structure, since the conversion to core 2 promotes chain branching and elongation, whereas the addition of sialic acid terminates chain growth. In considering the potential competition of glycosyltransferases for the core 1 substrate, the level of activity of a specific glycosyltransferase and their relative positions in the Golgi pathway need to be considered. It now appears that glycosyltransferases are not confined exclusively to specific Golgi compartments but show a more diffuse distribution among compartments (13Rottger S. White J. Wandall H.H. Olivo J.C. Stark A. Bennett E.P. Whitehouse C. Berger E.G. Clausen H. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, although the expression of the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-I 1ST3Gal-I (SiaT-4a) refers to a sialyltransferase with GenBankTM accession number L13972.

Another important finding is that most glycosidic linkages are in fact formed by multiple glycosyltransferase isoenzymes that have different kinetic properties and expression patterns and possibly different subcellular distributions. Thus there are several transferases that are able to add sialic acid in Î±2,3 linkage to the galactose moiety in core 1 (15Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 5-14Crossref Google Scholar). However, of the cloned Î±2,3-sialyltransferases enzymes, ST3Gal-I appears to play the major role in the sialylation of core 1 structures on MUC1 in breast, as deduced from enzyme specificity and tissue distribution (16Gillespie W.

Significantly, the ST3Gal-I enzyme has been found to be elevated in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers (14Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Loyd K.O.

Of the C2GnTs identified to date by cloning, it appears that C2GnT1 is the enzyme most commonly expressed in breast tissue and tumors, although C2GnT3 can occasionally be expressed (this manuscript). Although the expression of the C2GnT1 enzyme has been found to be decreased or absent in most breast cancer cell lines (24Brockhausen I. Yang J. Burchell J.M. Whitehouse C. Taylor- Papadimitriou J.

Moreover, the level of expression of the mRNA coding for ST3Gal-I correlates with the level of expression of the SM3 epitope and with tumor grade (19Burchell J.M. Poulsom R. Hanby A. Whitehouse C. Cooper L. Clausen H. Miles D. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Since core 2 branching by Î²6GlcNAc-transferases is inhibited by Î±2,3 sialylation of core 1 in vitro (25Kuhns W. Rutz V. Paulsen H. Matta K.L. Baker M.A. Barner M. Granovsky M. Brockhausen I. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 27Brockhausen I. Schutzbach J. Kuhns W. Acta Anat. 1998; 161: 36-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it follows that ST3Gal-I could be a key controlling enzyme leading to simple mucin type core 1 glycosylation pattern in cancer cells. The question, however, is whether ST3Gal-I can effectively compete with C2GnT1 in vivo, leading to an inhibition in the formation of core 2 structures on MUC1 and whether this relates to exposure of the cancer-associated SM3 epitope. For competition to be effective, the enzymes must overlap in the compartments of the Golgi apparatus. We have therefore examined in detail the level of expression of C2GnT1 throughout the Golgi pathway and compared this profile with the profile of expression of ST3Gal-I in the same Golgi compartments. We find that although the peak expression of C2GnT1 is in the cis and ST3Gal-I peaks in the medial/trans, the enzymes did show partial overlap. To directly examine if this degree of overlap is sufficient to allow competition between the two enzymes, we transfected the cDNAs encoding C2GnT1 and ST3Gal-I into the breast cancer cell line T47D (28Keydar I. Chen l. Karby S. Weiss F.R. Delarea J. Radu M. Chaitcik S. Brenner H.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1979; 15: 659-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that despite the later peak of localization in the Golgi, the ST3Gal-I enzyme is able to compete effectively with C2GnT1 for the core 1 substrate in vivo, when the sialyltransferase is highly expressed. The results show that the relative levels of the competing enzymes affect both the structure of the O-glycans attached to MUC1 and the exposure of the SM3 epitope. Thus, the SM3 epitope was exposed in breast cancer cells expressing C2GnT1, providing the ST3Gal-I enzyme was elevated as it is in breast cancer.

HPAF, a human pancreatic carcinoma line, was grown in E4, 10â¥FCS. 20 frozen breast cancer tumor tissues were provided by Dr. Andrew Hanby, Imperial Cancer Research Fund Breast Pathology Group. All samples were classified as invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3 showing positive staining with the SM3 antibody. Before RNA extraction (which was done as described for the cell lines; see below), samples were kept in liquid nitrogen and then subject to mechanical dis-aggregation using a dis-membranator. The cDNA encoding the human C2GnT1 was obtained from Dr. R. McEver (W. K. Warren Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma). A 950-base pair PstI fragment containing the open reading frame from +710 to +1,660 was used a probe for Northern analysis. The cDNA encoding the human ST3Gal-I (32Chang M.L. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B.

The full-length C2GnT1 cDNA-coding region was ligated into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 expressing the neomycin-selectable marker (Invitrogen). For Golgi localization experiments, C2GnT1 cDNA was tagged with six 9E10 Myc epitopes and cloned into the retroviral vector, pBabepuro. The production of amphotrophic ST3Gal-I- and C2GnT1-expressing retroviruses was essentially as previously described (14Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Loyd K.O. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, ST3Gal-I DNA (tagged with an Myc epitope at the C terminus) and C2GnT cDNA, subcloned into the pBabe puro vector, was transfected into the amphotrophic packaging cell line AM12. 48 h after transfection, cells were split 1:10 into growth medium containing 2 Î¼g/ml puromycin for selection. Medium was changed every 3 to 4 days for 4 weeks until selection was complete. The retrovirus producer cell lines were grown to 70â¥ confluency, and the spent medium was replaced with a half-volume of fresh medium. 3 days later, the virus-containing medium was removed, filtered, quick frozen in dry ice, and stored at â70 Â°C. T47D cells were transfected with pcDNA3neo-expressing C2GnT1 or with the empty vector to give the T47 E2B and T47D E2J cell lines expressing C2GnT and the T47D neo cell line expressing only the selectable marker. To ensure efficient transfection of cells and the isolation of stable clones, a modified method of electroporation in the presence of Me2SO was used, which improves the efficiency of transfection of epithelial cell lines (33Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 1.25â¥ Me2SO was included in both the electroporation cuvette and also after the pulse in the culture medium. Three days post-transfection T47D cells were split 1:10 into growth medium containing 500 Î¼g/ml G418. Media were changed every 3 days until selection was complete and stable clones were expanded. For transduction of T47D-E2B, T47D-E2J, and MTSV1â7 cell lines with the ST3Gal-I and C2GnT1 retroviruses, cells were seeded at â¼1 Ã 105 cells/well on a 6-well plate overnight, then 2 ml of retroviral supernatant (derived from transfection of packaging cell line above) was added along with sterile Polybrene at 8 Î¼g/ml and incubated for 7 h. Medium was then changed to E4, 10â¥ FCS for T47D and E4, 10â¥ FCS + 10 Î¼g/ml insulin and 5 Î¼g/ml hydrocortisone for MTSV1â7, and cells were left for 24 h. At this time the medium was changed to contain the appropriate antibiotic for selection. Selection was continued for 7 days, after which individual clones were isolated and expanded. MTSV1â7 cells (31Bartek J. Bartkova J. Kyprianou K. Lalani E.N. Staskova Z. Shearer M. Chang S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Patterns of O-Glycosylation in Normal and Malignant Breast Epithelial Cells. Ph.D. thesis. University of London, 1998Google Scholar), and clones were isolated. Cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1â¥ glutaraldehyde, 4â¥ paraformaldehyde before being scraped, spun, and stored overnight at 4 Â°C. Pellets were then stained with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti mouse Ig coupled to 10-nm gold particles and processed for electron microscopy as described by Whitehouse et al. (14Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Loyd K.O. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The orientation of the Golgi was determined by reference to the position of Î²1â4 galactosyltransferase (GalT1) using rabbit antibody to GalT1 (a generous gift from Dr. Eric Berger) and followed by protein A coupled to 5-nm gold particles. Quantitation was performed as described by Whitehouse et al. (14Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Loyd K.O. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose was added to 108 cells, and the cells were hand-homogenized and stored at â80 Â°C. The activities of Î²6GlcNAc transferase and ST3Gal(O) transferase in cell homogenates were measured using GalÎ²1,3GalNAc-nitrophenol as substrate, and the product was estimated by high performance liquid chromatography, as described by Brockhausen et al. (24Brockhausen I. Yang J. Burchell J.M. Whitehouse C. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as nmol/h/mg. Cells were trypsinized and washed once in growth medium, and a minimum of 5 Ã 105 cells were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of the appropriate specific antibody diluted in growth medium, neat tissue culture supernatant, or in 100 Î¼l of growth medium alone as a negative control. All incubations were carried out in the presence of 0.02â¥ sodium azide and on wet ice. After a 30-min incubation, cells were washed three times in growth medium containing 0.02â¥ sodium azide. Cells were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, diluted 1:40 in growth medium, and incubated for 30 min in the dark. After washing three times in growth medium containing 0.02â¥ sodium azide, cells were resuspended in 300 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline, and 10,000 cells were analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACScan. For FACS analysis of PNA binding, cells were incubated with or without sialidase (V. cholerae), 0.06 units/ml, and analyzed for the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated PNA as described previously (7Burchell J.M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines or breast tumors using TRIZOL as per the manufacturer's instructions. Placental poly(A)+ RNA was obtained fromCLONTECH. RNA was run on 1â¥ agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde-diethyl pyrocarbonate gel in running buffer (0.02 m MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, in diethyl pyrocarbonate water). After denaturing, the RNA was transferred and immobilized onto Hybond-N membrane and incubated with Î±-32P-labeled probe (labeled using MegaPrime kit with [Î±-32P]dCTP) and hybridized overnight at 65 Â°C. Filters were then washed for 1 h in buffer A (0.08 m sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 5â¥ bovine serum albumin, 10â¥ SDS) at 65 Â°C, then twice in buffer B (0.16 m sodium phosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 4â¥SDS) for 1 h at 65 Â°C and then exposed to a Kodak phosphor screen overnight and visualized using a STORM scanner system. Cells grown to around 80â¥ confluence in a T75 flask were washed twice in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.4 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1â¥ Triton X-100, 1â¥ deoxycholate, 109 Î¼g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin). Cells were scraped off, the flask was washed with an additional 0.2 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the lysates were spun at 14,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. Supernatant was used for Western blotting or MUC1 immunoprecipitation. Changes in the hexosamines in the side chains of MUC1 were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) after metabolically labeling the glycoprotein with [3H]glucosamine hydrochoride and precipitating with the CT-1 antibody as previously described (4Lloyd K.O.

Briefly, cells in 75-cm2 flasks at 70â80â¥ confluence were incubated for 2 h with medium containing reduced glucose (0.45 g/liter) before changing to low glucose medium (3 ml) containing 100 Î¼Ci/ml [3H]glucosamine hydrochoride. After overnight incubation, cells were lysed, and 500 Î¼l of the lysate was pre-cleared with pre-immune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads. The radioactively labeled MUC1 was immunoprecipitated with 10 Î¼l of CT-1 polyclonal antibody (30Pemberton L. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which was directed to the cytoplasmic tail and precipitated all glycoforms of the mucin. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the complex was removed by centrifugation and washed thoroughly. The immunoprecipitate was eluted in 2â¥ SDS and hydrolyzed in 2 n trifluoroacetic acid at 100 Â°C for 3 h and then analyzed by HPAEC on a CarboPak PA1 column by isocratic elution with 0.01 m NaOH. 300 Î¼g of cell lysate were incubated with or without 1.0 unit of C. perfringens sialidase in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, in a 37 Â°C water bath overnight. 50 Î¼g of lysate was separated on a 12â¥ SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose in Towbin buffer using a Bio-Rad semi-dry electroblotter. The blot was blocked overnight at 4 Â°C in 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.2â¥ Tween 20, 1.0â¥ bovine serum albumin (PTB solution) and then incubated with biotinylated PNA (5 Î¼g/ml in 20 ml PTB solution) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After 3 washes in PTB solution, the blot was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1/2000 dilution in 20 ml of PTB solution). After 3 additional washes, the bound lectin-streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and light-sensitive film. Genes coding for three enzymes able to synthesize core 2 (C2GnT1, C2GnT2, and C2GnT3) from core 1 have been isolated (20Bierhuizen M.F.A. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of these enzymes in the T47D breast cancer cell line and in the nonmalignant MTSV1â7 cells was examined by Northern analysis. Fig. 2 shows that none of these enzymes were expressed in T47D cells, whereas C2GnT1 and C2GnT3, but not C2GnT2, were expressed in MTSV1â7 cells (Fig.2 B, lane 1). When RNA from normal breast tissue was examined, only C2GnT1 could be detected, mRNA for the other two enzymes being undetectable (Fig.3 A).

Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The Î²2-adrenergic receptor (Î²2AR) was cloned more than a decade ago and has since served as a prototypic member of the receptor family (3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F.

A key issue in our understanding of GPCR function is the nature of the molecular mechanisms that couple agonist binding to receptor activation and transmission of the signal across the plasma membrane. Only recently spectroscopic techniques on purified receptor preparations have been taken into use and permitted the first direct insight into structural changes that occur during receptor activation (4Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The use of EPR spectroscopy by Hubbell, Khorana, and co-workers (5Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) has showed evidence that activation of the light-sensing receptor rhodopsin involves movements of transmembrane segment (TM) 3 and 6 relative to one another. In addition, movements of TM 6 in rhodopsin have been predicted from fluorescence spectroscopy studies (8Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our application of fluorescence spectroscopy to the Î²2AR has supported a role of TM 3 and 6 also for activation of GPCRs activated by âdiffusibleâ ligands. The sulfhydryl-reactive fluorescent probe, IANBD, was covalently incorporated into the purified Î²2AR and used as a molecular reporter of the structural changes that takes place following agonist binding to the receptor (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis identified two cysteines, Cys-1253.44 in the middle of TM 3 and Cys-2856.47 in middle of TM 6, as responsible for the observed agonist-induced fluorescence changes (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K.

While converging on the involvement of TM 3 and 6 in receptor activation, the spectroscopic studies on rhodopsin and the Î²2AR also indicated some possible important differences between the two receptors. The EPR spectroscopic read-outs for rhodopsin demonstrated a rapid formation of the active metarhodopsin II state (within microseconds) following light-induced conversion of the preboundcis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, whereas the conversion of metarhodopsin back to the inactive metarhodopsin III state was slow, with a t 12 of about 6 min (12Farahbakhsh Z.T.

In contrast to the rapid activation and the slow inactivation kinetics observed for rhodopsin, the spectroscopic analyses of the Î²2AR indicated slow agonist-induced conformational changes (t 12 = â¼2â3 min), significantly slower than the predicted association rate of the agonist (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reversal of the agonist-induced conformational change was relatively fast (t 12 = â¼30 s) (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These differences in activation kinetics could either reflect inherent differences between the two receptors or be a consequence of differences in how the changes were detected. To clarify this issue and to obtain further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR activation, we wished to establish new read-outs for agonist-induced conformational changes in the Î²2AR. We decided to focus on the cytoplasmic end of TM 6 for two major reasons. First, the evidence for TM 6 movements in response to light activation of rhodopsin, was based on spectroscopic analysis of mutants that contained cysteine residues in this particular region of TM 6, labeled with either nitroxide spin labels or fluorescent probes (6Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 7Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Labeling of the Î²2AR in this region with a molecular reporter of conformational changes would thus allow a more direct comparison between rhodopsin and the Î²2AR. Second, many mutagenesis-based studies have indicated the importance of the cytoplasmic region of TM 6 in receptor activation and G protein coupling (3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 132: 63101-63132Google Scholar, 14Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); nonetheless, its precise role is still not well understood, and conformational changes at the cytoplasmic side of TM 6 have not been described for receptors activated by diffusible ligands (4Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Notably, our earlier evidence for TM 6 movements in the Î²2AR was based on fluorescent labeling of a naturally occurring cysteine (Cys-2856.47) situated in the hydrophobic middle part of TM 6 (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling at this position did not allow reliable predictions about the character of potential movements at the cytoplasmic side of the helix. To explore the putative conformational changes in the predicted cytoplasmic region of TM 6 of the Î²2AR, four residues in this region were substituted with cysteines. The cysteines were inserted in a mutant Î²2AR containing a reduced number of endogenous cysteines (Î²2AR-Cys-min) (see Fig. 1). The spectroscopic analyses of the purified and fluorescently labeled Î²2AR cysteine mutants provided evidence that activation of the Î²2AR involves structural changes at the cytoplasmic side of TM 6. Employment of a computational method, which incorporated the complex hydrophobic/hydrophilic environment in which the inserted cysteines reside, allowed a prediction of the preferred conformations of the attached IANBD moiety. Analysis of these preferred conformations in context of a receptor model supported the possibility that TM 6 undergoes movements that are similar to those predicted to take place in rhodopsin during photo-activation. The template used for site-directed mutagenesis was a cDNA named Î²2AR-Cys-min, which encoded the human Î²2AR, containing the mutations C77V, C265A, C327S, C378A, and C406A (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the construct was tagged at the N terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (Sigma), and at the C terminus with six histidines (15Guan X. Peroutka S.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 695-698PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were all generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis usingPfu polymerase according the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 containing Î²2AR-Cys-min (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Î²2AR-Cys-min-GsÎ± (16Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Î²2AR-Cys-min and mutant constructs were expressed in Sf-9 insect cells and high titer virus stocks generated as described using the the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) (17Jensen A.D. Gether U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 345-361PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as described from 30-ml Sf-9 cell cultures in 125-ml disposable Erlenmeyer flasks, grown at a density of 3 Ã 106 cells/ml, and infected with baculovirus encoding the different receptor constructs for 48 h before harvesting (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase assays were preformed in the Sf-9 cell membranes as described (18Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPase assays were carried out on Sf-9 cell membranes expressing Î²2AR-GsÎ± fusion constructs as described (16Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Saturation binding assays and competition binding assays on membrane preparations from cells expressing the different receptors were carried out as previously described using [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as radioligand (19Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Binding assays on solubilized and purified Î²2AR were also performed as described using [3H]DHA as radioligand (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.0 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). The Î²2AR-Cys-min and mutant receptors were solubilized in 0.8%n-dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside (DÎ²M) (Anatrace) and subsequently purified by nickel chromatography using Chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by alprenolol affinity chromatography as previously described (17Jensen A.D. Gether U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 345-361PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Approximately 1â2 nmol of purified protein could generally be obtained from a 500-ml culture. The specific activity of the purified receptors varied between 3 and 9 nmol/mg protein. Protein was determined using the detergent-insensitive Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Purified receptors were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by standard Coomassie staining. The purified receptor was labeled with IANBD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to described procedures (17Jensen A.D. Gether U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 345-361PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1â3 nmol receptor was bound to a 150-Î¼l nickel column (Chelating Fast Flow Sepharose Resin, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 500 mm NaCl and 0.08% DÎ²M), and labeling achieved by recycling 1.0 ml of 0.5 mm IANBD in high salt buffer several times over the nickel column for 20 min. Excess dye was removed by extensive washing of the column with high salt buffer. The labeling procedure resulted in incorporation of 1.1â1.5 mol of IANBD/mol of receptor, as determined by measuring absorption at 481 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 21,000 mâ1cmâ1 for IANBD and a molecular mass of 50,000 Da for the receptor. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed at room temperature on a SPEX Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter connected to a PC equipped with the Datamax 2.2 software package (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) as described (9Gether U. Lin S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 17Jensen A.D. Gether U. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 345-361PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments the excitation and emission bandpass were set at. 4.2 nm. Both emission scans and time course experiments were done with 10â20 pmol of IANBD-labeled receptor in 500 Î¼l of buffer (20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.08% DÎ²M) under constant stirring. In emission scan experiments the excitation wavelength was 481 nm, and emission was measured from 490 to 625 nm. During time scan experiments the excitation wavelength was 481 nm, and emission was measured at a wavelength of 530 nm. The volume of the added ligands was one percentage of total volume, and fluorescence was corrected for this dilution. The compounds tested in the fluorescence experiments had an absorbance of less than 0.01 at 481 and 525 nm in the concentrations used excluding inner filter effects. Stock solutions (1.0m) of the hydrophilic quencher potassium iodide containing 10 mm Na2S2O3 was prepared freshly for each round of experiments. The experiments were preformed with 10â20 pmol of IANBD-labeled receptor in 400 Î¼l of buffer (20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.08% DÎ²M). To correct for dilution/ionic strength effects on fluorescence, measurements were performed in parallel using a 1.0 m stock of KCl. 10 Î¼l of quencher (potassium iodide) or control solution (potassium chloride) were added sequentially followed by thorough mixing after each addition and subsequent recording of fluorescence using the Constant Wavelength Analysis program in the Datamax software package (Jobin Yvon Inc.). The excitation wavelength was 481 nm, and the emission wavelength was 530 nm. The data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F = 1 +KSV[Q], whereFo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of quencher ([Q]), andKSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (21Lakovicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 238-318Google Scholar). TM 6 was modeled from residues Ser-2626.24âVal-2976.59 as an Î±-helix as described under âResultsâ and according to Ref. 11Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2504) Google Scholar. The conformational memories method (22Guarnieri F. Weinstein H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5580-5589Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Guarnieri F. Wilson S.R. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 648-653Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used to explore the preferred conformations of IANBD attached to the inserted cysteines (Cys-2696.31, Cys-2706.32, Cys-2716.33, and Cys-2726.34) (24Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The simulations were performed on the isolated TM 6 peptide using a new computational method that incorporated the mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic environment in which the cysteines are located. To reduce the required computing time, only the dihedrals of residues from Glu-2686.30 to Ile-2766.38 were varied. The computational method is based on the work of White and Wimley (25White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar), who showed evidence that the membrane cannot be considered a homogenous hydrophobic layer but consists of an â¼30 â« relatively constant, low dielectric region, sandwiched between two complex regions of variable dielectric behavior. In the method, the interfacial regions are approximated as a dielectric gradient. Because solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation are iterative, it is not possible to perform such calculations within a statistical mechanics simulation-like conformational memories. Thus, the following procedure was implemented: 1) the 15â« interfacial region was grid into 0.2â« spacing; 2) the water-interface boundary was set to a dielectric constant of 78; 3) the interface-lipid boundary was set to a dielectric constant of 5; 4) the penetration dielectric constant was set to toe(z) = 78(1 â z) + 5z, z = 0.2n/15,n = 0,1,2,â,75; 5) the Poisson Boltzmann equation for each dielectric slice was solved, and the potentials were stored on the grids numerically in data tables; 6) potentials were obtained over a coverage of at least the 60 â« region spanning the membrane; and 7) a linear interpolation of the potentials between grids was implemented. Still and co-workers (26Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caulfield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar) have developed a generalized Born surface area continuum solvation model for water and chloroform. Creation of the membrane interface was implemented as follows: 1) for each new configuration of the peptide, either a conformational change or a rigid body translation or rotation, both the chloroform and water solvation energy was computed; 2) atoms that have a zcoordinate less than 15 were assigned the chloroform solvation energy; 3) atoms that have a z coordinate greater than 0 were assigned the water solvation energy; 4) atoms that have 15 <z < 0 are assigned a solvation energyesolv = (x)(water) + (1 âx)(chloroform), x = (15 + z)/15. The starting spatial configuration of the peptide consisted of placing the Î±-carbon of the IANBD-labeled cysteine mutant 0.5 â« into the interface at the interface-lipid boundary (i.e. 0, 0, â14.5), and placing the Î±-carbon of the i+7 residue in the chloroform environment such that the vector between iand i+7 are perpendicular to the xy plane. Thei+7 Î±-carbon residue resides at an approximate coordinate of 0, 0, â24. The different Pro-kink conformations were selected from our previous and published simulations on TM 6 of the Î²2AR (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The preferred IANBD conformations defined by the computational simulations described above were analyzed in the context of a three-dimensional model of the seven-helix Î²2AR transmembrane domain modeled after the rhodopsin template (27Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 28Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To achieve the possibility of site-selective, covalent incorporation of the sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophore IANBD into the purified Î²2AR, we wanted to reduce the number of endogenous cysteines available for chemical derivatization. All of the free cysteines could not be substituted without severe decrease in receptor expression; however, the expression was preserved in a mutant where Cys-772.52, Cys-2656.27, Cys-3277.54, Cys-378, and Cys-406 were substituted with valine or serine (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant still contains three cysteines available for chemical derivatization, Cys-1163.35, Cys-1253.44, and Cys-2856.47, but additional mutation of any of these residues substantially reduced expression (data not shown and Ref. 10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose this construct, which we named Î²2AR-Cys-min, for further studies. Importantly, Î²2AR-Cys-min binds agonists and antagonists with the same affinities as the wild type Î²2AR and couples to adenylyl cyclase with the same efficiency (10Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four consecutive residues in the cytoplasmic region of TM 6, His-2696.31, Lys-2706.32, Ala-2716.33, and Leu-2726.34, were mutated to cysteines in the Î²2AR-Cys-min background (Fig.1). The substitutions had only minor effects on the general pharmacological properties of the receptor (Table I). Saturation binding experiments revealed unchanged affinities in the mutants for the antagonist [3H]DHA (Table I). Competition binding experiments with the full agonist isoproteronol (ISO) showed Ki values for inhibition of [3H]DHA binding to the mutant receptors that were either similar or slightly smaller than that of Î²2AR-Cys-min (Table I). Following purification and labeling with IANBD, the mutants and Î²2AR-Cys-min were analyzed again for their capability to bind [3H]DHA and ISO. Both the purified Î²2AR-Cys-min and the purified mutants exhibited high affinity for [3H]DHA, although a moderate decrease in apparent [3H]DHA affinity was observed in Î²2AR-Cys-min-L272C (Table I). However, the affinities for ISO were well preserved in all constructs upon purification and IANBD labeling (Table I). The mutants were finally analyzed for their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase in Sf-9 cell membrane preparations. All mutants exhibited evidence for efficient coupling to adenylyl cyclase, and the observed EC50 values for ISO were comparable to that of Î²2AR-Cys-min (Table I). Of the four mutants, only Î²2AR-Cys-min-L272C showed evidence of increased agonist-independent activity as indicated by a small increase in basal receptor activity in comparison with the wild type (Table I).Table IBinding properties and functional coupling of Î²2AR-Cys-min and mutant receptorsBmaxKd [3H]DHA membranesKi ISO membranesKd [3H]DHA purified, IANBD-labeledKi ISO purified, IANBD-labeledBasal cyclaseMaximum cyclaseEC50, ISO cyclasepmol/mgnmÎ¼mnmÎ¼m% of Î²2AR-Cys-min% of basalnmÎ²2AR-Cys-min4.9 Â± 0.490.66 Â± 0.20.16 (0.15â0.17)0.59 (0.54â0.65)0.30 (0.1â0.8)100181 Â± 1320 (14â27)H269C2.2 Â± 0.060.45 Â± 0.10.10 (0.08â0.13)1.25 (1.18â1.32)0.8 (0.4â1.6)108 Â± 15184 Â± 2719 (6â58)K270C4.4 Â± 1.210.61 Â± 0.10.10 (0.09â0.11)0.93 (0.90â0.96)0.09 (0.04â0.13)77 Â± 8200 Â± 2014 (8â26)A271C5.4 Â± 0.290.56 Â± 0.020.073 (0.069â0.079)1.00 (0.92â1.08)0.5 (0.3â1.1)77 Â± 8245 Â± 3068 (63â73)L272C3.5 Â± 0.350.46 Â± 0.060.043 (0.038â0.048)6.7 (6.2â7.4)0.25 (0.17â0.42)154 Â± 22132 Â± 49 (8â11)Bmax and Kd values for [3H]DHA in Sf-9 cell membranes were determined from saturation binding experiments by non-linear regression analysis using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Experimental results have been obtained that address the role of strange quarks in generating nuclear magnetism. The measurement reported here provides an unambiguous constraint on strange quark contributions to the proton's magnetic moment through the electron-proton weak interaction. We also report evidence for the existence of a parity-violating electromagnetic effect known as the anapole moment of the proton. The proton's anapole moment is not yet well understood theoretically, but it could have important implications for precision weak interaction studies in atomic systems such as cesium."

https://openalex.org/W2037814757,"Human group V phospholipase A2(hVPLA2) has been shown to have high activity to elicit leukotriene production in human neutrophils (Han, S. K., Kim, K. P., Koduri, R., Bittova, L., Munoz, N. M., Leff, A. R., Wilton, D. C., Gelb, M. H., and Cho, W. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11881â11888). To determine the mechanism by which hVPLA2 interacts with cell membranes to induce leukotriene formation, we mutated surface cationic residues and a catalytic residue of hVPLA2 and measured the interactions of mutants with model membranes, immobilized heparin, and human neutrophils. These studies showed that cationic residues, Lys7, Lys11, and Arg34, constitute a part of the interfacial binding surface of hVPLA2, which accounts for its moderate preference for anionic membranes. Additionally, hVPLA2 binds heparin with high affinity and has a well defined heparin-binding site. The site is composed of Arg100, Lys101, Lys107, Arg108, and Arg111, and is spatially distinct from its interfacial binding surface. Importantly, the activities of the mutants to hydrolyze cell membrane phospholipids and induce leukotriene biosynthesis, when enzymes were added exogenously to neutrophils, correlated with their activities on phosphatidylcholine membranes but not with their affinities for anionic membranes and heparin. These results indicate that hVPLA2 acts directly on the outer plasma membranes of neutrophils to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Further studies suggest that products of hVPLA2 hydrolysis trigger the cellular leukotriene production by activating cellular enzymes involved in leukotriene formation. Finally, the temporal and spatial resolution of exogenously added hVPLA2 and mutants suggests that binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is important for the internalization and clearance of cell surface-bound hVPLA2. Human group V phospholipase A2(hVPLA2) has been shown to have high activity to elicit leukotriene production in human neutrophils (Han, S. K., Kim, K. P., Koduri, R., Bittova, L., Munoz, N.

The site is composed of Arg100, Lys101, Lys107, Arg108, and Arg111, and is spatially distinct from its interfacial binding surface. Importantly, the activities of the mutants to hydrolyze cell membrane phospholipids and induce leukotriene biosynthesis, when enzymes were added exogenously to neutrophils, correlated with their activities on phosphatidylcholine membranes but not with their affinities for anionic membranes and heparin. These results indicate that hVPLA2 acts directly on the outer plasma membranes of neutrophils to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Further studies suggest that products of hVPLA2 hydrolysis trigger the cellular leukotriene production by activating cellular enzymes involved in leukotriene formation. Finally, the temporal and spatial resolution of exogenously added hVPLA2 and mutants suggests that binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is important for the internalization and clearance of cell surface-bound hVPLA2. phospholipase A2 arachidonic acid 1,2-bis[12-(lipoyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol bovine serum albumin 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine Hanks' balanced salt solution heparan sulfate proteoglycan human group IIa phospholipase A2 human group V phospholipase A2 leukotriene B4 phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidyl choline 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine secretory phospholipase A2 Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 human embryonic kidney oleic acid Phospholipases A2(PLA2)1 catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, the products of which can be transformed into potent inflammatory lipid mediators, platelet-activating factor, and eicosanoids that include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Multiple forms of PLA2s have been found in mammalian tissues (1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), including several forms (groups Ib, IIa, IIc, IId, IIe, IIf, V, and X) of secretory PLA2s (sPLA2) and intracellular PLA2s (e.g. groups IV and VI). Recent cell studies indicated that sPLA2 works in concert with group IV cytosolic PLA2 to induce immediate and delayed eicosanoid formation (2Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

At present, however, the identity of sPLA2 involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis, the temporal and spatial sequences of its mobilization during inflammatory cell activation, and the mechanism by which it interacts with cell membranes to induce cellular eicosanoid formation are not fully understood. Recently, mounting evidence has pointed to the involvement of group V PLA2 in eicosanoid formation in various mammalian cells (4Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J.

In particular, the mechanism whereby group V PLA2 interacts with cell membranes remains unclear. There are at least three possible mechanisms for interaction of sPLA2 with cells (see Fig. 1). In the simplest mechanism, sPLA2 would act directly on membrane phospholipids to release fatty acids and lysophospholipids, which in turn induce eicosanoid release. However, many mammalian sPLA2s, most notably group Ib (9Dua R. Wu S.K. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 263-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and IIa PLA2s (10Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), strongly prefer anionic membranes to zwitterionic ones, and consequently have low affinity for and activity on intact mammalian cells, the outer plasma membranes of which are mainly composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin. For this reason, indirect mechanisms, involving anionic cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (3Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), have been proposed (see Fig. 1). However, direct involvement of HSPG and receptors in the actions of sPLA2on cells remains controversial (16Koduri R. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.-K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To elucidate the origin of high activity of group V PLA2 to release fatty acids and eicosanoids from mammalian cells, we fully characterized the enzymatic and membrane-binding properties of recombinant human group V PLA2 (hVPLA2) (17Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These studies showed that hVPLA2 could bind and hydrolyze PC membranes and the outer plasma membranes of mammalian cells much more efficiently than other sPLA2s, including human group IIa PLA2(hIIaPLA2). Additionally, a structure-function analysis of hVPLA2 revealed good correlation between its affinity for PC membranes and its activity on mammalian cells, suggesting that hVPLA2 could directly bind to the outer plasma membranes of mammalian cells to hydrolyze phospholipids and elicit eicosanoid formation (18Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that rat group V PLA2 binds to human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells via HSPG (3Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Indeed, group V PLA2s, including hVPLA2, contain a cluster of cationic residues in the C-terminal region (see Fig. 2), which is involved in HSPG binding for group IIa PLA2s (16Koduri R. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.-K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, hVPLA2 has a few cationic residues on its putative interfacial binding surface and modestly (â¼4-fold) prefers anionic membranes to zwitterionic membranes (18Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the cell binding of group V PLA2 might involve interactions with anionic surfaces, including cell surface HSPG. To determine the exact mechanism by which hVPLA2interacts with mammalian cells and elucidate the potential involvement of HSPG binding in its cell activities, we mutated surface cationic residues and a catalytic residue, and measured the interactions of mutants with model membranes, immobilized heparin, and human neutrophils. Results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial sequences of events involved in hVPLA2-mediated cellular eicosanoid biosynthesis.Figure 2Partial amino acid sequences of mouse group V PLA2 (mVPLA2), hIIaPLA2 , and hIIaPLA2.

Styrene-divinylbenzene beads (5.2 Â± 0.3 Î¼m diameter) were purchased from Seradyn (Indianapolis, IN). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Bayer Inc. (Kankakee, IL). All restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and used without further purification. Recombinant hIIaPLA2 was prepared as described (10Snitko Y. Koduri R.

Mutagenesis was performed using the Sculptorin vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and a phagemid DNA prepared from the pSK vector in the presence of helper phage R408 as described previously (22Han S.-K.

Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as described previously (17Han S.-K. Yoon E.T. Cho W. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were lyophilized and stored at â20 Â°C. The purity of wild type and mutant proteins, assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, was consistently higher than 90%. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using BSA as standard. PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of polymerized mixed liposomes was carried out at 37 Â°C in 2 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 Î¼mpyrene-PE (1 mol %) inserted in 9.9 Î¼m BLPG, 2 Î¼m BSA, 0.16 m NaCl, and 10 mmCaCl2 (19Wu S.-K. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13902-13908Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Wu S.-K. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 378 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 345 nm. Spectral bandwidth was set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. Values of kcat*/Km* were determined from reaction progress curves as described previously (10Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of diC6PE monomers was performed with 0.5 mm phospholipid, 0.16m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2. The time course of phospholipid hydrolysis was monitored with a computer-controlled Metrom pH-stat (Brinkmann) in a thermostated vessel. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of diC6PE followed the first-order kinetics because the substrate concentrations remained lower than apparent Km. Thus, the values of apparent second-order rate constant, (kcat/Km)app, were calculated by dividing by the enzyme concentration the pseudo-first-order rate constants determined from the nonlinear least-squares analysis of reaction progress curves. Activity of PLA2 on zwitterionic vesicles was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [14C]SAPC hydrolysis. Typically, 20 Î¼l of [14C]SAPC solution in chloroform was dried in a glass vial with N2 and hydrated in 800 Î¼l of 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.16 m NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. After vortexing, the lipid suspension was sonicated for about 10 s, frozen in ethanol-dry ice bath, and sonicated again for â¼1 min to afford a homogenous small unilamellar vesicle solution. For assay, 50-Î¼l aliquots of [14C]SAPC vesicles (â¼10 Î¼m) solutions containing 15 Î¼m BSA were placed in Eppendorf tubes. Reactions were started by addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 10â20 nm and quenched by adding 370 Î¼l of ice-cold chloroform/methanol/HCl (2:1:0.01, v/v/v) solution after a given period of incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, 460 Î¼l of chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v/v), 240 Î¼l of chloroform, and 240 Î¼l of H2O were added and each reaction mixture was vortexed to extract the lipids into the organic phase. Liberated [14C]AA was separated from the reaction mixtures on small silica gel columns using petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) as an eluent. Solvents collected in scintillation vials were evaporated with N2 and replaced by 4 ml of scintillation mixture (Sigma), and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The binding affinity of PLA2 for sucrose-loaded polymerized BLPG liposomes was determined at 25 Â°C as described previously (10Snitko Y. Koduri R. Han S.-K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B.J. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The binding assay solution contained 100 Î¼m phospholipid and varying concentrations of PLA2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.145 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 1 Î¼m BSA. For the determination of PC membrane binding affinity, PC-coated styrene-divinylbenzene beads, which can be rapidly and completely separated from the solution by low speed centrifugation, were used instead of PC vesicles that typically have low pelleting efficiency (23Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding measurements with DHPC-coated beads were performed as described previously (24Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The binding assay solution contained 100â150 Î¼m phospholipid coated on beads and varying concentrations of PLA2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 mNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 Î¼m BSA. For both binding measurements, the concentration of free enzyme was determined by PLA2 activity assays using either pyrene-PE/BLPG polymerized mixed liposomes or [14C]SAPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol/1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol (10:9:1) vesicles as substrate, from which the bound enzyme concentration ([E]b) was calculated. Values ofn and Kd were determined by nonlinear least-squares analysis of the [E]b versus[E]o plot using Equation 1. [E]b=[E]o+Kd+[PL]o/nâ([E]o+Kd+[PL]o/n)2â4[E]o[PL]o[PL]o/n2Equation 1 [PL]o, and [E]o are total phospholipid and enzyme concentrations, respectively. This equation assumes that each enzyme binds independently to a site on the interface composed of n phospholipids with dissociation constant ofKd. Heparin-binding affinity of W79A and other mutants was measured using a HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to an AÌkta Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Typically, â¼40 Î¼g of hVPLA2 dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was loaded onto an 1-ml column that was equilibrated with the same buffer solution at 4 Â°C. The column was then eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0â0.7 m KCl in the same buffer. The enzyme fractions were monitored by a PLA2 activity assay using [14C]SAPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol/1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol (10:9:1) vesicles as substrate as described above. The concentration of KCl that gives rise to a protein peak was determined for each protein as an average of duplicate measurements. Human neutrophils were prepared from heparinized venous blood collected from medication-free donors according to the method by Hansel et al. (25Hansel T.T. de Vries I.J.M. Iff T. Rihs S. Wandzilak M. Betz S. Blaser K. Walker C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 145: 105-110Crossref Scopus (566) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 30 ml of heparinized blood was diluted with the equal volume of calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), layered over 15 ml of 1.089 g/ml Percoll and centrifuged for 20 min at 900 Ã g. The supernatant and the mononuclear cells at the interface were aspirated carefully, and the inside wall of the tube was wiped with sterile gauze to remove mononuclear cells attached to the wall. To the pellet of neutrophils and erythrocytes was added 20 ml of ice-cold water and the suspension was mixed gently for 30 s, after which 20 ml of 2Ã HBSS was added. If the erythrocytes remained, then the procedure was repeated. After the lysis of erythrocytes, neutrophils were washed once in HBSS plus 0.2% BSA, and the total cell count was determined with a Coulter counter. The resulting cell population consisted of >95% neutrophils, as estimated by differential counts of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospin preparations. Radiolabeling of neutrophils was achieved by incubating the cells (107) with 0.5 Ci/ml [3H]AA for 90 min at 37 Â°C. Unincorporated [3H]AA was removed by washing the cells with HBSS plus 0.2% BSA. Double labeling of neutrophils with [3H]AA (0.5 Ci/ml) and [14C]OA (0.5 Ci/ml) was performed in the same manner. The labeled cells were resuspended in HBSS plus 0.2% BSA (106 cells/90 Î¼l) and incubated with 0.1 Î¼mPLA2 at 37 Â°C for a given period (30 min for routine assays). The reaction was quenched by centrifugation, and the supernatants were removed and their radioactivity (3H and14C) was measured by two-channel liquid scintillation counting. For the measurements of leukotriene production from neutrophils, cells (1 Ã 106 cells/ml) were incubated at 37 Â°C in 250 Î¼l of HBSS containing CaCl2 (1.2 mm) and 0.1 Î¼m PLA2. Control cells were treated with HBSS. Thereafter cells were centrifuged at 8000 g for 2 min. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release was determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Typically, LTB4 secretion reached a maximal value within 20 min of incubation under our experimental conditions. The maximal value for each incubation mixture was then corrected for a background signal from control cells. Neutrophils (2 Ã 106 cells per experiment) were treated with 0.3 Î¼m hVPLA2for various periods, and the incubation was quenched by centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g for 10 s. After repeatedly (more than three) washing, the pellets with HBSS containing 0.5 mNaCl, the pellet was then lysed in 70 Î¼l of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid. After 10 min on ice, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 Ãg for 20 min to remove cell debris. The supernatants were then mixed with 14 Î¼l of gel loading buffer (0.125 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue), and the mixtures were boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing condition, using 16% acrylamide gels. The electrotransfer of proteins from the gels to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was achieved using a semidry system (200 mA, 120 min). The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA for 60 min, then incubated with 2 Î¼g/ml of anti-hVPLA2monoclonal antibody 3G1 (26MunÌoz N.M. Kim K. Han S.-K. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Sano H. Zhu X. Cho W. Leff A.R. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) diluted in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight. The membranes were washed three times for 20 min with TBS-T. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was diluted 1:3000 in TBS-T and incubated with polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 60 min. The membrane was again washed three times with TBS-T and assayed with an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Neutrophils were re-suspended in HBSS at a density of 5 Ã 105 cells/ml. 300 Î¼l of neutrophils in HBSS were placed into each of eight wells on a sterile Nuncâ¢ chambered cover glass and incubated at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2 for 45 min. After incubation, the chambers were washed twice with 37 Â°C HBSS to remove any nonadherent neutrophils. W79A and W79A/R100/101A were diluted to 0.3 Î¼m (final concentration) in HBSS supplemented with 1.3 mmCaCl2, and overlaid onto the neutrophils in the appropriate wells. Neutrophils were incubated with enzyme for 10, 20, 30, and 40 min in a 37 Â°C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator. At the specified time, the enzyme was removed, the cells were washed once with HBSS containing 1.3 mm CaCl2, and then were fixed at room temperature with 0.4% p-benzoquinone in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. After fixation, the neutrophils were washed four times with PBS and were placed in blocking solution (10% normal goat serum and 100 Î¼m goat IgG/ml in PBS) at 4 Â°C overnight. Then, the monoclonal antibodies to hVPLA2 (26MunÌoz N.M. Kim K. Han S.-K. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Sano H. Zhu X. Cho W. Leff A.R. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were diluted to 2 Î¼g/ml in PBS and applied to the cells. After 1-h incubation at room temperature, the antibodies were removed, and the cells were washed six times in PBS. Secondary antibody, Alexa568 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), was applied for 1/2 h at room temperature. Neutrophils were washed six times with PBS, and imaged in PBS immediately. Imaging was done with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate background autofluorescence contributions. hVPLA2 is a basic protein (isoelectric point > 9.0) with eight lysines and seven arginines. A model structure of hVPLA2 built on the basis of homology to hIIaPLA2 is illustrated in Fig.3. The structure suggests that some cationic residues, including Lys6, Lys11, Arg34, Lys74, and Arg76, might be located on its putative interfacial binding surface, whereas others, including Arg100, Lys101, Lys107, Arg108, and Arg111, might form a cationic patch on the opposite face. To determine the roles of these residues in the interaction of hVPLA2 with cell membranes, we mutated these cationic residues to glutamate. We also mutated a catalytic residue, His48, to Ala to generate a catalytically inactive mutant. Initial attempts to prepare these mutants were hampered by extremely low refolding efficiency of solubilized inclusion bodies. To overcome this difficulty, we used W79A of hVPLA2, which was shown to be as active as wild type but much more stable than wild type (18Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R.

All these mutants (e.g.K6E/W79A) were expressed in high yields as inclusion bodies and their refolding yields were uniformly high (i.e. >2 mg/liter of culture after purification). To determine the effects of mutations on the enzymatic activities of hVPLA2, we measured the activities of mutants on three types of phospholipid substrates, a short-chain phospholipid diC6PE, anionic polymerized mixed liposomes, and zwitterionic [14C]SAPC vesicles. Since the concentration of diC6PE used in this study (0.5 mm) is well below the critical micelle concentration for this short-chain phospholipid (27Yuan W. Quinn D.M. Sigler P.B. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6082-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), diC6PE would exist as a soluble monomer. Although one cannot preclude the possibility of enzyme-substrate microaggregate formation (28Rogers J., Yu, B.Z. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6056-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the relative activity of mutants determined under these conditions should thus reflect the relative catalytic efficiency of their active sites. As summarized in TableI, a majority of mutants showed activities comparable to that of W79A (and wild type hVPLA2), which indicated the intactness of their active sites. However, three mutants, R34E/W79A, K74E/W79A, and W79A/K107E/R108E, exhibited less than 35% of wild type activity, suggesting that these mutations somehow disrupt catalytic steps of hVPLA2. Since none of these residues are in close proximity to the active site in the model structure, their deactivating effects might derive from indirect steric or electrostatic interactions with the active site residues, as seen with the mutations of other sPLA2s (10Snitko Y.

We have identified the protein binding sequence in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR and determined its functionality. The protein-binding element was identified by binding, competition, and antisense oligonucleotide interference. The sequence was preserved among species suggesting its importance. To study its functionality in the context of another RNA, a 63-base pair cDNA PTH sequence was fused to the growth hormone(GH) gene. There is no parathyroid (PT) cell line and therefore an in vitro degradation assay was used to determine the stability of transcripts for PTH, GH, and a chimeric GH-PTH 63 nucleotides with PT cytosolic proteins. The full-length PTH transcript was stabilized by PT proteins from rats fed a low calcium diet and destabilized by proteins from rats fed a low phosphate diet, correlating with PTH mRNA levels in vivo. These PT proteins did not affect the native GH transcript. However, the chimeric GH transcript was stabilized by low calcium PT proteins and destabilized by low phosphate PT proteins, similar to the PTH full-length transcript. Therefore, we have identified a PTH RNA-protein binding region and shown that it is sufficient to confer responsiveness to calcium and phosphate in a reporter gene. This defined element in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR is necessary and sufficient for the regulation of PTH mRNA stability by calcium and phosphate.

The PTH cDNA consists of three exons coding for the 5â²-UTR (exon I), the prepro region of PTH (exon II), and the structural hormone together with the 3â²-UTR (exon III) (10Hendy G.N.

Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 3â²-UTR is 42% conserved between human and rat, while the coding region is 78% conserved at the nt level (11Kemper B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have shown that cytosolic proteins from PTs bind to the 3â²-UTR of the rat PTH mRNA (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PT proteins from hypocalcemic rats show increased binding to the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR by mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays and this protein-RNA binding is decreased with hypophosphatemic PT proteins. Thus the level of protein-RNA binding directly correlates with PTH mRNA levels. Since there is no PT cell line, an in vitro PTH RNA stability assay was utilized. This assay showed stabilization of the PTH transcript by hypocalcemic PT proteins and marked instability with PT hypophosphatemic proteins (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A PTH transcript that did not include the 3â²-UTR was not degraded by PT proteins in this assay. These studies indicate that there are instability regions in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR that are protected by RNA-binding proteins. We have recently identified two proteins that bind the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Epstein E. Sela-Brown A. Ringel I. Kilav R. King S.M. Benashski S.E. Yisraeli J.K. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One protein, AUF1, was identified by affinity chromatography and was shown to stabilize the PTH transcript in an in vitro degradation assay with PT proteins (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In other RNAs such as proto-oncogenes and cytokines, that have a short half-life, AUF1 is associated with destabilization of the transcripts (14Buzby J.S. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A second protein, dynein light chain (Mr 8000) or LC8 was identified by expression cloning and was shown to mediate the binding of the PTH mRNA to microtubules (13Epstein E. Sela-Brown A. Ringel I. Kilav R. King S.M. Benashski S.E. Yisraeli J.K. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). LC8 may have a role in the intracellular localization of PTH mRNA in the PT cell rather than in the stability of PTH mRNA. We have now identified the minimal protein binding sequence in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR by binding assays, competition experiments, and oligonucleotide binding interference analysis. To demonstrate the functionality of this sequence 63 base pairs of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR which included the 26-nt protein-binding element and 5â²- and 3â²-flanking nt were inserted into the GH gene. Usingin vitro degradation assays with cytosolic extracts from parathyroid glands we demonstrated that this element altered GH mRNA stability. The 63-nt element also reduced the stability of a random transcript of the pCRII polylinker, in contrast to a truncated element inserted into the polylinker which did not bind PT proteins. In addition, inserting the 63-nt binding sequence into GH RNA conferred responsiveness of the chimeric transcript to PT proteins from low calcium and low phosphate rats, similar to the effects of these proteins on the full-length native PTH transcript. These results demonstrate that the protein-binding region in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR is sufficient to determine PTH mRNA stability in response to changes in serum calcium and phosphate. Weanling male Sabra rats were fed a normal calcium (0.6%), normal phosphate (0.3%) diet; a low calcium (0.02%), normal phosphate (0.3%) diet; or a low phosphate (0.02%), normal calcium (0.6%) diet (Teklad, IL) for 3 weeks. At 3 weeks the thyroparathyroid tissue was removed under pentobarbital anesthesia and blood samples were taken for serum calcium and phosphate. The low calcium diet resulted in a serum calcium of 4.6 Â± 0.4 mg/dl (control = 11.2 Â± 0.3 mg/dl). The low phosphate diet resulted in a serum phosphate of 4.0 Â± 0.6 mg/dl (control = 9.8 Â± 0.7 mg/dl) and serum calcium of 12.4 Â± 0.8 mg/dl. Cytoplasmic thyroparathyroid proteins (S100) for protein-RNA binding were extracted by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (15Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Tissues were removed from the rats and immediately washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The tissue was homogenized in 5 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 600 Ã g for 10 min (4 Â°C) the supernatant was carefully decanted, mixed with 0.1 volumes of buffer B containing 0.3 m HEPES, 1.4m KCl, and 0.03 m MgCl2, and centrifuged (4 Â°C) at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h (Beckman Type TL-100). For RNA degradation assays the S100 fraction was prepared as previously described (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) by homogenizing the tissue in 2 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2. 0.1 Volume of the extraction buffer (1.5 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT, was added and the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 Ã g for 2 min to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Cytoplasmic extracts were immediately frozen at â80 Â°C in aliquots. Protein concentration was determined by O.D. densitometry (595 Î¼m wavelength) using a Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Labeled and unlabeled RNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids using an RNA production kit (Promega, WI) and the appropriate RNA polymerases. The specific activity of the RNA probe was 0.5â1.0 Ã 106 cpm/ng. For competition experiments unlabeled RNA was transcribed similarly in the presence of 1 mm each of the four nucleotides. The unlabeled RNAs were quantified by visualization on a 2% agarose gel. A linearized plasmid construct containing the full-length PTH cDNA in Bluescript KS (Invitrogen, CA) was used as previously described (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For the 3â²-UTR of the PTH cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction product (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, CA) (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transcripts of 100, 63, 50, and 40 nt (Fig. 1 A) were transcribed from polymerase chain reaction products that were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, WI) (fragment for the 40 and 30 nt) or pCRII (Invitrogen, CA) (fragments for the 100, 63, 50, and 38 nt). For the constructs for transcription of the 100-, 63-, and 50-nt transcripts, polymerase chain reaction was performed with the same 5â² oligonucleotide: GTCTCTTCCAATGAT. The 3â² oligonucleotide for the 100-nt construct was TTCATGATCATTAAACTTTA, for the 63 nt, AAGTGGAAATGTGTAATACTTTAA, and for the 50 nt, TAATACTTTAAAAAGAAGAATATATTG. For the 40-nt transcript polymerase chain reaction was performed with the 5â² oligonucleotide, AATGATTCCATTTCAATAT, and the 3â² oligonucleotide, AATACTTTAAAAGAAG. For the transcript of 38 nt the corresponding cDNA was excised from the pCRII 63-nt construct and subcloned into pCRII. The transcript of 30 and 26 nt (Fig. 1 A) were prepared from annealed sense and antisense oligonucleotides that were constructed to include the T3 RNA polymerase sequence (underlined). For the 30-nt the sense oligonucleotide wasATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGACATTTCAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATT, and the antisense oligonucleotide was AATACTTTAAAAAGAAGAATATATTGAAATG. For the 26 nt the sense oligonucleotide wasATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGACAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATTA, and the antisense oligonucleotide was TAATACTTTAAAAAGAAGAATATATTG. For the calcium-sensing receptor 3â²-UTR, we subcloned the 3â²-UTR into Bluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a fragment obtained by restriction of the BoPCaRI cDNA in pSPORT (2Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert J. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) withNotI and SmaI, as previously described (13Epstein E. Sela-Brown A. Ringel I. Kilav R. King S.M. Benashski S.E. Yisraeli J.K. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Labeled RNA transcripts (10,000 cpm) spanning different regions of the PTH 3â²-UTR RNA were incubated with S100 thyroparathyroid extracts (10 Î¼g), in a final volume of 20 Î¼l containing 4 Î¼g of tRNA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT (binding buffer) for 10 min at at 4 Â°C. In some experiments RNase T1 (Sigma) was added for further 10 min at room temperature to a final concentration of 30 units/Î¼l to digest unprotected RNA. Addition of heparin (5 mg/ml) did not affect binding and the size of the complex. For competition experiments unlabeled RNA was added as indicated. The specificity of binding was further demonstrated by the addition of unlabeled nonrelated transcripts. The samples were run for 3 h on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide, 70:1) in a cold room. RNA-protein binding was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. UV cross-linking assays were performed as previously described (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) using 10 Î¼g of S100 thyroparathyroid extracts and 32P-labeled RNA transcripts of the full-length or parts of the 3â²-UTR of the PTH cDNA in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 3 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mg/ml heparin to eliminate nonspecific binding. After UV cross-linking, the samples were digested by RNase A, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. The antisense oligonucleotides used are shown in Fig. 4 A. Corresponding sense oligonucleotides were also synthesized. For binding interference experiments antisense oligonucleotides (200 pmol) were mixed with the radiolabeled RNA, heated to 80 Â°C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to 25 Â°C, before addition of protein extract and REMSA. In some experiments preincubation of the RNA and oligonucleotides was performed without heating of the RNA. In other experiments annealed double-strand DNAs were added instead of the antisense oligonucleotides. The 63-base pair DNA corresponding to the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR 63-nt transcript (Fig. 1 A) was inserted into the SmaI site of the pS16-GH that contained the S16 ribosomal protein promoter linked to theGH structural gene lacking GH promoter sequences (16Levy S. Avni D. Hariharan N. Perry R.P. Meyuhas O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The control was the same plasmid without the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR 63-base pair DNA. The GH DNA with and without the PTH sequence was subcloned into Bluescript KS (Invitrogen, CA) to transcribe RNA. Preparation of S100 PT protein extracts for the RNA degradation assay and the assay itself were performed as before (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). 0.2 Ã 106 cpm transcripts of PTH, GH, or the chimeric GH/PTH 63-nt RNAs were incubated with 10â20 Î¼g of PT cytoplasmic extracts and 80 units/ml RNasin (Promega, WI) and at timed intervals samples were removed and extracted by Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati OH). The labeled RNAs from each sample were run on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and autoradiographed (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The remaining undegraded transcripts at the different time points were quantified by densitometry. To measure the effect of PTH sequences in the pCRII polylinker transcript, EcoRV-linearized pCRII plasmids containing the 63 or 38 nt of the PTH 3â²-UTR as described above, or the unmodified pCRII polylinker were used to transcribe RNA with the Sp6 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcripts contained â¼100 nt corresponding to the polylinker plus the additional PTH sequences (Fig.6 A). They were analyzed by in vitro degradation with PT proteins. PT cytosolic proteins specifically bind the full-length PTH mRNA transcript and a transcript for the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR. To identify the protein binding sequence in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR we analyzed the binding of PT proteins to smaller RNA transcripts of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR (Fig.1 A). Uniformly labeled transcripts were incubated with PT cytosolic extract and the mixture resolved on native polyacrylamide gels for REMSA. The free probe for all transcripts ran as two major bands. These bands may represent secondary structures of the RNA, because denaturing the RNA at 80 Â°C followed by slow renaturation at room temperature resulted in a single band on polyacrylamide gel. This renatured probe showed the same binding to PT proteins as the untreated transcript (not shown). The transcripts used for mapping the minimal protein binding element in the PTH 3â²-UTR are shown in Fig. 1 A. Transcripts of 174 and 38 nt that excluded the 60-terminal nt of the 3â²-UTR did not bind proteins. A transcript of 234 nt consisting of the full-length UTR and transcripts of 100 (Fig. 1 B), 63, 50, and 40 nt (not shown) of the 3â²-UTR showed a large protein-RNA complex on REMSA with PT proteins (Fig. 1 B). This complex was reduced to a smaller complex after RNase T1 digestion of the bound protein RNA samples (Fig.1 B). Similar results were obtained when a transcript for the full-length PTH mRNA was analyzed (not shown). Transcripts of 30 (not shown) and 26 nt formed only the smaller protein-RNA complexes with or without treatment with RNase T1 (Fig. 1 B) and the larger RNA-protein complex was not formed. These results show that a transcript of 40 nt was necessary for the formation of the larger protein-RNA complex that was obtained when the full-length PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR transcript was analyzed. A 26-nt element was sufficient for protein binding and formed a complex that was similar to the complex formed with larger transcripts after treatment with RNase T1. Therefore, additional nucleotides in the 5â² of this element were necessary for formation of the larger complex that was formed in the absence of RNase T1. PT protein binding to these smaller transcripts (100, 63, and 40 nt) was increased by hypocalcemia and decreased by hypophosphatemia (Fig. 2), as with the full-length PTH transcript in our previous results (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the regulation of binding is preserved with the smaller transcripts. Further experiments were performed to confirm the minimal binding element. To demonstrate the specificity of the binding of PT proteins to the protein-binding element we used competitor RNAs from overlapping regions of the 3â²-UTR. Fig. 3 shows a representative REMSA that demonstrates the binding of PT cytosolic proteins to the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR. Addition of excess unlabeled RNA transcript for the 3â²-UTR that did not include the terminal 60-nucleotide of the 3â²-UTR (Fig. 3, transcript A) did not compete for binding of PT proteins to the PTH 3â²-UTR. However, excess transcript of the 26-nt element or of 63 nt that included the 26-nt binding element (Fig. 3, transcripts B and C) both competed for protein binding to the 3â²-UTR. Excess of an unrelated transcript for the 3â²-UTR of the calcium-sensing receptor mRNA (Fig. 3, transcript D), which is also expressed in the PT, did not compete for binding. Addition of heparin had no effect on complex formation (not shown). These results demonstrate the specificity of the protein-RNA interaction and indicate that the 26-nt transcript was sufficient to compete for the binding of PT proteins to the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR. To further characterize the protein binding element in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR we designed short single stranded antisense DNA oligonucleotides complimentary to portions of the 3â²-UTR and analyzed their effect on protein-RNA binding by REMSA and UV cross-linking analysis. Fig.4 A shows the sequence of the 100 terminal nt of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR including the 26 nt of the proposed protein-binding element and the antisense oligonucleotides used for the binding interference experiments. A representative REMSA for the binding of cytosolic PT proteins to the 3â²-UTR transcript that had been preincubated with different antisense oligonucleotides is shown in Fig. 4 B. The antisense oligonucleotides were annealed to the labeled 3â²-UTR transcript that had been heated to 80 Â°C to unfold secondary structures in the RNA. PT protein extracts were then added and protein binding analyzed. Corresponding double-stranded DNAs were used as controls. Fig. 4 B shows the 3â²-UTR transcript after RNase T1 treatment and the protein-RNA complexes formed after addition of PT cytosolic extracts followed by RNase treatment. Preincubation of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR transcript with antisense oligonucleotides 1, 2, and 6 (Fig. 4 A) that did not span the protein binding sequences had no effect on protein binding (Fig. 4 B). Preincubation with oligonucleotides spanning the 26-nt element or part of this sequence with or without 3â²-flanking sequences (oligonucleotides 3, 4, and 5 in Fig.4 A) abolished the binding of PT proteins to the 3â²-UTR (Fig.4 B). Corresponding sense or double-stranded DNAs had no effect on protein-RNA complex formation (not shown). The effect of antisense oligonucleotides on PT protein binding to the PTH RNA 3â²-UTR was also analyzed by UV cross-linking experiments. In this assay RNA-binding proteins from cytosolic extracts are cross-linked to labeled transcript in solution and complexes resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4 C shows that 3 cross-linked protein-RNA complexes of â¼110, 60, and 50 kDa were formed when a transcript for the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR was analyzed with PT protein extracts, as in our previous reports (9Moallem E.

When the transcript was denatured at 80 Â°C and preincubated with the antisense oligonucleotides the same inhibitory effect of the oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding region on protein binding was observed (Fig. 4 C), similar to the REMSA (Fig. 4 B). When the same UV cross-linking experiment was performed without denaturing the RNA by heating to 80 Â°C there was no effect of preincubation of the RNA with any of the oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 C). In addition, when there was no preheating of the RNA, the relevant oligonucleotides did not interfere with binding also by REMSA (not shown). Together, these results indicate that the protein-binding recognition site of the 3â²-UTR includes the element of 26 nt and that this region plays a role in protein-RNA binding. Moreover, the interference of binding only after unfolding the RNA at 80 Â°C suggests that protein binding to this region is dependent on secondary structures in the RNA. Sequence analysis of the 26-nt element in the PTH mRNA revealed high conservation of the rat element in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR to mouse (23 of 26 nt), human (19 of 26 nt), and canine (19 of 26 nt), with human and canine being identical (TableI). Such conservation of this sequence that lies outside of the coding region, among different species, suggests a functional role for this element.Table IThe 26-nt protein-binding element in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR is conserved among speciesRatAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATTAMurineAATATGCTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTACTAHumanTATTGTTTATTCTTTTTAAAGTATGTCanineTATTGTTTATTCTTTTTAAAGTATGT Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that the protein-binding region has a role in determining mRNA stability and response to calcium and phosphate, we inserted the fragment for the 63 nt of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR, which contains the 26-nt element (Fig.1 A), into the structural gene of human growth hormone (GH). This is shown schematically in Fig.5 A. We used these constructs to study whether this inserted 63-nt sequence affected GH mRNA stability in an in vitro degradation assay with PT proteins of rats fed normal, low calcium, or low phosphate diets. The in vitro degradation assay reflects the post-transcriptional regulation of PTH mRNA stability in vivo in response to changes in calcium and phosphate. A low calcium diet increases PTH mRNA levels in vivo and PT proteins from these rats stabilized the full-length PTH transcript using the in vitro degradation assay (Fig. 5 B, upper panel, and Ref. 9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A low phosphate diet decreases PTH mRNA levels and led to rapid degradation of the PTH transcript by PT proteins from these rats (Fig. 5 B, upper panel, and Ref. 9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the effect of the PTH mRNA 63-nt protein binding sequence on GH mRNA degradation in the presence of these PT proteins. With PT proteins from rats fed a normal diet, the chimeric GH transcript containing 63 nt of the PTH 3â²-UTR was degraded more rapidly than the native GH transcript (t12 = 130 min: >180 min) (Fig. 5 B, middle and bottom panels, normal diet). This suggests that this element is an instability element. We then studied the effect of PT proteins from hypocalcemic or hypophosphatemic rats on degradation of the GH transcripts. When the transcript for the native GH mRNA was analyzed with PT proteins from the different diets, there was no effect on native GH degradation (Fig. 5 B, middle panel). In contrast, the chimeric GH transcript was stabilized by PT proteins from low calcium rats and more rapidly degraded with PT proteins of low phosphate rats (t 12 > 180 min:30 min) (Fig. 5, B, bottom panel, and C), similar to the full-length PTH transcript (Fig. 5 B, top panel). Therefore the protein binding sequences in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR were sufficient to confer responsiveness to changes in PT proteins induced by dietary calcium and phosphate to another mRNA that itself was not regulated by calcium and phosphate. To determine the specificity of the effect of the protein-binding region, the protein-binding segment of 63 nt was inserted into a random sequence, the pCRII polylinker. In addition a shorter PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR RNA of 38 nt, that itself did not bind PT proteins (Fig.1 A) was also inserted at the same site into the pCRII polylinker (Fig. 6 A). The stability of the polylinker and chimeric RNAs was determined in thein vitro degradation assay with PT proteins. The PTH mRNA 63 nt was recognized and cleaved more rapidly by the PT extract (t 12 = 10 Â± 2 min, n= 3) than the RNA without the PTH mRNA insert (t 12 = 35 Â± 5 min, n = 3) (Fig. 6). Insertion of the shorter PTH RNA 38 nt did not destabilize the chimeric transcript (t 12 = 40 Â± 5 min,n = 3). These results suggest that the PTH 63-nt RNA destabilized the random RNA sequence of pCRII. This effect was similar to the effect of the 63 nt when it was inserted into a larger transcript, GH RNA, representing a cellular mRNA. The destabilizing effect was dependent on an intact protein-binding transcript, because a shorter transcript that disrupted protein binding did not have the same effect. We have identified by gel shift binding, competition experiments, and the use of single-strand antisense oligonucleotides the minimal sequence of 26 nt for protein binding in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR. Unlike gel shifts, UV cross-linking identified 40 nt as the smallest binding transcript and not the 26- or 30-nt transcripts. The 26 and 30 nt are part of the 40-nt binding transcript. It is not readily evident why the 26-nt element was not sufficient for protein binding by UV cross-linking. However, protein-RNA binding analysis by REMSA utilizes a native PAGE after incubating protein and RNA and therefore may be more physiological than denaturing gels of UV cross-linked RNA-protein complexes. Single-strand antisense oligonucleotides spanning the 26-nt core binding element, or parts of it, interfered with the binding of PT proteins to the 3â²-UTR both by REMSA and UV cross-linking. The antisense data together with the competition experiments with the 26-nt element show that the 26-nt element is important for binding. It is possible that the larger sequence of 40 nt may represent the required sequence for protein-RNA interaction, with the 26 nt representing the core element. We have previously shown that PT proteins from rats fed a low calcium diet, where there is a marked increase in PTH mRNA levels, have increased binding to the PTH mRNA full-length and 3â²-UTR transcripts. In contrast, PT proteins from rats fed a low phosphate diet where there is decrease in PTH mRNA levels, have decreased binding (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have now shown that protein binding to shorter transcripts (100, 63, and 40 nt) was also regulated by the different diets by UV cross-linking (Fig. 2). The binding of PT proteins to the 26-nt transcript by REMSA was similarly regulated by calcium and phosphate (not shown). These results demonstrate that the smaller transcripts retain the properties of the previously characterized full-length transcript (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The rat PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR is 234 nt long. Sequence analysis of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR of different species revealed a preservation of the 26-nt core protein-binding element in rat, murine, human, and canine 3â²-UTRs. In particular, there is a stretch of 14 nt within the element that is present in all four species. In the 26-nt element, the identity among the species varies between 73 and 89%. For instance, the human and rat are 73% identical in the 26-nt element, and only 42% identical in their 3â²-UTR (11Kemper B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The canine and rat are 73% identical in their 26-nt element and 50% identical in their 3â²-UTR (17Rosol T.J. Steinmeyer C.L. McCauley L.K. Grone A. DeWille J.W. Capen C.C. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 160: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The human and canine are 100% identical in the 26 nt of the element and only 70% identical in their 3â²-UTR. Comparison of the 26-nt sequence in rat and mouse showed 89% identity, however, their 3â²-UTRs show a comparable degree of identity. All in all, this analysis suggests that the binding element may represent a functional unit that has been evolutionarily conserved, but sequencing of the 3â²-UTR in many other species is needed to establish this conclusion. One of the PT cytosolic proteins involved in the stabilization of the PTH transcript was identified by affinity chromatography to the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR as AUF1 (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays showed that recombinant AUF1 bound the full-length, 3â²-UTR (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and shorter transcripts including the 26-nt core element. 2R. Kilav, J. Silver, and T. Naveh-Many, unpublished data. There is no PT cell line and therefore PTH mRNA stability was measured by an in vitro degradation assay with rat PT proteins (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recombinant AUF1 stabilized the PTH transcript in the in vitro degradation assay with PT proteins (12Sela-Brown A. Silver J. Brewer G. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7424-7429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To study functionality of the protein-binding region, we used the 63-nt sequence to create a chimeric transcript. We inserted a 63-base pair fragment of the PTH 3â²-UTR into the structural gene of humanGH. The RNA transcribed from this chimeric gene includes the 26-nt core element within the 63 nt of the PTH-binding region. We then studied the effect of the protein-binding region to confer PTH-like responsiveness to calcium and phosphate on a heterologous gene. There is no PT cell line and therefore, to study the effect of the PTH 3â²-UTR element on RNA decay, we performed in vitro degradation assays with cytosolic proteins from PT glands. With PT proteins, the chimeric transcript was less stable than the native GH transcript indicating that in this assay, with PT proteins the 63-nt element was an instability element. Furthermore, the chimeric GH mRNA transcript containing the 63 nt of the PTH mRNA responded to PT proteins from low calcium and phosphate similar to the PTH mRNA. Therefore, the 63-nt protein-binding region of the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR is both necessary and sufficient to regulate RNA stability and to confer responsiveness to changes in PT proteins by calcium and phosphate. To document a correlation between protein-binding and RNA stability, the 63-nt protein-binding region or a shorter sequence of 38 nt that did not bind PT proteins were inserted into a random transcript of pCRII polylinker. The stability of these transcripts and the transcript of the original polylinker were then studied in the in vitrodegradation assay with PT proteins from normal rats. The chimeric transcript was destabilized by the 63-nt insert and not by the truncated insert. This indicates that the 63-nt binding element also functions as an instability element in a random sequence. Moreover, the lack of effect of the truncated transcript indicates that a sequence, which binds PT proteins is necessary for the degradatory function in another RNA. A random transcript of a polylinker had been used by others to show that the ribonuclease cleavage site in the Î±-globin 3â²-UTR could be conferred to a heterologous RNA (18Wang Z. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the 63 nt on RNA stability was dependent upon an intact protein-binding region both with the native PTH RNA (9Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) as well as in the heterologous RNAs. Increasing evidence demonstrates that mRNA decay is an actively regulated process that determines gene expression. This process involves trans-acting protein factors that interact with specific cis-elements in a mRNA and under different physiological conditions leads to rapid decay or stability. Defined elements in mRNAs bind specific RNA-binding proteins and have been shown to mediate in addition to RNA stability, subcellular localization and RNA translation (19Wilhelm J.E. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 20Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The information encoded by such elements in the RNA can be packaged as primary sequences and secondary or tertiary structures or a combination of both. cis-Elements that determine mRNA stability or instability have been determined in a number of mRNAs. The primary sequence of some of thesecis-acting elements is highly conserved among species (21Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 257-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A well defined example is the adenosine uridine-rich element. Repeats of this AUUUA pentamer in the 3â²-UTR of mRNAs of various cytokines targeted them for rapid decay by their interaction with cytoplasmictrans-factors (22Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the brains of Alzheimer's patients there are increased levels of Î²-amyloid protein and often the amyloid precursor protein mRNA as well (21Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 257-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A 29-base element in the 3â²-UTR has been defined that is bound bytrans-factors and determines the amyloid precursor protein mRNA decay (21Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 257-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The iron response element is another well definedcis-element. This element in the ferritin 5â²-UTR controls translation of this mRNA and in the transferrin receptor mRNA it is present in multiple iterations where it regulates mRNA stability (24Klausner R.D. Rouault T.R. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 25Schlegl J. Gegout V. Schlager B. Hentze M.W. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Romby P. RNA. 1997; 3: 1159-1172PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified a novelcis-element in the PTH mRNA 3â²-UTR that determines PTH mRNA stability in response to changes in serum calcium and phosphate.

Although ganglioside sialylation is known to be important, the mechanism of inhibition is unknown.

The role of gangliosides, which are localized to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, is largely unknown, but studies with cultured keratinocytes and keratinocyte-derived cells suggest that gangliosides are involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion (10Paller A.S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 1982; 141: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although these early studies showed that the terminal sialic acid residues of gangliosides were critical for the inhibitory effect, the mechanism of inhibition was unclear. More than 10 years later, our laboratory used cultured keratinocytes and keratinocyte-derived cell lines to demonstrate that the inhibition of migration and adhesion by ganglioside GT1b is specific to plating on a FN matrix and is competitively inhibited by RGDS peptide (11Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Chen J.D. Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that ganglioside may abrogate the interaction between Î±5Î²1 and FN. SCC13 and HaCaT cells, keratinocyte-derived cell lines with diminished expression of Î±5Î²1 in comparison with normal keratinocytes and SCC12 cells, are not inhibited by GT1b in their binding and migration on FN. The demonstration that treatment of HaCaT cells with transforming growth factor-Î²1 not only increases the expression of Î±5Î²1, but also restores the responsiveness to the inhibitory effects of ganglioside further supports a putative interaction between GT1b and Î±5Î²1 (13Sung C.-C.

The possibility of a direct interaction between GT1b and Î±5Î²1 as the mechanism for ganglioside action and its relevance for keratinocyte function have not been explored. Using recombinant and affinity-purified forms of Î±5Î²1 and novel binding techniques, we provide evidence that GT1b binds directly to the extracellular domain of the Î±5 subunit through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, thereby inhibiting the interaction of Î±5Î²1 with FN. SCC12F2 (SCC12) cells, a generous gift from James Rheinwald (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Insect Sf9 cells were grown in TNM-FH serum-free medium (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and Escherichia colicells were grown in LB medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gangliosides were extracted from SCC12 cell membranes using chloroform/methanol as previously described (17Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Robinson J.K. Bremer E.G. J. Invest.

The aqueous phase was separated and desalted, and the bands of gangliosides were separated by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water with 0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10, v/v/v). Gangliosides were detected by resorcinol staining. Band density was quantified by a Storm 800 fluorescence PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The identity of the four bands of ganglioside was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-GM3 antibody (courtesy of T.

Binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Several human recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 integrins were generated using both baculoviral and E. coli systems and vectors with an N-terminal histidine tag that allowed cleavage or a C-terminal His tag that could not be cleaved. For generating Î±5 integrin in insect cells with an N-terminal cleavable His tag, the pAcHLT-C vector was cleaved by concurrent incubation with StuI and SacI. The Î±5 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number 06256; courtesy of Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) (18Gianotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

BaculoGold virus DNA (Pharmingen) was mixed with the recombinant Î±5 or Î²1 plasmid DNA and transfected into insect cells following the manufacturer's instructions. For generating recombinant integrins in both the insect system and E. coli with a C-terminal non-cleavable His tag, Î±5 cDNA was cleaved by SalI and HindIII, and the SalI end was blunted-ended.

The Î±5- or Î²1-containing plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) was transferred into E. coli cells following the manufacturer's instructions or cotransfected with BaculoGold virus DNA into insect cells. The recombinant proteins from both insect cells and E. coli supernatants were purified by passage over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. After purification, the N-terminal His tag was removed from Î±5 or Î²1 from insect cells, unless desired for use in the nickel-agarose binding (NAB) technique. Thrombin (Pharmingen) was added to the protein at a ratio of 1 unit of thrombin to 10 Î¼g of integrin subunit protein, run on a Sephacryl S-200HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, following the manufacturer's instructions. The C-terminal His tags were retained on the E. coli and insect cell integrin proteins. To make recombinant Î±5Î²1 complexes, Î±5 and Î²1 subunits were combined in a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence of 30 Î¼m CaCl2. The identity of the purified recombinant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. The purified recombinant proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), and 10 ng/lane was applied to an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% dry milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 137 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. Lanes were treated with 50 ng/ml anti-Î±5 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), 100 ng/ml anti-Î²1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), or 250 ng/ml anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 1 h, and bands were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. Intact integrin Î±5Î²1was purified from SCC12 cells by affinity chromatography on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) coupled to RGD polymer and anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody as a modification of the previously described techniques (20Koyama T. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25939-25944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RGD polymer (5 mg/ml of gel) was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. SCC12 cells were lysed (20Koyama T. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25939-25944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the lysate was poured over the RGD column. After elution, the integrin bound to RGD polymer was further purified by affinity chromatography with anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column as described above for RGD polymer. Fractions were assayed for integrin by Western blot assays using anti-Î±5 or anti-Î²1 antibody and chemiluminescence for detection. The ability of ganglioside to block the binding of the Î±5Î²1 integrin complex to the RGD-containing fragment of FN in a cell-free system was assayed by ELISA. 5 Î¼g/cm2 RGD-containing FN fragment (Sigma) was cross-linked to the wells of a 96-well plate by treatment with 10 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. To evaluate the effect of gangliosides on the binding of Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells to FN, cells were treated overnight with or without GT1b, GD3, GM3, GM2, or GD1a (Calbiochem) at concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 50 Î¼m. The SCC12 cells were lysed as described by Pomies et al. (22Pomies P. Frachet P. Block M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 18: 5104-5112Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the cell lysates in lysis buffer at protein concentrations of 10 pg/ml to 1 mg/ml were incubated in each FN fragment-coated well for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the wells were treated with anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and 3,3â²-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) reaction substrate. To test the ability of gangliosides to block the binding to FN of a 1:1 molar mixture of insect recombinant Î±5 and Î²1, 0.1 pg/ml to 0.1 Î¼g/ml integrin (without the His tags) was preincubated with or without gangliosides overnight at 4 Â°C and then applied to the FN fragment-coated wells. Recombinant integrin bound to FN was immunostained as described for Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells. Binding was detected in a V maxkinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) atA 450 nm. In each case, uncoated wells and omission of anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody served as negative controls. All studies were repeated at least four times, with triplicate wells for each condition. A novel assay, the NAB technique, was used to assess whether the ability of GT1b to interfere with integrin binding to FN specifically involves one of the integrin subunits and to verify that the N terminus of integrin is critical. This assay takes advantage of the fact that the His tag can bind to nickel-agarose; thus, a His tag at the C-terminal end exposes the N terminus with the integrin extracellular domains. 5 Î¼g of purified insect recombinant Î±5 or Î²1 protein with a C-terminal His tag (i.e. the N terminus available) or, as a control, with an N-terminal His tag was mixed with 100 Î¼l of nickel-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the coated nickel-agarose beads were mixed for 16 h in wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) containing 20 Î¼g/ml RGD-containing 110-kDa FN fragment with 1â50 Î¼m GT1b. Controls included mixing the integrin with gangliosides without FN and mixing the integrin and FN without any ganglioside. The bound bead was then washed and boiled in denaturing Laemmli buffer. Separated proteins were evaluated by Western blotting as described above, except that proteins on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were detected with a 1:1 mixture of anti-fibronectin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and anti-Î±5 or anti-Î²1 antibody. As a positive control and to verify results of the ELISAs, a 1:1 mixture of Î±5 and Î²1 (the Î±5Î²1 complex) was bound to nickel-agarose and mixed with FN in the presence or absence of GT1b. Similar techniques were used, except that the nickel-agarose-bound C-terminal His-integrin Î²1 subunit was first able to form nickel-agarose-bound C-terminal His-Î±5Î²1 by incubation with the partner Î±5 subunit without its His tag, prior to mixing with FN and ganglioside. To prevent separation of Î±5 from Î²1 and to allow detection with anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody, the complex of nickel-agarose-bound His-Î±5Î²1 and FN was incubated in Laemmli buffer containing 17.4% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature without boiling, and the gel was treated with 2.5% Triton X-100 before transferring to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. NAB assays were performed three times. SCC12 cells were treated for 48 h with or without GT1b or GD3 at concentrations of 1 nm to 50 Î¼m or, as a control, with 10, 50, or 200 Î¼mGM2, GD1a, or GM3. The cells were lysed in calcium-free buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin (23Mutoh T. Tokuda T. Hamaguchi M. Fujuki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5087-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 5 Î¼g of anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody was added to 2.5 mg of cell-free lysates at 4 Â°C for 2 h. In some studies, 5 Î¼g/ml FN was added to determine whether the presence of FN significantly altered the complex formation of ganglioside with Î±5Î²1 integrin. After treatment with 5 Î¼g of rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min, 10 Î¼l of 50% protein A-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h at 4 Â°C. One-eighth of the mixture was boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the separated integrin Î±5 and Î²1 subunits were detected by Western blotting with anti-Î±5 and anti-Î²1 antibodies. Lipids were extracted from the remaining samples with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) (17Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Robinson J.K. Bremer E.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), separated by thin-layer chromatography as described above, and identified with anti-GM3, anti-GM2, anti-GM1, anti-GD3, and anti-GT1b antibodies, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection as previously described (24Arnsmeier S.L. Paller A.S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 911-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Band density was quantified by the Storm 800 fluorescence PhosphorImager. To further evaluate the ability of gangliosides GT1b and GD3 to bind directly to Î±5Î²1 or to one of its subunits, slot blot assays were performed. 20 Î¼l of 50 Î¼m GT1b, GD3, or, as a control, GM3, GM2, GD1a, or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was loaded into each slot of a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on a Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was air-dried and blocked by the addition of 1% BSA in PBS, pH 7.6. After air drying, the membrane was incubated with 50 ng/ml affinity-purified Î±5Î²1 from the SCC12 cells, with 5 Î¼g/ml insect recombinant protein Î±5 or Î²1, or with a 1:1 molar mixture of Î±5 and Î²1 in PBS, pH 7.6, at 4 Â°C for 4â6 h. The membrane was washed with PBS, and the binding was detected with anti-Î±5, anti-Î²1, or anti-Î±5Î²1antibody using Western blotting with an ECL kit as described above. SCC12 cells were incubated overnight with GT1b at concentrations of 1 nm to 50 Î¼m GT1b or, as a control, with 50 Î¼m GM3, GM2, or GM1 or medium without ganglioside. Cells were lysed, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the expression of Î±5 and Î²1 was detected with anti-Î±5 and anti-Î²1 antibodies and an ECL kit. The NAB technique was also used to investigate whether GT1b interferes with the complex formation between Î±5 and Î²1 subunits. 100 Î¼l of nickel-agarose beads was mixed for 1 h at room temperature with 5 Î¼g of insect recombinant Î±5 with a C-terminal His tag or with 5 Î¼g of insect recombinant Î²1 with a C-terminal His tag, leaving the N terminus free to interact. As a negative control, nickel-agarose beads were also mixed with Î±5 or Î²1 subunits with N-terminal His tags. After washing, the His-Î±5-nickel-agarose or His-Î²1-nickel-agarose beads were mixed with GT1b at concentrations of 1 nm to 50 Î¼m in PBS for 4 h. Subsequently, 5 Î¼g of the appropriate partner integrin subunit without its His tag (e.g. Î±5 for nickel-agarose-bound His-Î²1) was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the sample was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, and the subunit combination was identified by Western blotting as described above using a 1:1 mixture of anti-Î±5 and anti-Î²1 antibodies. In all NAB studies, the presence of GT1b was confirmed by loading an aliquot onto a membrane for slot blot assays as described above, except that anti-GT1b antibody was used to detect GT1b. To assess the role of sugar moieties of Î±5Î²1in the interaction with gangliosides, Î±5Î²1from SCC12 cells and insect recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 proteins were deglycosylated by a modification of previously described techniques (21Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1646-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, poorly glycosylated recombinant Î±5Î²1 was generated in E. coli cells (26Weiland F. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1988; 70: 1493-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as described above. After reaching 80% confluence, SCC12 cells were switched to serum-free medium with 2 Î¼g/ml tunicamycin. 2 units/ml PNGase F (Calbiochem) was added to the medium 22 h later, and the cells were incubated with the combination of PNGase F and tunicamycin for an additional 2 h. After washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mm PMSF to clear cleaved carbohydrate residues and residual enzyme, the deglycosylated proteins were collected by cell lysis with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 3 mm PMSF, and 0.1m octyl glucoside. After centrifugation, the pellet was discarded. Recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 were treated with 0.4 units/ml PNGase F for 1 h at 37 Â°C (21Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then lysed and purified by passage over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column as described above. The resultant deglycosylated SCC12 cell Î±5Î²1, insect recombinant Î±5Î²1, and E. coliÎ±5Î²1 were analyzed in comparison with the original glycosylated forms of Î±5Î²1 by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or periodate-Schiff reagent (Sigma) and compared with known molecular mass standards. ELISAs were performed as described above to examine the effect of gangliosides on the ability of deglycosylated integrins and poorly glycosylated integrin from E. coli to bind to FN. In addition, bead binding assays and slot blot assays were used to determine whether deglycosylation prevents the direct binding of ganglioside to the integrin. Slot blot assays were performed as described above, except that deglycosylated Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells (50 ng/ml), deglycosylated Î±5Î²1 from insect recombinant cells (5 Î¼g/ml), and the poorly glycosylated Î±5Î²1 from E. coli (5 Î¼g/ml) were substituted for the glycosylated forms of Î±5Î²1. In the bead binding assays, 50 Î¼m GT1b or GD3 in PBS was cross-linked to 250 Î¼l of 0.2-Î¼m amine-modified red FluoSphere beads (1 Ã 105 particles/ml in PBS; F-8763, Molecular Probes, Inc.) by mixing with 5 mg/ml EDAC in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C. 50 Î¼m GD1a, GM2, or GM3 in PBS or PBS alone was coated onto FluoSphere beads as negative controls. To detect the attachment of the ganglioside to the FluoSphere beads, 20 Î¼l of GT1b-coated, GM3-coated, or uncoated red beads was washed and loaded into the slots of a slot blot apparatus as described above. The colored beads are easily visible under ultraviolet light as red bands. The binding of gangliosides GT1b, GM2, and GM3 to beads was confirmed by incubation with anti-GT1b, anti-GM2 (courtesy of Dr. P. Livingston, Sloan-Kettering, New York, NY), and anti-GM3 monoclonal antibodies, respectively, all applied at a ratio of 1:2 in PBS, and detected by chemiluminescence as described above. Affinity-purified Î±5Î²1 integrin protein from SCC12 cells, deglycosylated affinity-purified Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells, recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 subunits generated in insect cells and their 1:1 mixture, deglycosylated insect recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 subunits and their 1:1 mixture, recombinant Î±5 and Î²1 fromE. coli, and 1% BSA were coated onto 96-well plates overnight at 4 Â°C as described for FN ELISAs. To ensure good binding of integrin or integrin subunits to the plate, wells were washed and then treated with anti-Î±5, anti-Î²1, or anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody, and the integrin was detected by immunofluorescence. After washing, the beads coated with gangliosides were added to the integrin-coated plates. After a 2-h incubation, the binding of the colored ganglioside-coated spheres to integrin was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE300 immunofluorescence microscope linked to a computer with Neurolucida software from MicrobrightField, Inc., Colchester, VT) at magnification Ã 200 using a 580-nm filter. The number of beads counted in 13 non-overlapping fields was expressed as a percentage of the number of GT1b-coated beads bound to fully glycosylated affinity-purified Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells. ELISAs were also used to examine the competitive binding of concanavalin A (ConA) lectin, which recognizes mannose residues, and GT1b or other gangliosides to Î±5Î²1. In these studies, 96-well clear polystyrene plates (Calbiochem) precoated with ConA by the manufacturer were washed, and 200 Î¼l of 10 nm GT1b, GM3, or GM2 or 1% BSA was added to the plate concurrent with affinity-purified Î±5Î²1 from SCC12 cells at concentrations of 10â14 to 10â6 g/ml. After washing, the binding of Î±5Î²1 integrin to ConA was detected by incubation with anti-Î±5Î²1 antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and DAB. Binding was measured as described above at A 450 nm. As a control, the same experiment was performed with Ulex europaeusagglutinin-1 (UEA-1) lectin, which preferentially binds fucose groups rather than mannose, in substitution for the ConA lectin. The experiment was performed at least four times in triplicate. To further assess a preferential binding of GT1b and GD3 for mannose-containing sugars, ELISAs were performed to examine the binding of gangliosides to high mannose and reduced mannose forms of ovalbumin (Sigma). Purification of âhigh mannoseâ ovalbumin protein cleaves mannose residues and reduces content by â¼30% to generate âlow mannoseâ ovalbumin (27Huang C. Mayer H.E. Montgomery R. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 13: 127-137Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 50 Î¼g/ml high or low mannose ovalbumin was coated by overnight incubation in the presence of 10 mg/ml EDAC in PBS at 4 Â°C onto a 96-well plate. After washing, 200 Î¼l of 2â14 nm GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD3 or GT1b or 1% BSA was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. The plate was then washed vigorously with PBS and reacted with anti-GM1, anti-GM2, anti-GD1a, anti-GD3, or anti-GT1b monoclonal antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and DAB reaction substrate. Binding was detected atA 450 nm. The experiment was performed at least four times in triplicate. All data were analyzed statistically by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. We have previously shown that gangliosides compose 0.1% of the lipids of intact epidermis (17Paller A.S. Arnsmeier S.L. Robinson J.K. Bremer E.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with GM3 as the predominant ganglioside and smaller amounts of gangliosides GD3 and GT1b. Studies with cultured keratinocytes (data not shown) demonstrate a ganglioside profile that is similar to that of cultured SCC12 cells ("

Full-Text PDF Open Access n-dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside 2-(4â²-maleimidylanilino)naphtalene-6-sulfonic acid n-octyl-Î²-d-glucoside intramembrane particles The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus is composed of a 51-kDa integral membrane domain and a 19-kDa regulatory domain that is located at the cytoplasmatic surface of the membrane. The 51-kDa carrier domain is necessary and sufficient for translocation catalysis. The LacS protein is a member of the galactose-pentose-hexuronide family and studies on the membrane topology and structure prediction algorithms are most consistent with a carrier domain that is composed of a bundle of 12 transmembrane segments in Î±-helical configuration. Such an organization is typical for many membrane transport proteins (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W.-J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Besides the primary and secondary structure, very little structural information is available for membrane transport proteins. In this paper we set out to study the quaternary structure of LacS, a system that is paradigmatic for proteins that catalyze the uptake of solutes in symport with a cation. Based on genetic and biochemical studies of several secondary transporters it has been proposed that there is a single structural principle for all these systems (2Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12287-12292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transporters containing 10 to 12 putative transmembrane Î±-helices, such as the LacY (3Wright J.K.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12287-12292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GLUT1 (5Chen C.-C. Kurokawa T. Shaw S.-Y. Tillotson L.G. Kalled S. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2652-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the functional species appears to be monomeric. Whereas, secondary carriers with 6 to 7 putative transmembrane Î±-helices, such as the ADP/ATP carrier and the phosphate carriers of the inner mitochondrial membrane (6Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Wagner R. Apley E.C. Gross A. Flugge U.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), appear to function as a dimer. If this structural principle is indeed characteristic of all secondary transporters it would predict LacS to be monomeric. Many integral membrane proteins, however, are oligomeric (8Grasberger B. Minton A. DeLisi C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which results in a large excluded volume effect (high protein concentrations in the membrane) and a significant restriction in translational mobility. Also, their orientation is fixed relative to the membrane plane, resulting in the loss of fewer degrees of freedom upon oligomerization than when a soluble protein oligomerizes. Isolation of integral membrane proteins with nonionic detergents is often considered mild, and the proteins are usually undenatured and intact (9Cann J.R. Interacting Macromolecules: Theory and Practice of Their Electrophoresis: Ultracentrifugation and Chromatography. Academic Press, New York1970Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of these detergent-solubilized proteins can then be derived from molecular weight measurements. The quaternary structure of membrane proteins in detergent has most often been studied by gel filtration chromatography. This method, however, suffers from a poor resolution due to the large amount of detergent binding to the protein and requires that the dissociation rate of the oligomeric species is slow compared with the time required to perform the gel filtration experiment. Molecular weight measurements can be made rigorously by employing analytical ultracentrifugation. The effect of the detergent on the hydrodynamic properties of the integral membrane protein can be corrected for using appropriate methods without the intrinsic assumptions described above (10Tanford C. Yasuhiko N. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 11Schubert D. Tziatzios C. van den Broek J.A. Schuck P. Germeroth L. Michel H. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1994; 94: 14-19Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular organization in the membrane environment may be different from that in the detergent-solubilized form, that is when the protein requires particular alkyl chains, lipid head groups, or the strain of the membrane for its quaternary structure. Therefore, the quaternary structure of LacS was also studied for the membrane-embedded state of the protein. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy images of proteoliposomes allowed for the quantification of the cross-sectional surface area of the transmembrane domain, which correlates with the number of Î±-helices and, consequently, with the quaternary structure of LacS in the membrane environment (12Eskandari S.P. Wright E.M. Freman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the quaternary structure of the LacS protein in the detergent-solubilized and membrane-reconstituted state using analytical ultracentrifugation and freeze-fracture electron microscopy techniques. [d-Glucose-1-14C]lactose (2.11 TBq/mol) was obtained from the Radiochemical Center Amersham, United Kingdom. [14C]Dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside (2 GBq/mmol) was a generous gift from M. Le Maire (Paris, France). Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen, Inc. and Bio-Beads SM-2 from Bio-Rad, Inc. Triton X-100 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals;n-dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside from Anatrace. D2O (99.9%) was purchased from Fluka. TotalEscherichia coli lipids andl-Î±-phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk were from Avanti Polar Lipids and Sigma, respectively. All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. S. thermophilus ST11(ÎlacS) carrying plasmid pGKHis was grown semi-anaerobically at 42 Â°C in Elliker broth supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) beef extract, 20 mm lactose plus 5 Î¼g/ml erythromycin (13Knol J.

Using a polymerase chain reaction approach (13Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Lys-373 was replaced for cysteine using the lacS(C320A) gene in pGKH(C320A) as parent. The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis was 5â²-AATGGTGTACGGGTCACC (mutations are underlined); in addition to the AAA (Lys) to TGT (Cys) change, aBstEII site was created 3 base pairs downstream of the TGT codon. The fragment containing the mutant sequence was checked by nucleotide sequencing, and the resulting plasmid was named pGKH(C320A/K373C). All purification steps were performed at 4 Â°C. The protein was purified essentially as described (13Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Membranes of S. thermophilus were isolated and subsequently solubilized in 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl plus 0.5% (w/v) DDM.1 After 10â20 min of incubation, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (280,000 Ã g, 15 min). The solubilized membrane proteins were mixed and incubated for 30 min with Ni-NTA resin (â¼4 mg of LacS/ml of resin) that was equilibrated with buffer A (15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl plus 0.05% DDM). The column material was poured into a Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, plus 0.05% DDM. After 10-fold dilution with buffer B (5 mmHepes, pH 7.2, plus 0.05% DDM). The diluted protein sample was applied to a Bio-Spin column containing Q-Sepharose fast flow resin (10 mg of LacS/ml of resin; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer B plus 25 mm NaCl, the protein was step-eluted with buffer B plus 100 mm NaCl. Peak fractions usually contained 0.6â0.8 mg of LacS/ml. To obtain higher protein concentrations, the LacS protein was concentrated using Microcon-100 filters with a cut-off of 100 kDa (Amicon); the filters were centrifuged at 3,000 Ã guntil the desired concentration was achieved without concentrating the DDM that is not associated with the protein. To determine the protein concentration and the degree of aggregation, absorption spectra were taken with an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Spectra were collected from 240â340 nm with wavelength increments of 1 nm. LacS concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm (A 280) using an extinction coefficient (Îµ) of 76,320 mâ1 cmâ1 (14Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsky G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar), following the appropriate corrections for light scattering (15Leach S.J. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4790Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The LacS concentration as determined from the A 280yielded values that were 15â20% lower than those estimated from the Lowry assay in the presence of 0.5% SDS using bovine serum albumin as standard (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lowry assay was used for the LacS protein in Triton X-100 and the protein concentrations were normalized to theA 280 measurements of DDM-purified LacS. Circular dichroism spectra were collected using an Aviv 60 DS spectropolarimeter. The CD spectra were the average of five scans from 190 to 250 nm with wavelength increments of 1.0 nm, and the signal was acquired for 1 s at each wavelength. Experiments were performed at 25 Â°C with 0.14 mg/ml protein and a 0.1-cm path length cell. Prior to the measurements, the protein samples were extensively dialyzed at 4 Â°C against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol plus the appropriate detergent as indicated in the legend of Fig. 1. Spectra were corrected by subtracting baseline spectra obtained with the buffer solution. The LacS(C320A), LacS(C320A/K373C), and other single cysteine mutants were purified as described above, using either Triton X-100 or DDM as detergent. Mal-ANS labeling was carried out in 2.0 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl plus 0.05% (w/v) detergent, and at a temperature of 30 Â°C. LacS protein was added to a final concentration of 10â15 Î¼g/ml (i.e. 142â213 nm), and after 3 min of equilibration, the reaction was started by adding 5 Î¼m Mal-ANS (1 mm stock solution in Me2SO). The rates of labeling in the presence of galactose were estimated from the increase in fluorescence over a time period of 20 s, following the addition of ligand (at time is 5 min). Fluorescence changes were measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 416 nm, respectively, using slit widths of 5 nm. The extent of LacS labeling by Mal-ANS was estimated from the protein and probe absorbances at 280 and 313 nm, respectively, using extinction coefficients of 76,320 for LacS and 14,000 mâ1cmâ1 for ANS. The number of DDM molecules bound to purified LacS protein was determined with radiolabeled detergent using equilibrium desorption chromatography (17MÃ¸ller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18659-18672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein bound to Q-Sepharose (0.4 ml) was equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.05% (w/v) [14C]DDM. Following washing of the column with 4 ml of buffer B plus 25 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with buffer B plus 100 mm NaCl. LacS concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and detergent concentrations in the various fractions were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Liposomes prepared from acetone/ether-washed E. coli lipids and egg yolkl-Î±-phosphatidylcholine in a ratio of 3:1 (w/w) were made by dissolving lipids (20 mg/ml) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by three freeze/thaw cycles and extrusion through polycarbonate filters of 400-nm pore size (13Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), unless indicated otherwise. The liposomes (4 mg of phospholipid/ml) were titrated with the appropriate amounts of detergent, and 1 ml of this suspension was mixed with purified detergent-solubilized LacS and incubated for 30 min at 20 Â°C under gentle agitation. The final protein concentration was 10 Î¼g/ml, resulting in a lipid to protein ratio of 400 (w/w). To remove the detergents, polystyrene beads were added at a wet weight of 40 mg/ml and the sample was incubated for another 2 h at room temperature. Fresh Bio-Beads SM-2 were added twice and the samples were incubated at 4 Â°C for 3 h and overnight, respectively. The proteoliposomes were washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using an AN-50 Ti 8-place rotor with 2-channel charcoal-filled centerpieces at 20 Â°C. Prior to the measurements, the protein samples were extensively dialyzed at 4 Â°C against buffer C (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm K-EDTA plus 0.05% DDM (w/v)). The sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 38,000 rpm, and data were collected at 280 or 230 nm in a continuous mode with a radial step size of 0.003 cm, at 12-min intervals. Observed sedimentation coefficients were determined from the centroids of the sedimentation boundaries analogous to the method of Arisaka and Van Holde (22Arisaka F. Van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 41-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out on sample volumes of 100 Î¼l, at rotor speeds of 8,000, 10,000, and 12,000 rpm, and loading LacS-DDM concentrations of 0.020, 0.050, and 0.100 mg of protein/ml. Absorbance optics were used to collect data of the LacS-DDM samples at 280 nm, and data were acquired every 0.001 cm with 10 replicates. Data analysis was performed with the XL-I data analysis software. The partial specific volume of LacS was calculated from the amino acid composition using reported values (18Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Hafner Publishing Co., New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). The solvent densities were determined with an Anton Paar densitometer, model DM 48. The molecular weight of LacS was determined by treating the experimental data with equations appropriate for multicomponent systems (19Casassa E.F. Eisenberg H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 287Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10Tanford C. Yasuhiko N. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). At sedimentation equilibrium the experimentally determined protein concentration (c) as a function of the radial position (r) is given by, (2RT/Ï2)(d ln c/dr2)=M(1âÏâ²Ï)Equation 1 where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, Ï is the angular velocity, Ï is the density of the solvent, and Ïâ² is the effective partial specific volume of the protein moiety, which includes the contributions of bound detergent. The molecular weight (M) is that of the protein moiety of the particle, excluding bound detergent or solvent. This approach allows for the calculation of the buoyant density factor by replacing the factor M(1 âÏâ²Ï) of Equation 1 by,M(1âÏâ²Ï)=M[(1âvÌÏÏ)+Î´D(1âvÌDÏ)]Equation 2 where p is the partial specific volume of LacS, which was calculated to be 0.7514 at 20 Â°C (18Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Hafner Publishing Co., New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar), and d the partial specific volume of DDM bound to LacS. In Equation 2, Î´ D is the DDM bound by LacS (g/g), which was determined experimentally using equilibrium desorption chromatography; d is the partial specific volume of DDM which was determined experimentally by sedimentation equilibrium analysis at different solvent densities. The behavior of a single, thermodynamically ideal solute in a centrifugal field can be derived from the Lamm equation (20Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Asron. Fys. 1929; 21B (, 1â4): 2Google Scholar), ln crr2=M(1âvÌÏ)Ï22RTEquation 3 where c r is the solute concentration as a function of the radial distance, R is the gas constant,T is the absolute temperature, Ï is the angular velocity, Ï is the density of the solvent, and vÌ is the partial specific volume of the protein moiety. Since the partial specific volume of the LacS-DDM complex is unknown, the molar mass of the protein moiety cannot directly be derived from the effective molar mass of the complex, M eff = M(1 âvÌÏ). However, by determining theM eff as a function of solvent densities by varying the ratio of H2O and D2O, the molar mass of the protein moiety can be evaluated by extrapolation to the density of DDM. The density of DDM is an important parameter in the equations used to determine the molar mass of the protein moiety. The density of 1/vÌDDM can be determined experimentally employing equilibrium sedimentation at different solvent densities by varying the ratio of H2O and D2O. Under conditions at which the solvent density equals 1/vÌDDM, the concentration distribution is no longer observed. However, the density of DDM is higher than the maximum obtainable solvent density using D2O. Therefore, the density of DDM can only be determined by extrapolation to solvent densities were M eff becomes zero. Interference optics was used to collect data of the DDM samples to determine its partial specific volume. Freeze-fracture replicas were prepared from pelleted proteoliposomes that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 4 Â°C in order to increase the vesicle size. Next, the proteoliposomes were washed with 15% glycerol in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, and placed on gold holders followed by ultra-rapid cooling by plunging into liquid propane (â190 Â°C) that was cooled with liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were fractured in a Balzers BA301 instrument at 10â7 torr. Tantalium/carbon was deposited at 45Â° elevation from the resistance electrode immediately after fracturing at â160 Â°C, and all replicas were backed with carbon from 90Â°. The samples and replicas were separated from the support in dilute chromic acid (21Costello M.J. Fetter R. HoÌchli M. J. Microsc. ( Oxf .). 1983; 125: 125-136Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Replicas were picked up on 400-mesh uncoated grids for examination in a Phillips CM10 electron microscope. Images enlarged at a final magnification of Ã 250,000 were digitized and particle diameters were measured perpendicular to the shadow direction using software from ScionImage. The results were plotted as frequency histograms at the center of the bin (0.5 nm) and fitted to a (multiple) Gaussian function, fx=âi Ai/siexp[â0.5(xâÎ¼i/si) 2]Equation 4 where f x is the frequency of occurrence of a particle of size x, x is the measured diameter of a given particle (nm), A is an approximation of the area below the curve of a given particle population, Î¼ is the mean diameter of a given population (nm), s is the standard deviation of the population diameter, and i is an integer from 1 to the total number of particle populations. For sample sizes,N refers to the number of diameter measurements, andn refers to the number of particles counted for particle density determinations. For particle density measurements fracture faces where enlarged to a final magnification of Ã75,000, and intramembrane particles (IMP) from both the convex and concave proteoliposomes were counted from known areas of the membrane. No correction was made for the curvature of the vesicle surfaces, resulting in a slight overestimation of the particle densities. Using the His-tagged protein, LacS was purified in two steps (Ni affinity and anion exchange chromatography), yielding a single band after staining with silver or Coomassie Blue on a SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Previous purification trials often led to higher order aggregates and significant loss of activity, but the modified protocol yielded a protein that was highly pure, and stable in the Triton X-100 or DDM-solubilized state(s) for at least 3 days at 20 Â°C. The absorption spectrum of LacS purified with DDM exhibited a flat baseline in the 310â340 nm region (Fig.1, inset), which indicates that higher order aggregates are not significantly present under these conditions. In contrast, LacS purified in OG was highly aggregated, as indicated by the absorbance in the 310â340 nm region, already in fractions eluting from the Ni-NTA column (Fig. 1,inset). The secondary structure of LacS in micelles of DDM or Triton X-100 was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 1). Although the CD spectra of LacS purified in Triton X-100 exhibited more noise than those in DDM due to the absorption of Triton X-100 in the UV region, the spectra were otherwise superimposable. CD spectra of LacS purified in DDM were used to quantify the secondary structure elements by the method of Contin (23Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-242Crossref Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). The estimates of secondary structure amounted to 60% Î±-helix, 13% Î²-sheet, 15% Î²-turn, and 12% remainder. The addition of 10 mm lactose had no effect on the CD spectra (data not shown). To assess the functional integrity of detergent-solubilized and purified LacS protein, we determined the dissociation constant for galactose binding in a fluorometric assay. Mutants were constructed that lack the native cysteine (Cys-320) but carry a cysteine in interhelix loop 10â11,i.e. near the putative substrate-binding site (32Spooner P.J.R. Veenhoff L.M. Watts A. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9634-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These mutants were tested for their ability to react in a ligand-dependent manner with Mal-ANS, a maleimide derivative that is non-fluorescent until it reacts with thiols. Moreover, its fluorescence quantum yield is highly dependent on the polarity of the environment. Of different mutants tested, LacS(C320A/K373C) proved to be the best target as the rate of labeling was affected only in the presence of carrier substrates (Fig.2 A). Labeling of LacS(C320A/K373C) by Mal-ANS was quantitative as no further thiol-specific reaction was observed upon unfolding of the protein with SDS (not shown). The extent of SDS-treated LacS(C320A/K373C) was calibrated by titration with known amounts of reduced glutathione. Importantly, upon membrane reconstitution, the unlabeled and labeled double mutant as well as the single mutant (C320A) displayed counterflow activities identical to the wild-type protein (data not shown). In contrast to LacS(C320A/K373C), detergent-solubilized and purified LacS(C320A) was not significantly labeled by Mal-ANS. The rate of LacS(C320A/K373C) labeling was enhanced in the presence of sugars (galactosides) that are known to be substrates of LacS (33Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33244-33250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas other sugars such as glucose and sucrose had no effect (Fig.2 A). This property was used to estimate the dissociation constant (K d) for equilibrium galactose binding by determining the rate of labeling by Mal-ANS at varying galactose concentrations. The kinetic analysis of galactose binding to LacS(C320A/K373C) as reported by the difference in the rate of labeling with and without ligand is shown in Fig. 2 B. The data for the Triton X-100- and DDM-solubilized protein were very similar, yielding K d values for galactose binding of approximately 2 mm. Thus, both the spectroscopic and ligand binding measurements do not reveal significant differences between LacS in the Triton X-100 and DDM-solubilized state, and indicate that the detergent-solubilized LacS has retained its native conformation. Equilibrium desorption chromatography was employed to determine the molar ratio of DDM to LacS protein. Upon equilibration of LacS bound to the column matrix with buffer B containing 14C-labeled DDM, the 14C label in the elution volume levels off between 4 and 7.5 ml (Fig.3). The increase in14C-labeled DDM upon increasing the NaCl concentration to 100 mm parallels the elution of the LacS protein. The14C-labeled DDM increased linearly with the protein concentration in the range of 0.03 to 0.78 mg of LacS/ml (0.4â11 Î¼m) (Fig. 3). Linear regression resulted in a molar ratio of 14C-labeled DDM to protein in the elution fractions of 197 Â± 5, which correspo"

https://openalex.org/W1651928497,"The identification of galaxies at extreme distances provides the most direct information about the earliest phases of galaxy formation. But at redshifts z > 5 even the most luminous galaxies appear faint; the interpretation of low signal-to-noise ratio data is difficult and misidentifications do occur. Here we report optical and near-infrared observations of the source STIS123627+621755, which was previously suggested to be at a redshift of 6.68 (ref. 1). At that redshift, and with the reported spectral energy distribution, the galaxy should be essentially invisible at wavelengths less than 9,300 A, because the intervening intergalactic medium absorbs almost all light energetic enough to ionize neutral hydrogen--that is, with wavelengths less than the redshifted Lyman limit of lambda = (1 + z) x 912A. At near-infrared wavelengths, however, the galaxy should be relatively bright. Here we report a detection of the galaxy at 6,700 A and a non-detection at a wavelength of 1.2 microm, contrary to expectations for z approximately 6.68. The data conservatively require that STIS123627+621755 has a redshift z < 6."
