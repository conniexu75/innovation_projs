https://openalex.org/W2800485395,"Soil salinity is a common and serious environmental problem worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered as bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. However, few studies have addressed the possible benefits of AMF inoculation for medicinal plants under saline conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of colonization with two AMF, Funneliformis mosseae and Diversispora versiformis, alone and in combination, on the growth and nutrient uptake of the medicinal plant Chrysanthemum morifolium (Hangbaiju) in a greenhouse salt stress experiment. After 6 weeks of a non-saline pretreatment, Hangbaiju plants with and without AMF were grown for five months under salinity levels that were achieved using 0, 50 and 200 mM NaCl. Root length, shoot and root dry weight, total dry weight, and root N concentration were higher in the mycorrhizal plants than in the non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of moderate salinity, especially with D. versiformis colonization. As salinity increased, mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal dependence decreased. The enhancement of root N uptake is probably the main mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. These results suggest that the symbiotic associations between the fungus D. versiformis and C. morifolium plants may be useful in biotechnological practice."

Pulmonary and extra-pulmonary symptoms associated with M. pneumoniae infection are reported. M. pneumoniae is mainly epidemic in Denmark with the recurrence every 4-7th year.Retrospectively, to describe the epidemiology and clinical features, in infants and children, during the M. pneumoniae epidemic in 2010 and 2011.All children under the age of 16 that were tested for M. pneumoniae during the period 01.02.2010-31.01.2012 were included. Medical charts, as well as radiological findings, were reviewed for all children with M. pneumoniae. A post-hoc analysis of viral co-infections was done on part of the cohort.134 of 746 children were tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR or serology. Positive tests were found in 65% of children seven years and older, in 30% of 2-6-year-olds and 4% of infants (less than two years of age). Viral co-infection was found in 27% of the tested samples. The clinical presentation was a cough, asthma-like symptoms and low-grade fever. Extra-pulmonary symptoms were common and presented as nausea/vomiting by 33% of the children and skin manifestations by 25%. 84% of the children had a chest x-ray taken, and there were positive radiological findings in 94% of these.M. pneumoniae also affected infants and young children and symptoms were similar to infections with respiratory viruses, but severe LRTI were also seen. During an up-coming epidemic, assessment of extra-pulmonary manifestations can be helpful when diagnosing M. pneumoniae infections."
https://openalex.org/W2799858190,"The corncob is an agricultural waste generated in huge quantities during corn processing. In this paper, we tested the capacity of corncob particles for water purification by removing the azo dye Direct Yellow 27 (DY27) via biosorption. The biosorption process was investigated in terms of the kinetics, equilibria, and thermodynamics. Batch biosorption studies showed that the biosorption performance has strong inverse correlations to the solution pH and the corncob particle size, and it increases quickly with increasing contact time and initial dye concentration. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model provides the best fit to the experimental data, whereas the Redlich-Peterson isotherm model is most suitable for describing the observed equilibrium biosorption. The biosorption process is exothermic, spontaneous, and physisorption in character. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) studies suggest that lignocellulose and proteins play key roles in the biosorption of DY27 from aqueous solutions by corncob. Furthermore, after biosorption onto the corncob, the dye can be effectively desorbed using 0.1 M NaOH solution. Therefore, the corncob can be used as a promising biosorbent to remediate DY27-contaminated water and wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2802627407,"Genomic analysis of cancer tissues is an essential aspect of personalized oncology treatment. Though it has been suggested that formalin fixation of patient tissues may be suboptimal for molecular studies, this tissue processing approach remains the industry standard. Therefore clinical molecular laboratories must be able to work with formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) material. This study examines the effects of pre-analytic variables introduced by routine pathology processing on specimens used for clinical reports produced by next-generation sequencing technology. Tissue resected from three colorectal cancer patients was subjected to 2, 15, 24, and 48 hour fixation times in neutral buffered formalin. DNA was extracted from all tissues twice, once with uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) treatment to counter deamination effects, and once without. Of note, deamination events at methylated cytosine, as found at CpG sites, remains unaffected by UNG. After extraction a two-step PCR targeted sequencing method was performed using the Illumina MiSeq and the data was analyzed via a custom-built bioinformatics pipeline, including filtration of reads with mapping quality <30. A larger baseline group of samples (n = 20) was examined to establish if there was a sample performance difference between the two DNA extraction methods, with/without UNG treatment. There was no statistical difference between sequencing performance of the two extraction methods when comparing read counts (raw, mapped, and filtered) and read quality (% mapped, % filtered). Analyzing mutation type, there was no significant difference between mutation calls until the 48 hour fixation treatment. At 48 hours there is a significant increase in C/G->T/A mutations that is not represented in DNA treated with UNG. This suggests these errors may be due to deamination events triggered by a longer fixation time. However the allelic frequency of these events remained below the limit of detection for reportable mutations in this assay (<2%). We do however recommend that suspected intratumoral heterogeneity events be verified by re-sequencing the same FFPE block."
https://openalex.org/W2802375498,"Myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) is widely distributed in various tissues or organs and plays crucial roles in multiple biological processes. To examine the potential effects of MEF2A on skeletal muscle myoblast, the functional role of MFE2A in myoblast proliferation and differentiation was investigated. In this study, we found that the mRNA expression level of Mef2a was dramatically increased during the myogenesis of bovine skeletal muscle primary myoblast. Overexpression of MEF2A significantly promoted myoblast proliferation, while knockdown of MEF2A inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of myoblast. RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that this positive effect of MEF2A on the proliferation of myoblast was carried out by triggering cell cycle progression by activating CDK2 protein expression. Besides, MEF2A was found to be an important transcription factor that bound to the myozenin 2 (MyoZ2) proximal promoter and performed upstream of MyoZ2 during myoblast differentiation. This study provides the first experimental evidence that MEF2A is a positive regulator in skeletal muscle myoblast proliferation and suggests that MEF2A regulates myoblast differentiation via regulating MyoZ2."
https://openalex.org/W2801812283,"Purpose Numerous reports indicate that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a prognostic factor in various cancers and that they must be good biomarkers. However, the methods of evaluating TILs differ in each study; thus, there is not yet a standardized methodology for evaluating TILs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) using the new method proposed by the International TILs Working Group in breast cancer and to standardize the method of evaluating TILs in CRC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed a database of 160 patients with Stage II or III CRC. The density of TILs was assessed by measuring the area occupied by mononuclear cells over the stromal area on hematoxylin and eosin (H-E)-stained sections. We set 42% as the cut-off percentage of the area occupied by TILs according to the receiver operating characteristic curve, and we classified patients into the high-TILs and the low-TILs groups. Results The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the high-TILs group were significantly higher than those in the low-TILs group. A multivariate analysis showed that the density of TILs was independently associated with RFS and OS. Moreover, the density of TILs assessed by an observer was significantly associated with the density of TILs assessed by the automated imaging software program. Conclusions The new method for evaluating TILs, which was recommended by the International TILs Working Group in breast cancer, might be a useful predictive factor in colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800888211,"Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a biodegradable polymer, can be produced by different microorganisms. The PHB belongs to the family of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) that mostly accumulates as a granule in the cytoplasm of microorganisms to store carbon and energy. In this study, we established an integrated one-pot electromicrobial setup in which carbon dioxide is reduced to formate electrochemically, followed by sequential microbial conversion into PHB, using the two model strains, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 and Cupriavidus necator H16. This setup allows to investigate the influence of different stress conditions, such as coexisting electrolysis, relatively high salinity, nutrient limitation, and starvation, on the production of PHB. The overall PHB production efficiency was analyzed in reasonably short reaction cycles typically as short as 8 h. As a result, the PHB formation was detected with C. necator H16 as a biocatalyst only when the electrolysis was operated in the same solution. The specificity of the source of PHB production is discussed, such as salinity, electricity, concurrent hydrogen production, and the possible involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
https://openalex.org/W2802277267,"Species occurrence data records the location and time of an encounter with a species, and is valuable for many aspects of ecological and evolutionary analyses. A key distinction within species occurrence data is between (1) collected and preserved specimens that can be taxonomically validated (i.e., natural history collections), and (2) observations, which are more error prone but richer in terms of number and spread of observations. In this study we analyse the distribution in temporal, spatial, taxonomic and environmental coverage of specimen- and observation based species occurrence data for land plants in Norway, a region with strong climatic and human population density gradients. Of 4.8 million species occurrence records, the majority (78%) were observations. However, there was a greater species richness in the specimen record (N = 4691) than in the observation record (N = 3193) and most species were recorded more as specimens than observations. Specimen data was on average older, and collected later during the year. Both record types were highly influenced by a small number of prolific contributors. The species most highly represented in the observation data set were widespread or invasive, while in the specimen records, taxonomically challenging species were overrepresented. Species occurrence records were unevenly spatially distributed. Both specimen and observation records were concentrated in regions of Norway with high human population density and with high temperatures and precipitation, but in different regions within Norway. Observation and specimen records thus differ in taxonomic, temporal, spatial and environmental coverage for a well-sampled group and study region, potentially influencing the ecological inferences made from studies utilizing species occurrence data. The distribution of observation data dominates the dataset, so inferences of species diversity and distributions do not correspond to the evolutionary or physiological knowledge of species, which is based on specimen data. We make recommendations for users of biodiversity data, and collectors to better exploit the complementary strengths of these distinct biodiversity data types."
https://openalex.org/W2802727938,"From 2006 to 2013, an increasing incidence of fusariosis was observed in the hematologic patients of our University Hospital. We suspected of an environmental source, and the indoor hospital air was investigated as a potential source of the fungemia. Air samplings were performed in the hematology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) wards using an air sampler with pre-defined air volumes. To study the molecular relationship among environmental and clinical isolates, 18 Fusarium spp. recovered from blood cultures were included in the study. DNA sequencing of a partial portion of TEF1α gene was performed for molecular identification. Molecular typing was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using a four-gene scheme: TEF1α, rDNA, RPB1 and RPB2. One hundred four isolates were recovered from the air of the hematology (n = 76) and the BMT (n = 28) wards. Fusarium isolates from the air were from five species complexes: Fusarium fujikuroi (FFSC, n = 56), Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti (FIESC, n = 24), Fusarium solani (FSSC, n = 13), Fusarium chlamydosporum (FCSC, n = 10), and Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC, n = 1). Fifteen Fusarium isolates recovered from blood belonged to FSSC, and three to FFSC. MLST identified the same sequence type (ST) in clinical and environmental isolates. ST1 was found in 5 isolates from blood and in 7 from the air, both identified as FSSC (Fusarium petroliphilum). STn1 was found in one isolate from blood and in one from the air, both identified as FFSC (Fusarium napiforme). F. napiforme was isolated from the air of the hospital room of the patient with fungemia due to F. napiforme. These findings suggested a possible clonal origin of the Fusarium spp. recovered from air and bloodcultures. In conclusion, our study found a diversity of Fusarium species in the air of our hospital, and a possible role of the air as source of systemic fusariosis in our immunocompromised patients."
https://openalex.org/W2802696055,"Background The imidazole group is an ubiquitous chemical motif present in several key types of biomolecules. It is a structural moiety of purines, and plays a central role in biological catalysis as part of the side-chain of histidine, the amino acid most frequently found in the catalytic site of enzymes. Histidine biosynthesis starts with both ATP and the pentose phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is also the precursor for the de novo synthesis of purines. These two anabolic pathways are also connected by the imidazole intermediate 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR), which is synthesized in both routes but used only in purine biosynthesis. Rather surprisingly, the imidazole moieties of histidine and purines are synthesized by different, non-homologous enzymes. As discussed here, this phenomenon can be understood as a case of functional molecular convergence. Results In this work, we analyze these polyphyletic processes and argue that the independent origin of the corresponding enzymes is best explained by the differences in the function of each of the molecules to which the imidazole moiety is attached. Since the imidazole present in histidine is a catalytic moiety, its chemical arrangement allows it to act as an acid or a base. On the contrary, the de novo biosynthesis of purines starts with an activated ribose and all the successive intermediates are ribotides, with the key β-glycosidic bondage joining the ribose and the imidazole moiety. This prevents purine ribonucleotides to exhibit any imidazole-dependent catalytic activity, and may have been the critical trait for the evolution of two separate imidazole-synthesizing-enzymes. We also suggest that, in evolutionary terms, the biosynthesis of purines predated that of histidine. Conclusions As reviewed here, other biosynthetic routes for imidazole molecules are also found in extant metabolism, including the autocatalytic cyclization that occurs during the formation of creatinine from creatine phosphate, as well as the internal cyclization of the Ala-Ser-Gly motif of some members of the ammonia-lyase and aminomutase families, that lead to the MIO cofactor. The diversity of imidazole-synthesizing pathways highlights the biological significance of this key chemical group, whose biosyntheses evolved independently several times."
https://openalex.org/W2801466606,"Despite improvement in prognosis of colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer survivors often suffer from adverse effects of cancer treatment, including reduced health-related fitness level. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the feasibility and efficacy of the 6-week home-based exercise program on the level of physical activity and physical fitness in stage II to III colorectal cancer survivors. Seventy-two stage II to III colorectal cancer survivors were randomly assigned to either a home-based exercise (n = 38) or usual care (n = 34) group for 6 weeks. The goal of the home-based exercise program was to increase the level of exercise to 18 metabolic equivalent task hours per week. The primary and the secondary outcomes of this study were physical activity level and physical fitness, respectively. A total of 57 participants (79.2%) completed the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that moderate physical activity level increased significantly by 269.4 ± 260.6 minutes per week in the exercise group (mean between-group difference, 254.6 minutes; 95% confidence interval, 172.7–434.7; p < 0.001). Physical fitness measured by using the step test (-3.9 vs. 2.6, p = 0.012) and push-up test (3.0 vs. -1.2, p = 0.012) also improved significantly in the exercise group compared to the control group. The 6-week home-based mixed aerobic and resistance exercise program was feasible and effective for increasing physical activity level and physical fitness in stage II to III colorectal cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2801160036,"Purpose To assess the effect of marital status and the role of race/ethnicity on breast cancer specific mortality in women with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods The study utilized the California Cancer Registry to identify 22,812 cases of first primary female TNBC. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier breast cancer specific survival was computed. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling was used to compute the adjusted risk of breast cancer specific mortality for women who were single, separated, divorced, and widowed when compared with women who were married. Models were adjusted for age, stage, tumor grade, SES, and treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Results Separated (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14–2.01) and widowed (HR: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.23–1.57) white women had a higher risk of mortality than white married women whereas single and divorced white women had the same risk of mortality. For Asian/Pacific Islanders (API), only single (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.17–2.06) and divorced (HR:1.81; 95% CI:1.26–2.60) women had a higher risk of mortality than married women. Marital status had no influence on risk of mortality for either black or Hispanic women. Conclusions The risk of mortality associated with marital status is dependent on race/ethnicity. Only white and API women with TNBC have a marital advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2802862220,"The aim of the current study is to evaluate the detection rate of micro- and macro-metastases of the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) compared to frozen section examination and subsequent ultra-staging examination in early stage endometrial cancer (EC).From March 2016 to June 2016, data of 40 consecutive FIGO stage I EC patients were prospectively collected in an electronic database. The sentinel lymph node mapping was performed in all patients. All mapped nodes were removed and processed. Sentinel lymph nodes were sectioned and alternate sections were respectively examined by OSNA and by frozen section analysis. After frozen section, the residual tissue from each block was processed with step-level sections (each step at 200 micron) including H&E and IHC slides.Sentinel lymph nodes mapping was successful in 29 patients (72.5%). In the remaining 11 patients (27.5%), a systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. OSNA assay sensitivity and specificity were 87.5% and 100% respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 99% respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 99%. As far as frozen section examination and subsequent ultra-staging analysis was concerned, we reported sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 94.4% respectively; positive and negative predictive values were 14.3% and 99%, respectively, with an accuracy of 93.6%. In one patient, despite negative OSNA and frozen section analysis of the sentinel node, a macro-metastasis in 1 non-sentinel node was found.The combination of OSNA procedure with the sentinel lymph node mapping could represent an efficient intra-operative tool for the selection of early-stage EC patients to be submitted to systematic lymphadenectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2800821028,"Complete degradation of the xylan backbone of hemicellulosic plant cell walls requires the synergistic action of endo-xylanases and β-1,4-xylosidases. While endo-xylanases produce xylooligosaccharides from xylan, β-1,4-xylosidases degrade the xylooligosaccharides into xylose monomers. The glycoside hydrolase family 43 β-1,4-xylosidase from Geobacillus thermoleovorans IT-08 is a promising, heat stable catalyst for the saccharification of hemicellulosic material into simple fermentable sugars, but it is competitively inhibited by its products arabinose and xylose. As a first step to help overcome this problem, we elucidated crystal structures of the enzyme in the unliganded form and with bound products, at 1.7–2.0 Å resolution. The structures are very similar to those of other enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 43. Unexpectedly, the monosaccharides are bound in very different ways. Arabinose preferentially binds in subsite -1, while xylose exclusively interacts with subsite +1. These structures and sugar binding preferences suggest ways for improving the catalytic performance of the enzyme by rational mutational design."
https://openalex.org/W2939490628,"We propose a framework for the systematic analysis of mobile phone data to identify relevant mobility profiles in a population. The proposed framework allows finding distinct human mobility profiles based on the digital trace of mobile phone users characterized by a Matrix of Individual Trajectories (IT-Matrix). This matrix gathers a consistent and regularized description of individual trajectories that enables multi-scale representations along time and space, which can be used to extract aggregated indicators such as a dynamic multi-scale population count. Unsupervised clustering of individual trajectories generates mobility profiles (clusters of similar individual trajectories) which characterize relevant group behaviors preserving optimal aggregation levels for detailed and privacy-secured mobility characterization. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated by analyzing fully anonymized data on human mobility from mobile phones in Senegal at the arrondissement level over a calendar year. The analysis of monthly mobility patterns at the livelihood zone resolution resulted in the discovery and characterization of seasonal mobility profiles related with economic activities, agricultural calendars and rainfalls. The use of these mobility profiles could support the timely identification of mobility changes in vulnerable populations in response to external shocks (such as natural disasters, civil conflicts or sudden increases of food prices) to monitor food security."
https://openalex.org/W2800337085,"Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing life-threatening mycobacterium with multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. However, there is no official regimen for M. abscessus therapy. In this study, we screened the Pathogen Box, which contains 400 drug-like molecules active against neglected diseases, to identify active molecules targeting Mycobacterium abscessus using resazurin live/dead assays. In this screening assay, the Z-factor was 0.7, as an indicator of the statistical confidence of the assay. A cut-off of 80% growth inhibition in the screening resulted in the identification of four different compounds at a single concentration (20 μM). Dose-response curves identified three different hit candidates, i.e., MMV688508, MMV688844, and MMV688845, which generated good inhibitory curves. All hit candidates were expected to have different molecular targets. Among them, MMV688844 showed the best minimum inhibitory concentration value for not only wild-type M. abscessus but also for nine different R and S morphotype clinical isolates. Thus, we found that MMV688844, identified from the Pathogen Box screen, may be a promising candidate in the M. abscessus drug discovery pipeline."

Traditional techniques have been used for many years, but there has now been a progression to move towards alternative digital models and interactive 3D models to engage the learner. However, digital innovations in the curriculum have typically involved the medical curriculum rather than the veterinary curriculum. Therefore, we aimed to create a simple workflow methodology to highlight the simplicity there is in creating a mobile augmented reality application of basic canine head anatomy. Using canine CT and MRI scans and widely available software programs, we demonstrate how to create an interactive model of head anatomy. This was applied to augmented reality for a popular Android mobile device to demonstrate the user-friendly interface. Here we present the processes, challenges and resolutions for the creation of a highly accurate, data based anatomical model that could potentially be used in the veterinary curriculum. This proof of concept study provides an excellent framework for the creation of augmented reality training products for veterinary education. The lack of similar resources within this field provides the ideal platform to extend this into other areas of veterinary education and beyond."

T-cell sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1)-mediated signaling directs T-lymphocyte trafficking. Effects of T-cell S1P1 activation on cardiac fibrosis in a murine diabetic model remain to be explored. For this purpose, conditional T-cell S1P1 knockout (TS1P1KO) mice generated by crossing S1pr1loxP/loxP mice with Lck-Cre mice were used in a model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy. The TS1P1KO mice exhibited sustained deficiency of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood. The TS1P1KO vehicle control mouse hearts featured an altered phenotype characterized by increased myocardial fibrosis and reduced cardiac contractility under normal levels of glucose. Compared with littermate diabetic mice, TS1P1KO diabetic mice had improved cardiac function and alleviated cardiac fibrosis detected after 11 wk of diabetic induction.

https://openalex.org/W2801665642,"Background We investigated the effects of multiple-modality exercise with additional mind-motor training on cognition in community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive complaints. Methods Participants (n = 127, mean age 67.5 [7.3] years, 71% women) were randomized to receive 45 minutes of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 minutes of either mind-motor training (M4, n = 63) or control (balance, range of motion and breathing exercises [M2, n = 64]). In total, both groups exercised 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. Standardized global cognitive functioning (GCF), concentration, reasoning, planning, and memory were assessed at 24 weeks and after a 28-week no-contact follow-up. Results There were no significant differences in the study primary outcomes. The M4 group, however, showed trends for greater improvements in GCF and memory (both, P = .07) compared to the M2 group at 24 weeks. Significant differences between group in GCF (P = .03) and memory (P = .02) were observed after the 28-week no-contact follow-up favouring the M4 group.

Methods A total of 134 pathology confirmed GC patients who underwent PET/CT for staging work-ups were enrolled. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary tumor (Tmax), spleen (Smax), and spleen to liver uptake ratio (SLR) were measured. The prognostic value of PET-measured parameters in GC patients for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. And the relationships of the parameters with hematological and inflammatory parameters were also investigated. Results During follow-up period, 19 patients (14.1%) had disease recurrence and 12 (8.9%) died from GC. In univariate analysis, hematocrit (p<0.001 and p = 0.002), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR; p = 0.021 and p = 0.040), AJCC staging (p<0.001 and p<0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (p<0.001 and p<0.001), Tmax (p = 0.004 and p = 0.005), and SLR (p = 0.005 and p = 0.016) were significant prognostic factors for RFS and OS, whereas platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR; p = 0.034) was a significant prognostic factor for RFS. In multivariate analysis, only SLR was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (p = 0.018, adjusted HR = 3.011, 95% CI = 1.207–7.511). SLR were significantly associated with serum hematocrit level (r = -0.256, p = 0.002), PLR (r = 0.362, p = 0.001), and Tmax (r = 0.280, p = 0.001). Conclusion Diffuse splenic uptake on FDG PET/CT was correlated with the level of hematological and inflammatory parameters and was an independent predictor for RFS in GC."
https://openalex.org/W2800153422,"In critically sick adults, sustained low efficiency dialysis [SLED] appears to be better tolerated hemodynamically and outcomes seem to be comparable to CRRT. However, there is paucity of data in critically sick children. In children, two recent studies from Taiwan (n = 11) and India (n = 68) showed benefits of SLED in critically sick children.The objective of the study was to look at the feasibility and tolerability of sustained low efficiency daily dialysis-filtration [SLEDD-f] in critically sick pediatric patients.Design: Retrospective study Inclusion criteria: All pediatric patients who had undergone heparin free SLEDD-f from January 2012 to October 2017. Measurements: Data collected included demographic details, vital signs, PRISM III at admission, ventilator parameters (where applicable), number of inotropes, blood gas and electrolytes before, during, and on conclusion of SLED therapy. Technical information was gathered regarding SLEDD-f prescription and complications.Between 2012-2017, a total of 242 sessions of SLEDD-f were performed on 70 patients, out of which 40 children survived. The median age of patients in years was 12 (range 0.8-17 years), and the median weight was 39 kg (range 8.5-66 kg). The mean PRISM score at admission was 8.77±7.22. SLEDD-f sessions were well tolerated, with marked improvement in fluid status and acidosis. Premature terminations had to be done in 23 (9.5%) of the sessions. There were 21 sessions (8.6%) terminated due to hypotension and 2 sessions (0.8%) terminated due to circuit clotting. Post- SLEDD-f hypocalcemia occurred in 15 sessions (6.2%), post- SLEDD-f hypophosphatemia occurred in 1 session (0.4%), and post- SLEDD-f hypokalemia occurred in 17 sessions (7.0%).This study is the largest compiled data on pediatric SLEDD-f use in critically ill patients.

https://openalex.org/W2801365749,"Repeated cycles of antibody-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy (ADEPT) and the use of glucarpidase in the detoxification of cytotoxic methotrexate (MTX) are highly desirable during cancer therapy but are hampered by the induced human antibody response to glucarpidase. Novel variants of glucarpidase (formal name: carboxypeptidase G2, CPG2) with epitopes not recognized by the immune system are likely to allow repeated cycles of ADEPT for effective cancer therapy. Towards this aim, over two thousand soil samples were collected and screened for folate hydrolyzing bacteria using folate as the sole carbon source. The work led to the isolation and the characterization of three new glucarpidase producing strains, which were designated as: Pseudomonas lubricans strain SF168, Stenotrophomonas sp SA and Xenophilus azovorans SN213. The CPG2 genes of Xenophilus azovorans SN213 (named Xen CPG2) and Stenotrophomonas sp SA (named Sten CPG2) were cloned and molecularly characterized. Both Xen CPG2 and Sten CPG2 share very close amino acid sequences (99%); we therefore, focused on the study of Xen CPG2. Finally, we demonstrated that a polyclonal antibody raised against our new CPG2, Xen CPG2, does not react with the CPG2 from Pseudomonas sp. strain RS-16 (Ps CPG2) that are currently in clinical use. The two enzymes, therefore could potentially be used consecutively in the ADEPT protocol to minimize the effect of the human antibody response that hampers current treatment with Ps CPG2. The identified novel CPG2 in this study will, therefore, pave the way for safer antibody directed enzyme pro-drug therapy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2802343633,"Background Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is a cause of urethritis. While resistance to azithromycin is increasing, routine detection of MG is not performed in Belgium, where its prevalence is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine prevalence of MG in men with urethritis. Method and findings An “in-house” amplification assay detecting MG was performed on urine of men with complaints of urethritis who consulted the emergency unit or the Sexually Transmitted Infection clinic of our public hospital in Brussels. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) were tested on the same sample. A total of 187 men were tested. Prevalence of MG was 9% (95% Confidence Interval: 5 to 13.2%). CT was detected in 20%, NG in 22% and 56% of samples were negative for these three pathogens. Neither age, ethnic origin, sexual orientation nor HIV infection were associated with MG urethritis. Conclusion M. genitalium was identified in 9% of men with complaints of urethritis indicating that amplification assay detecting MG should be implemented in routine testing for those patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800056140,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the spacing of lettuce rows on the production of a lettuce-rocket intercropping system over two growing seasons (11 August to 25 September 2011 and 12 January to 24 February 2012) in Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brazil. We evaluated 11 treatments in each season: lettuce-rocket intercrops with five row spacings for the lettuce (0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40 m) and the rocket planted midway between the lettuce rows, sole crops of lettuce at the same five row spacings and a sole crop of rocket. Fresh and dry masses of the lettuce and rocket and number of lettuce leaves per plant were highest with a lettuce row spacing of 0.40 m, but the productivities of the lettuce and rocket were higher with a lettuce row spacing of 0.20 m. The productivities and fresh and dry weights of the lettuce and rocket and the number of lettuce leaves per plant were highest in the sole crops, but the fresh and dry weights of the rocket were higher with intercropping. The land equivalent ratios were >1.0 in both seasons in all intercrops and were highest for the densest crop (1.41). Intercropping was therefore 41% more efficient than sole cropping for the production of lettuce and rocket."
https://openalex.org/W2800786251,"The RV144 Phase III clinical trial with ALVAC-HIV prime and AIDSVAX B/E subtypes CRF01_AE (A244) and B (MN) gp120 boost vaccine regime in Thailand provided a foundation for the future development of improved vaccine strategies that may afford protection against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Results from this trial showed that immune responses directed against specific regions V1V2 of the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1, were inversely correlated to the risk of HIV-1 infection. Due to the low production of gp120 proteins in CHO cells (2-20 mg/L), cleavage sites in V1V2 loops (A244) and V3 loop (MN) causing heterogeneous antigen products, it was an urgent need to generate CHO cells harboring A244 gp120 with high production yields and an additional, homogenous and uncleaved subtype B gp120 protein to replace MN used in RV144 for the future clinical trials. Here we describe the generation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines stably expressing vaccine HIV-1 Env antigens for these purposes: one expressing an HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE A244 Env gp120 protein (A244.AE) and one expressing an HIV-1 subtype B 6240 Env gp120 protein (6240.B) suitable for possible future manufacturing of Phase I clinical trial materials with cell culture expression levels of over 100 mg/L. The antigenic profiles of the molecules were elucidated by comprehensive approaches including analysis with a panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies recognizing critical epitopes using Biacore and ELISA, and glycosylation analysis by mass spectrometry, which confirmed previously identified glycosylation sites and revealed unknown sites of O-linked and N-linked glycosylations at non-consensus motifs. Overall, the vaccines given with MF59 adjuvant induced higher and more rapid antibody (Ab) responses as well as higher Ab avidity than groups given with aluminum hydroxide. Also, bivalent proteins (A244.AE and 6240.B) formulated with MF59 elicited distinct V2-specific Abs to the epitope previously shown to correlate with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection in the RV144 trial. All together, these results provide critical information allowing the consideration of these candidate gp120 proteins for future clinical evaluations in combination with a potent adjuvant."
https://openalex.org/W2803049663,"The ability of an individual to participate in courtroom proceedings is assessed by clinicians using legal ‘fitness to plead’ criteria. Findings of ‘unfitness’ are so rare that there is considerable professional unease concerning the utility of the current subjective assessment process. As a result, mentally disordered defendants may be subjected unfairly to criminal trials. The Law Commission in England and Wales has proposed legal reform, as well as the utilisation of a defined psychiatric instrument to assist in fitness to plead assessments. Similar legal reforms are occurring in other jurisdictions. Our objective was to produce and validate a standardised assessment instrument of fitness to plead employing a filmed vignette of criminal proceedings. The instrument was developed in consultation with legal and clinical professionals, and was refined using standard item reduction methods in two initial rounds of testing (n = 212). The factorial structure, test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the resultant instrument were assessed in a further round (n = 160). As a result of this iterative process a 25-item scale was produced, with an underlying two-factor structure representing the foundational and decision-making abilities underpinning fitness to plead. The sub-scales demonstrate good internal consistency (factor 1: 0·76; factor 2: 0·65) and test-retest stability (0·7) as well as excellent convergent validity with scores of intelligence, executive function and mentalising abilities (p≤0·01 in all domains). Overall the standardised Fitness to Plead Assessment instrument has good psychometric properties. It has the potential to ensure that the significant numbers of mentally ill and cognitively impaired individuals who face trial are objectively assessed, and the courtroom process critically informed."
https://openalex.org/W2799332380,"Objective To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of intraoperative ultrasonography in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for intrarenal tumors. Patients and methods All patients who underwent LPN for renal tumors in our institution from January 2010 to October 2016 were assessed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups, the first with totally intrarenal tumors (TIT group), defined as a solid renal mass with no exophytic element on both preoperative and intraoperative evaluations, and the second with exophytic tumors (control group). General information and perioperative data of the two groups were compared, including tumor characteristics, operative time, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time and pathological findings. Intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography (ILUS) was used to precisely locate and delineate the TIT border, as well as seeking for other suspected lesions. Results We identified 583 patients who underwent LPN in our center, including 46 in the TIT and 537 in the control group. All patients in the TIT group were evaluated by ILUS, and all TIT procedures were successfully performed with only one conversion to open surgery. The mean tumor sizes in the TIT and control groups were 2.42 ± 0.46 cm and 3.29 ± 1.43 cm (p < 0.001), respectively. The TIT group’s R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score was higher than that of the control group (median 8.5 vs 6.0, p < 0.001), and their mean operation times were 127.2 ± 16.0 min and 120.1 ± 19.2 min, respectively. Mean estimated blood loss was higher in the TIT than in the control group (161.3 ml vs 136.6 ml, p = 0.003). Mean warm ischemia time differed in the TIT and control groups (22.2 ± 6.4 vs 20.6 ± 4.7 min, p = 0.105), but not significantly. Rates of open conversion and positive margins, as well as rates of major postoperative complications, pathological findings, and 1-month changes in renal function, were similar in the two groups. Conclusion Intraoperative ultrasonography is technically feasible in patients undergoing LPN for TITs. This method may reduce the need for radical nephrectomy in patients with endogenic renal masses."
https://openalex.org/W2800788868,"The reliable assessment and management of avian pain is important in the context of animal welfare. Overtly expressed signs of pain vary substantially between and within species, strains and individuals, limiting the use of behaviour in pain studies. Similarly, physiological indices of pain can also vary and may be confounded by influence from non-painful stimuli. In mammals, changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded under light anaesthesia (the minimal anaesthesia model; MAM) have been shown to reliably indicate cerebral responses to noxious stimuli in a range of species. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the MAM can be applied to the study of nociception in birds. Ten chickens were lightly anaesthetised with halothane and their EEG recorded using surface electrodes during the application of supramaximal mechanical, thermal and electrical noxious stimuli. Spectral analysis revealed no EEG responses to any of these stimuli. Given that birds possess the neural apparatus to detect and process pain, and that the applied noxious stimuli elicit behavioural signs of pain in conscious chickens, this lack of response probably relates to methodological limitations. Anatomical differences between the avian and mammalian brains, along with a paucity of knowledge regarding specific sites of pain processing in the avian brain, could mean that EEG recorded from the head surface is insensitive to changes in neural activity in the pain processing regions of the avian brain. Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing."
https://openalex.org/W2801206235,"The shape of the cranial vault, a region comprising interlocking flat bones surrounding the cerebral cortex, varies considerably in humans. Strongly influenced by brain size and shape, cranial vault morphology has both clinical and evolutionary relevance. However, little is known about the genetic basis of normal vault shape in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on three vault measures (maximum cranial width [MCW], maximum cranial length [MCL], and cephalic index [CI]) in a sample of 4419 healthy individuals of European ancestry. All measures were adjusted by sex, age, and body size, then tested for association with genetic variants spanning the genome. GWAS results for the two cohorts were combined via meta-analysis. Significant associations were observed at two loci: 15p11.2 (lead SNP rs2924767, p = 2.107 × 10−8) for MCW and 17q11.2 (lead SNP rs72841279, p = 5.29 × 10−9) for MCL. Additionally, 32 suggestive loci (p < 5x10-6) were observed. Several candidate genes were located in these loci, such as NLK, MEF2A, SOX9 and SOX11. Genome-wide linkage analysis of cranial vault shape in mice (N = 433) was performed to follow-up the associated candidate loci identified in the human GWAS. Two loci, 17q11.2 (c11.loc44 in mice) and 17q25.1 (c11.loc74 in mice), associated with cranial vault size in humans, were also linked with cranial vault size in mice (LOD scores: 3.37 and 3.79 respectively). These results provide further insight into genetic pathways and mechanisms underlying normal variation in human craniofacial morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2801530275,"Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ots) is an obligate, intracellular, mite-transmitted human pathogen which causes scrub typhus. Understanding the diversity of Ots antigens is essential for designing specific diagnostic assays and efficient vaccines. The protective immunodominant type-specific 56 kDa antigen (TSA) of Ots varies locally and across its geographic distribution. TSA contains four hypervariable domains. We bioinformatically analyzed 345 partial sequences of TSA available from India, most of which contain only the three variable domains (VDI-III) and three spacer conserved domains (SVDI, SVDII/III, SVDIII). The total number (152) of antigenic types (amino acid variants) varied from 14–36 in the six domains of TSA that we studied. Notably, 55% (787/1435) of the predicted CD4 T-cell epitopes (TCEs) from all the six domains had high binding affinities (HBA) to at least one of the prevalent Indian human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. A surprisingly high proportion (61%) of such TCEs were from spacer domains; indeed 100% of the CD4 TCEs in the SVDI were HBA. TSA sequences from India had more antigenic types (AT) than TSA from Korea. Overall, >90% of predicted CD4 TCEs from spacer domains were predicted to have HBA against one or more prevalent HLA types from Indian, Korean, Asia-Pacific region or global population data sets, while only <50% of CD4 TCEs in variable domains exhibited such HBA. The phylogenetically and immunologically important amino acids in the conserved spacer domains were identified. Our results suggest that the conserved spacer domains are predicted to be functionally more important than previously appreciated in immune responses to Ots infections. Changes occurring at the TCE level of TSA may contribute to the wide range of pathogenicity of Ots in humans and mouse models. CD4 T-cell functional experiments are needed to assess the immunological significance of these HBA spacer domains and their role in clearance of Ots from Indian patients."
https://openalex.org/W2801673838,"This study is aimed at (i) estimating the angular leaf spot (ALS) disease severity in common beans crops in Brazil, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora griseola, employing leaf and canopy spectral reflectance data, (ii) evaluating the informative spectral regions in the detection, and (iii) comparing the estimation accuracy when the reflectance or the first derivative reflectance (FDR) is employed. Three data sets of useful spectral reflectance measurements in the 440 to 850 nm range were employed; measurements were taken over the leaves and canopy of bean crops with different levels of disease. A system based in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was developed to estimate the disease severity from leaf and canopy hyperspectral reflectance spectra. Levels of disease to be taken as true reference were determined from the proportion of the total leaf surface covered by necrotic lesions on RGB images. When estimating ALS disease severity in bean crops by using hyperspectral reflectance spectrometry, this study suggests that (i) successful estimations with coefficients of determination up to 0.87 can be achieved if the spectra is acquired by the spectroradiometer in contact with the leaves, (ii) unsuccessful estimations are obtained when the spectra are acquired by the spectroradiometer from one or more meters above the crop, (iii) the red to near-infrared spectral region (630–850 nm) offers the same precision in the estimation as the blue to near-infrared spectral region (440–850), and (iv) neither significant improvements nor significant detriments are achieved when the input data to the estimation processing system are the FDR spectra, instead of the reflectance spectra."

Endpoints were retinal detachment resolution, visual function, ERG amplitude, ocular survival, and patient survival from metastases.87 eyes of 84 retinoblastoma patients were included. Using a survival multistate model, by 36 months of follow-up, there was a 54% cumulative probability of complete retinal reattachment and a 76% probability of partial reattachment. 24% of eyes that completely reattached received only OAC without any prior or adjuvant treatments. Eyes that completely reattached were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed at a younger age (p<0.0001) and to have greater initial ERG values (p = 0.006). At final follow-up, 14% of eyes had gained at least 25 μV of ERG activity, and 8.0% had achieved hand motion vision or better, including one to 20/60. 13% of eyes were enucleated. No patient died from metastatic disease, and only one developed metastases.OAC can successfully treat previously considered ""non-salvageable"" retinoblastoma eyes with total retinal detachments, promote retinal reattachment in the majority of eyes, and preserve ocular and patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2799507746,"Background Clustering of breast and colorectal cancer has been observed within some families and cannot be explained by chance or known high-risk mutations in major susceptibility genes. Potential shared genetic susceptibility between breast and colorectal cancer, not explained by high-penetrance genes, has been postulated. We hypothesized that yet undiscovered genetic variants predispose to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Methods To identify variants associated with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from cases and controls that met the following criteria: cases (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, men/women with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer, and women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer. Controls (n = 1769), were unrelated, breast and colorectal cancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched to cases. After imputation, 6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci) were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 2,103 controls). Results Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene were suggestively associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the discovery and replication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery = 1.2E-04; rs7429100, Preplication = 2.8E-03). In meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data, the most significant association remained at rs7429100 (P = 1.84E-06). Conclusion The results of this exploratory analysis did not find clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary breast and colorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2799719720,"Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E2 are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (P<0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (P = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients."
https://openalex.org/W2799873069,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to increase asymmetry and variability of bilateral movements. However, the mechanisms of such abnormalities are not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate whether kinematic abnormalities are related to cortical participation during bilateral, cyclical ankle movements, which required i) maintenance of a specific frequency and ii) bilateral coordination of the lower limbs in an anti-phasic manner. We analyzed electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals from nine men with PD and nine aged-matched healthy men while they sat and cyclically dorsi- and plantarflexed their feet. This movement was performed at a similar cadence to normal walking under two conditions: i) self-paced and ii) externally paced by a metronome. Participants with PD exhibited reduced range of motion and more variable bilateral coordination. However, participants with and without PD did not differ in the magnitude of corticomuscular coherence between the midline cortical areas and tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles. This finding suggests that either the kinematic abnormalities were related to processes outside linear corticomuscular communication or PD-related changes in neural correlates maintained corticomuscular communication but not motor performance."
https://openalex.org/W2800119303,"Ototyphlonemertes is a cosmopolitan genus of meiofaunal nemerteans. Their morphological characters are insufficient to reliably identify and delimit species. Consequently, some of the species are considered cosmopolitan despite anticipated low dispersion capability of the adults and a short planktonic larval phase. Indeed, recent studies show that some species actually comprise cryptic species, and populations are connected by stochastic events of long-distance dispersion. Based solely on morphological traits, a Lactea and a Pallida morph of Ototyphlonemertes are recognized here from collections at eight and five locations respectively along the Chilean coast. To assess the phylogeographic patterns of their populations, two mitochondrial markers (COI and COX3) of 162 specimens of Lactea and 25 of Pallida were sequenced. Final sequences are 605bp and 362bp for COI and COX3, respectively. Results from phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses suggest that the Lactea morph comprises up to three independent evolutionary units (one with only COX3 sequences). A COI gene tree including other previously published Ototyphlonemertes sequences groups the Chilean Lactea with other Lactea, while the Chilean Pallida is grouped with other Pallida. Different structuring and gene flow patterns found for the four groups support the hypothesis that these are four independent evolutionary entities with different ecological, dispersal and demographical characteristics."

Here, a chicken 600k SNP-array was employed to detect the signals of artificial selection using 331 individuals from 9 breeds, including Jingfen (JF), Jinghong (JH), Araucanas (AR), White Leghorn (WL), Pekin-Bantam (PB), Shamo (SH), Gallus-Gallus-Spadiceus (GA), Rheinlander (RH) and Vorwerkhuhn (VO). Per the population genetic structure, 9 breeds were combined into 5 breed-pools, and a 'two-step' strategy was used to reveal the signals of artificial selection. GA, which has little artificial selection, was defined as the reference population, and a total of 204, 155, 305 and 323 potential artificial selection signals were identified in AR_VO, PB, RH_WL and JH_JF, respectively. We also found signals derived from standing and de-novo genetic variations have contributed to adaptive evolution during artificial selection. Further enrichment analysis suggests that the genomic regions of artificial selection signals harbour genes, including THSR, PTHLH and PMCH, responsible for economic traits, such as fertility, growth and immunization. Overall, this study found a series of genes that contribute to the improvement of chicken breeds and revealed the genetic mechanisms of adaptive evolution, which can be used as fundamental information in future chicken functional genomics study."
https://openalex.org/W2802764766,"Although, United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest prevalence of overweight, obesity and type 2 diabetes in the world, however, validated dietary assessment aids to estimate food intake of individuals and populations in the UAE are currently lacking. We conducted two observational studies to evaluate the accuracy of a photographic food atlas which was developed as a tool for food portion size estimation in the UAE. The UAE Food Atlas presents eight portion sizes for each food. Study 1 involved portion size estimations of 13 food items consumed during the previous day. Study 2 involved portion size estimations of nine food items immediately after consumption. Differences between the food portion sizes estimated from the photographs and the weighed food portions (estimation error), as well as the percentage differences relative to the weighed food portion for each tested food item were calculated. Four of the evaluated food items were underestimated (by -8.9% to -18.4%), while nine were overestimated (by 9.5% to 90.9%) in Study 1. Moreover, there were significant differences between estimated and eaten food portions for eight food items (P<0.05). In Study 2, one food item was underestimated (-8.1%) while eight were overestimated (range 2.52% to 82.1%). Furthermore, there were significant differences between estimated and eaten food portions (P<0.05) for six food items. The limits of agreement between the estimated and consumed food portion size were wide indicating a large variability in food portion estimation errors. These reported findings highlight the need for further developments of the UAE Food Atlas to improve the accuracy of food portion size intake estimations in dietary assessments. Additionally, recalling food portions from the previous day did not seem to increase food portion estimation errors in this study."

The study participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination, including retinal photography. Assessing fundus photograohs, ERMs were classified as cellophane macular reflex (CMR) without retinal folds, or as preretinal macular fibrosis (PMF) without or with retinal folds.Fundus photographs were available for 2476 subjects with a mean age of 69.0±7.8 years (range:51-93 years) and mean axial length of 23.3±0.9 mm (range:19.92-26.33mm). The 10-year incidence of ERMs was 8.4% (208/2476 participants; 95% confidence interval (CI):7.4,9.5). ERMs developed bilaterally in 50 (24%) individuals and unilaterally in 158 (76%) persons. The incidence of PMFs with 2.5% (95% CI: 1.9, 3.1) was lower than the incidence of CMRs with 5.9% (95% CI: 5.0, 6.9). Higher 10-year incidence of ERMs was associated with older age (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR): 1.06; 95%CI:1.04,1.09), previous cataract surgery (P = 0.003;OR:3.32;95%CI:1.51,7.29) and presence of a complete posterior vitreous detachment (P = 0.02;OR:1.84;95%CI:1.12,3.02). In the age groups of <60 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years and 80+years, incidence of ERMs was 3.1%, 10.0%, 14.4% and 10.9%, respectively, with no significant gender difference.In Chinese aged 40+ years, the 10-year incidence of ERMs (8.4%) increased with older age, previous cataract surgery and complete posterior vitreous detachment.

https://openalex.org/W2800853513,"Amphotericin B (AmB) is a recommended medication for the treatment of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in cases of therapeutic failure with first-line medications; however, little is known about the in vitro susceptibility to AmB of clinical isolates of the subgenus Viannia, which is most prevalent in South America. This work aimed to determine the in vitro susceptibility profiles to AmB of clinical isolates of the species L. (V.) panamensis, L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis. In vitro susceptibility to AmB was evaluated for 65 isolates. Macrophages derived from the U937 cell line were infected with promastigotes and exposed to different AmB concentrations. After 96 hours, the number of intracellular amastigotes was quantified by qPCR, and median effective concentration (EC50) was determined using the PROBIT model. The controls included sensitive strains and experimentally derived less sensitive strains generated in vitro, which presented EC50 values up to 7.57-fold higher than the values of the sensitive strains. The isolates were classified into groups according to their in vitro susceptibility profiles using Ward's hierarchical method. The susceptibility to AmB differed in an intraspecies-specific manner as follows: 28.21% (11/39) of L. (V.) panamensis strains, 50% (3/6) of L. (V.) guyanensis strains and 34.61% (9/26) of L. (V.) braziliensis strains were classified as less sensitive. The latter subset featured three susceptibility groups. We identified Colombian isolates with different AmB susceptibility profiles. In addition, the capacity of species of subgenus Viannia to develop lower susceptibility to AmB was demonstrated in vitro. These new findings should be considered in the pharmacovigilance of AmB in Colombia and South America."

However, LV afterload consists of both valvular and arterial loads, and the benefits of TAVR may be attenuated if the arterial load dominates. We proposed a new hemodynamic index, the Relative Valve Load (RVL), a ratio of mean gradient (MG) and valvuloarterial impedance (Zva), to describe the relative contribution of the valvular load to the global LV load, and examined whether RVL predicted patient outcome following TAVR.A total of 258 patients with symptomatic severe AS (indexed aortic valve area (AVA)<0.6cm2/m2, AR≤2+) underwent successful TAVR at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and had clinical follow-up to 1-year post-TAVR. Pre-TAVR MG, AVA, percent stroke work loss (%SWL), Zva and RVL were measured by echocardiography. The primary endpoint was all cause mortality at 1-year post TAVR.There were 53 deaths (20.5%) at 1-year. RVL≤7.95ml/m2 had a sensitivity of 60.4% and specificity of 75.1% for identifying all cause mortality at 1-year post-TAVR and provided better specificity than MG<40 mmHg, AVA>0.75cm2, %SWL≤25% and Zva>5mmHg/ml/m2 despite equivalent or better sensitivity. In multivariable Cox analysis, RVL≤7.95ml/m2 was an independent predictor of all cause mortality (HR 3.2, CI 1.8-5.9; p<0.0001). RVL≤7.95ml/m2 was predictive of all cause mortality in both low flow and normal flow severe AS.RVL is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in severe AS patients undergoing TAVR. A pre-procedural RVL≤7.95ml/m2 identifies AS patients at increased risk of death despite TAVR and may assist with decision making on the benefits of TAVR."
https://openalex.org/W2800907237,"Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids concentrated in glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. Mainly restricted to the nervous system in healthy adult, complex gangliosides such as GD3 and GD2 have been shown to be involved in aggressiveness and metastasis of neuro-ectoderm derived tumors such as melanoma and neuroblastoma. GD3 synthase (GD3S), the key enzyme that controls the biosynthesis of complex gangliosides, was shown to be over-expressed in Estrogen Receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer tumors, and associated with a decreased overall survival of patients. We previously demonstrated that GD3S expression in ER-negative breast cancer cells induced a proliferative phenotype and an increased tumor growth. In addition, our results clearly indicate that Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) induced GD3S over-expression in breast cancer cells via NFκB pathway. In this study, we analyzed the effect of TNF on ganglioside biosynthesis and expression in breast cancer cells from different molecular subtypes. We showed that TNF up-regulated the expression of GD3S in MCF-7 and Hs578T cells, whereas no change was observed for MDA-MB-231. We also showed that TNF induced an increased expression of complex gangliosides at the cell surface of a small proportion of MCF-7 cells. These results demonstrate that TNF differentially regulates gangliosides expression in breast cancer cell lines and establish a possible link between inflammation at the tumor site environment, expression of complex gangliosides and tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2802514883,"The purpose of this study was to elaborate on the anastomoses between the paraumbilical and systemic veins, particularly the ensiform veins. The connections with the ensiform veins have received little attention in the anatomical and radiological literature, and remain incompletely described. Too small to be reliably traced in normal CT scans, the paraumbilical veins can dilate in response to increased blood flow from systemic veins in superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO), allowing a study of their arrangement and connections. Collateral paraumbilical veins were therefore analyzed retrospectively in 28 patients with SVCO using CT. We observed inferior and superior groups of collateral vessels in 23/28 (82%) and 17/28 (61%) patients, respectively. Inferior veins ascended towards the liver and drained into portal veins (19/28, 68%) or the umbilical vein (8/28, 29%); superior veins descended and drained into portal veins. The inferior veins (N = 27) could be traced to ensiform veins in almost all of the cases (26/27, 96%), and a little over half (14/27, 52%) were also traceable to subcutaneous and deep epigastric veins. They were opacified by ensiform (25/27, 93%), deep epigastric (4/27, 15%) and subcutaneous (4/27, 15%) veins. The superior veins (N = 17) were supplied by diaphragmatic (13/17, 76%) and ensiform veins (4/17, 24%); the diaphragmatic veins were branches of collateral internal thoracic, left pericardiacophrenic and anterior mediastinal veins. Collateral ensiform veins were observed in 22 patients and anastomosed with internal thoracic (19/22, 86%), superior epigastric (9/22, 41%), diaphragmatic (4/22, 18%), subcutaneous (3/22, 14%) and anterior mediastinal veins (1/22, 5%). These observations show that the paraumbilical veins communicate with ensiform, deep epigastric, subcutaneous and diaphragmatic veins, joining the liver to the properitoneal fat pad, anterior trunk, diaphragm and mediastinum. In SVCO, the most common sources of collateral flow to the paraumbilical veins are the ensiform and diaphragmatic branches of the internal thoracic veins."
https://openalex.org/W2799964237,"In complex graphical representations, the relevant information for a specific task is often distributed across multiple spatial locations. In such situations, understanding the representation requires internal transformation processes in order to extract the relevant information. However, digital technology enables observers to alter the spatial arrangement of depicted information and therefore to offload the transformation processes. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of such a representation control (i.e. the users' option to decide how information should be displayed) in order to accomplish an information extraction task in terms of solution time and accuracy. In the representation control condition, the participants were allowed to reorganize the graphical representation and reduce information density. In the control condition, no interactive features were offered. We observed that participants in the representation control condition solved tasks that required reorganization of the maps faster and more accurate than participants without representation control. The present findings demonstrate how processes of cognitive offloading, spatial contiguity, and information coherence interact in knowledge media intended for broad and diverse groups of recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2801229673,"Oxidative stress is a pathophysiological mechanism potentially involved in psychiatric disorders. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between total antioxidant status (TAS) and the functional status of patients with a first episode of psychosis at the onset of the disease. For this purpose, a sample of 70 patients aged between 9 and 17 years with a first episode of psychosis were followed up for a period of two years. Blood samples were drawn to measure TAS levels at three time points: at baseline, at one year, and at two years. Clinical symptoms and functioning were also assessed at the same time points using various scales. Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between TAS and clinical status at each assessment, adjusting for potential confounding factors. The distribution of clinical variables was grouped in different percentiles to assess the dose-response in the relation between clinical variables and TAS. At baseline, patient's score on Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) was directly and significantly associated with TAS with a monotonic increase in percentiles, and surprising this association was reversed after one and two years of follow-up with a monotonic decrease. In summary at the onset of the illness, TAS is positively related to clinical status, whereas as the illness progresses this correlation is reversed and becomes negative. This may be the result of an adaptive response."
https://openalex.org/W2802789271,"The goal of this study is to discover disease co-occurrence and sequence patterns from large scale cancer diagnosis histories in New York State. In particular, we want to identify disparities among different patient groups. Our study will provide essential knowledge for clinical researchers to further investigate comorbidities and disease progression for improving the management of multiple diseases. We used inpatient discharge and outpatient visit records from the New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) from 2011-2015. We grouped each patient’s visit history to generate diagnosis sequences for seven most popular cancer types. We performed frequent disease co-occurrence mining using the Apriori algorithm, and frequent disease sequence patterns discovery using the cSPADE algorithm. Different types of cancer demonstrated distinct patterns. Disparities of both disease co-occurrence and sequence patterns were observed from patients within different age groups. There were also considerable disparities in disease co-occurrence patterns with respect to different claim types (i.e., inpatient, outpatient, emergency department and ambulatory surgery). Disparities regarding genders were mostly found where the cancer types were gender specific. Supports of most patterns were usually higher for males than for females. Compared with secondary diagnosis codes, primary diagnosis codes can convey more stable results. Two disease sequences consisting of the same diagnoses but in different orders were usually with different supports. Our results suggest that the methods adopted can generate potentially interesting and clinically meaningful disease co-occurrence and sequence patterns, and identify disparities among various patient groups. These patterns could imply comorbidities and disease progressions."
https://openalex.org/W2950544665,"The Glycoside Hydrolase Family 13 (GH13) is both evolutionarily diverse and relevant to many industrial applications. Its members hydrolyze starch into smaller carbohydrates and members of the family have been bioengineered to improve catalytic function under industrial environments. We introduce a framework to analyze the response to selection of GH13 protein structures given some phylogenetic and simulated dynamic information. We find that the TIM-barrel (a conserved protein fold consisting of eight α-helices and eight parallel β-strands that alternate along the peptide backbone, common to all amylases) is not selectable since it is under purifying selection. We also show a method to rank important residues with higher inferred response to selection. These residues can be altered to effect change in properties. In this work, we define fitness as inferred thermodynamic stability. We show that under the developed framework, residues 112Y, 122K, 124D, 125W, and 126P are good candidates to increase the stability of the truncated α-amylase protein from Geobacillus thermoleovorans (PDB code: 4E2O; α-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.1). Overall, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of a framework for the analysis of protein structures for any other fitness landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2801343945,"Background Anti-RhD immunised donors provide anti-RhD immunoglobulins used for the prevention of rhesus disease. These donors are periodically hyper-immunised (boostered) to retain a high titer level of anti-RhD. Study design and methods We analysed anti-RhD donor records from 1998 to 2016, consisting of 30,116 anti-RhD titers from 755 donors, encompassing 3,372 booster events. Various models were fit to these data to allow describing the anti-RhD titers over time. Results A random effects model with a log-linear anti-RhD titer decline over time and a saturating titer response to boostering is shown to fit the data well. This model contains two general model parameters, relating timing and maximum of the booster effect, as well as two parameters characterizing the individual donor, namely how fast the booster effect saturates with current titer and the anti-RhD decline rate. The average individual log2 decline is 0.55 per year, i.e. a 32% decline in absolute titer, with half of the donors declining between 13% and 41% per year. Their anti-RhD titer peaks around 26 days following a booster event. Boostering response reduces with higher titers at boostering; at median titer (log2 11) the mean increase per booster is log2 0.38, that is from an absolute titer of 2048 to 2665 (+30%), with half of all donors increasing between 16% and 65% in their titer. Conclusion The model describes anti-RhD titer change per individual with only four parameters, two of which are donor specific. This information can be used to enhance the blood bank’s immunisation programme, by deriving individualized immunization policies in which boostering is adjusted to the anticipated anti-RhD decline, effectiveness of boostering and titer levels required."
https://openalex.org/W2802689369,"This study's purpose was to analyze and quantify the impact of auditory information loss versus information gain provided by electronic travel aids (ETAs) on navigation performance in people with low vision. Navigation performance of ten subjects (age: 54.9±11.2 years) with visual acuities >1.0 LogMAR was assessed via the Graz Mobility Test (GMT). Subjects passed through a maze in three different modalities: 'Normal' with visual and auditory information available, 'Auditory Information Loss' with artificially reduced hearing (leaving only visual information), and 'ETA' with a vibrating ETA based on ultrasonic waves, thereby facilitating visual, auditory, and tactile information. Main performance measures comprised passage time and number of contacts. Additionally, head tracking was used to relate head movements to motion direction. When comparing 'Auditory Information Loss' to 'Normal', subjects needed significantly more time (p<0.001), made more contacts (p<0.001), had higher relative viewing angles (p = 0.002), and a higher percentage of orientation losses (p = 0.011). The only significant difference when comparing 'ETA' to 'Normal' was a reduced number of contacts (p<0.001). Our study provides objective, quantifiable measures of the impact of reduced hearing on the navigation performance in low vision subjects. Significant effects of 'Auditory Information Loss' were found for all measures; for example, passage time increased by 17.4%. These findings show that low vision subjects rely on auditory information for navigation. In contrast, the impact of the ETA was not significant but further analysis of head movements revealed two different coping strategies: half of the subjects used the ETA to increase speed, whereas the other half aimed at avoiding contacts."
