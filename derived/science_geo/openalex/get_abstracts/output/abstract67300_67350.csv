https://openalex.org/W1990804066,"Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were administered to rats while the activities of single, serotonin-containing neurons of the midbrain raphe nuclei were being monitored with microelectrodes. All the inhibitors tested (pargyline, tranylcypromine, phenelzine, iproniazid) caused depression of raphe unit firing rate. The ability of monoamine oxidase inhibitors to depress raphe units was impaired by prior treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006457802,"The conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, previously demonstrated in athyreotic human subjects, has been investigated in normal subjects who were given intravenous injections of purified thyroxine labeled with carbon-14 in ring A and in the alanine side chain. Evidence for the conversion of T4 to T3 was provided by the finding of carbon-14 in the T3 fraction isolated from serums. It is estimated that an appreciable fraction of T4 may be transformed to T3 in normal man."

https://openalex.org/W2002866205,"In dogs which are panting due to a heat load, most of the respired air enters through the nose and leaves through the mouth. Different patterns of flow are, however, possible. The unidirectional flow over the evaporative (nasal) surfaces is an important mechanism for regulating the amount of heat dissipated in panting."

https://openalex.org/W2029223707,"Rats were adrenalectomized 10 days before we estimated in vivo the conversion index of (3)H-tryptophan into radioactive serotonin in brainstem and telediencephalon. We found that the conversion index in the brainstem of adrenalectomized rats is smaller than in the same area of sham-operated rats. Conversely, the conversion index in the telediencephalon was similar in the two groups of rats. The serotonin concentrations were unchanged by adrenalectomy, which suggests that in brainstem the decrease of tryptophan hydroxylase is reflected by the conversion index estimation and not by measurement of serotonin steady-state concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2068313979,Lead poisoning was diagnosed in four primates by the finding of toxic amounts of lead in tissues. Abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord were characterized by vascular lesions and demyelination. These findings suggest a new animal model for the study of demyelination and strengthen the supposition that lead may be a factor in some idiopathic demyelinating diseases.
https://openalex.org/W2095059616,"Oxychlordane (C(10)H(4)Cl(8)O), a minor heretofore unidentified metabolite, was isolated from fat of pigs on diets heavily dosed with pure isomers of the insecticide, chlordane (C(10)H(6)Cl(8)). Chemical and spectroscopic evidence provides bases for proposal of structure of the metabolite as 1-exo-2-endo-4,5,6,7,8,8-octachloro-2,3-exo-epoxy-2,3,3a,4,7,7a-hexahydro-4,7-methanoindene."
https://openalex.org/W2025084039,"Prenatal behavior develops in three phases: early rates, acceleration and maintenance, and deceleration to birth. Fetal activity occurs as discrete movements, bursts of activity, and prolonged activity. Four-hour samples were most representative of the daily rates of movement."
https://openalex.org/W2006833109,"ATTEMPTS to explain the morphological changes of the kidney induced by lead poisoning have been concerned chiefly with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions1,2. Cytoplasmic inclusions have been shown to contain Fe (ref. 1), but the composition of nuclear inclusions remains a subject for debate. It is still not clear whether lead is deposited within the kidney and some authors deny a direct action of this element in favour of a mechanism of indirect action through vascular changes3. Fortunately, the problem of detection of metallic localizations within the kidney is amenable to direct observations with the electron probe microanalyser, an instrument ideally suited to the purpose, with a detection limit of about 10−15 g and a spatial resolution of about 1 µm (ref. 4)."

https://openalex.org/W2034366988,"RIFAMPICIN prevents vaccinia virus growth1,2 by a still undefined mechanism. Viral DNA and early and late species of messenger RNA are synthesized in the presence of rifampicin3–6; early and late viral proteins are also made, although synthesis of the latter declines sooner than in the absence of the drug3,4,6,7. Rifampicin does not inhibit the RNA polymerase activity contained within purified vaccinia virus particles3,5,7–9, but the drug prevents the formation of particulate RNA polymerase activity5. This enzyme can ordinarily be demonstrated, at late times in vaccinia-infected cells, after treatment of cytoplasmic fractions with mercaptoethanol and detergents10–13. Rifampicin has also been found to block vaccinia virus assembly during the formation of the viral envelope and preceding the appearance of virus particles6,14. The sequence of events which follows the removal of rifampicin has now been examined in order to correlate the effects observed on the formation of the late particulate RNA polymerase activity and on the assembly of viral envelopes."

https://openalex.org/W2068332588,"Monoclinic crystals of the sodium salt of cytidine 2',3'-phosphate contain two anions in the asymmetric unit. Both bases are in the syn conformation, and the nucleotides are stacked together into an antiparallel stranded ribbon with the bases 3.3 angstroms apart. One ribose ring is planar, and the other has oxygen-1' puckered toward carbon-5'. The phosphorus atoms in the five-membered ester rings are puckered toward the sugars. The conformations about the carbon-4'-carbon-5' bonds are gauche-trans and gauche-gauche."
https://openalex.org/W2014117917,"RIFAMPICIN inhibits the replication of poxvirus1,2; experiments with other rifamycin derivatives suggested that the hydrazone side-chain of rifampicin was essential for its antiviral activity3. We describe here the action of the characteristic component of this side-chain, l-methyl-4-aminopiperazine, and compare it with that of the other analogue of rifampicin, 3-formylrifamycin SV (FSV), and another compound, l-methyl-4-benzylidenaminopiperazine, which contains the hydrazone side-chain but not the rifamycin moiety."

https://openalex.org/W1999775386,Thymine trimer was isolated from a frozen aqueous solution of thymine which was irradiated with ultraviolet light and was presumably formed through the rearrangement of an initial oxetane photoproduct. X-ray diffraction analysis of a single crystal has confirmed the trimeric diol structure and has established the stereoconfiguration of the molecule. The possible importance of the diol structure in photobiology is pointed out.

https://openalex.org/W2079892190,"The suggestion is made that isotope tracing be carried out by monitoring the natural variations in deuterium concentrations. As an example, the natural variations in deuterium concentrations between food and water collected in Illinois and food and water collected in Colorado were used to determine the residence time of water in the blood and urine of rats. We observed not only a 5(1/2)-day turnover time of water in the blood and urine, but also evidence for the influx of water vapor from the atmosphere through the lungs into the blood."
