https://openalex.org/W1750690213,"The rate of autoxidation of epinephrine and the sensitivity of this autoxidation to inhibition by superoxide dismutase were both augmented, as the pH was raised from 7.8 → 10.2. O2-, generated by the xanthine oxidase reaction, caused the oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome and the yield of adrenochrome produced per O2- introduced, increased with increasing pH in the range 7.8 → 10.2 and also increased with increasing concentration of epinephrine. These results, in conjunction with complexities in the kinetics of adrenochrome accumulation, lead to the proposal that the autoxidation of epinephrine proceeds by at least two distinct pathways, only one of which is a free radical chain reaction involving O2- and hence inhibitable by superoxide dismutase. This chain reaction accounted for a progressively greater fraction of the total oxidation as the pH was raised. The ability of superoxide dismutase to inhibit the autoxidation of epinephrine at pH 10.2 has been used as the basis of a convenient and sensitive assay for this enzyme."

This difference could be observed in splitbrain monkeys executing a visuomotor task with one eye covered, provided tactile guidance of the movements was largely prevented."
https://openalex.org/W1579075259,"The site of synthesis of lipopolysaccharide has been investigated in cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions isolated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation of the total membrane fraction from lysozyme-EDTA spheroplasts. Evidence that synthesis of O-antigen occurs exclusively in cytoplasmic membrane was obtained by pulse-chase experiments in vivo and by assay of biosynthetic enzymes in isolated membrane fractions. O-Antigen chains pulse-labeled in vivo with [14C]mannose appeared initially in cytoplasmic membrane, but were rapidly transferred to outer membrane during a subsequent chase with nonradioactive mannose. In accord, the specific activities of enzymes of O-antigen synthesis in isolated cytoplasmic membrane fractions were 15- to 30-fold greater than in outer membrane. The cytoplasmic membrane fractions were also enriched for glycosyltransferase activities involved in biosynthesis of the core region of lipopolysaccharide. However, unequivocal localization of core transferase enzymes in the isolated membranes was not possible since these activities were also found with soluble fraction, and secondary binding of soluble enzyme to both cytoplasmic and outer membrane was shown to occur during the isolation procedure. Evidence that the cytoplasmic membrane is the site of synthesis of the core region was derived from pulse-chase experiments in a mutant in which [14C]galactose is incorporated exclusively into the core portion of the polysaccharide. Over 90% of the [14C]galactose incorporated into lipopolysaccharide during a 1-min pulse was recovered in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction. The mechanism of translocation of lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane is unknown. Evidence suggesting that the process is not readily reversible was obtained in experiments in mutants with conditional defects in lipopolysaccharide synthesis. Incomplete lipopolysaccharides incorporated into outer membrane during growth under nonpermissive conditions could not be completed following subsequent shift to permissive growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1554943836,"Abstract We find no difference in the rate of translation of α- and β-globin mRNA in cell-free extracts of rabbit reticulocytes (about 200 s per chain at 25°) nor in the rate of release of completed globin chains from polyribosomes (about 15 s per chain). In these reactions, as well as incubation of intact reticulocytes, each β-globin mRNA contains 30 to 40% more ribosomes than each α-mRNA. These results imply that each β-mRNA initiates synthesis of about 40% more β-globin than each α-mRNA initiates synthesis of α chains. Hence, reticulocytes must contain 30 to 40% more α-mRNA than β in order to synthesize equal numbers of the two hemoglobin chains. This conclusion is consistent with results of a previous indirect measure of the relative amounts of α- and β-globin mRNA (Lodish, H. F. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7131)."
https://openalex.org/W1531754583,"Abstract A method for the large scale preparation of chymotrypsin Inhibitor I from potato tubers is described. The method utilizes the inhibitor's stability to acid at elevated temperatures and its dissociation in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride into subunits (protomers) to produce the pure protein with a 47% recovery and a 40-fold purification. Ion exchange chromatography on sulfoethylcellulose in the presence of 0.1 m formic acid in 8 m urea resolves Inhibitor I protomers into two major and two minor types. After reassociation to the tetramer form by dilution, one of the two major rechromatographed protomers was shown to be a powerful inhibitor of both chymotrypsin and trypsin, whereas the other strongly inhibits chymotrypsin but only weakly inhibits trypsin. All four purified protomers resolved from Inhibitor I can be reassociated either individually or hybridized with each other to form tetrameric isoinhibitors. Tetrameric Inhibitor I species prepared from each of the four protomeric types all have an NH2-terminal glutamic acid. However, they differ quantitatively from each other in amino acid composition, reactivity with chymotrypsin and trypsin, digestibility by pepsin, and electrophoretic mobility. Tetrameric Inhibitor I in potatoes is therefore a heterogeneous mixture of isoinhibitors whose properties reflect those of its individual protomers. The molecular weights of tetrameric Inhibitor I and its complex with chymotrypsin were re-evaluated. The molecular weight of Inhibitor I was found to be 39,000 ± 2,000, and that of its complex saturated with chymotrypsin, 140,000 ± 4,600."
https://openalex.org/W1565797700,"Studies were conducted to isolate and characterize rat serum retinol-binding protein (RBP), the specific transport protein for vitamin A in the rat. RBP was isolated from rat serum by a sequence of procedures which included: precipitation with ammonium sulfate between 30 and 50% saturation; chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex; gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and G-100; and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These procedures resulted in RBP which had been purified approximately 2,300-fold, and which was completely pure by physical and by immunological criteria. Purified rat RBP has α1 mobility, a sedimentation constant (s20,w) of 2.06 S, and a molecular weight of approximately 20,000. The properties of rat RBP resemble those of human plasma RBP in many ways. The two proteins have nearly identical ultraviolet absorption spectra (peak maxima at 280 and 330 nm) and fluorescence emission and excitation spectra. The amino acid compositions of rat and human RBP are somewhat similar, both with a fairly high content of aromatic amino acids. A specific antirat RBP antiserum was prepared in a rabbit. There was no immunological cross-reactivity between rat and human RBP, indicating that the two proteins are immunologically completely distinct. In plasma, rat RBP circulates in the form of a protein-protein complex, with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 60,000 to 70,000. The protein (prealbumin-2) with which RBP interacts to form a complex has an electrophoretic mobility slightly greater than that of rat serum albumin. Purified prealbumin-2 has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 45,000 to 50,000. Prealbumin-2 may also represent a major transport protein for thyroid hormone in the rat."

The diatom grew faster and was therefore dominant in control cultures, but its dominance diminished in treated cultures, even at concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons that had no apparent effect in pure cultures. Such stable pollutants could disrupt the species composition of phytoplankton communities, thereby affecting whole eco-systems."
https://openalex.org/W1563767697,"The transfer reaction of [14C]methylamine into the acetylated B chain of oxidized insulin as catalyzed by several transglutaminases has been studied at pH 7.5 in the presence of calcium ion. The only radioactive product of the transfer reaction with each transglutaminase was identified as peptide-bound γ-glutamic acid methylamide. Initial velocity and product inhibition patterns for the human plasma and guinea pig hair follicle transglutaminases are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism, previously proposed for guinea pig liver transglutaminase (F olk , J. E. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3707) in which acyl enzyme formed from peptide-bound glutamine may react with water (hydrolysis) or with a primary amine (transfer). Hydrolysis and isotope exchange in the presence of one substrate and one product add substantial support for this mechanism. The pattern of calcium activation of plasma transglutaminase in the transfer reaction is in accord with an equilibrium-ordered activation mechanism in which the first substrate, acetylated B chain of oxidized insulin, adds only to enzyme-metal complex. The similarity in the kinetic constants obtained for human plasma and platelet transglutaminases adds support to recent evidence that the catalytic subunits of the plasma and platelet zymogens and enzymes are closely related (S chwartz , M. L., P izzo , S. V., H ill , R. L., and M c K ee , P. A. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5851). Improved purification procedures for plasma and platelet protransglutaminases are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2147039156,"Abstract The transamination by pig mitochondrial and supernatant aspartate transaminase of aromatic amino acids was studied in order to determine if an analogy exists between these enzymes and a previously reported brain phenylalanine transaminase (George, H., and Gabay, S. (1968) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 167, 555). Supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase from pig heart can utilize aromatic amino acids as substrates. Phenylalanine and other aromatic amino acids are competitive inhibitors of the transamination between glutamate and aspartate and their respective keto acids. The inhibition constants (Ki) are: phenylalanine = 6.8 mm, tryptophan = 4.1 mm, and tyrosine = 3.9 mm for the supernatant enzyme; and phenylalanine = 18.4 mm, tryptophan = 12 mm, and tyrosine = 3.3 mm for the mitochondrial enzyme. It can be shown that phenylalanine reacts with the pyridoxal form of both isozymes (absorbance, 350 to 360 nm) to generate the pyridoxamine form of the enzyme (absorbance, 330 nm). This form reconverts into the pyridoxal form upon addition of either phenylpyruvate or α-ketoglutarate, completing a full transamination cycle between an amino acid and its analogous keto acid or with acceptor keto acid. Other non-aromatic amino acids, with the exception of methionine, are considerably poorer substrates. At pH 8.3 the transamination rates of isolated pig heart supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase with phenylalanine as amino donor and α-ketoglutarate as acceptor are 12 and 200 nmoles of glutamate formed per hour per µg. The substrate dissociation constants, as determined by direct spectrophotometric titrations of the isoenzyme's active site, are: phenylalanine = 18.3 mm and phenylpyruvate = 0.4 mm for the mitochondrial enzyme and phenylalanine = 25 mm and phenylpyruvate = 0.6 mm for supernatant enzyme. These values are comparable to those of purified brain phenylalanine transaminase. Immunological and electrophoretic studies reveal identity between the isoenzymes of heart aspartate transaminase and brain phenylalanine transaminase. Antibodies against the heart enzyme inhibit the brain enzyme, with a concomitant decrease in both the aspartate transaminase and phenylalanine transaminases activities. After inhibition by heart's supernatant and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase antibodies, the ratio of aspartate transaminase activity to phenylalanine transaminase remains constant throughout the brain's enzyme purification procedure. It appears that because of substrate specificity, substrate affinity, transamination rates, inhibition by phenylalanine, inhibition by antibodies and electrophoretic mobility, pig brain phenylalanine transaminase is aspartate transaminase. Brain contains both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoenzymes. Because of a higher rate of utilization of phenylalanine by the mitochondrial enzyme, it is suggested that the production of phenylpyruvate in brain might preferentially occur, in vivo, through the participation of mitochondrial glutamate aspartate transaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1525056862,"Abstract UDP-glucose:d-fructose 2-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.14), commonly called sucrose synthetase, has been purified from etiolated Phaseolus aureus seedlings to homogeneity by electrophoretic, immunological, and ultracentrifugal criteria. Molecular weight determinations by low speed equilibrium centrifugation yields a value of 375,000 ± 12,000. A value of 405,000 ± 20,000 was obtained by gel filtration. Other physical determinations for the enzyme yielded the following data: s20,w = 12.4 x 10-13 sec-1; diffusion constant (D20,w) = 3.03 x 10-7 cm-2 sec-1; and f/f0 = 1.49. Subunit analyses indicate that the enzyme is a tetramer composed of identical protein subunits of approximate molecular weight 94,000. An equilibrium constant of 0.15 for the sucrose synthetase reaction at pH 7.5 and 25° in the direction of uridine diphosphate glucose synthesis was experimentally determined. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme in the proposed physiological direction, that of nucleoside diphosphate glucose synthesis, have been measured. When UDP is present at saturating levels, the Km for sucrose was determined to be 17 mm. A similar value (29 mm) was obtained when ADP was the second substrate. Upon complete purification the enzyme retains activity for UDP, ADP, TDP, CDP, or GDP as substrates. Km values for these substrates, determined in the presence of saturating sucrose, are 0.19, 0.19, 0.30, 0.44, and 0.17 mm, respectively. The Vmax in the presence of these substrates are, in relative numbers, 100, 28.6, 5.8, 3.4, and 2.8, respectively. Kinetic data indicate a random mechanism for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1520155137,"Abstract The ability of phospholipids to bind prothrombin in the presence of Ca2+ ions has been studied as a function of lipid composition. Two distinct but complementary methods have been devised to evaluate binding. The first method involves gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 at pH 9.0 to separate the lipid-bound and free prothrombin; the second involves precipitation of the complexes at pH 6.5. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) or a mixture of this lipid with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bound very little prothrombin, whereas mixtures of phosphatidylserine (PS) with PC were very effective in binding and the complexes that formed were highly active in the one-stage prothrombin assay. PS alone, phosphatidic acid (PA) alone, PA-PS mixtures, and PA-PC mixtures containing high proportions of PA, bound prothrombin very effectively, but the complexes formed were much less active than when PS-PC was used. Bound protein could be much more readily removed from PS-PC than from PS-PA by treatment of the complexes with EDTA. It was suggested that an optimal surface condition is required to bind reversibly prothrombin prior to conversion to thrombin. Anticoagulant effects ascribed to acidic phospholipids may be due to irreversible binding of the clotting factors to lipid surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1533043270,"Abstract Trehalose phosphorylase, an enzyme found in cell-free extracts of Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris, was purified 75-fold by treatment with protamine sulfate, centrifugation at 200,000 x g, and chromatography in a column of hydroxylapatite. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible phosphorolytic splitting of trehalose, yielding β-glucose 1-phosphate and glucose as products. The optimum pH of the reaction was 7.0 for phosphorolysis and 6.3 for the synthesis of trehalose. The equilibrium constant changes with pH. It was 4.2 at pH 7.0 and 17 at pH 6.3. The enzyme is very unstable in the absence of inorganic phosphate, α- or β-glucose 1-phosphate. Measurements in sucrose gradient gave a molecular weight of about 344,000. This enzyme together with a phosphoglucomutase for β-glucose 1-phosphate found in the same Euglena extracts would constitute a new catabolic pathway for trehalose."
https://openalex.org/W1575276199,"Abstract Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the major protein-containing fraction of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides chromatophores reveals the presence of five electrophoretic components. The predominant component has associated with it, nearly all of the chlorophyll and phospholipid initially present in the chromatophore. Because of its potential structural and functional importance, this fraction has been isolated and purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis. As isolated from preparative gels, this protein is at least 95% pure by virtue of the following criteria: protein chemistry, analytical gel electrophoresis, immunochemical reactivity, and a linear sedimentation-equilibrium plot. Chemical characterization of the protein-lipid-pigment complex reveals the presence of approximately 59% protein, 35% phospholipid, and 6% chlorophyll. Amino acid analysis of the purified protein shows a high content of nonpolar residues, no histidine or cysteine. Minimum molecular weights were estimated as 7,000 by amino acid analysis, 10,000 by SDS-acrylamide gel analysis, and 15,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Immunochemical characterization indicates that this protein is specific to only the photosynthetic membrane system derived from phototrophically grown cells."

https://openalex.org/W1601143106,"Abstract The commercial protease mixture, Pronase, which is obtained from the K-1 strain of Streptomyces griseus, contains many exo- and endopeptidases. Among the latter enzymes are several which are inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). Three of these DFP-reacting components, being of low molecular weight, were partially separated by filtration through Sephadex G-75. Chromatography through CM-cellulose of the filtration fractions with the smaller proteins yielded two well separated peaks (A and B) after the start of a sodium chloride gradient. Peak B consisted of a single enzyme which hydrolyzed N-α-acetyll-tyrosine ethyl ester (Ac-Tyr-OEt). It was homogeneous by gel electrophoresis and its approximate molecular weight was 17,500 as determined by gel filtration. The material in Peak A was heterogeneous with activities against both AcTyr-OEt and N-α-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester (Bz-Arg-OEt). The component which hydrolyzes Bz-Arg-OEt was previously shown to be homologous with mammalian trypsin. Because of reports of the binding of alkylamines by trypsin, rechromatography of components in the earlier peak was carried out in the presence of n-butylamine. Slight retardation of the trypsin-like component was achieved. When a diamine, cadaverine, was substituted for the monoamine, further selective retardation was noted with almost complete resolution of the components in Peak A into two peaks (A1 and A2). These resolutions were thought to be due to the formation of an amine-enzyme complex at the active site; for, if the protein corresponding to Peak A was first reacted with DFP, no retardation was noted. Material from Peak A1 was homogeneous by gel electrophoresis and had an approximate molecular weight of 15,500. It hydrolyzed Ac-Tyr-OEt selectively. As expected the protein corresponding to Peak A2 hydrolyzed Bz-Arg-OEt selectively; its approximate molecular weight was 20,500. This enzyme demonstrated two bands by gel electrophoresis; this heterogeneity was tentatively attributed to the presence of both native enzyme and a partially autolyzed product. A larger DFP-reacting protein which hydrolyzed Ac-Tyr-OEt was partially purified by chromatography through CM-cellulose. Its approximate molecular weight was 27,000. An analysis was made of the partially hydrolyzed [32P]diisopropylphosphoryl (DIP) derivative of this protein. Electrophoretic studies of the migration of the radioactive peptides revealed a significant difference from the pattern of the radioactive peptides of [32P]DIP-α-chymotrypsin. This was in marked contrast to the results obtained with the three smaller enzymes. When a comparative electrophoretic analysis was made with the radioactive peptides of both the new enzyme and the [32P]DIP subtilisins excellent correspondence of patterns was noted. Therefore, the larger enzyme probably contains the sequence Thr-Ser-Met around the reactive seryl residue in contrast to the Asp-Ser-Gly sequences of the smaller enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2049737912,"In the monkey, the blood-brain barrier and the blood-aqueous and blood-vitreous barriers of the eye can be opened by internal carotid perfusion of solutions of 2 molar urea in a way compatible with survival and, in some few cases, without detectable neurological deficits. Urea presumably acts by osmotically shrinking the endothelial cells of the cerebrovascular vessels and opening their tight junctions. The high incidence of brain necrosis with neurological sequelae after perfusion of urea by the present technique precludes the use of osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier for pharmacotherapy at this time."
https://openalex.org/W2154299905,"Abstract The synthetic reaction catalyzed by the chicken liver fatty acid synthetase has a bell-shaped pH rate profile with a maximum at pH 6.7 and gives a discontinuous biphasic Arrhenius plot. The activation energy at low temperature is 28,900 cal per mole, which changes to 11,300 cal per mole at temperatures above 15°. The amino acid composition of the purified enzyme was found to be very similar to other animal synthetases. Rabbit antibody to chicken liver fatty acid synthetase partially cross-reacts with the pigeon liver enzyme, but does not precipitate the rat and hamster liver enzymes. The chicken liver enzyme which has an s20, w of 12 S dissociates at low ionic strength in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, into an essentially homogeneous 8 S species, which has a molecular weight of 253,000 by equilibrium sedimentation. The dissociated enzyme contains a mixture of equivalent amounts of two subcomplexes of similar size, but differing in net charge and probably in the composition of enzyme components. The molecular weight (Msd), diffusion coefficient, frictional ratio (f/f0), and Stokes' radius (α) of the native and dissociated enzymes were found to be 500,800, 240,000; 2.44, 3.24; 1.63, 1.59; and 8.61, 6.70, respectively. Dissociation of this enzyme by the above method is a reversible process, accompanied by extensive oxidation of thiol groups. Reactivation of the resulting subcomplexes has been shown to follow a two-step reaction sequence: (a) reassociation of these half-molecules into an inactive enzyme in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer at neutral pH; (b) reduction of this inactive enzyme by dithiothreitol to yield the active enzyme. Dissociation, however, is not dependent on the oxidation of thiol groups, occurring just as readily when these groups are protected by dithiothreitol. The subcomplexes obtained in this manner are fully reduced and reconstitute in neutral phosphate buffer directly into the active enzyme in the absence of dithiothreitol. Synthetase activity, however, requires both fully reduced protein thiols and intact quaternary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1567869453,"Abstract We have characterized the response of Bacillus subtilis cells to amino acid starvation, in regard to the total instantaneous rates of RNA synthesis, and the levels of guanine nucleotides thought to be involved in the mechanisms of amino acid control in a different prokaryote (Escherichia coli). We find, in agreement with earlier studies, that the formation of stable RNA species comprises only 16% of the normal instantaneous rate of RNA synthesis in B. subtilis. During arginine starvation, the instantaneous rate is reduced by 65 to 77%, showing that messenger RNA synthesis is substantially inhibited: the smallest reduction in the rate of messenger RNA synthesis compatible with our data is 58%. A reduction of this magnitude is consistent with the results of several other studies, briefly reviewed, of amino acid control of RNA synthesis in both E. coli and B. subtilis. We conclude that amino acid control pertains to transcription per se, i.e. the formation of both stable and unstable RNA molecules. Arginine starvation of B. subtilis elicits a sudden accumulation of the regulatory guanine nucleotides MS I (ppGpp) and MS II, and an equally sudden contraction of the GTP pool. Thus, the involvement of the MS nucleotides in the mechanism of amino acid control seems to be common to prokaryotes as divergent as E. coli and B. subtilis. We conclude that the general reduction in the rate of transcription in amino acid-starved B. subtilis cells may be due to direct inhibition by the MS nucleotides, or the diminished supply of GTP, or both."

The enzyme was induced in rat liver by the administration of 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide, and subsequently purified 150- to 200-fold from the hepatic cytosol. The purification was accomplished by gel filtration with Sephadex G-50, protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate fractionation, calcium phosphate gel adsorption, Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, and centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient. The partially purified enzyme requires high cation concentration (equivalent to 0.3 m NaCl) for maximum activation and stabilization of its activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme, determined in the presence of NaCl, is approximately 300,000; determinations in the absence of NaCl indicated an apparent molecular weight in excess of 500,000 with a diminished specific activity. δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase has a pH optimum of 7.5. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for the substrates, glycine and succinyl-CoA, and for the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The apparent Km values are 1 x 10-2, 7 x 10-5, and 3 x 10-6, m, respectively. No enzymatic activity was measurable when either alanine or serine replaced glycine in the incubation medium. Specificity was also established for succinyl-CoA; replacement of this substrate by propionyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA resulted in the formation of aminoketones at a rate of less than 1% that of the normal substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1580450769,"Abstract A homogeneous serine protease, homologous with bovine chymotrypsin, purified from a commercial preparation (Pronase) of the K-1 strain of Streptomyces griseus demonstrated marked stability in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. In this solvent the enzyme was active against N-α-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester showing a slight increase in Km but a significant decrease in Vmax as compared to results of studies in the absence of denaturant. The rate of hydrolysis of casein was enhanced in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. Ovalbumin, which was minimally hydrolyzed in the absence of denaturant was extensively hydrolyzed by the enzyme in the presence of denaturant. These results probably reflect the selective unfolding of the substrate proteins by denaturant. The enzyme revealed no difference in circular dichroism spectra in the presence or absence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. Sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the presence of denaturant caused a sustained irreversible loss of activity associated with a change in the circular dichroism spectrum. In the absence of guanidine, minimal effects of the chelating agent were seen. These results suggest the probable stabilizing effect of a cation. We believe this is the first demonstration of conservation of enzymatic activity in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride. This protease may be useful for structural studies of polypeptides which are, in the native state, resistant to proteolysis."

For the polymers, no apparent relationship exists between DNA nucleotide composition and the extent of density change on alkaline titration. Thus it is not possible to predict the nucleotide composition of a natural single-stranded DNA from its shift in buoyant density. Large decreases in buoyant density were found on alkaline titration of some DNA polymers in Cs2SO4 solution. Also, natural DNA's show a net density decrement due to alkaline titration. Contrastingly, in CsCl solutions, only buoyant density increases were observed."
https://openalex.org/W1601391360,"Abstract The repressor-like protein, transcription factor 1 (TF1), has been isolated from SP01-infected Bacillus subtilis. A purification method is described which yields homogeneous protein as judged by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea and Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography. The amino acid analysis of TF1 allows one to estimate a minimum molecular weight of approximately 11,500. Sedimentation equilibrium molecular weight measurements in 0.25 m KCl, 0.01 m Tris cacodylate, pH 6, at 20°, suggest that TF1 is a dimer under these conditions. The amino acid composition of TF1 is characterized by a high content of basic and acidic (or, potentially acidic) amino acids, and by the absence of cysteine, histidine, and tryptophan. The isoelectric point of TF1 is 9.8. The conformation of TF1 in solution is strongly temperature-dependent. The circular dichroism spectrum suggests an α helix content of 20 to 30% at room temperature, but reversible denaturation occurs between 30 and 60°. TF1 is synthesized after phage infection, yet more than 105 molecules of TF1 are present in an infected cell 20 min after infection at 37°."
https://openalex.org/W1659731446,"Abstract Effects of two antibiotics, chloramphenicol and cycloheximide, on the synthesis of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ribosomes in Tetrahymena were studied. The results presented here show that mitochondrial ribosome synthesis was not completely inhibited by chloramphenicol (0.5 mm), but was abolished by cycloheximide (1 mm). Acrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in a range of molecular weights from 13,000 to 25,000 were found particularly susceptible to chloramphenicol inhibition. Cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins did not appear to be differentially inhibited by chloramphenicol. The inhibition of mitochondrial ribosome synthesis in the presence of cycloheximide did not result from the loss of mitochondrial protein synthesis capacity as evidenced by in vitro [14C]leucine incorporation capacity of mitochondria isolated from whole cells treated with cycloheximide. However, cycloheximide greatly reduces the capacity to incorporate [3H]uridine into mitochondrial ribosomes as RNaseresistant radioactivity. These results suggest that some mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are synthesized in mitochondria and others by cytoplasmic ribosomes. The synthesis of those proteins that are produced by the mitochondrial ribosomes appears to be under the control of cytoplasmic protein synthesis. However, mitochondrial ribosome assembly can take place in the absence of cytoplasmic protein synthesis."

These findings suggest that l-lysine monooxygenase can catalyze an oxidative deamination of l-ornithine similar to that catalyzed by l-amino acid oxidase. 2,8-Diaminooctanoate appeared to be degraded in the same way as l-ornithine as evidenced by a 50% reduction in the rate of oxygen uptake upon the addition of catalase. Evidence indicating that both activities, monooxygenation and oxidation of amino acids, are attributable to a single enzyme includes the constant ratio of the two activities during the course of the enzyme purification and the parallel inactivation by —SH inhibitors or by sodium dodecyl sulfate. A competitive type inhibition of lysine monooxygenation by ornithine suggests that both amino acids bind to the enzyme at the same site."
https://openalex.org/W1488668245,"Abstract Enterotoxin E produced by Staphylococcus aureus strain FRI (Food Research Institute)-326 was purified by cation exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose, gel filtration through superfine Sephadex G-75, and gel filtration in 6 m urea with superfine Sephadex G-75. The purified toxin appears to be nearly homogeneous by paper, starch gel, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and double gel diffusion tests. It is a simple, colorless, antigenic protein. Its molecular weight was determined to be 29,600 ± 500 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, molecular sieve chromatography on Sephadex G-100, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its toxicity and reaction with its specific antibody are destroyed by extreme acidic (pH 2) and basic (pH 12) conditions. Urea-treated enterotoxin E retains its toxic activity and reaction with its specific antibody after removal of the denaturing agent. The enterotoxin consists of 259 amino acid residues and contains no free sulfhydryl groups. End group analysis showed serine to be the NH2-terminal amino acid and threonine to be the COOH-terminal amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1512733047,Abstract A polymorphic form of human carbonic anhydrase C has been isolated in crystalline form from the erythrocytes of Negroes who were either homozygous or heterozygous for this enzyme. It differs from carbonic anhydrase C in having an aspartic acid rather than an asparagine at a position 9 residues removed from the COOH-terminal end of the molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1551291503,"Degradation of the labeled glycogen from cells grown overnight in labeled acetate, pyruvate, and lactate confirmed the idea based on enzymatic data that Tetrahymena uses only the glyoxylate cycle in vivo for production of oxaloacetate in the gluconeogenic pathway. Comparison of the incorporation into CO2 and lipid of label from [1-14C] acetate and [2-14C]pyruvate, and [2-14C]acetate and [1-14C]glucose indicated that two pools of acetyl coenzyme A exist in Tetrahymena. One of these, derived most directly from acetate, is associated with lipid synthesis, whereas the other, derived from pyruvate and presumably mitochondrial, is more closely associated with oxidation to CO2. The incorporation of label from [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose into CO2 and the glycerol and fatty acyl moieties of the lipids was also measured. The ratio of 14C from [1-14C]glucose to that from [6-14C]glucose was about 0.5 for each of these products. The enrichment of label from [6-14C]glucose relative to that from [1-14C]glucose in these products indicates that transaldolase plays a role in carbon flow in the glycolytic and glyconeogenic pathways of Tetrahymena."
https://openalex.org/W1481576954,"Abstract The amidase activity on α-N-benzoylarginine-β-naphthylamide of a cathepsin B-like enzyme in rat liver lysosomes has been resolved from the main cathepsin B activity, defined by its hydrolysis of α-N-benzoylarginine amide. The enzyme has been purified 21- to 41-fold over the specific activity in solubilized lysosomes and 840- to 1560-fold over the specific activity in the homogenate by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. The purified enzyme is homogeneous as determined by gel electrophoresis, has optimum activity at pH 7.0 to 7.2, shows an absolute requirement for sulfhydryl compounds, and is protected from metal ions by EDTA. The enzyme is inhibited by thiol-reactive reagents and metal ions. The apparent molecular weight, determined by molecular sieve chromatography, is 33,000. The enzyme shows no appreciable hydrolysis of benzoylarginine-p-nitroanilide, a substrate for cathepsin B1, and does not hydrolyze carbobenzoxyleucyl-β-naphthylamide, benzoylarginine ethyl ester, benzoylphenylalanine-β-naphthylamide, benzoylalanine-β-naphthylamide, benzoylaspartate-di-β-naphthylamide, arginine-β-naphthylamide, lysine-β-naphthylamide, and leucine-β-naphthylamide. The enzyme exhibits proteolytic activity on calf thymus histones but has very little activity on denatured hemoglobin. Comparison of kinetic parameters indicates that the enzyme has a lower Km and higher turnover rate constant for benzoylarginine-β-naphthylamide than for benzoylarginine amide. The name proposed for the enzyme is α-N-benzoylarginine-β-naphthylamide amidohydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1499794014,"Abstract l-Ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase from Aerobacter aerogenes was inactivated by treatment with EDTA and was reactivated to varying extents by the addition of divalent metal ions in the order: Mn++ g Co++ g Ni++ g Ca++ g Zn++ g Mg++. When optimal Mn++ was present, the homogeneous enzyme had a specific activity of 70 µmoles-1 min-1 mg of protein at 28° and pH 7.2. This value is about five times greater than that displayed by the crystalline enzyme as isolated and assayed in the absence of added metal ion. In other mechanistic studies, l-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase was found to be stable to treatment with sodium sulfite and arsenite in the presence of a thiol compound. It was also stable to sodium borohydride in the presence or absence of substrate. Further, a reaction of tetranitromethane with the enzyme-substrate complex could not be detected. Possible mechanisms for l-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1506973990,"Abstract The properties and functions of lysine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) from Bacillus subtilis W23 have been analyzed to determine its possible role in regulation at the translational level of protein synthesis. Two lysine tRNA species were resolved by elution from a benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column. The ratio of these two lysine tRNA's from both vegetative cells and sporulating cells was constant in various media in which the growth rates were quite different. Lysine tRNA1 and lysine tRNA2 responded differently to the lysine codons. The codon AAG was more efficient in binding lysyl-tRNA than the codon AAA in the formation of a lysyl-tRNA-messenger RNA-ribosome complex. Both of the lysine tRNA species were susceptible to iodine oxidation to the same degree, but the amino acid-accepting ability and the binding efficiency to the messenger RNA-ribosome complex of lysine tRNA2 were affected less than those of lysine tRNA1. Spores grown under various nutritional conditions contained only one lysine tRNA peak, which eluted in the position of lysine tRNA1 of vegetative cells. Several possible reasons for the absence of one of the lysine tRNA peaks in spores are discussed. The involvement of lysine tRNA1 and lysine tRNA2 in regulation at the translational level is postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1591030053,"Abstract The enzymes of phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism, i.e. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, P-enolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate kinase, have been compared in Tetrahymena pyriformis under growth conditions which favor either gluconeogenesis or glycolysis. The activity of the cytosol P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is high in glucose-free and low in glucose-supplemented medium, while there is no change in activity of the mitochondrial enzyme. The chromatographic separation of the cytosol and mitochondrial enzymes on DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-200 indicate that they are isozymes with distinct molecular properties. Both P-enolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase activities are higher in glucose-supplemented medium. Distribution studies indicate an exclusive mitochondrial location for P-enolpyruvate carboxylase and cytosol location for pyruvate kinase. The peroxisomal enzymes, isocitrate lyase, malate synthetase, and lactic acid oxidase, as well as the cytosol P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, adapt to changes in aeration as well as to glucose supplementation of the culture. Certain important enzymatic similarities as well as differences were observed between Tetrahymena and other organisms, including mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2058396256,"Tocinamide and tocinoic acid, ring structures of oxytocin, are potent inhibitors of the release of melanophore stimulating hormone from the rat and hamster pituitary in vitro. Tocinamide is effective at concentrations as low as 10-(14)M on the mammalian pituitary. These peptides do not affect release of the hormone on the frog (Rana pipiens) pars intermedia, but they do inhibit release in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and the toad (Bufo marinus). The specificity of the peptides on inhibition of the hormone is demonstrated by the fact that oxytocin, lysine vasopressin, and pressinoic acid and pressinamide (ring structures of the vasopressins) do not show such inhibitory activity. Hypothalamic extracts of either the frog (Rana pipiens) or the rat inhibit release of the hormone from pituitaries of either species. The inhibitory effects of tocinamide and tocinoic acid, like that of hypothalamic extracts, are reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1601334823,"Abstract An enzyme in extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes was shown to catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of cellobiose monophosphate (6-O-phosphoryl-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-d-glucose) to yield equimolar amounts of d-glucose and d-glucose 6-phosphate. The enzyme was partially purified and characterized. In addition to cellobiose monophosphate, it catalyzed the cleavage of cellobiitol phosphate, arbutin phosphate, salicin phosphate, gentiobiose phosphate, methyl β-d-glucoside phosphate, and phenyl β-d-glucoside phosphate, but not nonphosphorylated β-glucosides."
https://openalex.org/W2145680237,"Abstract The presence of neutral deoxyribonuclease activity in highly purified preparation of acid deoxyribonuclease from sheep spleen (deoxyribonuclease II, EC 3.1.4.6) is described. The activity at pH 7.0 differs from the activity at pH 4.5 in its optimal ionic strength, its inhibition by tRNA, inhibition by EDTA, and activation by divalent cations. The deoxyribonuclease activity at neutral pH is not due to contamination by deoxyribonuclease I (EC 3.1.4.5) as judged from the differences between the various divalent cations activation curves, the inhibition by tRNA, and the inhibition of deoxyribonuclease I and II by purified deoxyribonuclease I inhibitor. While deoxyribonuclease I was completely inhibited by the inhibitor, deoxyribonuclease II was not inhibited at all either when assayed at pH 4.5 or at pH 7.0. Furthermore, we have shown that pH, ionic strength, and requirements for divalent cations are interdependent variables. The higher the pH at which deoxyribonuclease II is assayed, the lower its requirements for ionic strength, while its requirements for divalent cations are increased. It is highly probable that the neutral and acid deoxyribonuclease activities in our highly purified preparation of splenic deoxyribonuclease II are due to the same protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1591917944,"Two or possibly three equivalents of N-bromoacetylacetazolamide interact with two histidine residues located in the active site region of human carbonic anhydrase B. The most rapid reaction occurs at the 1-nitrogen of a histidine residue and this is followed by a slower alkylation of the 3-nitrogen of the same histidine and the 3-nitrogen of a second histidine. From a reaction mixture of N-bromo[14C]acetylacetazolamide and the enzyme, a species was isolated that contained approximately 1 eq of reagent covalently bound to the 1-nitrogen of a histidine (or histidines). This alkylated enzyme is active toward p-nitrophenyl acetate, but shows a pH dependence which is different from that of the native enzyme. At pH 6 the esterase activity is 95%, and levels off at pH 7.6 to about 35% relative to the native enzyme. The Km of the alkylated enzyme is almost identical with that of the native enzyme. These observations indicate that the histidine that reacted fastest with the reagent does not participate in the catalysis. Like the native enzyme alkylated human carbonic anhydrase B reacts with bromoacetate at the 3-nitrogen position of a histidine in the active site region. The partially purified dialkylated enzyme has a residual esterase activity at pH 7.6 of less than 0.8%. This raises the possibility that the histidine that reacts with bromoacetate plays a role in the catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2024611108,"Abstract The factors affecting the uptake, utilization, and desaturation of exogenous palmitic acid by Bacillus megaterium 14581 have been elucidated and the validity of the in vivo assay for determining the relative levels of the temperature-induced Δ5-desaturating enzyme system in this organism has been established. It was found that, in the presence of glucose, [1-14C]palmitic acid added to the cultures of B. megaterium is taken up rapidly and quantitatively by the cells. However, most of the 14C-label is excreted back into the medium within 15 min as water-soluble products (CO2, acetate, etc.) presumably derived from β oxidation of the added [1-14C]palmitate. The remaining [1-14C]palmitate (about 30% of the amount added) mixes with a small endogenous pool of palmitate (approximately 35 mµ moles per g of cells) which is readily desaturated but is completely stable to β oxidation. In the absence of glucose, β oxidation of added [1-14C]palmitate follows the same time pattern but a greater proportion of the label is excreted into the medium as oxidation products. Concomitantly, the endogenous pool of palmitate available for desaturation drops to 0 and total desaturation is reduced to about 6 to 7% of that obtained in the presence of glucose. Considerable experimental evidence would indicate that neither palmityl-CoA nor the palmitate of neutral or phospholipids are substrates for desaturation. Rather, it seems more probable that the true substrate for desaturation is the palmitate derived from fatty acid biosynthesis, presumably the palmityl thioester of acyl carrier protein. Exogenously derived [1-14C]palmitate is thought to enter this pool indirectly by first being incorporated into a small, metabolically active pool of neutral and phospholipids and then exchanging rapidly with endogenous palmityl acyl carrier protein. In the presence of glucose, the endogenous pool of palmitate available for desaturation was shown to remain constant during the period when Δ5-desaturating enzyme was induced from an undetectable level to maximal levels after transfer of a 35°-grown culture of B. megaterium to 20°. Furthermore, the pool size was shown to be independent of levels of substrate desaturation. In all cases, in the presence of glucose and chloramphenicol, the level of desaturation was determined solely by the level of Δ5-desaturating enzyme (i.e. was independent of exogenous substrate concentration, total pool size, pH, cell concentration, etc.) within wide experimental limits. This fact permitted the development of a precise and accurate assay procedure for the determination of relative desaturating enzyme levels and opened the way for the in vivo study of the temperature-mediated mechanisms which regulate unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in B. megaterium."

https://openalex.org/W2046179624,"Abstract Three control mechanisms have been demonstrated in Bacillus megaterium which regulate the level of Δ5-desaturating enzyme, and hence the rate of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, in response to temperature changes in the growth or incubation medium. One control process mediated by temperature is that of desaturase induction. A culture growing at 35° does not synthesize unsaturated fatty acids. When the culture is transferred to 20°, however, the synthesis of desaturase begins and continues at an accelerating rate for at least 1 hour. The induction process is blocked by chloramphenicol and the evidence suggests that both the desaturase synthesizing system and the desaturase itself are absent in cultures growing at 35° and must be induced at 20° by a process requiring protein synthesis. A second control process responsive to temperature is the irreversible inactivation of the desaturating enzyme. The inactivation process, in vivo, follows strict first order kinetics at all temperatures and the enzyme half-life is determined solely by the incubation temperature. The rate of inactivation of the desaturase is extremely sensitive to slight changes in temperature. At temperatures near 20° a decrease of less than 2° in the temperature of the incubation medium results in a more than 2-fold increase in the half-life of the desaturating enzyme. Temperature-mediiated irreversible inactivation is probably the most important mechanism for regulating the steady state level of desaturase during the exponential phase of cell growth at temperatures near 20°. A third process, the decay of the desaturase synthesizing system, is observed when a culture that has undergone induction at 20° is transferred back to 34°. Not only is the irreversible first order inactivation of the desaturating enzyme accelerated after transfer, but the desaturase-synthesizing system itself immediately begins to decay at a rate which follows zero order kinetics. The kinetics of decay as well as several other characteristics of the process are consistent with (but do not conclusively demonstrate) a mechanism involving the temperature-triggered synthesis of a repressor for the desaturase synthesis system. There is also some evidence for a rapid, temperature-reversible denaturation of desaturase at 34° which is superimposed on the slower, irreversible first order inactivation of the desaturating enzyme. Finally, equations are derived which enable one to calculate, as a function of time, the individual contribution of each of these temperature-dependent processes in regulating the level of desaturating enzyme at a given temperature in cultures of B. megaterium."
