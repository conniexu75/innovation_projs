https://openalex.org/W2024518635,"Investigations have been made of crude oil, pristane, phytane, steranetype and optically active alkanes, porphyrins, microfossils, and the stable isotopes of carbon and of sulfur found in the Nonesuch shale of Precambrian age from Northern Michigan. These sediments are approximately 1 billion years old. Geologic evidence indicates that they were deposited in a nearshore deltaic environment. Porphyrins are found in the siltstones but not in the crude oils of the Nonesuch formationâ€”evidence that these chemical fossils are adsorbed or absorbed and immobile. This immobility makes it highly unlikely that these porphyrins could have moved from younger formations into the Nonesuch sediments, and the widely disseminated particulate organic matters and fossils in this Precambrian shale are certainly indigenous."

https://openalex.org/W1995440051,In flooded rice fields a decline in total nematode populations began shortly after the onset of soil anaerobiosis and was correlated with a sustained increase in concentration of molecular hydrogen sulfide in the soil-water phase. Laboratory tests showed that hydrogen sulfide at concentrations found in flooded fields killed 100 percent of nematodes in 5 to 10 days. The effect of hydrogen sulfide and its pattern of occurrence in the soils of water-saturated rice fields suggest that this compound can be a significant factor in the etiology and control of certain plant diseases.

From these data the ""age"" of water obtained from a series of wells, each progressively farther down gradient on the piezometric surface, was established. Relative carbon-14 ages indicated a velocity of groundwater movement of 23 feet (7 meters) per year for about 85 miles (137 kilometers) of travel. A velocity of 23 feet per year was calculated independently from Darcy's law."

https://openalex.org/W1986626816,"By means of a high-speed photographic technique, the initial velocities of seeds were studied as they were expelled from the fruits of four Colorado dwarfmistletoes: Arceuthobium douglasii, A. campylopodum f. cyanocarpum, A. vaginatum f. cryptopodum, and A. americanum. Velocities of the seeds of the latter two species averaged 2600 centimeters per second and were significantly greater than those of the first two, which averaged 2200 centimeters per second. The initial velocity of 526 seeds of the four dwarfmistletoes averaged 2400 centimeters per second."

Similar measurements made at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, show a similar though smaller reduction. The causal factor is believed to be a layer of atmospheric dust resulting from the eruption of Mt. Agung, Bali, in March 1963."

https://openalex.org/W1971099647,"I hope I have shown not that mathematicians are incompetent or wrong, but why I believe that their interests, tastes, and objectives are frequently different from those of practicing numerical analysts, and why activity in numerical analysis should be evaluated by its own standards and not by those of pure mathematics. I hope I have also shown you that much of the ""art form"" of mathematics consists of delicate, ""noise-free"" results, while many areas of applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, are dominated by noise. Again, in computing the process is fundamental, and rigorous mathematical proofs are often meaningless in computing situations. Finally, in numerical analysis, as in engineering, choosing the right model is more important than choosing the model with the elegant mathematics."

https://openalex.org/W1964481028,"The array of auroral phenomena involves all the basic types of physical phenomena: heat, light, sound, electricity and magnetism, atomic physics, and plasma physics. The uncontrollability, the unreproducibility, and the sheer enormity of the phenomena will keep experimentalists and theorists busy but unsatisfied for many years to come. The greatest challenge in this field of research is an adequate experimentally verifiable theory of the local energization of auroral particle fluxes. Once that is achieved, there is every likelihood that the multitude of correlations between auroral phenomena can be understood and appreciated. Until that time, however, such correlations are to be regarded like icebergs-the parts that can be seen are only a small fraction of the whole phenomenon, and it is the large unseen parts that can be dangerous to theorists and experimentalists alike."

Movements of the tentacles, oral disc and column, and huge swellings of the pedal disc are the chief features in a coordinated purposive sequence, which settles the anemone on the shell in a few minutes."

https://openalex.org/W4231214699,"In my report on the Echo Lakes Symposium on Cosmic Rays (Science, September 2, 1949) the pi- and micro-symbols were interchanged, in the line before last of the second column, p. 242, and in the first line of the third column in the same page. The portion of the text containing these two lines should read: "". . . the latest values for the masses of the micro- and the pi-meson (215 and 285 electron masses respectively) and for the mean life of the pi-meson (0.63x10(-8) see)."" In a recent letter to the writer, Dr. Barkas states that this value for the mean life of the pi-meson has been superseded by more accurate measurements. These measurements, made on positive pi-mesons, give a mean life of 1.97x10(-8) sec. Dr. Barkas also indicates that new mass measurements give 276 electron masses for positive or negative pi-mesons and 210 electron masses for positive micro-mesons."
