https://openalex.org/W2051758487,"A complementary DNA clone has been isolated that encodes a coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). When transfected with CAR complementary DNA, nonpermissive hamster cells became susceptible to coxsackie B virus attachment and infection. Furthermore, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that adenovirus infection depends on attachment of a viral fiber to the target cell, CAR-transfected hamster cells bound adenovirus in a fiber-dependent fashion and showed a 100-fold increase in susceptibility to virus-mediated gene transfer. Identification of CAR as a receptor for these two unrelated and structurally distinct viral pathogens is important for understanding viral pathogenesis and has implications for therapeutic gene delivery with adenovirus vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2015667791,Recent developments in piconewton instrumentation allow the manipulation of single molecules and measurements of intermolecular as well as intramolecular forces. Dextran filaments linked to a gold surface were probed with the atomic force microscope tip by vertical stretching. At low forces the deformation of dextran was found to be dominated by entropic forces and can be described by the Langevin function with a 6 angstrom Kuhn length. At elevated forces the strand elongation was governed by a twist of bond angles. At higher forces the dextran filaments underwent a distinct conformational change. The polymer stiffened and the segment elasticity was dominated by the bending of bond angles. The conformational change was found to be reversible and was corroborated by molecular dynamics calculations.

Rho-kinase is activated by Rho and may mediate some biological effects of Rho. Microinjection of the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells induced the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas microinjection of the inactive catalytic domain, the Rho-binding domain, or the pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited the LPA-induced formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Thus, Rho-kinase appears to mediate signals from Rho and to induce the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2081635255,"Exposure of rats to hypoxia (7% O2) markedly increased the level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA in several tissues. Accumulation of HO-1 transcripts was also observed after exposure of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells to 1% O2, and this induction was dependent on gene transcription. Activation of the mouse HO-1 gene by all agents thus far tested is mediated by two 5′-enhancer sequences, SX2 and AB1, but neither fragment was responsive to hypoxia in VSM cells. Hypoxia-dependent induction of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was mediated by a 163-bp fragment located approximately 9.5 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site. This fragment contains two potential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). A role for HIF-1 in HO-1 gene regulation was established by the following observations: 1) HIF-1 specifically bound to an oligonucleotide spanning these sequences, 2) mutation of these sequences abolished HIF-1 binding and hypoxia-dependent gene activation in VSM cells, 3) hypoxia increased HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels in VSM cells, and 4) hypoxia-dependent HO-1 mRNA accumulation was not observed in mutant hepatoma cells lacking HIF-1 DNA-binding activity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hypoxia induces HO-1 expression in animal tissues and cell cultures and implicate HIF-1 in this response.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that hypoxia induces HO-1 expression in animal tissues and cell cultures and implicate HIF-1 in this response. Low cellular oxygen tension is a feature of both physiological conditions, such as adaptations to high altitude and physical endurance exercise (1Nunn J.F. Applied Respiratory Physiology. Butterworth & Co., Cambridge, UK1989: 471-479Google Scholar), and pathophysiological conditions including ischemia, fibrosis (2Silverstein J.L. Steen V.D. Medsger Jr., T.A. Falanga V. Arch.

Mammalian cells respond to hypoxia in part by increased expression of several genes that encode both tissue-specific and ubiquitous proteins (4Helfman T. Falanga V. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1993; 306: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These proteins participate in diverse biological processes including erythropoiesis, which enhances the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood; angiogenesis, which permits delivery of oxygen carrying blood to hypoxic sites; glycolysis, as a means of energy production; xenobiotic detoxification; and cellular adaptation to stress. Hypoxia-inducible proteins within these respective categories include erythropoietin (EPO) §Supported by a National Institutes of Health NHLBI Multidisciplinary Training Grant. (5Semenza G.L.

Where examined, increased expression of specific proteins in response to hypoxia is regulated primarily at the level of gene transcription (although post-transcriptional mechanisms have also been characterized). Another stress-associated protein whose expression is stimulated by hypoxia is heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (13Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Short S.M. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Morita T. Perrella M.S. Lee M. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). HO-1, a microsomal membrane enzyme, catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction in heme catabolism, the oxidative cleavage of b-type heme molecules to yield equimolar quantities of biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by the action of biliverdin reductase. The expression of HO-1 is dramatically induced not only by the substrate, heme, but a variety of stress-associated agents, including heavy metals, hyperthermia, and UV irradiation (reviewed in Maines (15Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 145-201Google Scholar)). A common feature among these inducers, including heme, is that they generate reactive oxygen species and/or diminish glutathione levels. This correlation and the observation that bilirubin functions as an antioxidant (16Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that induction of HO-1 is part of a general response to oxidant stress and that this enzyme plays a protective role during such conditions (17Nath D.A.

Stimulation of HO-1 expression by most if not all inducers is controlled primarily at the level of gene transcription and in our studies on the regulation of the mouse HO-1 gene, we have identified two 5′ distal enhancer regions, SX2 and AB1, that mediate gene activation by a variety of pro-oxidants including heme, heavy metals, TPA, hydrogen peroxide, and LPS (20Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alam J. Cai J. Smith A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The mechanism of HO-1 induction by hypoxia has not been investigated and because this induction has been proposed to occur as a consequence of oxidative stress (13Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Short S.M. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we examined the role of the SX2 and AB1 enhancers in hypoxia-dependent gene activation. In this report we show that these enhancers do not mediate transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene in response to hypoxia. Rather, this induction is mediated by a 163-bp fragment located directly downstream of the AB1 enhancer and approximately 9.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. The active sequences within this fragment resemble the binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), initially identified as a protein that binds to a site in the EPO gene enhancer required for transcription activation by hypoxia (24Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 25Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Pathogen-free Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (200-225 g) were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) and allowed to acclimate upon arrival for 7 d prior to experimentation. Animals were fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Animals were exposed to hypoxia (7.0% O2) in a 3.70-cubic feet plexiglass exposure chamber. Rats were supplied with rodent chow and water ad libitum during the exposures. At appropriate times, animal(s) were removed from the chamber and immediately sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction. These experiments were carried out according to animal protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Primary cultures of rat aortic vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, passage 2-10, were generously provided by Dr. Michael Crow of the National Institute of Aging. Chinese hamster ovary epithelial cells (CHO cells) were obtained from American Tissue Cell Culture. VSM cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's-F12 medium. Wild type Hepa1 c1c7 and mutant Hepa1 c4 cells (generously provided by Dr. O. Hankinson of the University of California at Los Angeles) were maintained in minimal essential medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2) in a tightly sealed modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothberg, Del Mar, CA) at 37°C. All experimentations were performed with confluent cultures. Total RNA from cells and tissues was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (23Camhi S. Alam J. Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10- or 15-μg (Hepa1 cells) aliquots of total RNA were fractionated on a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane by capillary action, and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. The nylon membranes were incubated in hybridization buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 mM EDTA) containing 32P-labeled rat HO-1 cDNA (27Shibahara S. Muller R. Taguchi H. Yoshida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2865-2869Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. S. Shibahara of Tohuku University, Japan) at 65°C for 24 h. Nylon membranes were then washed twice in buffer A (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA) for 15 min at 65°C followed by four washes in buffer B (1% SDS, 40 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 mM EDTA) for 15 min at 65°C and exposed to x-ray film. To control for variation in either the amount of RNA in different samples or loading errors, blots were hybridized with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-ACGGTATCTGATCGTCTTCGAACC-3′) complementary to 18 S rRNA after stripping of the HO-1 probe. Autoradiographic signals were quantified by densitometric scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). All densitometric values obtained for the HO-1 mRNA transcript (1.8 kb) were normalized to values for 18 S rRNA obtained on the same blot. The HO-1 mRNA level in treated cells was expressed in densitometric absorbance units, normalized to control untreated samples, and expressed as fold induction compared to controls. For HO-1 immunoblots, frozen tissues or cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137.5 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by Coomassie Blue dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). An equal volume of 2 × SDS/sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol) was added and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples (100 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated for 2 h with rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat HO-1 (1:1,000 dilution; StressGen Biotech Corp., Vancouver, Canada) followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 2 h. Signal development was carried out using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Corp.). For HIF-1α and HIF-1β immunoblots, aliquots of crude nuclear extracts containing 15 μg of protein from cells exposed to 1% or 20% O2 were fractionated at 30 mA by SDS-PAGE using a 7% acrylamide, 0.23% bisacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with affinity-purified HIF-1α or HIF-1β antibodies at 1:600 (v/v) dilution. The membrane was washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase anti-immunoglobulin conjugate at 1:2000 dilution, and detected with ECL reagents as described previously (28Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Construction of the CAT reporter plasmids diagramed in Fig. 4 has been described previously (20Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alam J. Cai J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alam J. Camhi S.

Choi A.M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were isolated after digestion with the appropriate endonucleases, blunt-ended, and cloned into the SpeI site, upstream of the minimal promoter and CAT gene in pMHO1CATΔ-33 (20Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the putative HIF-1 binding sites in the BT fragment was carried out by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (29Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) using the single-stranded form of plasmid pMHO1CATΔ-33 + BT. The sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotide was 5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGCGGAAAGCTGGCGTGGCTTTTCCTCTCTG-3′. The first 14 residues are derived from the multiple cloning sites of pBluescript II SK−, the parent plasmid of pMHO1CATΔ-33. Residue 15 corresponds to nucleotide 324 in the sequence presented in Fig. 6A.Fig. 5Functional analysis of the EH subfragment in VSM cells after hypoxia. The diagramed fragments were isolated after digestion with the indicated restriction endonucleases, blunt-ended and cloned into the vector pMHO1CATΔ-33 which contains a minimal HO-1 promoter (−33 to −73). VSM cells transiently transfected with the appropriate CAT construct were exposed to 20% O2 or 1% O2 for 24 h and then analyzed for CAT activity. The data represent the average value from three independent experiments and the mean fold induction of CAT activity in extracts of cells exposed to 1% O2 compared to that in extracts of cells exposed to 20% O2.

The cells were transfected overnight after which time the plates were washed twice with serum-free media and then incubated in complete media at 1 or 20% O2 for 24 h. Preparation of cellular extracts and measurement of CAT activity were carried out as described previously (30Prestera T. Talalay P. Alam J. Ahn Y.I. Lee P.J. Choi A.M.K. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAT enzyme standard was purchased from Sigma and used for calculation of cellular enzyme activities. Rat VSM cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 6 h and crude nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 7 μg of nuclear extracts was performed in binding buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.2 mM sodium vanadate, with 104 cpm of oligonucleotide probe (24Semenza G.L.

Oligonucleotide competition experiments were performed with 1 or 3 ng (10- or 30-fold excess) of unlabeled wild-type or mutant HO-1, or 3 ng of unlabeled wild-type or mutant EPO double-stranded oligonucleotides. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, labeled wild-type HO-1 probe was added and incubated on ice for 15 min. In the supershift assays, 1 μl of preimmune serum or antiserum (28Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar) specific for HIF-1α at 1:3 dilution or HIF-1β at 1:6 dilution was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min on ice prior to electrophoresis. Rats were exposed to 7% O2 for 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 h and HO-1 expression in various tissues was monitored by RNA blot analysis. Results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1. A marked increase in the steady-state level of HO-1 mRNA was observed in the lung, liver, heart, and aorta, and in all cases this induction was evident within 30-60 min of exposure to hypoxia. Within the time period examined, the highest levels of induction were observed in the liver (32-fold) and lung (16-fold). Reexposure of rats to 21% O2 for 15 or 30 min after 2 h of hypoxia resulted in a rapid decline in the amount of HO-1 mRNA in all tissues examined. HO-1 mRNA accumulation was also observed in the kidney and adrenal gland but was less pronounced. No induction was observed in the spleen (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated hypoxic-dependent induction of HO-1 expression in CHO cells (13Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Short S.M. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and VSM cells (14Morita T. Perrella M.S. Lee M. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The latter were selected for investigation of the regulatory mechanism of HO-1 induction because of the physiological relevance of VSM cells (see below) and because they exhibited more consistent and higher levels of induction than CHO cells (data not shown). Exposure of VSM cells to 1% O2 produced an initial rise in the steady-state amount of HO-1 mRNA at 4 h (4.0-fold), peak levels at 8 h (6.0-fold), prior to a drop in the levels by 24 h (2.4-fold) and 48 h (1.6-fold) of continuous hypoxia (Fig. 2A). The level of HO-1 mRNA accumulation and the temporal profile are similar to those observed after exposure of VSM cells to 0% O2 (14Morita T. Perrella M.S. Lee M. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Induction of HO-1 expression in cultured VSM cells appears to be delayed relative to that observed in the aorta. This variation, however, is not surprising given the differences in the treatment conditions and the cellular environments, particularly the presence of multiple cell types (i.e. endothelial cells) in the in vivo studies. The accumulation of HO-1 mRNA in cultured VSM cells correlated with increased levels of HO-1 protein (Fig. 2B). To further delineate the molecular basis for increased expression of HO-1 in response to hypoxia, we examined whether HO-1 mRNA induction was dependent on gene transcription. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with actinomycin D, a potent inhibitor of RNA synthesis, prior to exposure to hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 3, actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) completely inhibited hypoxia-induced HO-1 mRNA accumulation. To identify cis-acting DNA sequences that mediate HO-1 gene activation in response to hypoxia, VSM cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing various segments of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse HO-1 gene linked to the Escherichia coli CAT gene. Transfected cells were exposed to 20% O2 or 1% O2 for 24 h and hypoxia-dependent fusion gene regulation was assessed by measuring CAT activity in cellular extracts. Analysis of approximately 12.5 kb of the HO-1 5′-flanking region indicated that the hypoxia-responsive element (HypRE) resides within a 900-bp fragment, EH, located 9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4). By analyzing subfragments of EH in a manner analogous to that described above, the HypRE was localized to a 163-bp BsrBI/TaqI fragment, BT (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this fragment is immediately downstream of enhancer sequences, AB1, previously shown to mediate transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene in response to various agents including heme and cadmium (22Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Neither the AB1 enhancer nor the SX2 enhancer (Fig. 4) were responsive to hypoxia in VSM cells. A partial sequence of the EH fragment, is shown in Fig. 6A. The sequence of the AB1 segment (residues 166-326) has been published previously (22Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the EH sequence indicated that it contains two motifs similar to the consensus binding site, 5′-BACGTGCK-3′, for HIF-1 (9Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M Wang G.L. J. Biol.

Both of the putative HIF-1 binding sites 5′-GACGTGCT-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GACGTGCC-3′ (antisense strand) are located within the hypoxia-responsive BT fragment (residues 324-486). To assess the role of these putative HIF-1 binding sites in hypoxia-dependent gene activation, the CGT trinucleotide of both elements was mutated to AAA in the context of the BT fragment (Fig. 6B). Previous studies have demonstrated that analogous mutations within the HIF-1 binding site of the hypoxia-responsive EPO enhancer, 5′-TACGTGCT-3′, abolish both protein binding and enhancer function (24Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 32Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar) (see below). The mutant BT fragment was unresponsive to hypoxia (Fig. 6B), demonstrating that these sequences are necessary for HO-1 gene activation in hypoxic VSM cells. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to wild-type and mutant HO-1 and EPO sequences (Fig. 7A). The wild-type HO-1 oligonucleotide (Hw) was radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from VSM cells that had been incubated in 1% or 20% O2 for 6 h. The Hw probe detected a constitutively-expressed DNA-binding activity (C) that was present in both nonhypoxic (Fig. 7B, lane 1) and hypoxic (lane 2) cells as well as a DNA binding activity present only in hypoxic cells (lane 2). Inclusion of 1 or 3 ng (representing a 10- or 30-fold molar excess) of unlabeled mutant HO-1 oligonucleotide (Hm) had no effect on the binding of the inducible factor(s) to the Hw probe (lanes 3 and 4), whereas binding was partially and completely inhibited by 1 and 3 ng, respectively, of unlabeled Hw oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and 6). Binding of the inducible factor(s) to the Hw probe was also blocked by excess wild-type (Ew), but not mutant (Em), EPO oligonucleotides (lanes 7 and 8). Inclusion of antiserum raised against HIF-1α (Fig. 7C, lane 2) or HIF-1β (lane 4) resulted in the loss of the inducible complex and formation of a supershifted complex, suggesting that HIF-1α and HIF-1β are components of the hypoxia-inducible HypRE binding activity. The respective preimmune sera (lanes 1 and 3) had no effect on the HIF-1/DNA complex that formed in the absence of antiserum (lane 5). HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels in nuclear extracts from non-hypoxic and hypoxic VSM cells were also quantified by immunoblot assay (Fig. 8). Levels of HIF-1α were extremely low in nonhypoxic cells and increased dramatically in response to hypoxia. Multiple HIF-1α isoforms were detected in hypoxic VSM cells. Compared to HIF-1α, HIF-1β protein levels were higher in nonhypoxic VSM cells and showed a more modest induction in response to hypoxia. These features of HIF-1 expression are similar to those previously described for Hep3B cells (28Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that (i) exposure of VSM cells to 1% O2 increases nuclear HIF-1 DNA-binding activity as well as HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein, (ii) HIF-1 specifically binds to HO-1 sequences necessary for gene activation in response to hypoxia, and (iii) mutations in the HO-1 enhancer that result in a loss of transcriptional activity in hypoxic cells also result in a loss of HIF-1 binding. To further investigate the role of HIF-1 in HO-1 gene regulation, two clones of mouse hepatoma cells, wild-type Hepa1 c1c7 and its mutant derivative Hepa1 c4, were analyzed for HO-1 expression under hypoxic conditions. Hepa1 c4 cells are deficient in HIF-1β (33Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and lack HIF-1 DNA-binding activity. ‡‡An Established Investigator of the American Heart Association. Supported in part by a grant from the American Heart Association and by National Institutes of Health Grant R01-HL55338. These cells were incubated for 0, 4, 8, and 16 h at 1% O2, and HO-1 expression was subsequently assessed by Northern blot analyses. In wild-type Hepa1 cells, HO-1 mRNA levels increased 14.0-fold at 4 h, 7.8-fold at 8 h, and 4.3-fold at 16 h of hypoxia (Fig. 9). In mutant Hepa1 c4 cells, the basal level of HO-1 mRNA was significantly higher but no appreciable increase was observed under hypoxic conditions. These data provide further evidence that HIF-1 plays a critical role in HO-1 gene activation in response to hypoxia in cultured cells. Much interest in HO-1 has been generated recently by reports demonstrating the induction of HO-1 expression by a variety of pro-oxidants including UV irradiation, hyperoxia, and endotoxin, and the protection this induction affords against heme- and non-heme-mediated oxidant injury (reviewed in Choi and Alam (34Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar)). The present study demonstrates that acute hypoxic stress also stimulates HO-1 expression both in animal tissues and in cell cultures. In VSM cells, induction of HO-1 expression is regulated at the level of gene transcription and results from several lines of investigation demonstrate that this activation is mediated by HIF-1. HIF-1 was initially identified as a hypoxia-inducible nuclear factor in Hep3B hepatoma cells that bound to sequences necessary for hypoxic activation of the EPO gene, whose product is expressed primarily in fetal liver and the kidney. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HIF-1 is present and/or functions in cell lines of various tissue origin, including HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, Ltk− fibroblast, C2C12 skeletal myoblasts and CHO cells, suggesting that this transcription factor plays a more general role in the hypoxic response of mammalian cells and may regulate the expression of other hypoxia-inducible genes (32Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Indeed, HIF-1 binding sites have been identified in other functional classes of hypoxia-inducible genes including those coding for inducible nitric oxide synthase (35Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A.

Koos, and G. L. Semenza, submitted for publication.(36Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the potential significance of increased HO-1 activity in hypoxic cells (see below), the identification of the HO-1 gene as a target for HIF-1 regulation lends further support to the hypothesis that HIF-1 coordinates homeostatic transcriptional responses to cellular hypoxia. In addition to HIF-1, the AP-1 transcription factors, comprised of homo- and heterodimers of the Fos and Jun family of proteins, have been implicated in hypoxia-dependent gene activation. For instance, in several cell types, both the mRNA levels of individual Fos and Jun family members and AP-1- specific DNA binding activity are increased after exposure to hypoxia (10Yao K.-S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5032-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an AP-1 binding site within the promoter of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene is required for hypoxia-dependent transcription activation (40Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both SX2 and AB1 enhancers contain binding sites for various transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and Sp1, but the dominant element within both fragments is the consensus sequence, (T/C)GCTGAGTCA, which is present in five copies (20Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol.

That a single type of element regulates mouse HO-1 induction by diverse agents argues for a common mechanism in the mode of action of these agents and is consistent with the oxidant stress hypothesis. Clearly, neither the SX2 nor the AB1 enhancer is responsive to hypoxia in VSM cells. These results attest to the uniqueness of hypoxia as an inducer of the mouse HO-1 gene and argue against the previous suggestion that hypoxic induction of HO-1 in CHO cells occurs as a consequence of oxidative stress (13Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Short S.M. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The significance of increased HO-1 expression under hypoxic conditions is not clearly understood. The utilization of distinct transcription factor pathways for HO-1 gene activation by hypoxia and various pro-oxidants, however, suggests that this significance may be less related to the antioxidant activity of HO-1 (i.e. production of bilirubin) than to the ability of this enzyme to generate CO. CO is a member of a new class of gaseous signaling molecules that also includes nitric oxide (NO). CO, like NO, can activate guanylate cyclase resulting in elevated levels of cGMP, which among other activities, causes relaxation of VSM cells and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Recent studies have in fact established that, under physiological conditions, maintenance of normal vascular tone and blood flow can be attributed in part to enzymatically derived CO (42Christodoulides N. Durante W. Kroll M.H. Schafer A.I. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2306-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 43Suematsu M. Goda N. Sano T. Kashiwagi S. Egawa T. Shinoda Y. Ishimura Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2431-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in vascular tone, endothelial permeability, and/or coagulant function observed under hypoxic conditions (44Shreeniwas R. Ogawa S. Cozzolino F. Torcia G. Braunstein N. Butura C.

Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) may in part be a consequence of HO-1 induction and localized production of CO. Consistent with this role of HO-1, hypoxic VSM cells exhibit increased production of CO, derived primarily if not exclusively from induced HO-1 activity, and increased levels of cGMP (14Morita T. Perrella M.S. Lee M. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the HO-1-derived CO from VSM cells may have paracrine effects as it modulates cGMP levels and gene expression in endothelial cells in an in vitro co-culture system (46Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Finally, with respect to VSM cells, HO-1 induction and the regulatory effects of CO may be of particular significance in pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis where smooth muscle cells are exposed to hypoxic environments prior to and during development of lesions (47Santilli S.M. Fiegel V.D. Knighton D.R. J. Vasc. Surg. 1993; 18: 227-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 48Barker S.G. Talbert A. Cottam S. Baskerville P.A. Martin J.F.

Both SUT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were shown to be diurnally regulated and to have high turnover rates. SUT1 protein was detected by immunolocalization in plasma membranes of enucleate sieve elements (SEs) in tobacco, potato, and tomato. Analysis by in situ hybridization showed that SUT1 mRNA localizes mainly to the SE and is preferentially associated with plasmodesmata. Antisense inhibition of SUT1 expression under control of a companion cell (CC)-specific promoter indicated synthesis of SUT1 mRNA in the CC. These results provide evidence for targeting of plant endogenous mRNA and potentially SUT1 protein through phloem plasmodesmata and for sucrose loading at the plasma membrane of SE."

The discovery of chemical agents that can inhibit deleterious glycation reactions is potentially of great therapeutic benefit to all these pathologies, but no such pharmacological agents have entered clinical practice to date.Most kinetic studies of AGE inhibition so far have focused on observing the overall glycation of proteins in the presence of high, nonphysiological concentrations of reducing sugar. The elucidation of the mechanism of inhibition of any candidate AGE inhibitor under such conditions is an extremely difficult task due to the complexity of the glycation cascade (Scheme 1). For example, reactive AGE-forming intermediates can arise from oxidative reactions (“glycoxidation”) of free sugar or from initial Schiff base condensation products with protein amino groups, rather than just from the “classical” Amadori rearrangement products. Furthermore, an inhibitor could potentially act at more than one step of the glycation pathway, so that its contributions to each step would have to be evaluated. This is typified by the prominent AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine, or guanylhydrazine (Scheme 2), that can potentially react as a hydrazine with carbonyls of Amadori intermediates or can scavenge reactive dicarbonyls through its guanidinium moiety. Additionally, as a hydrazine it can block the reactive open chain carbonyl form of reducing sugars (32Khatami M. Suldan Z. David I. Li W. Rockey J.H. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Hirsch J. Petrakova E. Feather M.S. Barnes C.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 267: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Few studies have quantitatively measured the complete kinetics of protein glycation due to the slowness of the reactions with glucose, making it even more difficult to draw conclusions about inhibition. Limited studies have been carried out on small model Amadori compounds (34Smith P.R. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1992; 41: 42-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wells-Knecht M.C. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15134-15141Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Scheme 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have recently reported a significant simplification in studying the kinetics and mechanism of protein glycation (39Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since glycation by glucose is usually a slow reaction (weeks and months), we have investigated glycation with the pentose ribose, a more reactive analogue of glucose (40Bunn H.F. Higgins P.J. Science. 1981; 213: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 41Cervantes-Laurean D. Minter D.E. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Those studies led to the unique preparation, kinetic characterization, and stabilization of a reactive glycation intermediate in ribonuclease A. After removing excess and reversibly bound ribose from this presumed Amadori intermediate (Scheme 1), it rapidly forms AGEs with a half-time for the exponential kinetics of about 10 h (39Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This “interrupted glycation” method provides a new mechanism-based strategy for a better understanding of AGE inhibition by established inhibitors, such as aminoguanidine, through isolating post-Amadori pathways of AGE formation (cf. Scheme 1) and thus removing effects arising from glycoxidation of free sugar or Schiff base (Namiki pathway) (35Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). More importantly, it opens the way to searching for novel inhibitors that specifically act on post-Amadori pathways of AGE formation. Baynes and co-workers (38Wells-Knecht M.C. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15134-15141Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have recently emphasized the importance of Amadori products for the in vivo formation of AGEs. We note that exogenously administered Amadori and AGE proteins have been shown to produce diabetic-like glomerular sclerosis, basement membrane thickening, and albuminuria (42Vlassara H. Striker L.J. Teichberg S. Fuh H. Li Y.M. Steffes M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11704-11708Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 43Cohen M.P. Ziyadeh F.N. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar).We now report the successful use of the above approach to elucidate important aspects of the inhibition by aminoguanidine and to discover novel post-Amadori inhibitors of AGE formation. In particular, we examined several derivatives of vitamins B1 and B6 (Scheme 2) that were recently screened for possible AGE inhibition in the presence of high glucose (44Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). They were chosen for study due to the chemistry of their participation as cofactors in many α-carbonyl reactions in carbohydrate metabolism, which could relate to α-carbonyls of Amadori intermediates. Two derivatives, pyridoxamine and thiamine pyrophosphate, proved to be unique post-Amadori inhibitors of AGE formation. In contrast, the classic AGE inhibitor aminoguanidine (45Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney A. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 1629-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) surprisingly showed little post-Amadori inhibition. We confirmed that our earlier inhibition results (44Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and the present ones are generally not specific for the proteins used, even though there are individual variations in rates of AGE formation and inhibition.RESULTSBefore presenting and then discussing the results, it may be useful to emphasize that there is no standard method of defining or following AGE formation and its inhibition. Quantitation of initial Schiff base condensation of labeled reducing sugars with protein amino groups provides little information on post-Amadori steps of AGE formation, since such steps may not lead to changes in the extent of labeling. Many studies of AGE formation have monitored the increase in blue fluorescence arising from “browning” glycation products. Such fluorescent changes can be produced by dicarbonyl or glycoxidation products that arise from free sugar, from the initial Schiff bases, and from Amadori and other intermediates (50Fuijimori E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 998: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 51Wolff S.P. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 52Hunt J.V.

Carboxymethyllysine (CmL), a notable AGE, can also arise from a variety of glycoxidation intermediates besides the Amadori product (35Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

In this work we chose to use sensitive ELISA techniques (46Nakayama H. Taneda S. Kuwajima S. Aoki S. Kuroda Y. Misawa K. Nakagawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This approach recently proved highly suitable for detailed kinetics studies of the formation of antigenic AGE products and its inhibition (39Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 44Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).2The results in this section are presented as two series of inhibition experiments. In the first series, the indicated proteins are mixed with ribose to initiate glycation in the presence and absence of the inhibitors, and the formation of AGEs was monitored by ELISA. This assay is referred to as “overall glycation kinetics” or as “uninterrupted glycation.” In the second series of experiments, an interrupted glycation method was used to follow “post-Amadori kinetics” of AGE formation in absence of ribose. The proteins were first incubated at 37°C with ribose for 24 h during which Amadori intermediates (Scheme 1) accumulated (39Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The excess and reversibly bound sugar was then removed by dialysis at 4°C, and AGE formation was initiated (the zero time) in the presence and absence of inhibitors by warming the solutions back to 37°C.Inhibition by Vitamin B6 Derivatives of the Overall Kinetics of AGE FormationThe inhibitory effects of the B1 and B6 vitamins on the kinetics of antigenic AGE formation were evaluated by polyclonal antibodies specific for AGEs. 3Polyclonal anti-AGE antibodies have proven to be a sensitive analytical tool for the study of AGE formation in vitro and in vivo, although the nature of the dominant antigenic AGE epitope of hapten remains in doubt. Baynes and co-workers (71Reddy S. Bichler J. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the protein glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CmL) is a dominant antigen of their antibodies, and they were able to rationalize why earlier studies had failed to reveal strong ELISA reactivity with model carboxymethyllysine compounds (48Makita Z. Vlassara H. Cerami A. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5133-5138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary characterization of our polyclonal antibodies reveals a strong, although variable, CML reactivity.5 Our initial inhibition studies were carried out on the glycation of bovine ribonuclease A (RNase) in the continuous presence of 0.05 M ribose. It has been shown elsewhere (39Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Booth A.A. Yang S.X. Mott J.D. Hudson B.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4645-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the rate of AGE formation is near-maximal at this concentration. Fig. 1 (control curves, filled rectangles) demonstrates that the formation of antigenic AGEs on RNase when incubated with 0.05 M ribose is relatively rapid, with a half-time of approximately 6 days under these temperature and buffer conditions. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (Fig. 1B) and pyridoxal (Fig. 1C) significantly inhibited the rate of AGE formation on RNase at concentrations of 50 and 15 mM. Surprisingly, pyridoxine, the alcohol form of vitamin B6 (Scheme 2), also moderately inhibited AGE formation on RNase (Fig. 1D). Of the B6 derivatives examined above, pyridoxamine at 50 mM provided the best inhibition of “final” levels of AGE formation on RNase over the 6-week period monitored (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1Effect of vitamin B6 derivatives on AGE formation during uninterrupted glycation of ribonuclease A by ribose. RNase (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.05 M ribose in the presence and absence of the various indicated derivatives in 0.4 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 at 37°C for 6 weeks. Aliquots were assayed by ELISA using R479 anti-AGE antibodies. Concentrations of the inhibitors were 0.5, 3.0, 15, and 50 mM.

In the case of thiamine pyrophosphate (Fig. 2A), both the rate of AGE formation and the final levels of AGE produced at the plateau appeared diminished by the compound. In the case of thiamine phosphate (Fig. 2B) and thiamine (Fig. 2C), there appeared little effect on the rate of AGE formation, but a substantial decrease in the final level of AGE formed in the presence of the highest concentration of inhibitor. In general, thiamine pyrophosphate demonstrated greater inhibition than the other two compounds at the lower concentrations examined.Fig. 2Effects of vitamin B1 derivatives and aminoguanidine on AGE formation during uninterrupted glycation of ribonuclease A by ribose. RNase (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.05 M ribose in the presence and absence of the various indicated derivatives in 0.4 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 at 37°C for 6 weeks. Aliquots were assayed by ELISA using R479 anti-AGE antibodies. Concentrations of the inhibitors were 0.5, 3.0, 15, and 50 mM.

Increasing concentrations of aminoguanidine decreased the rate of AGE formation on RNase but did not reduce the final levels of AGE formed, so that the level of AGEs produced by the 6th week was almost identical to that of the control.Inhibition of the Overall Kinetics of AGE Formation in Serum Albumin and HemoglobinComparative studies were carried out with bovine serum albumin and human methemoglobin to determine whether the observed inhibition was protein-specific. The different derivatives of vitamin B6 (Fig. 3, A-D) and vitamin B1 (Fig. 4, A-C) exhibited similar inhibition trends when incubated with bovine serum albumin, with pyridoxamine and thiamine pyrophosphate being the most effective inhibitors in each of the respective families. Pyridoxine failed to inhibit AGE formation on BSA (Fig. 3D). Pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxal (Fig. 3, B-C) mostly inhibited the rate of AGE formation but not the final levels. Pyridoxamine (Fig. 3A) again exhibited some inhibition at lower concentrations and at the highest concentration appeared to inhibit the final levels of AGE formation more effectively than the other B6 vitamers. In the case of the B1 vitamers, the overall extent of inhibition on BSA (Fig. 4, A-C) was less than that observed with RNase (Fig. 2, A-C). Higher concentrations of thiamine and thiamine monophosphate only slightly inhibited AGE formation on BSA (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas thiamine pyrophosphate inhibited the final levels of AGE formation without greatly affecting the rate of formation (Fig. 4A). Aminoguanidine again displayed the inhibition effects with BSA that it did with RNase (Fig. 4D), appearing to only slow the rate of AGE formation with lesser effects on decreasing the final levels of AGE.Fig. 3Effect of vitamin B6 derivatives on AGE formation during uninterrupted glycation of bovine serum albumin by ribose. BSA (10 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.05 M ribose in the presence and absence of the various indicated derivatives in 0.4 M sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 at 37°C for 6 weeks. Aliquots were assayed by ELISA using R618 anti-AGE antibodies. Concentrations of the inhibitors were 0.5, 3, 15, and 50 mM.

The absolute rates of AGE formation appeared higher with human methemoglobin than with the other two proteins,2 but the compounds revealed largely similar inhibition trends (data not shown). Of the vitamin B6 derivatives, pyridoxamine showed the greatest inhibition at concentrations of 3 mM and above when compared with pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, and pyridoxine. In the case of the B1 compounds, the inhibitory effects were more similar to the BSA inhibition trends than to RNase. The inhibition was modest at the highest concentrations tested (50 mM), being nearly 30-50% for all three vitamers (data not shown). It was primarily manifest as a decrease in the final levels of AGE.Inhibition by Vitamin B6 Derivatives of the Kinetics of Post-Amadori Ribose AGE FormationIn the interrupted glycation assays for following post-Amadori AGE formation, kinetics were followed by incubating isolated Amadori intermediates of either RNase or BSA at 37°C in absence of free or reversibly bound ribose.

A component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spindle, Ase1, was observed to undergo cell cycle-specific degradation mediated by the cyclosome, or anaphase promoting complex (APC). Ase1 was degraded when cells exited from mitosis and entered G 1 . Inappropriate expression of stable Ase1 during G 1 produced a spindle defect that is sensed by the spindle assembly checkpoint. In addition, loss of ASE1 function destabilized telophase spindles, and expression of a nondegradable Ase1 mutant delayed spindle disassembly. APC-mediated proteolysis therefore appears to regulate both spindle assembly and disassembly."

The binding specificities of three such toxins for different glycolipids, mainly from the ganglioside series, were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a liposome capture method. Unlike microtiter plate and thin layer chromatography overlay assays, the SPR/liposome methodology allows for real time analysis of toxin binding under conditions that mimic the natural cell surface venue of these interactions and without any requirement for labeling of toxin or receptor. Compared to conventional assays, the liposome technique showed more restricted oligosaccharide specificities for toxin binding. Cholera toxin demonstrated an absolute requirement for terminal galactose and internal sialic acid residues (as in GM1) with tolerance for substitution with a second internal sialic acid (as in GD1b). Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin bound to GM1 and tolerated removal or extension of the internal sialic acid residue (as in asialo-GM1 and GD1b, respectively) but not substitution of the terminal galactose of GM1. Tetanus toxin showed a requirement for two internal sialic acid residues as in GD1b. Extension of terminal galactose with a single sialic acid was tolerated to some extent. The SPR analyses also yielded rate and affinity constants which are not attainable by conventional assays. Complex binding profiles were observed in that the association and dissociation rate constants varied with toxin:receptor ratios. The sub-nanomolar affinities of cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin for liposome-anchored gangliosides were attributable largely to very slow dissociation rate constants.

Implanted ectopic sources of intercellular signal proteins that are involved in establishing normal left-right information randomized the handedness of heart development and also altered the asymmetry of cSnR expression. cSnR thus appears to act downstream of these signals, or perhaps in parallel with the latest expressed of them, the Nodal protein, in controlling the anatomical asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1989041973,"The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in long-term synaptic facilitation was examined in isolated Aplysia ganglia. Treatment with TGF-beta1 induced long-term facilitation (24 and 48 hours), but not short-term (5 to 15 minutes) or intermediate-term (2 to 4 hours) facilitation. The long-term effects of TGF-beta1 were not additive with those of serotonin. Moreover, serotonin-induced facilitation was blocked by an inhibitor of TGF-beta. Thus, activation of TGF-beta may be part of the cascade of events underlying long-term sensitization, consistent with the hypothesis that signaling molecules that participate in development also have roles in adult neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2080152503,"The salt-instigated protein expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during growth in either 0.7 or 1.4 M NaCl was studied by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 73 protein spots that were identified as more than 3-fold responsive in 1.4 M NaCl were further grouped by response class (halometric, low-salt, and high-salt regulation). Roughly 40% of these responsive proteins were found to decrease in expression, while at higher magnitudes of change (>8-fold) only induction was recorded. Enolase 1 (Eno1p) was the most increasing protein by absolute numbers per cell, but not by -fold change, and the enzymes involved in glycerol synthesis, Gpd1p and Gpp2p, were also induced to a similar degree as Eno1p.

The physiological response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to hyperosmotic stress has for long been a subject of study (1Blomberg A. Adler L. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1992; 33: 145-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main response has been shown to be an increased production and accumulation of glycerol, as a compatible solute, following the external osmotic pressure up to molar intracellular concentrations (2ölz R. Larsson K. Adler L. Gustafsson L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2205-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increased production is believed to be caused mainly by an enhanced activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoded by two genes, the osmoresponsive GPD1 (4Larsson K. Ansell R. Eriksson P. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and GPD2 (5Eriksson P. André L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the latter of which seems to be involved in regulation of cytoplasmic redox balance. 1Ansell, R., Granath, K., Hohmann, S., Thevelein, J. M., and Adler, L. (1994) EMBO J., in press. The induction of GPD1 has been shown to occur at the level of transcription (5Eriksson P. André L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol.

The second enzyme in the pathway to glycerol is glycerol-3-phosphatase, recently shown to be encoded by two genes, the constitutively expressed GPP1 and the osmotically induced GPP2 (8Norbeck J. Påhlman A.-K. Akhtar N. Blomberg A. Adler L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), also reported as RHR2 and HOR2, respectively (9Hirayama T. Maeda T. Saito H. Shinozaki K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The induction of these genes is, at least partly, dependent on a functional HOG pathway involving homologs of human mitogen-activated protein kinases (10Brewster J.L. De Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), which is coupled to two putative osmosensor proteins, Sln1p (11Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and Sho1p (12Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), the signals from which converge at Pbs2p. In addition to the genes involved in glycerol production, there are other genes reportedly regulated via the HOG path, such as CTT1 (13Schüller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), HSP12 (14Varela J.C.S. Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6232-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and three adjacent genes including an aldehyde dehydrogenase, the expression of which was maximal at 0.3 M NaCl (15Miralles V.J. Serrano R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that other signaling paths are of importance for osmotic regulation of gene expression. DDR48 is induced maximally by 1 M NaCl, with very little induction below 0.5 M, independent of HOG1 (15Miralles V.J. Serrano R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and most of the seven HOR genes were induced, albeit to a lower degree, even in a HOG1 disruptant (9Hirayama T. Maeda T. Saito H. Shinozaki K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ENA1 gene, encoding a Na-pump, is regulated via Hog1p, calcineurin, and protein kinase A acting in concert (16Márquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Hirata D. Harada S. Namba H. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that combinations of these mechanisms are responsible for the osmotic regulation of gene expression in yeast. It was previously reported that S. cerevisiae strain Y41 (ATCC 38531) displayed largely transient changes in protein expression during adaptation to 0.7 M NaCl (18Blomberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3563-3572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transient protein response during adaptation was further substantiated, since very few proteins were found to display expression changes in this strain during growth (19Norbeck J. Blomberg A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the responses observed, it was suggested that a decrease of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity together with an increase in GPD activity is required for increased production of glycerol. The aim of the present study was to identify responsive proteins during growth in 1.4 M NaCl medium and furthermore to group these proteins into response classes, presumably caused by differences in interaction of signaling pathways acting at the respective promotors. The classification of response type can then be used to select genes with similar patterns of expression for comparative promotor studies. During the course of this work we found evidence for a salt-induced dissimilation of glycerol via dihydroxyacetone, as has been indicated previously for Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (20Van Zyl P.J. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 36: 369-374Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Debaryomyces hansenii (21Adler L. Blomberg A. Nilsson A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 300-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of homology to known proteins from other organisms, we suggest candidate genes for the two enzymatic steps involved. S. cerevisiae, strain SKQ2n (ATCC 44827; genotype: a/α, ade1/+, +/ade2, +/his1) or Y41 (ATCC 38531) was used for all experiments. Glucose concentration was 20 g/liter, but apart from this, media and growth conditions were the same as described previously (22Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The defined YNB medium was supplemented with appropriate amounts of sodium chloride where indicated. Growth was monitored as optical density at 610 nm (OD610). At an OD610 of 0.5 (5 × 106 cells/ml) the cultures were labeled with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine (15 μCi/μl, >1000 Ci/mmol, SJ1515, Amersham Inc.) for 30 min before harvest as described previously (22Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein extraction was performed, as described previously (23Blomberg A. Blomberg L. Norbeck J. Fey S.J. Mose Larsen P. Larsen M. Roepstorff P. Degand H. Boutry M. Posch A. Görg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), by vortexing with glass beads and boiling with SDS/mercaptoethanol added before nuclease treatment. 20 μg of protein was lyophilized and dissolved in 10 μl of urea-containing sample buffer, all of which was applied on the first dimension gels. Protein concentration and amount of incorporated 35S-methionine in the extracts was determined as described previously (23Blomberg A. Blomberg L. Norbeck J. Fey S.J. Mose Larsen P. Larsen M. Roepstorff P. Degand H. Boutry M. Posch A. Görg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Extracts from 0 M NaCl cultures contained 3-4 μg of protein/μl of extract and approximately 170,000 dpm/μg protein, while the corresponding values for salt-grown cells were 2-2.5 μg/μl and approximately 100,000 dpm/μg, respectively. Two-dimensional PAGE 2The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFUN genegene of previously unknown or only putative functionGLDglycerol dehydrogenaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. was run on an Investigator™ system using a modified procedure of Garrels (24Garrels J.I. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with all chemicals and equipment supplied by Oxford glycosystems. First dimensional acrylamide gels were 4% T, 2.6% C (Duracryl 0.8% bisacrylamide, ELCR 2DC 010), 9.5 M urea, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 5.8% (v/v) of a 40% (w/v) ampholyte pH 3-10 stock solution (ELCR 1DC 110). The gels were prefocused until a voltage of 1500 V had been reached, prior to sample application with a maximum of 20 μg of protein (2 μg/μl in sample buffer). Focusing was run for 18,500 V-h overnight at room temperature (20-23°C). The isoelectric focusing gels were equilibrated for 2 min in SDS buffer (containing 3% (w/v) SDS, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 M Tris base, 0.075 M Tris-HCl, and 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue) before mounting on the SDS-PAGE slab gels. These second dimension acrylamide gels were 10% T, 2.1% C (Duracryl 0.65% bisacrylamide; ELCR 2DC 070) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.37 M Tris base, and 0.27 M Tris-HCl. Gels were cast at room temperature, and samples were run on a vertical system at 20°C (Investigator; Oxford Glycosystems) with gels fully submerged in running buffer for efficient cooling. The running buffer was 25 mM Tris base, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 192 mM glycine with the upper tank containing approximately 2 liters of 2 × concentrated running buffer. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed at limiting power of 16,000 megawatts (maximum voltage 500 V) per gel for about 5 h until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Immediately after the run, the gels were dried on filter paper without any previous fixation. In all cases the gel surface was covered by plastic film during the drying process. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gene of previously unknown or only putative function glycerol dehydrogenase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Dried, analytical two-dimensional PAGE gels were exposed to image plates, which were subsequently scanned in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) with a pixel size of 176 × 176 μm. All image files thus produced were processed in the PDQuest two-dimensional analysis program (PDI; Protein and DNA Imageware Inc.) version 4.1. In brief, gel scans were subjected to background subtraction and smoothing to produce a synthetic gel image on which spot detection was performed (23Blomberg A. Blomberg L. Norbeck J. Fey S.J. Mose Larsen P. Larsen M. Roepstorff P. Degand H. Boutry M. Posch A. Görg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis was combined with a log Student's t test to produce sets containing the proteins that change significantly and by the specified factor. NADP+-specific glycerol dehydrogenase from Aspergillus niger was obtained from Sigma (product number G9509). The protein was dissolved in SDS buffer (0.3% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol in 50 mM Tris buffer) and boiled for 5 min. Extract equivalent to 5 μg of protein was subsequently applied on an SDS-PAGE gel of 15% acrylamide utilizing the same chemicals as the two-dimensional PAGE second dimension gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein bands were trypsin-digested as described (22Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unknown spots were identified by the methodology described previously (22Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using preparative two-dimensional PAGE electrophoresis, in-gel trypsin digestion, separation of generated peptides on high pressure liquid chromatography, and N-terminal sequencing. Homology searches were then performed using the BLAST program to screen all public yeast sequences. The molecular weight (Mr) and isoelectric point (pI) axis was constructed using values taken from the latest update of the YPD data base. 3The latest update of the YPD data base can be found on the World Wide Web at http://quest7.proteome.com/. The proteins used were, in order of decreasing Mr, Met6p (p85.7/6.25), Ssa2p (p69.3/4.9), Ssb1p (p66.5/5.23), Lys9p (p48.9/5.18), Eno2p (p46.8/5.82), Act1p (p41.7/5.39), Ilv5p (p37.9/6.49), Ipp1p (32.2/5.46), and YKL056c (p18.7/4.44). Assays for dihydroxyacetone kinase and glycerol dehydrogenase (GLD) were performed as described earlier (25Gancedo C. Llobell A. Ribas J.-C. Luchi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Extract for the assay was made from cells of 250 ml of YNB medium with 0 or 1.4 M NaCl grown to an OD610 of 0.5. These cells were washed in 10 ml of ice-cold 20 mM MES buffer, pH 6.5, and subsequently disrupted by vortexing for 4 × 30 s with the addition of 0.6 g of acid-washed glass beads and 600 μl of the MES buffer. Determination of protein concentration was performed as described previously (23Blomberg A. Blomberg L. Norbeck J. Fey S.J. Mose Larsen P. Larsen M. Roepstorff P. Degand H. Boutry M. Posch A. Görg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The dihydroxyacetone assay was performed in 0.1 M imidazole, pH 7.5, 10 mM 2,2′-dipyridyl, 0.1 mM NADH, 1 mM KCN, 20 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM dihydroxyacetone as substrate, approximately 2 units of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Boehringer Mannheim), and an appropriate amount of extract. The reaction was started by the addition of ATP to 10 mM final concentration. The oxidation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm, and the slope was normalized for protein amount to yield the specific activity in units defined as 1 nmol of NADH/min being oxidized to NAD+. Attempts at measuring GLD activity were made with the following buffers: (i) 0.1 M K2CO3, pH 9, with 10 mM 2,2′-dipyridyl, 0.1 mM NADPH or NADH, an appropriate amount of extract, and 4 mM dihydroxyacetone to start the reaction, (ii) 0.1 M imidazole, 10 mM 2,2′-dipyridyl, 0.1 mM NADPH or NADH, 1 mM KCN, 20 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM dihydroxyacetone as substrate (pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.5), (iii) TRED buffer (10 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and 10% (v/v) of glycerol as substrate. Both NAD+ and NADP+ were tested as cofactors. In this last case the protein extraction was also performed in TRED buffer. Total RNA was isolated from cells grown and harvested as described for protein extracts, and running and blotting procedures were as described previously (5Eriksson P. André L. Ansell R. Blomberg A. Adler L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with identical ACT1 and GPD1 probes also used (kindly provided by R. Ansell). For probing the other genes, the following oligonucleotides were used (all of which were obtained from Life Technologies Ltd): GPP1, 5′-TGT GGT CAA AGG CAT TGC GAT GG-3′; GPP2, 5′-CTT GCT CAT TGA TCG GAT ATC CTA A-3′; DAK1, 5′-TTG TTC AGC ACC ACT CTT CAT CCA-3′; DAK2, 5′-GTA GGT AGG GAG TAA CGA TGT TTC-3′; ENO1, 5′-GCC ATT TTG ATT TAG TGT TTG TGT G-3′; ENO2, 5′-GTA TGT TAT AGT ATT AGT TGC TTG GTG-3′; YBR149w (YBZ9), 5′-TTT CCT GTG ACA TTG TAC TTT TCG G-3′; GCY1, 5′- ACC CTT TTT TCG CCC TTT TCC TTC −3′; YPR1, 5′-TGC CAA CTT CTT CTT CAT TCA AAT AG-3′; YDL124W, 5′-TTT GAT TAA CTT GGG GCT TGA CTT C-3′. The bands were quantified in the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics) after scanning on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics 425E). The obtained values were then normalized by division with the corresponding value for ACT1. After inoculation of fresh medium with an overnight culture of SKQ2n (ATCC 44827), a lag phase followed, the length of which depended on the NaCl concentration (Fig. 1). For 0 and 0.7 M NaCl medium there was no significant difference, with growth resuming after about 1 h. Inoculation into 1.4 M, however, was stress of a higher magnitude, and the adaptation phase lasted for approximately 6 h. A salt dependence of the growth rate was also observed with generation times of 1.7, 2.7, and 6.6 h for 0, 0.7, and 1.4 M NaCl, respectively. [35S]methionine was added at an OD610 of 0.5 (indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 1), which was more than one generation before growth arrest in the diauxic shift. As can be further seen, the density at which cell growth was arrested, due to exhaustion of glucose, was strongly related to the medium composition (Fig. 1), with control cells reaching an optical density of approximately 6.6, 0.7 M cells reaching an OD610 of 3.4, and 1.4 M grown cells arresting at an OD610 of about 1.4. Strain Y41 (ATCC 38531) displayed similar generation times as SKQ2n irrespective of salinity (data not shown). Protein extracted from the harvested cells was applied on isoelectric focusing gels, which were run overnight and subsequently mounted on top of SDS-PAGE gels for the second dimension. Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager plates to produce a digital image of the protein pattern (Fig. 2). Many protein spots on these gels were previously identified by N-terminal sequencing of in-gel trypsin-generated peptides (19Norbeck J. Blomberg A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of seven previously unidentified protein spots are presented in this study (Table TI). Four of these are genes of previously unknown or only putative function (FUN genes), and the expression of all seven, except YKL056c, was affected by the medium salinity. The Mr and pI of these identified proteins is shown on two-dimensional gels from 0 and 1.4 M NaCl (Fig. 2), and the locations on the gel are furthermore available on a two-dimensional PAGE yeast data base, 4This data base can be found on the World Wide Web at http://yeast-2dpage.gmm.gu.se. which is continuously being updated as identifications proceed. The Mr and pI of the 73 responsive proteins described above, with quantifications at 0 and 1.4 M NaCl, expressed as ppm of total protein, is presented together with identity where possible (Table TII). The more dominant proteins often have “satellite spots” of slightly different pI values, but the reason for the appearance of these spots is not known. Such “satellites” are indicated when location and expression data suggests identity (Table TII).Table IIPosition and quantity of proteins, the expression of which were found to respond more than 3-fold during growth in 1.4 M NaCl, sorted by response class (Fig. 5)Response classMrpIQuantityGene nameResponse classMrpIQuantityGene name0 M1.4 M0 M1.4 MppmppmHalometric increase15.36.09543722*Halometric decrease16.95.286727516.55.72301055*37.96.579122346*ILV516.66.1137645*39.86.320,0843650ADH119.45.81761017*40.06.42368433(ADH1)23.05.94391581*GPP243.74.7951270*25.34.6166624*48.95.22618762*LYS929.25.43011287*49.95.13217898SAM137.55.914391753.35.577711270GDH140.85.4120403*53.55.4727141*(GDH1)45.76.01461209*54.56.0378124*46.15.4297966*GPD156.75.815,8254929*PDC159.55.24111492*DAK157.05.71831563*(PDC1)57.34.91609501*61.96.277423063.45.01169261*HSP60High-salt increase30.75.420163865.66.0450106*31.25.211336566.55.22017647SSB137.95.9136789Low-salt increase16.86.1101325*High-salt decrease85.76.23343887*MET633.15.812274687.16.1898254*(MET6)48.96.3339015,190ENO149.26.23411110*(ENO1)Low-salt decrease27.84.74043650*Unclassified increase20.05.09259029.44.71471426*NAB1A/YST122.55.96434831.64.71106346*23.05.46474135.85.089925325.15.07928652.06.1125631829.16.13120856.24.7126534732.05.34031259.65.52602761ALD634.25.76147935.15.58030837.15.27126038.25.758505Unclassified decrease25.75.03708839.15.35932638.45.52699039.35.55934251.56.12754246.25.55023460.04.61895547.66.26722249.16.59049250.45.43713150.95.55820351.85.26048852.75.71212353.15.73884159.95.66933362.36.074420CTT170.75.91623071.05.813318 Open table in a new tab The GPP1 gene, coding for the constitutive form of glycerol-3-phosphatase (8Norbeck J.

We furthermore found that the initial methionine was missing. The predicted Mr and pI of this shorter form (27.9 and 5.43, respectively) also correlates better with the apparent Mr and pI of the identified Gpp1p on two-dimensional gels (p27.9/5.5). The individual protein spots on the two-dimensional gels were quantified, normalized to the total dpm found in valid spots on the respective gel, and analyzed for statistically significant changes. A primary selection was made for proteins changing in quantity by at least 3-fold, going from 0 to 1.4 M NaCl, and this yielded 73 responding protein spots (Table TII). From a plot of the number of proteins against -fold change it could be seen that the magnitude of change was generally greater for the increasing proteins (Fig. 3). Proteins displaying a salt-dependent expression change of less than 3-fold are hereafter only discussed in the cases where the two-dimensional identity is known (Table TIII). 30 of the 73 responsive proteins were found to be repressed, and these are indicated by circles on the pattern from the control, 0 M NaCl, cells (Fig. 2A). Arrows point to the three proteins repressed by a 6-fold criterion. On a gel of extract from 1.4 M NaCl-grown cells (Fig. 2B) are similarly shown the 43 proteins induced more than 3-fold by this salinity; the 13 arrows indicate proteins induced more than 6-fold.Table IIIPosition and expression of identified proteins not included among the salt responsive proteins in Table IIProteinMrpIQuantityGene name0 M1.4 MppmGlycolytic enzymes56.45.3666223HXK239.05.849,75522,451FBA146.85.860,97227,536ENO2Structural41.75.453152668ACT1Miscellaneous (in alphabetical order)50.05.21716826ATP227.95.513841331GPP132.25.920262326IPP147.36.013171370MET1727.74.81844914NAB1B/YST266.35.32074840SSB218.74.466496148YKL056c25.55.791373143SC9718_15 (YMR116C) Open table in a new tab Inspection of the growth curves from the different salinities shows that harvest of the cells in 1.4 M NaCl was only one to two generations from the cessation of fermentative growth, and many of the changes observed could thus be argued to be due to this fact, since the transition phase at glucose depletion is accompanied by massive changes in protein expression (26Fuge K.E. Braun E.L. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5802-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Bataillé N. Régnacqo M. Boucherie H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were therefore labeled and harvested at an earlier stage of the growth curve as a control, and from two-dimensional gels of these it was evident that the proteins reported as responsive also here displayed salinity-dependent changes (data not shown). It was evident from the quantitation of individual proteins that several different patterns of regulation could be discerned, as shown in a blowup of a portion of the gels centered around an Mr of 55 and a pI of 5.5 and demonstrating the regulation of three selected proteins in SKQ2n, from 0, 0.7, and 1.4 M NaCl, and Y41 from 1.4 M NaCl (Fig. 4). A ratio, Q (Fig. 5), was therefore calculated for each of the more than 3-fold responsive proteins between 0 and 1.4 M NaCl, and this Q value was subsequently used to group these responders into three classes depending on between which salinities the main expression change occurred. A value for Q falling between 0.4 and 2.3 was somewhat arbitrarily chosen as an indication of a protein expression regulated more or less linearly with salt concentration, a response that we will hereafter refer to as halometric. Proteins displaying their major change already at 0.7 M NaCl, corresponding to a Q value below 0.4, were characterized as having a low-salt response while a major change at the highest salinity, indicated by a Q above 2.3, was termed high-salt response. A number of proteins, especially among the increasing, have a very low ppm value in the uninduced state, and quantifications of spots close to background values tend to be overestimated or uncertain. For this reason, no Q value was calculated for spots with an uninduced level of below 100 ppm, and these were therefore grouped together as unclassified responders (Table TII).Fig. 5Definition of the different regulatory classes identified in this work. The value Q was calculated (Q = (ppm1.4 M− ppm0.7 M)/(ppm0.7 M− ppm0 M)) and used to assign each protein to the proper regulatory class.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the selection into classes described above will naturally yield border straddlers, we have also indicated the proteins that fulfill a more stringent classification by an asterisk in Table TII. By these more stringent criteria, a high-salt response should have a Q of 1 ± 0.5, a low-salt response should have a Q value below 0.1, and a high-salt response should have a Q value of more than 10. This class of proteins constitute the largest group, both for increasing and decreasing proteins, comprising 29 of 45 classified proteins. 17 of the 29 halometric proteins were found to decrease, most by 3-4-fold, and about half of the proteins in this class have been identified (Table TII). Glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP+), encoded by the GDH1 gene, was identified as spot p53.3/5.5 as the most repressed protein present, and it is likely that the slightly less regulated p53.5/5.4 is a charge variation, satellite spot, of the same protein, thus explaining the similar regulation. The same would apply to the pair of spots p39.8/6.3 and p40.0/6.4, which were also among the most repressed enzymes, the first of which has been identified as the product of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) gene. The spot corresponding to Eno2p, p46.8/5.8, was repressed approximately 2-fold, which on account of the very high level at which this protein is synthesized (Table TIII) makes it the most repressed enzyme seen as absolute change in number of protein molecules/cell. Pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) and the glycolytic enzyme fructose bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1p) were both repressed by salt, although the latter only 2.2-fold.

This interaction results in further modification of FAK by Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, including phosphorylation of catalytic domain tyrosines 576 and 577, which elevates FAK's kinase activity toward exogenous substrates (34Calalb M.B.

Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanisms that govern signaling mediated by FAK and Cas, we examined potential regulation of FAK·;Cas complex formation and subcellular distribution by factors known to result in a concomitant increase in their phosphotyrosine content, namely cell adhesion and transformation by Src. Both processes increased FAK·;Cas complex levels in nonionic detergent-insoluble cellular fractions, suggesting increased association with the cytoskeleton. In the case of activated Src, increased association of the FAK·;Cas complex with this fraction requires an active Src catalytic domain but not its SH2 or SH3 domains. This effect was observed in the context of Cas binding to each of two distinct proline-rich sites on FAK. Moreover, Src's ability to enhance the FAK·;Cas complex required FAK tyrosines 576 and 577, suggesting a role for direct phosphorylation of these sites by Src. The source and maintenance of COS-7 cells, mouse Balb/c/3T3 fibroblasts, rat 3YI fibroblasts, and the Src-transformed 3YI cell line PS3YI have been described previously (34Calalb M.B. Polte T.R.

Hunter (Salk Institute) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell lysis of adherent cells was carried out as described previously (2Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Detached cells were prepared by trypsinization followed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline with soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml) and two washes in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cell lysis was performed in the following buffers as indicated: low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol), Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40), 0.05% SDS-RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), 0.1% SDS-RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate), or 0.5% SDS-RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate). All lysis buffers were supplemented with 50 mM NaF, 1% aprotinin, and 0.1 mM Na3VO4. In some experiments the insoluble material from low salt Nonidet P-40 lysates was solubilized in 0.1% SDS-RIPA buffer and homogenized by passing several times through a 26-gauge needle. Protein concentration of lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and samples were standardized as stated in the figure legends.

Proteins detected by immunoblotting were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software for volume integration; Molecular Dynamics). Cell fractionation was carried out according to the methods of Kaplan et al. (44Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent normally growing cells were chilled on ice for 15 min and then washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed for 30 s, 2 min, or 10 min by gently rocking at 4°C in cytoskeleton stabilization buffer (CSK) (0.3 M sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1% aprotinin, 50 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4). Plates were rinsed briefly with a small volume of CSK and pooled with the initial lysate. CSK lysates were centrifuged 20 min to remove cellular debris. Insoluble cell fractions remaining on plates were solubilized in 0.1% SDS-RIPA for 10 min followed by scraping and homogenization through a 26-gauge needle. To ensure that conditions were equivalent during immunoprecipitations, the CSK-soluble fractions were diluted in a RIPA supplement such that the final lysate contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Samples were standardized with respect to total protein solubilized at each time point in the CSK and RIPA fractions combined. Lysates were subjected to immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation analysis as described above. pBluescript-II (SK+) (Stratagene) and pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) plasmids containing hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged FAK plasmids have been described previously (34Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on pBluescript-II (SK+)-HA-tagged FAK plasmids using the Mutagene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at positions 397, 407, 576, and 577 have been described previously (34Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation was made at position 861 using the following DNA oligomer: 5′-CACATCTTTCAGCCTGTG-3′. FAK mutants containing proline to alanine mutations were made using the following oligomers: P712A/P715A (mPR-1), 5′-GAAGCAGCACCCAAGGCCAGCAG-3′; and P873A/P876A (mPR-2), 5′-CCTGCAGCTCCAGCAAAGAAAGCTCCTCGCCCT-3′. Mutagenized fragments were sequenced to confirm the mutations and to ensure integrity of the remaining sequence prior to subsequent subcloning into the pRc/CMV eukaryotic expression vector or pBTM116 yeast expression vector. Mouse neuronal c-Src (45Martinez R. Mathey-Prevot B. Bernards A. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 237: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was used in all studies involving Src, and for simplicity it is referred to as c-Src. For full-length c-Src expression, cDNA sequences from pN1.8 (45Martinez R. Mathey-Prevot B. Bernards A. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 237: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), representing the entire c-Src open reading frame as well as approximately 200 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequences encompassed by NcoI and XbaI restriction sites, were subcloned into the NotI-ApaI site of pRc/CMV. A C-terminal truncated version of c-Src (Nt-Src), representing amino acid residues 1-251, was subcloned into the NotI site of pRc/CMV as a NcoI-SmaI fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis of c-Src was carried out on appropriate fragments subcloned into pBluescript-II (SK+). The following DNA oligomers were used to create specific mutations: Y535F (to avoid confusion, this mutation will be referred to as Y527F, the corresponding mutation in non-neuronal c-Src), 5′-TCCCCGGGCTCGAACTGTGGCTC-3′; D101N, 5′-ACAGAGACTAACCTGTCCTTC-3′; R183K, 5′-TTCCTCGTGAAGGAGAGTGAG-3′; and K303R, 5′-GTTGCCATCAGAACTCTGAAG-3′. Mutagenized fragments were sequenced to confirm the mutations and to ensure integrity of the remaining sequence prior to subsequent subcloning. DNA transfections of COS-7 cells were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μg of total plasmid DNA was mixed with 25 μl of LipofectAMINE for transfection of 100-mm cell culture dishes. Cells were incubated 6 h in the presence of LipofectAMINE and DNA in serum-free media before adding calf serum to 10% and incubated an additional 18 h before changing to normal growth media. Cells were harvested 48 h after initial transfection. Plasmids and yeast strains used in the two-hybrid screen were generously provided by Stan Hollenberg (Vollum Institute). Interactions between specific polypeptides were assayed essentially as described previously (17Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The bait plasmid pBTM116-FAKNX (17Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with a FAK polypeptide encompassing residues 1-748 yielded the Cas, Efs/Sin (for mbryonal yn-associated ubstrate (52Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H.

A second two-hybrid screen with a murine Cas polypeptide encompassing residues 300-874 yielded the Src pVP16-SH3 domain construct. 2S. Reddy, T. R. Polte, and S. K. Hanks, unpublished results. These constructs were isolated from pVP16-mouse embryo cDNA libraries constructed by Hollenberg et al. (46Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The Cas SH3 domain is from the p130Cas“a” variant (17Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of Src is from the neuronal form of Src. To determine if interactions between FAK and Cas are regulated by cell adhesion, the ability of Cas to co-precipitate with FAK immune complexes was compared in lysates of adherent versus detached Balb/c/3T3 fibroblasts. The relative stability and solubility of the complexes was determined by employing five different buffers of increasing stringency based on concentration of NaCl, SDS, and sodium deoxycholate: low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer, Nonidet P-40 buffer, 0.05% SDS-RIPA buffer, 0.1% SDS-RIPA buffer, or 0.5% SDS-RIPA (see “Experimental Procedures” for complete buffer compositions). Cas was readily detected in FAK immune complexes formed in lysates of both adherent and detached cells under each lysis condition tested with the exception 0.5% SDS-RIPA lysis, which failed to recover FAK·;Cas complexes from either adherent or detached cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). 3Minor levels of Cas were detected in some immune complexes formed with control IgG. These background levels were highest for Nonidet P-40 buffer lysates (and CSK buffers; see below) of adherent cells and were taken into account when determining the significance of coprecipitating Cas. The effect of cell adhesion on Cas coprecipitation with FAK varied with the buffer used to lyse the cells. Equal or slightly more Cas coprecipitated from detached cells as compared with adherent cells when lysates were prepared with low salt Nonidet P-40 and Nonidet P-40 buffers (Fig. 1, compare lane 2 with lane 4 and lane 6 with lane 8). In contrast, significantly less Cas coprecipitated with FAK from detached cells as compared with adherent cells when lysates were prepared with 0.05-0.1% SDS RIPA buffers (Fig. 1, compare lane 10 with lane 12 and lane 14 with lane 16). These findings suggest the presence of distinct subsets of FAK·;Cas complexes, differing with respect to solubility and/or stability and differentially regulated by cell adhesion. Less coprecipitating Cas was observed in Nonidet P-40 lysates compared with low salt Nonidet P-40 lysates (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that nonionic detergent-soluble FAK·;Cas complexes are sensitive to salt concentrations, possibly reflecting a weak interaction. In contrast, more coprecipitating Cas was detected in 0.05-0.1% SDS-RIPA lysates compared with Nonidet P-40 buffer lysates (Fig. 1, compare lane 6 with lanes 10 and 14) despite the fact that each buffer contains equal concentrations of NaCl. This indicates that RIPA buffers solubilize a different subpopulation of complexes in which FAK-Cas interactions are more stable. Further supporting the presence of distinct FAK·;Cas complex subpopulations, different electrophoretic mobility characteristics were observed for the coprecipitating Cas under different lysis conditions. In low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer, FAK-associated Cas comprised a major band migrating near 125 kDa and a minor band near 120 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). In contrast, the two bands were of nearly equal intensity in RIPA lysates (Fig. 1, lanes 10, 12, 14, and 16). It is not known what changes in Cas give rise to these different migrating species; however, it is unlikely that tyrosine phosphorylation is a major contributing factor, since only trace amounts of phosphotyrosine were detected in Cas immunoprecipitates formed under these conditions (Fig. 3, and see “Discussion”). To address the effect of Src transformation on FAK·;Cas complex solubility and stability, low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer and 0.1% SDS-RIPA buffer lysates from two Src-transformed cell lines, PS3YI and PSrcII, and their corresponding nontransformed parental lines, rat 3YI and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, respectively, were assayed for coimmunoprecipitation. Similar to cell adhesion, Src transformation differentially affected the amount of coprecipitating Cas, depending on cell lysis conditions. When assayed in low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer lysates, less Cas coprecipitated with FAK from Src-transformed cells as compared with parental lines (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lane 6 and lane 10 with lane 14). In contrast, when assayed in 0.1% SDS-RIPA buffer, significantly more Cas coprecipitated with FAK from Src transformed cells as compared with parental lines (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lane 8 and lane 12 with lane 16). For parental cells, decreased recovery of FAK·;Cas complexes from 0.1% SDS-RIPA lysates compared with low salt Nonidet P-40 lysates (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lane 4"
https://openalex.org/W1976288322,"Abstract glut1 gene expression and glucose transport are stimulated in a variety of cells and tissues in response to hypoxia. glut1 is also up-regulated by inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (such as azide) in the presence of oxygen. Here, we test the hypothesis that hypoxia stimulates glut1 gene expression independent of its inhibitory effect on oxidative phosphorylation. We examined the effect of cobalt chloride, a known stimulator of genes responsive to reduced oxygen concentration per se, on GLUT1 expression under normoxic conditions and compared the results with the response to azide. Exposure of a rat liver cell line (Clone 9) to 250 μM cobalt chloride increases GLUT1 mRNA content, which becomes evident at 2 h, reaches a maximal value of ∼12-fold at 8 h, and remains elevated at ∼8-fold at 24 h. GLUT1 mRNA was the only GLUT isoform expressed in control cells and in cells exposed to cobalt chloride or azide. The induction of GLUT1 mRNA by cobalt chloride is associated with a ∼10-fold stimulation of cytochalasin B-inhibitable 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport at 24 h. In contrast to the rapid decrease in cell ATP levels and the stimulation of glucose transport in response to azide, cell ATP content and glucose transport remained unaltered during the initial 1-h period of exposure to cobalt chloride. The effect of cobalt chloride on GLUT1 mRNA content is mimicked by Ni(II) or Mn(II) but not by Fe(II). Employing actinomycin D, we found no increase in the ∼1.5-h half-life of GLUT1 mRNA in cobalt chloride-treated cells, suggesting that the effect of cobalt chloride on GLUT1 mRNA content is largely mediated at the transcriptional level; in contrast, GLUT1 mRNA half-life increased to >8 h in azide-treated cells. In transient transfections we found that ∼6 kilobase pairs (kbp) of 5′-flanking region of the rat glut1 promoter confers both cobalt chloride- and azide-inducibility to a reporter gene. Deletion of ∼2,500 base pairs (bp) from the 5′ end of the ∼6-kbp DNA fragment results in a reduction of the response to cobalt chloride and a complete loss of the response to azide. A 666-bp DNA segment located ∼6.0 kbp upstream of the transcription start site was found to be necessary for the increase in reporter gene expression in response to azide, whereas a 480-bp segment located at approximately −3.5 kbp mediated the response to cobalt chloride. The 480-bp segment is highly homologous to the previously reported mouse glut1 enhancer and contains several potential regulatory elements, including a hypoxia-inducible element; an additional hypoxia-inducible element is present in the 666-bp segment. Our results suggest that glut1 gene expression is regulated in a dual fashion by hypoxia per se and in response to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1978524270,"Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed on amino acid residues 210-216 of cytochrome P450 3A4, the major drug-metabolizing enzyme of human liver. Mutagenesis of this region, which has been proposed to align with the C-terminal ends of F-helices from cytochromes P450BM-3, P450terp, and P450cam, served as a test of the applicability of the substrate recognition site model of Gotoh (Gotoh, O. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 83-90) to P450 3A4. The results, using two steroid substrates, indicated that substitution of Ala for Leu210 altered the responsiveness to the effector alpha-naphthoflavone and the regioselectivity of testosterone hydroxylation. Replacement of Leu211 by Ala also decreased the stimulation by alpha-naphthoflavone, whereas mutations at residues 212-216 had little effect. The diminished flavonoid responses of the 210 and 211 mutants were observed over a wide range of progesterone and alpha-naphthoflavone concentrations. Further characterization was performed with the additional effectors beta-naphthoflavone, flavone, and 4-chromanone. The finding that P450 3A4 with one altered residue, Leu210 --> Ala, can have both an altered testosterone hydroxylation profile and response to flavonoid stimulation provides evidence that the substrate binding and effector sites are at least partially overlapping."

The relative enrichment of carbon-13 in the carboxyl group of amino acids, as observed by Abelson and Hoering (1Abelson P.H. Hoering T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in 1961, was the first indication for the existence of non-statistical isotope distributions in biological compounds. Later results on acetic acid (2Meinschein W.G. Rinaldi G.G. Hayes J.M. Schoeller D.A. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1974; 1: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and on acetoin (3Rinaldi G.G. Meinschein W.G. Hayes J.M. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1974; 1: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) gave evidence that this observation was just one example of a common phenomenon. In order to find a general explanation for this observation Galimov (4Galimov E. The Biological Fractionation of Isotopes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1985Google Scholar) discussed that even in chemically unequilibrated systems, e.g. biological systems, a microscopic reversibility in enzymatic reactions is the origin for a thermodynamically ordered isotope distribution. The author's calculations could in fact explain some of the isotopic patterns of natural compounds known at that time. However, the presumption of a general thermodynamic equilibrium in biological systems is probably not realistic. In our opinion kinetic isotope effects on enzymatic reactions should be considered as primary causes for isotope discriminations.

More detailed interpretations were possible when the total isotopic patterns of primary and secondary metabolites became available. Especially, our corresponding investigations on glucose indicated an enrichment of 13C in positions C-3 and C-4, and a depletion of 13C in positions C-1 and C-6 (Fig. 1) of this important primary metabolite (16Roßmann A. Butzenlechner M. Schmidt H.-L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We have also identified the corresponding pattern in some direct metabolites of glucose (15Schmidt H.-L. Kexel H. Butzenlechner M. Schwarz S. Gleixner G. Thimet S. Werner R.A. Gensler M. Wada E.

As one of the reasons for this glucose pattern, we have discussed isotope effects on several reactions of the pentose phosphate cycle, especially on the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction. In order to verify this assumption we have now determined the kinetic and the equilibrium isotope effects on this reaction. We used for our experiments the well characterized Class I rabbit muscle aldolase (18Lebherz H.G. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Penhoet E.E.

The enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol cleavage of 1-phospho-ketoses (mainly fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP)) 1The abbreviations used are: FBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateDHAPdihydroxyacetone phosphateGC-C-IRMSgas chromatograph-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometerkatkatal. into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and aldehydes (mainly glyceraldehyde phosphate (glyceraldehyde 3-P)). In the condensation reaction it is specific for dihydroxyacetone phosphate with retention of pro-S-configuration of C-3 in the ketoses. More than 50 different aldehydes are condensed with DHAP (23Bednarski M.D. Simon E.S. Bischofberger N. Fesser W.-D. Kim M.-J. Lees W. Saito T. Waldmann H. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem.

The currently understood enzyme mechanism consists of several distinct steps (25Voet D. Voet J.G. BFE.Biochemie. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1992: 329Google Scholar, 26Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C.

The Enzymes. 1972; 7: 213-258Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2. They are preceded by the opening of the predominant ring form of the substrate in solution; step I is building up of the enzyme substrate complex, E·;FBP; step II a Schiff base (E·;SBFBP) formation from this complex; in step III the -C-C-bond cleavage to the “ternary” complex, E·;enamine·;glyceraldehyde 3-P, the enamine of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-P, takes place; step IV is the dissociation of glyceraldehyde 3-P from the ternary complex; step V is the DHAP-Schiff base formation, E·;SBDHAP; step VI is a proton transfer giving rise to the protonated Schiff base, E·;DHAP; step VII is the dissociation of DHAP from its Michaelis complex, E·;DHAP. It is still not clear whether the velocity of the total reaction rate is limited by the -C-C-bond cleavage (step III) or by the release of the triose phosphates (step IV and VII). The main purpose of this work is to elucidate the role of the enzyme reaction for the non-statistical 13C pattern of glucose, however, in the context of this investigation we also expect to identify the rate-limiting step in the mechanism by the carbon isotope effect on the reaction. Yet, our main interest deals with the influence of the aldolase reaction on the non-statistical isotope distribution in carbohydrate metabolism. All ordinary chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from local suppliers. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-trisodium salt, C6H11O12P2Na3*8H2O, was from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany. Triose-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), and phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), used for enzymatic assays of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and glycerol 3-phosphate (28Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974Google Scholar), were from local suppliers (Sigma, München, and Boehringer Mannheim GmbH). Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.2.1.13) from rabbit muscle, specific activity 0.15 μkat/mg, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.18), specific activity 2.83 μkat/mg, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), specific activity 1.33 μkat/mg, used for the reaction assay, were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. The activity of triose-phosphate isomerase in these enzymes, which is a common impurity of glycolytic enzymes, was below 0.1%. The measurement of the kinetic isotope effect on the aldolase reaction was performed under pH- and temperature-controlled conditions (Dosimat, Methrom, Herisau, CH), with the competitive method after O'Leary (29O'Leary M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). 1 mmol of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.1 mmol of NAD+, 25 μmol of phosphoglycolate, and 2 mmol of NaH2AsO4 were dissolved in 100 ml of water (high performance liquid chromatography grade). The pH was adjusted to 7.6 (25% NaOH). For “partial turnover” (approximately 10% or 1 h), an aliquot of 90 ml of this medium was incubated in the Dosimat vessel at 25°C with 1.25 μkat of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 834 nkat of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 33.3 nkat of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. For the “total turnover” assay, to an aliquot of 10 ml of medium, 834 nkat of aldolase were added, while the activities of the other enzymes added were identical as in the partial turnover assay. After turnover, the reaction mixtures were heated for 10 min to 65°C. The denatured proteins were eliminated by filtration (0.45 μm, Millipore, type HA), and the exact turnover was determined in an aliquot of the filtrate (enzymatic assays for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, and 3-phosphoglycerate). The bulk of the filtrate was lyophilized overnight, and the residue was dissolved in 5 ml of water. The reaction products 3-phosphoglycerate and glycerol-3-phosphate were separated by anion-exchange chromatography of 1-ml aliquots (Parisil SAX, 10 μm 20 × 250 mm, Grom, Herrenberg, Germany) on a Sykam high performance liquid chromatograph system (Sykam, Gilching, Germany). Before addition of the medium, the column was equilibrated for 30 min with 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 2.8) (flow rate 5 ml/min.). By a linear gradient between 5 and 150 mM KH2PO4 (pH 2.8) the reaction products were eluted. The fractions containing the reaction products, identified by their UV-absorption (200-350 nm) and enzymatic assays, were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at 4°C. The column was regenerated with 25 ml of 500 mM KH2PO4 (pH 2.8). 270 mg of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 10 mg of 2-phosphoglycolate (for inhibition of the triose-phosphate isomerase) were dissolved in 10 ml of 20 mM sodium arsenate solution (pH 7.6, 25°C). The solution was divided into 4 aliquots. In each, the reaction was started by the addition of 3.3 nkat of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. The reaction was stopped after 8 h (2 aliquots), respectively, 24 h (2 aliquots), by heating (65°C, 10 min), and the denatured protein was eliminated by filtration (0.45 μm, Millipore type HA) To the solution, 0.1 μmol of NADH, 0.1 μmol of NAD+, 283 nkat of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase solution, and 133 nkat of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase solution were added, and by 1 h incubation the triose phosphates were converted into glycerol 3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, respectively. After this conversion the proteins were denatured by heating. The filtrate of the medium was concentrated to 1 ml, and the products were separated as described before, by anion-exchange chromatography. The pooled fractions (about 5 ml) were concentrated under reduced pressure to 500 μl and finally lyophilized directly in 700-μl autosampler vials, in which the chemical degradation was performed. For the periodate degradation of glycerol 3-phosphate into formaldehyde and phosphoglycolaldehyde (30Rauschenbach P. Lamprecht W. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1966; 346: 290-295Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the compound (isolation and determination of total amount see above) was dissolved in 500 mM KH2PO4− buffer (pH 5.8) to a final concentration of at least 100 mM, and a 120% molar excess sodium metaperiodate was added. The reaction was complete after 5 min at room temperature. In the case of millimole samples, this was controlled by the determination of the formaldehyde formed (31Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4111) Google Scholar), while for nanomole samples the turnover was determined simultaneously to the isotope ratio measurement in the GC-C-IRMS system. For the determination of the isotope ratio of the phosphoglycolaldehyde formed, the solution was evaporated to dryness; after addition of water, the evaporation was repeated twice. The residue was directly submitted to wet combustion by adding 1 ml of 50% H2SO4 and a two times molar excess of KMnO4. The reaction was performed in an evacuated vessel at room temperature, and was complete after 3 min. The CO2 produced was measured volumetrically and then condensed into a vial for isotope ratio determination. 3-Phosphoglycerate was oxidized by Ce(IV)(NH4)4(SO4)4 to CO2 and phosphoglycolate (32Simon H. Floss H.G. Anwendung von Isotopen in der organischen Chemie und Biochemie, Band 1. Bestimmung von Isotopenverteilungen in markierten Verbindungen, Springer Verlag, Berlin1967Google Scholar). In a 10-ml vacutainer 3-phosphoglycerate (10-1000 nmol), isolated as described, was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mM KH2PO4, and 2-2000 μl of reaction mixture (12.7 g of Ce(IV)(NH4)4(SO4)4 and 15 ml of concentrated H2SO4, diluted in 85 ml of water) were added. The vacutainer was evacuated and the mixture incubated for 1 h at 100°C. With millimole samples the yield was controlled volumetrically, and the CO2 was transferred to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer for measurement. In the case of nanomole samples, after reaction the vacutainer was filled to a final gas volume of 1 ml with 10% H2SO4, and an aliquot of the gaseous phase was transferred by means of a gas tight syringe to the GC-C-IRMS system, where turnover and isotope ratio were determined. Gas samples in the millimole range and solid substances were analyzed in a MM 903 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (VG Isogas, Middelwich, Cheshire, Great Britan). Prior, solid samples were converted into CO2 in an elemental analyzer Roboprep CN (Europa Scientific, Crewe, Great Britan). Gaseous samples in the nanomole range were analyzed in an Isochrome I GC-C-IRMS system (VG-Isogas, Middelwich, Cheshire, Great Britan). The separation of CO2, formic acid, and formaldehyde in the GC-C-IRMS system was performed on a PoraPLOT U column (0.32 mm × 5 m, Chrompack, Frankfurt, Germany) using a temperature program (2 min 110°C, 0.3°C/min to 140°C). All isotope ratios were corrected after Craig (33Craig H. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 1957; 12: 133-149Crossref Scopus (3199) Google Scholar) and were expressed in δ13C values 2∂13C=Rsample−RPDBRPDB.1000[%]PDB,where PDB is the international carbon isotope standard and RPDB = 0.0112372. against PDB. The calculation of isotope effects was done after O'Leary (29O'Leary M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The usual enzyme assay (28Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974Google Scholar) for the determination of the enzyme activity of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is based on the isomerization of the trioses formed by triose-phosphate isomerase and the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate using an excess of the subsidiary enzymes. For the determination of the kinetic isotope effects it was important, not only to convert the products as fast as possible, but also to do this by independent reactions, in order to obtain two distinct compounds as carriers of atoms 3 and 4 of the substrate. Therefore the triose-phosphate isomerase, if present at all, was blocked by 2-phosphoglycolate (34Hatzfeld H.J. Stitt M. Planta. 1990; 180: 198-204PubMed Google Scholar), and the glyceraldehydephosphate formed was oxidized by glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase to 3-phosphoglycerate, while dihydroxyacetone phosphate was independently reduced to glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 3). The coupled reactions had the advantage of recycling NAD+, and thus the coenzyme concentration could be kept constant. In addition, the irreversibility of the reaction was attained by incubation in 20 mM arsenate (35Schmidt K. Genovese J. Katz J. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The evaluation of the separation and degradation procedure for isotope effects was tested with reference mixtures corresponding to the reaction medium but without enzymes. These mixtures were separated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the products were degraded as indicated. As an isotope effect could also be implied in the degradation of the products, 3-phosphoglycerate and glycerol 3-phosphate were degraded in millimole quantities under the conditions applied for the analysis of the incubation products. The turnover of the Ce(IV)-fission of 3-phosphoglycerate was controlled gas volumetrically on the CO2 formed, in the case of the glycerol 3-phosphate degradation (NaIO4) by colorimetric determination of the formaldehyde formed (32Simon H. Floss H.G. Anwendung von Isotopen in der organischen Chemie und Biochemie, Band 1. Bestimmung von Isotopenverteilungen in markierten Verbindungen, Springer Verlag, Berlin1967Google Scholar). The δ13C values of CO2, formaldehyde, and phosphoglycolaldehyde were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For both reaction products, the δ13C values as calculated from that of the fragments were compared to that of the original compound (Table I). For position C-1 in both products they did not differ by more than 0.5 ‰. Hence an isotope effect on the separation and degradation procedures would be negligible.Table I.δ13C values and isotope distribution of 3-phosphoglycerate and glycerol 3-phosphate before and after isolation from incubation mediaSubstanceδ13C values [‰]PDB in position12 + 31 − 3 calculated1 − 3 measuredGlycerol 3-PIncubated29.7 ± 0.8−27.7 ± 0.6−28.4−28.3 ± 0.2Isolated29.3 ± 0.9NDaND, not determined.3-PhosphoglycerateIncubated20.6 ± 0.2−25.4 ± 0.3−23.8−23.8 ± 0.1Isolated21.1 ± 1.3ND aND, not determined.a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In addition, an isotope balance of the whole reaction was established by comparison of the δ13C value of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to that of the sum of all fragments isolated (Table II). The difference in the δ13C value of 1.3 ‰ is small enough to exclude an isotope effect in the whole reaction, even though the errors on each position should not be neglected. We guess that the reason for these relatively high standard deviations of the positional δ13C value is the application of an on-line method, permitting the use of the small amount of only 50-100 nmol of substrate for the determination of the isotope effects. On the other hand the advantage of this method was the possibility to supply small incubation volumes for the experiments (1-5 ml), to use small analytical columns for the separation, and hence to have the possibility of making more independent experiments with a limited amount of enzyme.Table IIDirectly determined and from isolated degradation products calculated δ13 C value of fructose 1,6-bisphosphateδ13 C value [‰]PDB of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in position1 − 6 measured1 − 6 calculated1 + 2345 + 6−19.3 ± 2.4−18.0−16.3 ± 2.4−19.1 ± 2.2−20.2 ± 1.1−21.5 ± 1.9 Open table in a new tab This isotope balance and the δ value assignment to the fragments also reveals the specific isotope distribution in the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate used. In contrast to natural glucose (16Roßmann A. Butzenlechner M. Schmidt H.-L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) the positions C-3 and C-4 are depleted in 13C. As the origin of the compound is not known, a discussion of the reasons is not possible. In the present context it has to be pointed out that the measurement of the isotope effect is always based on a relative shift in a given position, and absolute values of the C-atom in question are not important. The kinetic isotope effect on the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction was determined according to the competitive method (29O'Leary M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present case the δ13C value of the products in positions corresponding to positions C-3 and C-4 of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate after partial and complete turnover were determined after,13(Vmax/Km) = log(1-f)/log(1-f*Rf/R0)(Eq. 1) The calculated kinetic isotope effect on position C-3 of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 13(Vmax/Km) = 1.016 ± 0.007, on position C-4 13(Vmax/Km) = 0.997 ± 0.009 (Table III). The range of these values is realistic and their difference is obvious.Table III.Isotope ratios in positions C-3 and C-4 of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate after partial and complete turnover, and the calculated kinetic isotope effect on these positions (f = turnover fraction, Rf = isotope ratio after turnover fraction f, R0 = isotope ratio after complete turnover, KIE = kinetic isotope effect)Turnover fraction fIsotope ratio in positionKIE on position3534RfR0RfR00.0670.0107900.010987NDaND, not determined.ND1.01890.0970.0108210.0109750.0109070.0108541.01500.99490.0970.0108320.011001ND aND, not determined.ND1.01640.1080.0108430.0108650.0108910.0108111.00210.99220.127NDND0.0109070.0108480.99420.1440.0108880.0110520.0108120.0107171.01630.99050.1870.0108510.0109850.0106940.0107711.01371.00800.2370.0108510.0109730.0108850.0107621.01290.98700.2630.0108010.011034ND aND, not determined.ND1.02520.2850.0108140.0110200.0108070.0109061.02261.0109Mean1.0159 ± 0.00660.9968 ± 0.0090a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The thermodynamic equilibrium of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction should be expressed as,FBPcyclic⇔ DHAP(50% gem diol)+glyceraldehyde 3-P(98% diol)(Eq. 2) The existence of the two different forms of DHAP has not been taken into account in the determinations of the isotope effects. The equilibrium is, in the concentration range used, more than 99.9% toward FBP (28Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974Google Scholar). Taking this into account, the equilibrium isotope effect on the reaction was determined by incubation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate of known isotopic pattern with aldolase for a given time in the absence of any other enzyme, and by subsequent pattern analysis of the products in equilibrium. After 8 and 24 h incubation the aldolase was denatured, and the glyceraldehyde 3-P and dihydroxyacetone phosphate present were converted into glycerol 3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, respectively, and analyzed as described. The calculation of the isotope distribution and hence the equilibrium isotope effect was done by comparing the isotope abundance in the triose phosphates measured with the isotope content of the corresponding positions of the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in equilibrium (δ13CSE), derived from its original pattern (δ13CS0) and taking into account the shift due to the corresponding abundance of the triose phosphates. Then the isotope content of the positions in question in the triose phosphates in equilibrium (δ13CPE) was correlated to that of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in equilibrium (δ13CSE) using the equilibrium concentrations according to the equilibrium constant for [glyceraldehyde 3-P] * [DHAP]/[FBP] = 8.1 * 10−5M (36Boyer P.D.

The identical results for the two independent equilibration times indicate that the equilibration was already attained after 8 h. At the beginning, it has to be pointed out that presently in the reaction sequence in question (Fig. 2), the final release of DHAP (step VII) is discussed to be the rate-limiting step of the whole sequence (37Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kuo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12291-12297Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), however, on the other side in the performed Vmax/Km,FBP experiments, only the reactions before the first irreversible step, here the release of glyceraldehyde 3-P (step IV), can contribute to the observed isotope effects. Intriguingly we found on C-3 a kinetic isotope effect significantly different from unity, while the one on C-4 was practically unity. This is not compatible with the -C-C- bond fission itself as a reason for the isotope effect, but with the formation of the sp2 configuration between C-2 and C-3 leading to the enamine of DHAP. The measured value 1.016 is reasonable for such a conversion of a secondary alcohol to an sp2 terminal carbon, accompanied by the simultaneous fission of the adjacent C-C bond (39Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 108-110Google Scholar). This process also has to be understood as an equilibration between the secondary alcohol and the enamine structures, in which the equilibration is attained before the release of glyceraldehyde 3-P. The observed effect is hence an equilibrium isotope effect on C-3. On the other hand the formation of the carbonyl sp2 structure in glyceraldehyde 3-P does not affect the isotope abundance on C-4. In agreement, the observation of large secondary tritium isotope effects for the conversion of the substrate with 3H in positions C-3 and C-4 (1.33 and 1.37, respectively, Ref. 40Biellmann J.F. O'Connell E.L. Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 6484-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) proves the existence of an equilibrium between intermediate sp2 structures before the release of glyceraldehyde 3-P, which is hence definitely the slowest partial step in Vmax/Km,FDB experiments. We cannot explain at present the observed 13C equilibrium isotope effects on the aldolase reaction. The predictions of Cleland (39Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 108-110Google Scholar) for a substitution of a C-H bond for a C-C bond at C-3 and the substitution of a C-O bond for the cleaved C-C bond at C-4, as well as the suggestions of Hogg et al. (41Hogg J.L. Rodgers J. Kovach I. Schowen R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 79-85Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the hydration of aldehydes predict an inverse isotope effect for C-4, hence a 13C enrichment in the released glyceraldehyde 3-P. On the other hand there are no examples available to which our observation could be compared. Most important with regard to our main interest, the isotopic pattern of hexoses and descendants (Fig. 4) is the existence of the isotope effects in respect to the observed 13C enrichments in positions C-3 and C-4. The thermodynamic isotope factors (βi values) after Galimov (4Galimov E. The Biological Fractionation of Isotopes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1985Google Scholar) do not generally correspond to the actually found 13C pattern of glucose (16Roßmann A. Butzenlechner M. Schmidt H.-L.

However, the 13C enrichments in positions C-3 and C-4 (Fig. 4) support the assumption that for the pattern in these positions, the equilibrium isotope effects found in this investigation are mainly responsible. The positive values, K12/K13 = 1.004 for C-3 and 1.005 for C-4, respectively, indicate that the dissociation equilibrium for the 12C isotopomers favors the trioses and that consequently hexose isotopomers with 13C enrichments in positions C-3 and C-4 are in equilibrium with these trioses, explaining different enrichments of 13C in carbohydrates from various compartments of plants (17Gleixner G. Danier H.-J. Werner R.A. Schmidt H.-L. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Even more, the found equilibrium isotope effects also predict a relatively higher 13C enrichment in position C-4, and that is exactly what has been found in the pattern (Fig. 1). On the other hand, applying this to a realistic dynamic biological system like a plant we have to take into account that the existing fast transport, metabolism, and turnover of substrates and different conditions of metabolic fluxes prevent all chemical species from being in equilibrium. Triose phosphates are the most important intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism, providing both the carbon and the energy source for the metabolism of all other cell compartments. As we have found that in spite of the fast turnover and scrambling mentioned above, in most metabolites 13C enrichments dominate in the positions originating from C-3 and C-4 of glucose. Maintenance of an isotopic balance demands a corresponding depletion in representatives of minor pathways originating from trioses, and this may be caused by the kinetic isotope effect found. The existence of a kinetic isotope effect on the aldolase reaction would, for example, demand a depletion in 13C of position C-1 of glycerol. As a matter of fact we have found that this compound from various sources is depleted in 13C relative to glucose from the same origin 3D. Weber, H. Kexel, and H.-L. Schmidt, unpublished results. (Fig. 4). The depletion is exclusively limited to position C-1, and a “normalization” of the pattern in positions C-2 and C-3 as reference shows that it can attain, relative to the expected pattern from DHAP, 25 ‰ (e.g. glycerol in wine, less intense in glycerol from cattle fat). As glycerol is a minor product in the sources investigated, this depletion compensates the enrichments of a few ‰ in the main products. A quantitative calculation of a metabolic and isotopic balance, as has been possible in the system CO2/CH4 for a rumen simulation (42Metges C. Kempe K. Schmidt H.-L. Br. J. Nutr. 1990; 63: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) will, in a complicated system like a plant, only be possible after the determination and isotopic analysis of all main compounds. This would in principle permit the measurement of metabolic fluxes in plants and cell compartments and will be investigated in the future. We thank Dr. I. A. Rose for the helpful comments on the manuscript."

We have found that NGG1p and ADA2p are coimmunoprecipitated from yeast whole cell extracts. In fact, <2% of cellular ADA2p was not associated with NGG1p. Also in agreement with their association in vivo, the stability of ADA2p and NGG1p depended on the presence of each other. In addition, three NGG1p- and ADA2p-containing peak fractions were resolved by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow ion-exchange chromatography of whole cell extract. The presence of another high molecular mass complex was supported by the separation of one of the NGG1p- and ADA2p-containing peak fractions by gel-filtration chromatography. Together, the combination of ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography suggests a total of four complexes, two with sizes of >2 MDa and single complexes of ∼900 and 200 kDa. At least one of these complexes was found to associate with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) since TBP was present in immunoprecipitates with NGG1p. The association of TBP with the ADA proteins required amino acids 274-307 of NGG1p, a region of NGG1p required for activity. This supports a role for NGG1p in the interaction with TBP and suggests that the interaction with TBP is functionally relevant.

Chemical modifications and mutagenesis experiments have shown that their catalytic mechanism involves a cysteine residue, Cys-12, which participates in phosphoenzyme intermediate formation (15Cirri P.

As mutation or thiophosphorylation of Tyr-131 (and Tyr-132 to a lesser degree) affects the catalytic activity of LMPTP, it seems that LMPTP is regulated during T cell activation.

Serine β-lactamases are divided into three classes A, C, and D on the basis of their primary structures.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3186-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Strynadka et al. (9Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), accumulation of an acyl-enzyme during the interaction between the TEM-1 Glu-166 → Asn mutant (E166N) and benzylpenicillin suggested that the mutation affected only the deacylation step in a severe manner. In contrast, kinetic studies of the Glu-166 → Ala mutant of the Bacillus licheniformis β-lactamase (12Escobar W.A. Tan A.K. Lewis E.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7619-7626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and of the Glu-166 → Asp mutant of the Bacillus cereus I β-lactamase (13Gibson R.M. Christensen H. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) showed that accumulation of the acyl-enzyme could result from simultaneous but different decreases of the kinetic parameters characterizing the acylation and deacylation steps. The present paper reports the analysis of the kinetic properties of the TEM-1 E166N mutant. Methods were developed to monitor the rapid formation of the acyl-enzyme. One of the most striking results was a sharp modification of the substrate profile of the enzyme. To explain these results, the interactions between different β-lactams and the E166N mutant were analyzed by molecular modeling. These confirmed the role of the catalytic water molecule in the mechanism and underlined the importance of the Ω-loop residues in the specificity profile. Similar kinetic data were obtained with the E166H mutant of the Streptomyces albus G class A β-lactamase. Escherichia coli TG1 strain (Δ(lac-pro), Sup E, thi, hsdD5/F′traD36, proA− B+, lacIq, lacZΔM15) was used for routine transformation, DNA preparation and production of the TEM-1 β-lactamase and as a host strain for M13 phage growth. The Streptomyces lividans TK24 strain (14Hopwood D.A. Kieser T. Wright H.M. Bibb M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 129: 2257-2269Google Scholar) was utilized for the production of the Streptomyces albus G β-lactamase. Plasmid pAD25 (15Dubus A. Wilkin J.-M. Raquet X. Normark S. Frère J.M. Biochem.

It was used both for the mutagenesis procedure and the expression of the WT 1The abbreviation used is: WTwild type. and mutant enzymes. wild type. The gene encoding the S. albus G β-lactamase was cloned into the M13tg131 phage for mutagenesis. The mutant gene was entirely sequenced, recloned into the pIJ702′ Streptomyces plasmid (a gift from Dr. J. Altenbüchner, Universität-Regensburg, Germany), and expressed in S. lividans. Sequencing was performed by the method of Sanger et al. (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). T4 DNA ligase and kinase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Specific Streptomyces DNA manipulations, such as protoplast preparation, transformation, and plasmid extraction, were based on Hopwood et al. (17Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith G.P. Ward J.M. Schremp F. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manuel. John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar). The E166N TEM-1 β-lactamase mutant was obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (18Clackson T. Güssow D. Jones P.T. Mc Pherson M.J. Quircke P. Taylor G.R. PCR: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 202-203Google Scholar) with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-AAGGCGAGTTACATGATCCCC-3′; 5′-GTAAGTCGAGGCCCAAGGTTGCTAG-3′. The latter carried the two mismatched bases designed to mutate the GAA (Glu) codon into AAC (Asn). Amplification was performed with the Vent DNA polymerase (Biolabs) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer to which MgSO4 was added to a final concentration of 4 mM; 30 cycles (60 s at 94°C, 60 s at 56°C, 270 s at 72°C) were performed on the reaction mixture. The polymerase chain reaction product was subsequently treated as described by Imai et al. (19Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli TG1. For the E166H mutant of the S. albus G β-lactamase, mutagenesis was performed as described by Eckstein et al. (20Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used to replace the GAC (Glu) codon by CAC (His) was 5′-CTCGACCGCTGGCACCCGGAGCTGAAC-3′. Benzylpenicillin was from Rhône Poulenc (Paris, France), cefuroxime and ceftazidime were from Glaxo Group Research (Greenford, Middlesex, United Kingdom), cefotaxime from Hoechst-Roussel (Romainville, France). Imipenem, moxalactam, temocillin, and cefoxitin from Merck, Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories (Rahway, NJ). Cephalosporin C and cephaloridine from Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, IN). All these compounds were kindly given by the respective companies. [14C]Benzylpenicillin (54 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham International. Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma. Fluoresceyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid was prepared as described by Lakaye et al. (21Lakaye B. Damblon C. Jamin M. Galleni M. Lepage S. Joris B. Marchand-Brynaert J. Frydrych C. Frère J.M. Biochem J. 1994; 300: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The E166H mutant of the S. albus G β-lactamase was isolated from 3 liters of culture supernatant and purified as described by Brannigan et al. (22Brannigan J. Matagne A. Jacob F. Damblon C. Joris B. Klein D. Spratt B.G. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with an additional chromatographic step on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. For the production of the E166N TEM-1 mutant, E. coli TG1 was grown at 30°C in 15 liters of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml tetracycline. When the A550 value reached 0.6, 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added and the culture was further incubated for 3 h. Cells were collected, suspended in a 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, containing 27% sucrose (w/v) and lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml final) as described by Dubus et al. (15Dubus A. Wilkin J.-M. Raquet X. Normark S. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell debris were discarded by centrifugation and the supernatant dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The enzyme was purified as described by Vanhove et al. (23Vanhove M. Guillaume G. Ledent P. Richards J.H. Pain R.H. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 321: 413-417Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the enzyme were identified by submitting samples of fluoresceyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid-labeled enzyme to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (24Galleni M. Lakaye B. Lepage S. Jamin M. Thamm I. Joris B. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purity of the different enzyme preparations was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The TEM-1 mutant was titrated with [14C]benzylpenicillin and found to be more than 95% pure. The E166H mutant of S. albus G was only 50% pure and remained contaminated by a single, low molecular mass protein which did not interfere with the kinetic measurements. Due to the very low k3 values observed with these two mutants the determination of their kinetic parameters rested on methods similar to those used for penicillin-binding proteins rather than for regular β-lactamases. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the kinetic assays were performed at 30°C in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Pseudo-first order reactions are only obtained when the β-lactam concentration is at least five times greater than that of enzyme. Due to the high k2/K values, these conditions where only fulfilled when the experiments were performed in a stopped-flow apparatus. The β-lactam concentration was also decreased close to that of enzyme and analysis performed according to the general second order equation. Finally after the direct determination of the k2/K values for cefoxitin and cephalosporin C, those for the other compounds were determined by a competition method. The enzyme solution was added with cefoxitin, cephalosporin C, cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime. The total volume was 0.5 ml and the final enzyme concentration 16 μM. The antibiotic concentration was always slightly higher than that of the enzyme. Decrease of the A260 value resulting from the opening of the β-lactam ring was monitored with the help of an Uvikon spectrophotometer connected to a COPAM PC88C microcomputer. The data were fitted to Equation 2 using the Enzfitter program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom (25Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC/PS2. Biosoft-Elsevier, Cambridge1987Google Scholar)) yielding the value of the second-order rate constant k, i.e. k2/K′, where K′ = (k−1+ k2)/k+1. Under conditions of similar initial enzyme and substrate concentration, the general Equation 2 prevails.ln[(E0-x)/(S0-x)]=ln(E0/S0)+(E0-S0)k•t(Eq. 2) where S0 and E0 are the initial concentrations of substrate and enzyme and x the concentration of E (or S) transformed at time t. Under our experimental conditions (S0 > E0) concentrations could be replaced by absorbance values as in Equation 3, leading to Equation 4,E0=(A0−A∞)/Δε;S0=(A0−A∞)·(S0/E0)/Δεand x=(A0−At)/Δε(Eq. 3) where A0, At, A∞, are the absorbance values at times 0, t, and at the end of the reaction and Δε is the variation of the substrate molar extinction coefficient upon hydrolysis.(At−A∞)/[(S0/E0)(A0−A∞)−A0+At)]=[1/(S0−E0)]exp[((A0−A∞)·(1−S0/E0)/Δε)kt](Eq. 4) The enzyme (16 μM) was mixed with increasing concentrations of cefoxitin with the help of a Biologic Stopped-flow apparatus (Grenoble, France). The S0/E0 ratio ranged from 1.2 to 25. For data analysis, Equation 2 was adapted to the stopped-flow recording conditions. Alternatively, for the highest S0/E0 ratios the pseudo-first order approximation was used, yielding identical results. The enzyme (0.9 μM) was added with a mixture of [14C]benzylpenicillin (B) and another antibiotic (I) at concentrations ranging from 2.5 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4M. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped and the protein precipitated, isolated, and the radioactivity determined as described by Martin and Waley (26Martin M. Waley S. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since both antibiotic concentrations were larger than that of the enzyme and the incubation time was much shorter than the half-life of both acyl-enzymes (see below), the respective quantities of labeled (E-B* formed with [14C]benzylpenicillin) and unlabeled (E-I* formed with the other antibiotic) acyl-enzymes were given by Equation 5 as shown by Frère et al. (27Frère J.M. Nguyen-Disteche M. Coyette J. Joris B. Page M.I. The Chemistry of Beta-Lactams. Chapman and Hall Ltd, Andover, UK1992: 148-197Google Scholar),[EI*]/[EB*]=(k2/K)[I]/(k2/K)B[B](Eq. 5) The value of [EI*] was estimated as [EB*]0− [EB*], where [EB*]0 was the quantity of acyl-enzyme formed with [14C]benzylpenicillin in the absence of competing substrate. With the E166H mutant of the S. albus G enzyme the second-order rate constant for acylation (k2/K′) was obtained by monitoring acyl-enzyme formation as a function of time (method D). The enzyme was incubated with an excess of [14C]benzylpenicillin (S0> E0) and after increasing periods of time, the reaction was stopped by addition of 1% SDS. The labeled acyl-enzyme was isolated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by fluorography (24Galleni M. Lakaye B. Lepage S. Jamin M. Thamm I. Joris B. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 19-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein (1.6 μM) was reacted with an excess of [14C]benzylpenicillin (10−4M) and the excess of free antibiotic eliminated by addition of 600 ng of the wild-type enzyme. The mixture was incubated at 30°C and after increasing periods of time, the residual acyl-enzyme quantified after precipitation as above (26Martin M. Waley S. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After formation of the acyl-enzyme in 50 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 7, at 30°C, the excess of unlabeled antibiotic was hydrolyzed by addition of the Zn-β-lactamase of B. cereus (1 μM) and 100 μM ZnCl2. The acyl-enzyme was then left to decay during different time periods. 1 mM EDTA was added to inactivate the Zn-β-lactamase and the regenerated active-serine enzyme was quantified by saturation with [14C]benzylpenicillin and precipitation as above. With both labeled and unlabeled antibiotics, the degradation of the acyl-enzyme obeyed simple first-order kinetics (28Frère J.M. Leyh-Bouille M. Ghuysen J.M. Perkins H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The following pH range was explored: acetic acid/sodium acetate, pH 4-5.5, sodium phosphate, pH 6-8, Tris-HCl, pH 8.5-9. All the buffers were 50 mM. These experiments were performed with the help of method A for the E166N mutant and method D for the E166H mutant. For the TEM-1 wild-type enzyme, the kcat/Km value was obtained by determining initial rates (v0) at substrate concentrations well below the Km value. The data obtained for the wild-type TEM-1 and the E166N mutant were fitted to Equation 6 by means of the Enzfitter program,kobs=klim/(1+[H+]/K1+K2/[H+])+klim2/(1+K2/[H+])(Eq. 6) Alternatively, fitting of the same data was performed with klim2 = 0. The pH dependence of k3 characterizing the degradation rate of the E166N-[14C]benzylpenicillin adduct was investigated in the same buffers. Temperature-induced unfolding was monitored by recording the intrinsic fluorescence of the TEM-1 E166N as described by Vanhove et al. (29Vanhove M. Raquet X. Frère J.M. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 25: 104-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cuvette containing the sample (1.4 ml) was heated at a rate of 0.9°C/min using a thermostatically regulated circulating water bath. The enzyme unfolded reversibly in a simple co-operative fashion. Unfolding curves were analyzed according to Equation 7 by means of the nonlinear regression data analysis Enzfitter program,Fmes={(N+yT)+(U+zT)exp α}/{1+exp α}(Eq. 7) with a = ΔHm [(T/Tm) − 1]/RT, where Tm is the midpoint at the transition and ΔHm is the enthalpy of unfolding at Tm. The (N + yT) and (U + zT) terms were necessary to account for the linear decreases of the intrinsic fluorescences of the native and denatured states of the protein (N and U, respectively) upon increasing temperature. A mixture containing 0.2 mg of enzyme and 0.02 mg of trypsin was incubated in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 40°C. Aliquots were removed and trypsin was inactivated by addition of 40 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Quantification of the mutant residual activity was performed by titration with [14C]benzylpenicillin. The structures of the β-lactam molecules were optimized by the AM1 semi-empirical method (Dewar et al. (30Dewar M.J.S. Zoebisch E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (15083) Google Scholar)). CNDO charges were adopted for these ligands. The bond lengths, bond angles, and ring dihedral angles of the antibiotics were constrained to the AM1 values. Models of the mutant enzymes were obtained from the x-ray structures of the wild-type proteins (5Fonzé E. Charlier P. To'th Y. Vermeire M. Raquet X. Dubus A. Frère J.M. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1995; 51: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the local conformational space of the mutated amino acid was searched by a minimum perturbation approach (31Shih H.H.-L. Brady J. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1697-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The system was solvated by cubes of standard “Monte Carlo” water molecules and the positions of these molecules after minimization were compared to those in the crystal structures. The geometry of the protein was optimized with the AMBER 4.1 set of programs (32Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.A. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 4.1. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar) using a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The β-lactam molecules were docked in the modeled active sites with the β-lactam amide oxygen atom oriented into the oxyanion-hole formed by the main chain nitrogen atoms of Ser-70 and Ala-237. Hydrogen bonds appeared to be formed between the C7 side chain amide group and the NΔ2 amide nitrogen atom of Asn-132 and the main chain oxygen atom of Ala-237. The energy of the Michaelis complexes thus obtained was minimized using AMBER (32Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.A. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 4.1. University of California, San Francisco1995Google Scholar). About 16 mg of the TEM-1 E166N mutant were obtained per liter of culture. The protein was purified to 95% homogeneity with a yield of 45%. For the S. albus G mutant, the culture and purification yields were 20 mg/liter and 25%, respectively; as stated above, the final preparation was only 50% pure. Attempts to eliminate the low molecular mass contaminant by various chromatographic procedures, including molecular sieve filtration, remained unsuccessful. The values of the rate constants obtained for the TEM-1 E166N mutant are reported in Table I. As expected and in agreement with the observations of Adachi et al. (11Adachi H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3186-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Strynadka et al. (9Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), the rates of deacylation (k3) were exceedingly low.Table I.Acylation rate constants (k2/K′) and deacylation rate constants (k3) of the TEM-1 E166N mutant and wild-type enzymes with various β-lactamsCompoundk2/K′ WTk2/K′ E166NMutant/WTk3 WTk3 E166NM−1 s−1s−1Benzylpenicillin84 × 106450 × 103(C)0.00515005.2 × 10−6Cephalosporin C90 × 1032 × 103(A+C)0.022>360.71 × 10−6Cephaloridine2.24 × 10615 × 103(C)0.007>15000.76 × 10−6Cefoxitin64.5 × 103(A+C)7504 × 10−3—aNot determinated.Moxalactam163.5 × 103(A)219—aNot determinated.—aNot determinated.Temocillin*bNo hydrolysis detected (3).500(C)>150—aNot determinated.—aNot determinated.Cefotaxime1.5 × 1032.5 × 103(A)1.7>90.91 × 10−6Cefuroxime6 × 1036 × 103(C)1>60.63 × 10−6Ceftazidime70400(A)5.7>0.342.1 × 10−6Imipenem2 × 10330 × 103 (C)15>2 × 10−2—aNot determinated.a Not determinated.b No hydrolysis detected (3Moews P.C.

Open table in a new tab Different strategies were utilized to determine the second-order rate constant (k2/K′), characteristic of the acylation rate. Rapid acylation could not be monitored by the usual methods. With [14C]benzylpenicillin, the reaction was so rapid that it could not be followed by manual mixing methods. In consequence, the first experiments were performed with compounds exhibiting lower acylation rates and whose modifications upon acyl-enzyme formation could be directly monitored by spectrophotometric methods. The manual method A allowed the determination of the k2/K′ values for cephalosporin C, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. That Equation 2 applied was confirmed by the fact that similar k2/K′ values were obtained at cefoxitin concentrations ranging from 20 to 40 μM. The stopped-flow method, which required much larger quantities of proteins was only utilized with cefoxitin. Here the antibiotic concentrations were as high as 400 μM. An average k2/K′ value of 2200 ± 440 M−1 s−1 was found, in fair agreement with that obtained in the manual mixing experiments (4500 ± 130 M−1 s−1). The values for the other compounds were obtained by the competition method C. First, competitions between [14C]benzylpenicillin and cephalosporin C or cefoxitin were performed, allowing the computation of the k2/K′ value for the 14C-labeled compound. Subsequently, the values for all the other β-lactams were derived from competition experiments with [14C]benzylpenicillin. For good substrates of the wild-type enzyme (benzylpenicillin and cephaloridine), the E166N mutation resulted in a decrease of the acylation rates by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This was, however, much less drastic than for the k3 value. The most striking results concerned the modification of the substrate profile. In contrast to what occurred with the good substrates, the k2/K′ for the poorest WT substrates (i.e. temocillin, cefoxitin, and moxalactam which bear a methoxy side chain on the α-face of the β-lactam ring) were increased by several orders of magnitude. With the oxyiminocephems, the k2/K′ value was not much affected. In consequence the k2/K′ values of the mutant only spanned 3 (from 400 to 400 × 103) versus 7 orders of magnitude for the wild-type protein. With benzylpenicillin and the S. albus G E166H mutant, similar results were obtained, involving a significant decrease of k2/K′ accompanied by a much more drastic decrease of k3 (Table II).Table IIAcylation (k2/K′) and deacylation rate constants (k3) of the S. albus G β-lactamase E166H mutant and of the wild-type enzyme with benzylpenicillinpHE166H k2/K′WT kcat/KmE166H k3WT k3M1 s−1s−156,0001,950 × 1031.8 × 10−3>3,800710,0003,000 × 1033.9 × 10−4>3,400932,0002,300 × 1034.5 × 10−4>2,800 Open table in a new tab The pH dependence of the acylation rate of the E166N mutant by cefoxitin was studied using method A (see Fig. 1). The pH dependence of the k2/K′ value could be fitted to Equation 6 with pK1 and pK2 values of 6.0 and 8.5, respectively. With the wild-type enzyme pK values of 7.2 and 9 were found. The mutation thus resulted in a shift of the curve to lower pH values, with a more significant effect to the acid limb. The k3 constant was not significantly influenced by the pH value (not shown). The k2/K′ value of the E166H mutant of the S. albus G β-lactamase (Table II) exhibited a new pH dependence which seemed to indicate that the base form of the His-166 side chain was adequately oriented to actively participate in the acylation step. By contrast, the k3 value at pH 5 was higher than at pH 7 or 9. This suggested that the His-166 residue of the mutant enzyme was not involved in the deacylation step as a general base catalyst. The melting temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy (ΔHm) of unfolding obtained by fitting the experimental curves to Equation 7 were: 51.1 ± 0.2°C and 112 ± 7 kcal/mol°C, 43 ± 1.4°C and 87 ± 5 kcal/mol°C for the wild-type and the E166N mutant proteins, respectively. This result highlighted a significant destabilization of the mutant which was corroborated by the proteolysis experiments in which the pseudo-first order rate constants (ki) characterizing trypsin-mediated inactivation were 0.29 min−1 and 0.012 min−1 for the TEM-1 E166N and WT proteins (33Raquet X. Vanhove M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Goussard S. Courvalin P. Frère J.M. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), respectively. The strong hydrogen bonds found between the carboxylic group of Glu-166 and the side chain nitrogen atoms of Lys-73 and Asn-170 of TEM-1 disappeared in the E166N mutant, allowing free rotation of these residues. In the most stable structure obtained by conformational analysis, the Asn-170 acyl group was rotated by 180° around the Cβ-Cγ bond with respect to the orientation found in the WT enzyme. A similar rotation was observed in the structure of the E166A mutant of the B. licheniformis β-lactamase (34Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Escobar W.A. Fink A.L.

https://openalex.org/W1985321947,"The tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB) plays a central role in cellular growth regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of RB results in a consequent loss of its ability to inhibit cell cycle progression. However, how RB phosphorylation might be regulated in apoptotic or postmitotic cells, such as neurons, remains unclear. Here we report that neuronal Cdc2-like kinase (Nclk), composed of Cdk5 and a neuronal Cdk5 activator (p25nck5a), can bind and phosphorylate RB. Since RB has been shown recently to associate with D-type G1 cyclins and viral oncoproteins through a common peptide sequence motif of LXCXE, Nclk binding may be mediated by a related sequence motif (LXCXXE) found in p25nck5a. We demonstrate (i) in vitro binding of bacterially expressed p25nck5a to a GST-RB fusion protein, (ii) coprecipitation of GST-RB and reconstituted Cdk5·p25nck5a, and (iii) phosphorylation of GST-RB by bacterially expressed Cdk5·p25nck5a kinase and by Cdk5·p25nck5a kinase purified from bovine brain. Finally, we show that immunoprecipitation of RB from embryonic mouse brain homogenate results in the coprecipitation of Cdk5 and that Cdk5 kinase activity is maximal during late embryonic development, a period when programmed cell death of developing neurons is greatest. Taken together, these results suggest that Nclk can bind to and phosphorylate RB in vitro and in vivo. We infer that Nclk may play an important role in regulating the activity of RB in the brain, including perhaps in apoptosing neurons. The tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB) plays a central role in cellular growth regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation of RB results in a consequent loss of its ability to inhibit cell cycle progression. However, how RB phosphorylation might be regulated in apoptotic or postmitotic cells, such as neurons, remains unclear.

Both vesicular monoamine transporter 1 and 2 contain several charged residues predicted to reside within transmembrane domains (TMDs), and conservation of these residues in multiple species and in other members of the gene family suggest important roles in transporter structure and function. To determine the role of these residues, we have used site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of Asp-263 in TMD6 with Asn (D263N) had no effect on transport activity. However, replacement of Lys-139 in TMD2 with Ala (K139A), Asp-400 in TMD10 with Asn (D400N), or Asp-427 in TMD11 with Asn (D427N) eliminated transport activity despite normal levels of protein expression. Remarkably, the double mutant K139A/D427N showed substantial transport activity, suggesting that Lys-139 and Asp-427 interact to form an ion pair in the native protein and hence that TMD2 occurs next to TMD11. Nonetheless, the double mutant showed reduced apparent affinity for serotonin and reduced ability of serotonin to inhibit reserpine binding, suggesting that although not required for activity, the ion pair promotes high affinity interaction with the substrate. In addition, a double mutant in which the polarity of the charged residues was reversed (K139D/D427K) showed no active transport. Remarkably, however, this mutant displayed normal reserpine binding that remained coupled to ΔΔμ˜H+, but serotonin failed to inhibit reserpine binding, suggesting that the charge reversal specifically disrupts substrate recognition.

This protein was purified and the amino acid sequence of six proteolytic fragments was found to overlap with that of the factor H-related proteins. In parallel we identified the cDNA encoding a new complement factor H-related protein, termed FHR-4. The sequences of the new apoprotein overlapped with that of the FHR-4 protein. Similar to the previously described factor H-related proteins, FHR-4 contains a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by a stretch of five repetitive elements termed short consensus repeats. Recombinant FHR-4 protein was expressed in the baculovirus system and has an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. In addition a 84-kDa dimeric form of the recombinant FHR-4 was detected. Using an immunoaffinity column with antibodies raised against the recombinant FHR-4, we isolated a 86-kDa protein from human plasma. The different molecular mass of the recombinant FHR-4 and the dimeric FHR-4 in plasma is due to different carbohydrate moieties. The 86-kDa plasma protein and the novel apolipoprotein had identical mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and reacted with antisera raised against the reFHR-4 and the purified apoprotein. In conclusion, we have identified a novel factor H-related protein, FHR-4, in human plasma and demonstrate that this protein is present in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in a dimeric form.

https://openalex.org/W1978921937,"The kinetics of the catalytic cycle and irreversible inactivation of horseradish peroxidase C (HRP-C) reacting with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) have been studied by conventional and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. mCPBA oxidized HRP-C to compound I with a second order-rate constant k1 = 3.6 × 107M−1 s−1 at pH 7.0, 25°C. Excess mCPBA subsequently acted as a one-electron reducing substrate, converting compound I to compound II and compound II to resting, ferric enzyme. In both of these reactions, spectrally distinct, transient forms of the enzyme were observed (λmax = 411 nm, ϵ = 45 mM−1 cm−1 for compound I with mCPBA, and λmax = 408 nm, ϵ = 77 mM−1 cm−1 for compound II with mCPBA). The compound I-mCPBA intermediate (shown by near infrared spectroscopy to be identical to P965) decayed either to compound II in a catalytic cycle (k3 = 6.4 × 10−3 s−1) or, in a competing inactivation reaction, to verdohemoprotein (ki = 3.3 × 10−3 s−1). Thus, a partition ratio of r = 2 is obtained for the inactivation of ferric HRP-C by mCPBA. The intermediate formed from compound II with mCPBA is not part of the inactivation pathway and only decays via the catalytic cycle to give resting, ferric enzyme (k5 = 1.0 × 10−3 s−1).

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 1The abbreviations used are: HRPhorseradish peroxidaseHRP-Chorseradish peroxidase isoenzyme CmCPBAm-chloroperoxybenzoic acidABTS2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). (donor:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) is an extracellular plant enzyme involved in the formation of free radical intermediates for the polymerization and cross-linking of cell wall components, for the oxidation of secondary metabolites essential for certain pathogenic defense reactions, and for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (1Penel C. Gaspar T.H. Greppin H.(eds) Plant Peroxidases: 1980–1990. University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland1992Google Scholar). There are more than 30 isoforms of HRP, which are usually classified, according to isoelectric point, into three major groups: acidic, neutral, and basic (2Shannon L.M. Kay E. Lew J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2166-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slightly basic (cationic) horseradish peroxidase C (HRP-C) is the most studied isoform, since it constitutes approximately 50% of the peroxidase content of horseradish root and is commercially available because of its use in clinical analysis and biotransformations (see Refs. 3Dunford H.B.

HRP-C is a monomeric (Mr of 33,922), glycosylated (18% by mass) enzyme that contains a single high spin ferric protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group and two calcium ions (6Marañón M.J.R.

The catalytic cycle is initiated by a rapid (k1 > 107M−1 s−1) 2e− oxidation of the enzyme by hydrogen peroxide (or other organic peroxides) to give a green enzyme intermediate, compound I, with the heme iron oxidized to the oxyferryl state (Fe(IV)=O) and a π-cation radical on the porphyrin ring. Compound I formation involves at least two reactions; formation of an intermediate enzyme-hydroperoxide complex (10Baeck H.K. Van Wart H.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 718-725Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), followed by heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond. Histidine 42 and arginine 38, located in the distal heme cavity, are key residues that modulate both these reactions (11Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 136-142Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In order to complete a peroxidation cycle, compound I is reduced back to the resting Fe(III) state by two successive single electron transfer reactions from reducing substrate molecules, the first yielding a second enzyme intermediate, compound II. Both of these reactions can yield free radical products that can undergo subsequent chemistry. The rate of the peroxidation cycle usually depends on the nature of the reducing substrate, with the reduction of compound II to resting enzyme being rate-limiting (3Dunford H.B. Stillman J.S. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1976; 19: 187-251Crossref Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In the absence of reducing substrates, excess hydrogen peroxide can react with compound I as an electron donor (reductant) in a catalase-like two-electron process that results in the formation of molecular oxygen or in two single-electron transfers in which compound II, compound III (Fe(II)-O2), and superoxide radical anion (O2) are formed (13Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 88-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nicholls P. Schonbaum G.R. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrbach K. Biochem. J. The Enzymes.

Importantly in the context of this paper, a competing enzyme inactivation takes place that results in the generation of a number of inactive chromophores with the final product being a verdohemoprotein, P670 (16Chance B.

A global reaction scheme that includes all the previously identified partial reactions of the catalytic cycle and the inactivation pathway has been developed using experimentally determined steady-state kinetic parameters for the HRP-C/H2O2 system (20Arnao M.B. Acosta M. Del RÍo J.A. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the catalase-like and compound III generating activities of HRP-C protect against inactivation and that the extent of inactivation is determined by the reactivity of a common intermediate, the complex formed between compound I and a second equivalent of H2O2 (18Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2067-2071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arnao M.B. Acosta M. Del RÍo J.A. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Consequently, with excess H2O2 as the only reducing substrate, the enzyme is completely inactivated after only ∼600 turnovers (20Arnao M.B. Acosta M. Del RÍo J.A. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A simplified form of the reaction scheme has recently been developed to enable a more rapid, comparative analysis of data for isoenzymes from diverse sources (21Hiner A.N.P. Hernández-RuÍz J. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Arnao M.B. Acosta M. Biotech. Bioeng. 1996; 50: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and to determine the effects of selected mutations in recombinant HRP-C (22Hiner A.N.P. Hernández-RuÍz J. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Smith A.T. Arnao M.B. Acosta M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A complementary approach to understanding the inactivation mechanism of HRP-C utilizes the competent, xenobiotic substrate, meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) instead of hydrogen peroxide. Compound I formation results in the release of the parent carboxylic acid instead of water (23Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Scheme I). Importantly, HRP-C in the ferric, compound I, and compound II states has a high affinity for mCPBA possibly because of its structural resemblance to reducing organic substrates such as benzhydroxamic acid (24Davies D.M. Jones P. Mantle D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Job D. Jones P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 86: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 16Chance B.

These affinities permit single turnover experiments, with an excess of enzyme over substrate, using rapid-scan stopped-flow spectrophotometry. These conditions allow a precise determination of the values of the rate constants for the partial reactions shown in Table I in the absence of subsequent reactions that would occur at significant rates with an excess of mCPBA. In addition, the absence of the catalase-like cycle (13Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 88-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Arnao M.B. Hernández-RuÍz J. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7889-7899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) causes the average number of turnovers effected by each molecule of enzyme before inactivation (r) to drop to very low values, typically 2 or 3 (22Hiner A.N.P.

This simplifies the kinetic analysis and aids the identification of intermediates in both the catalytic cycle and on the inactivation pathway, facilitates simulations of the complex absorbance changes, and allows a more rigorous test of our proposed mechanism of inactivation shown in Scheme I than was possible using pseudo-steady-state kinetics. In addition it has allowed us to show unambiguously that the reactivity of the complex formed between compound I and mCPBA is the key intermediate that determines the extent of inactivation. The results with mCPBA validate our earlier conclusions for the reactions of HRP-C with hydrogen peroxide, where it was only possible to use pseudo-steady-state kinetics, and allow us to discuss with greater confidence the physiological implications.Table IThe reaction of mCPBA with native HRP-C, compound I, and compound IISchemeReactionk1IIE + mCPBA → CoIk2 kiIIICoI + mCPBA ⇄ [Col ·; mCPBA] → Eik−2↓k3CoIIk4 k5IVCoII + mCPBA ⇄ [CoII ·; mCPBA] → Ek−4 Open table in a new tab Horseradish peroxidase isoenzyme C was purchased from Biozyme (Type HRP-4B) and used without further purification.

Its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ403 nm = 102 mM−1 cm−1. A specific activity of 1,322 μmol mg−1 min−1 was determined using 0.2 mM H2O2 and 0.5 mM ABTS as the reducing substrate in 50 mM glycine-HCl buffer, pH 4.5 at 25°C. The preparations used for this study had ratios of absorbance at 403/280 nm (RZ value) of 3.2. mCPBA in the solid state (Aldrich) containing m-chlorobenzoic acid as an impurity was recrystallized from light petroleum ether (boiling point 40-60°C)/diethylether (3:1, v/v) as described by Davies et al. (24Davies D.M. Jones P. Mantle D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to give material that was more than 96% pure (NMR analysis and single melting point at 92-94°C). Solutions of mCPBA were made up in 1:1 (v/v) absolute ethanol/water immediately prior to use. The concentration was determined using ϵ232 nm = 8,940 M−1 cm−1 allowing for the percentage purity obtained by NMR (26Arnao M.B. Hernández-RuÍz J. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Acosta M. J. Mol. Catal. A Chem. 1995; 104: 179-191Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Reagent grade H2O2 (30% v/v) was obtained from BDH, and its concentration determined spectrophotometrically using an ϵ240 nm of 43.6 M−1 cm−1 (31Bielski B.H.D. Allen A.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 1048-1050Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). ABTS was supplied by Sigma as a diammonium salt, and solution concentrations were determined using a ϵ340 nm of 36 mM−1 cm−1 (32Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Transient kinetics were monitored with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (model SF-51), Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, United Kingdom. Data were recorded through an RS232 interface with a microcomputer. Stopped-flow rapid-scan spectrophotometry was carried out with the same sample handling unit equipped with an MG-6000 diode array system. Spectrophotometric measurements were made with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-2 UV-visible spectrophotometer controlled by an Olivetti PCS/386SX computer running dedicated software. The temperature was controlled at 25 or 10°C using a Techne C-400 circulating bath with an integral heater-cooler system. Compound I formation was monitored at 395 nm (isosbestic for compounds I and II). Compound II formation from compound I was monitored at 412 nm (isosbestic for compound II and the resting enzyme). Compound I was generated by mixing enzyme with an equimolecular amount of H2O2 in a simple pre-mixing device attached to one of the transport syringe ports on the stopped-flow apparatus and transferred directly to a drive syringe for use within 5 min of preparation. Compound II was made from compound I (prepared as described above) by oxidative titration with ascorbic acid. The disappearance of compound II was monitored at 424 nm (the isosbestic for compound I and the ferric enzyme). The formation of verdohemoprotein was followed at 670 nm. The determination of the reaction rates were carried out under single turnover conditions with [E]0 > [S]0 (33Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 244-247Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state kinetic experiments were performed in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and the data analyzed by fitting the absorbance-time curves to exponential functions using a least-squares minimization procedure. The detection of enzyme intermediates and final products from reactions of ferric enzyme, compound I or compound II were carried out by mixing these species with a stoichiometric amount of mCPBA. Transient and final spectra were deconvoluted using a SPECFIT Global Analysis computer program (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC). All experiments were in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The kinetics of the reaction mechanism described in Scheme I is defined by a set of differential equations, whose numerical integration was carried out using a KSIM computer program provided by Dr. N. Millar. The differential equations are shown in Equations 1–6 below.(Eq. 1) (Eq. 2) (Eq. 3) (Eq. 4) (Eq. 5) (Eq. 6) Experimentally determined values of the equilibrium and rate constants were assigned to the partial reactions defined in Scheme I. The kinetics of the intermediates and products defined in Schemes II, III, and IV (shown in Table I) were simulated using the corresponding differential equations. Formation of verdohemoprotein (P670), with its characteristic absorption maximum at 670 nm, is diagnostic of peroxidase inactivation (19Bagger S. Williams R.J.P. Acta Chem Scand. 1971; 25: 976-982Crossref Google Scholar). The titration data shown in Fig. 1 with both spectrophotometric and enzyme activity monitoring show that at least two equivalents of mCPBA were required for its formation starting from HRP-C in the ferric state (Fig. 1). The loss of enzymatic activity is clearly proportional to the extent of P670 formation. These findings are consistent with the first equivalent mCPBA being used to form compound I and the second to inactivate the enzyme and suggest that compound I is a common intermediate in the catalytic cycle and at the beginning of the inactivation pathway (Scheme III shown in Table I). It can also be calculated from Fig. 1 that 8 mol of mCPBA are needed to completely inactivate 1 mol of enzyme ([substrate]/[enzyme] ratio = 70 μM/8.7 μM = 8.0). These equivalents are distributed between the catalytic cycle and the inactivation pathway (Scheme I). The reaction of HRP-C with a stoichiometric concentration of mCPBA yielded compound I with a UV-visible spectrum that was identical to that described for the reaction of this enzyme with hydrogen peroxide (23Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No differences in the stability of this compound I were observed when compared with the compound I formed with hydrogen peroxide under the same conditions. The kinetics of the reaction of HRP-C with mCPBA to form compound I have been shown by Dunford and Hewson (34Dunford H.B. Hewson W.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to have a viscosity dependence characteristic of a diffusion limited reaction (k1 = 8.2 × 107M−1 s−1 independent of pH in the range 5.0-6.8). Under single turnover conditions ([HRP-C]0 > [mCPBA]0) (Fig. 2), we have determined that k1 = (3.6 ± 0.6) × 107M−1 s−1 at pH 7.0 (Table I). Under these conditions, no inactivation of the enzyme occurred nor was any verdohemoprotein formed. The two competing reactions that the complex formed between compound I and mCPBA undergoes (Scheme III shown in Table I) are proposed to explain the relationship between catalytic cycle and the inactivation pathways. In order to detect this transient intermediate and to determine the kinetics and mechanism of its formation and decay, the reaction of compound I with mCPBA was studied under stoichiometric conditions. Fig. 3A shows the formation of compound I-mCPBA intermediate and its subsequent decay to compound II and P670. The spectrum of the compound I-mCPBA complex was recorded after a 1-s reaction time and showed maxima at 411, 531, 556, and 649 nm and a shoulder at 615 nm (Fig. 3B). The extinction coefficient in the Soret region was calculated to be 45 mM−1 cm−1 using a global analysis with the computer program SPECFIT. A similar spectrum to that assigned to the compound I-mCPBA complex (Fig. 3B) was obtained in the reaction of compound I with m-chlorobenzoic acid, the parent carboxylic acid (not-peroxo form) of mCPBA (Fig. 4). This reaction when followed at 405 nm showed monophasic kinetics with a second-order rate constant of 5.3 × 103M−1 s−1 and a dissociation constant of 0.25 mM. These results indicate that the complex formed between compound I and mCPBA is a real enzyme-substrate complex and could serve as a model for the HRP-C compound I-reducing substrate complex, which cannot be detected with conventional reducing substrates such as guaiacol or ABTS.Fig. 4Spectrum of the reaction of HRP-C compound I (10 μM) with m-chlorobenzoic acid (1 mM) in 10 mM sodium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 25°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzyme species designated P940 and P670 have been observed previously in the reaction of HRP-C with an excess of hydrogen peroxide (19Bagger S. Williams R.J.P. Acta Chem Scand. 1971; 25: 976-982Crossref Google Scholar) and other peroxides (16Chance B. Arch. Biochem. 1949; 21: 416-430PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marklund S. Arch. Biochem.

Another species, P965, has also been observed in the reaction of HRP-C with m-nitroperoxybenzoic acid (18Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2067-2071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors proposed a sequential mechanism in which P965, formed directly from the reaction of compound I with m-nitroperoxybenzoic acid, subsequently reacted irreversibly with a second equivalent of the peroxide to give initially form P940 and then finally P670. In order to clarify the number of enzyme intermediates in the inactivation pathway, we have studied the reaction of compound I with mCPBA in the near infrared region (Fig. 5). We have been restricted to using conventional spectrophotometry with the first observation after manual mixing at ∼15 s since our stopped-flow apparatus has a long wavelength limit of 700 nm. During the course of the reaction, an isosbestic point is maintained at 735 nm. The kinetics of the decrease in absorbance at 965 nm and the increase at 670 nm were identical and were fitted to a single exponential function with kobs = 4 × 10−3 s−1 at 10°C, independent of the concentration of mCPBA (Fig. 5, inset). At the beginning, an increase in absorbance at 965 nm took place as consequence of the compound I-mCPBA complex formation. These data strongly suggest that the compound I-mCPBA complex is P965, which is the only intermediate that is detected when compound I is converted to verdohemoprotein (P670) by reaction with one equivalent of mCPBA. The similarity in the spectra of the complexes formed between compound I and both mCPBA and m-chlorobenzoic acid (Figs. 3B and 4, respectively) points to a chemical nature of P965 related to an unreacted enzyme-substrate intermediate whose formation is reversible, as was previously suggested for the (compound I-m-nitroperoxybenzoic acid) complex (18Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2067-2071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent chemical structural change probably take place later, during the transition P965 → P670. However, not all of the P965 is converted to P670 due to the competing decay reaction that yields compound II (Scheme III shown in Table I). Under single turnover conditions, with the first step equilibrating rapidly (k2[mCPBA] + k−2> k3, ki), the relaxation times are given by Equations 7 and 8.(Eq. 7) (Eq. 8) K2 is the dissociation constant of the complex formed between compound I and mCPBA into compound I (K2 = k−2/k2) and λ2max = (k3+ ki). Equations 7 and 8 show that the faster relaxation time, λ1, corresponds to the formation of the compound I-mCPBA complex and is independent of the slower process. However, the slower relaxation time, λ2, is affected by the fast process (35Bernasconi C.F. Relaxation Kinetics. Academic Press, New York1976: 31-34Google Scholar). Under pseudo-first order conditions, with the concentration of compound I in large excess, the observed first-order rate constant for the formation of compound I-mCPBA at 411 nm exhibited a linear dependence with the concentration of compound I (Fig. 6). These data, together with Equation 7, allow the values of the elementary rate constant (k2 and k−2) and the dissociation constant (K2) to be calculated (Table II). The formation of both compound II and verdohemoprotein were followed at 412 and 670 nm, respectively, under single turnover conditions (Fig. 7). Both species were formed with the same observed first-order rate constant, which was independent of the initial concentration of compound I, although the values of the actual first-order rate constants, k3 and ki, differ by a factor of 2 (see below). This surprising feature of the kinetics is predicted by the analysis given in the Appendix section and was confirmed by a series of simulations with different initial conditions, an example of which is shown in Fig. 7 (inset). The observed first-order rate constant is equal to (k3+ ki) and has a value of 10−2 s−1. Note that this last value is similar to that obtained from Fig. 5B, because the process studied is the same, although at different temperature. The value of K2 = 4.5 × 10−6M is significantly lower than the initial concentration of compound I and therefore λ2 = λ2max.Table II.Kinetic constants which characterized the inactivation of HRP-C by mCPBACatalytic stepPre-steady-stateaThis work.Pseudo-steady-statebRef. 26.E + mCPBA → CoIk1 (M−1s−1) = (3.6 ± 0.6) × 107CoI + mCPBA → [CoI-mCPBA]k2 (M−1s−1) = (1.1 ± 0.1) × 106k−2 (s−1) = (4.9 ± 0.1)K2 (M) = (4.5 ± 0.5) × 10−6K2 (M) = (6.5 ± 0.2) × 10−6[CoI-mCPBA] → CoIIk3 (s−1) = (6.4 ± 0.1) × 10−3k3 (s−1) = (1.0 ± 0.1) × 10−2[CoI-mCPBA] → Ei (P-670)ki (s−1) = (3.3 ± 0.1) × 10−3ki (s−1) = (4.8 ± 0.4) × 10−3CoII + mCPBA → [CoII-mCPBA]k4 (M−1s−1) = (3.5 ± 0.1) × 105k−4 (s−1) = (2.2 ± 0.2) × 10−1K4 (M) = (5.7 ± 0.5) × 10−7[CoII-mCPBA] → Ek5 (s−1) = (1.0 ± 0.1) × 10−3k5 (s−1) = (1.5 ± 0.1) × 10−3Partition ratio (r)k3/ki = (2.0 ±0.1)k3/ki = (1.8 ± 0.1)a This work.b Ref. 26Arnao M.B.

The final concentration P670 was determined directly from the increase in absorbance at 670 nm using a calculated ϵ670 nm = (19.6 ± 2.0) mM−1 cm−1. The final concentration of compound II could not be measured spectrophotometrically since several forms of the enzyme absorb in the Soret region. Instead, it was estimated from the remaining enzymatic activity, using the ABTS oxidation assay. The data in Fig. 8 show that both determinations give a good linear correlation, indicating that the distribution of compound I-mCPBA into compound II (67 ± 3)% and P670 (33 ± 2)% was independent of the initial concentration of the complex. This distribution can be defined as the partition ratio (r = k3/ki = 2.0) and allows the values of k3 and ki to be calculated in good agreement with the values obtained previously under pseudo-steady-state conditions (Table II) (26Arnao M.B. Hernández-RuÍz J. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Acosta M. J. Mol. Catal. A Chem. 1995; 104: 179-191Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, our titration data (Fig. 1) show that 8 mol of mCPBA were necessary to completely inactivate 1 mol of enzyme. According to the calculated partition ratio of 2, the reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme I is consistent with this stoichiometry. Additional consumption of mCPBA in the inactivation pathway would result in a different titration value. In consequence, only one molecule of mCPBA is required to react with compound I for some inactivation to be observed, and this is not consistent with other mechanisms suggesting that two molecules of hydroperoxide from compound I are needed in order to convert the enzyme to inactive P670 state (18Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2067-2071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An inactivation pathway originating with compound II has been proposed previously (19Bagger S. Williams R.J.P. Acta Chem Scand. 1971; 25: 976-982Crossref Google Scholar). In order to further investigate this proposal, we have studied the reaction of compound II with stoichiometric and excess concentrations of mCPBA using conventional diode-array and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Compound II with characteristic absorption maxima at 417, 529, and 556 nm was generated from compound I by the addition of one equivalent of ascorbic acid. When compound II reacted with one equivalent of mCPBA, a transient spectrum of an intermediate (assumed to be the compound II-mCPBA complex) was initially observed. This spectrum subsequently converted to that characteristic of the native ferric state with an isosbestic point maintained at 411 nm (Fig. 9). The failure to detect any P670 product strongly suggests that only compound I and not compound II is involved in the initiation of the inactivation reaction. Under these conditions and with a 10-fold excess of mCPBA, no spectroscopic evidence for transient compound III formation was obtained. Thus the ferric enzyme product is probably formed by single electron transfer from mCPBA to compound II. The kinetics of the reaction of compound II with mCPBA were studied under single turnover conditions with increasing concentrations of compound II at a fixed substoichiometric concentration of mCPBA. The time dependence of the absorbance change at 403 nm showed an initial decrease with a minimum at 25 s that corresponds to the formation of the transient intermediate, compound II-mCPBA. This was followed by an increase in the absorbance due to the formation of native ferric enzyme. Assuming compound II-mCPBA complex formation occurs as a rapid pre-equilibrium prior to electron transfer, (k4[mCPBA] + k−4> k5), the observed first order rate constants for the two reactions, λ′1 and λ′2, are given by Equations 9 and 10 (35Bernasconi C.F. Relaxation Kinetics. Academic Press, New York1976: 31-34Google Scholar).(Eq. 9) (Eq. 10) Fig. 10 shows the linear dependence of λ′1 on the concentration of compound II under pseudo-first-order conditions ([compound II]0> [mCPBA]0). The slope and intercept give the values of k4, k−4, and K4 (Table II). The electron transfer from mCPBA to compound II within the complex was very slow (λ′2 = 1.0 × 10−3 s−1), as shown by the kinetics of the appearance of native ferric enzyme with monitoring at 403 nm (data not shown). Under these conditions, the low value of K4 = 5.7 × 10−7M results in λ′2 being independent of compound II concentration and equal to k5. This value of k5 is in agreement with that obtained under steady-state conditions with ([mCPBA]0> [HRP-C]0) (Table II) (26Arnao M.B. Hernández-RuÍz J. Varón R. GarcÍa-Cánovas F. Acosta M. J. Mol. Catal. A Chem. 1995; 104: 179-191Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The experiments described above have shown conclusively that mCPBA induced inactivation of HRP-C occurs by the mechanism described in Scheme I. The data are not consistent with the mechanism proposed by Marklund (17Marklund S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 154: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) nor with the modified mechanism of Nakajima and Yamazaki (18Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol.

Our kinetic and titration data clearly demonstrate that only two molecules of mCPBA are necessary to form inactive verdohemoprotein from the native ferric state of HRP-C. In addition, other mechanisms that have invoked an inactivation pathway originating at the compound II state (19Bagger S. Williams R.J.P.

Therefore, employing isolated cardiac membranes, the two-hybrid assay, and in vitro association studies with purified EGF receptor and Gsα we have investigated Gsα complex formation with the EGF receptor and elucidated the region in the receptor involved in this interaction. In isolated cardiac membranes, immunoprecipitation of EGF receptor was accompanied by co-immunoprecipitation of Gsα. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, the cytosolic domain of the EGF receptor and the N-terminal 64 amino acids of this region (Met644-Trp707) associated with Gsα. However, interactions of these regions of the EGF receptor with constitutively active Gsα were diminished in the two-hybrid assay. Employing purified proteins, our studies demonstrate that the EGF receptor, directly and stoichiometrically, associates with Gsα (1 mol of Gsα/mol of EGF receptor). This association was not altered in the presence or absence of ATP and therefore, was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of either of the proteins. Peptides corresponding to the juxtamembrane region of the receptor decreased association of the EGF receptor with Gsα.

INTRODUCTIONThe functional mimicry involving unrelated molecules is often encountered. Many times it occurs by design and is used as an effective control during various regulatory mechanisms. However, sometimes the accidental structural resemblances lead to aberrations, which are expressed in terms of clinical manifestations. For example, it has been suggested that the mimicry between microbial or viral peptides and the self-peptides presented inappropriately on a target tissue could initiate an autoimmune attack (1Baum H. Butler P. Davies H. Sternberg M.J.E. Burroughs A.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many enzymatically regulated events are controlled by intervention of proteinaceous inhibitors, which mimic substrate binding. The complementarity between serine proteases and the corresponding substrates is matched by aprotinin, the chymotrypsin inhibitor, and many other such inhibitors (2Laskowski M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 3Grewal N. Talwar G.P. Salunke D.M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, molecular mimicry has implications for rational drug design applications. Considerable efforts have been invested in the development of peptidomimetic drugs using nonpeptidyl surrogates (4Moore G.J. Trends Phramacol.

It is apparent that the structural rules governing molecular mimicry are required to be defined for its successful exploitation.

Peptidyl ligands have been characterized that bind to ConA with affinities comparable with those of the carbohydrate ligand methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (13Oldenberg K.R. Lognathan D. Goldstein I.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We have shown that the peptide and the carbohydrate ligands of ConA are true topological mimics. Cross-reactivity of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against an assortment of designed peptide analogs is used here to delineate the specific residues that may be contributing to the mimicry of carbohydrate structure by the peptide ligand.DISCUSSIONThe complementarity of geometry and charge, expressed in terms of the weak noncovalent forces at the interface, is responsible for mediating molecular recognition. This property is common to diverse molecular interactions, which include enzyme-substrate, protein-nucleic acid, and antigen-antibody. Functional equivalence of the chemically dissimilar molecules sharing common surface topology is, therefore, anticipated. Many such equivalences involving proteinaceous molecules and glycan moieties have been identified. Tendamistat, a regulatory protein inhibitor of α-amylase, binds to the carbohydrate binding site of the enzyme through a tripeptide epitope (20Vertesy L. Oeding B. Bender R. Zepf K. Nesemann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 505-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Hofmann O. Vertesy L. Braunitzer G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that streptococcal group A carbohydrate induces antibodies cross-reacting with cytokeratin peptides, leading to the clinical manifestations of autoimmune responses (22Froude J. Gibofsky A. Buskirk D.R. Khanna A. Zabriskie J.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 145: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The analysis of finer details of the mimicry between peptide and carbohydrate ligands of ConA is relevant for defining structural correlations corresponding to such functionally important protein-carbohydrate mimics.The peptide ligand (12-mer) not only binds to ConA but can also be displaced by methyl α-D-mannopyranoside in a dose-dependent manner. However, this alone is not sufficient to suggest that the two are structurally similar. There are many examples in which an organic molecule can bind to a receptor as strongly as the normal ligand without being structurally similar (23Wainer B.H. Wung W.E. Connors M. Rothberg R.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 498-506PubMed Google Scholar). But the anti-12-mer peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies cross-react with α-D-mannopyranoside, and the anti-α-D-mannopyranoside-specific polyclonal antibodies cross-react with the peptide, suggesting that the peptide and the carbohydrate ligands are topological equivalents. A truly polyclonal antibody population maps the entire surface of the antigen through the distribution of specificities. It essentially represents a topological map of the antigen. Such an antibody population can also provide a measure of similarity of the reciprocally related ligands. As seen in Fig. 3, the antipeptide antibodies distinguish high and low affinity ligands of ConA in a way comparable with the antisugar antibodies. It is known that methyl α-D-mannopyranoside binds to ConA more strongly than methyl α-D-glucopyranoside. The antipeptide pAbs bind to methyl α-D-mannopyranoside four times as efficiently as to methyl α-D-glucopyranoside. This implies that the surface similarity of the peptide ligand is more to the methyl α-D-mannopyranoside than to methyl α-D-glucopyranoside. As expected, both the anti-12-mer peptide and the anti-α-D-mannopyranoside pAbs do not recognize α-lactose, which is structurally very different from α-D-mannopyranoside. Thus, the antibody population not only provides a topological description of a molecular mimic but can also detect the extent of mimicry.The three peptide ligands have varying cross-reactivities to the antisugar pAbs. The 6-mer peptide is apparently a weak ligand of ConA. Within the concentration range used in the ELISA, no binding of this peptide to the antibodies was detected. However, 12- and 15-mer peptides show binding to these antibodies. The structural properties of the peptides, analyzed by CD spectroscopy, are consistent with these observations. All the peptide analogs exhibited characteristic structural features in their CD spectra. Short peptides containing a sequence motif in which proline is sandwiched between two aromatic residues is known to have definitive structure in solution (24Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The feature corresponding to the β-sheet secondary structure with a negative ellipticity at 212 nm is shared by all three peptides. However, a characteristic polyproline type II feature detected in the 12- and 15-mer peptides corresponding to negative ellipticity at 207 nm is absent in the 6-mer peptide. Thus, the 12- and 15-mer peptides are structurally closer to each other compared with the 6-mer peptide.The relative differences in binding of different peptides to antisugar pAbs implies that it is possible to delineate the residues responsible for the topological similarity with the sugar. It had been suggested that the consensus sequence YPY is critical for binding to ConA (13Oldenberg K.R. Lognathan D. Goldstein I.J. Schultz P.G. Gallop M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5393-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Scott J.K. Lognathan D. Easly R.B. Gong X. Goldstein I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the residues away from YPY also appear to participate in binding. The carboxyl-terminal four residues (ASGS) of these peptides significantly contribute to the topological resemblance to the sugar moiety and the ConA binding activity (Fig. 5). A decapeptide designed by incorporating these four residues at the carboxyl terminus of the 6-mer peptide not only shows better binding to antisugar antibodies but has structural similarity with the 12- and 15-mer peptides. In addition, it binds to ConA, unlike the 6-mer peptide. The hydrogen bonds involving hydroxyl groups from the sugar moieties critically contribute to the ConA-carbohydrate interaction (17Derewenda Z. Yariv J. Helliwell J.R. Kalb (Gilboa) A.J. Dodson E.J. Papiz M.Z. Wan T. Campbell J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The serine side chains in the ASGS sequence can also be attractive substitutes as hydrogen bonding donors in place of sugar hydroxyl groups. The point mutation at an amino-terminal residue Phe3→ Trp in the 12-mer peptide (called 12′-mer) improves its binding to antisugar pAbs without significantly affecting its structure. Although the binding affinities of the two analogs, 12-mer and 12′-mer, to ConA appears to be comparable, the mutation seems to have brought about a transition in the nature of binding. The 12-mer analog shows a much sharper increase in the ConA binding compared with that of the 12′-mer analog over the same concentration range of the peptide. ConA is known to exhibit structural and thermodynamic diversity in the mode of interaction with different carbohydrate moieties (25Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Gray R.D. Glew R.H. J. Biol.

The differences in the nature of binding by various peptide analogs may also reflect similar diversity.The carboxyl-terminal extension consisting of ASGS and the amino-terminal region incorporating WYPY are common in all peptide analogs sharing a strong topological relationship with the carbohydrate moiety. The three peptides, 10-, 12′-, and 15- mer, which share these two sequence motifs exhibit similar ConA binding activities. The anticarbohydrate pAb binding of these peptides is comparatively high. Also, the circular dichroism spectra of these peptides show significant resemblance with each other. However, the region sandwiched between these two motifs is highly diverse in terms of length and the nature of the residues in the three peptides. Whereas the 15-mer peptide has five residues sandwiched between WYPY and ASGS, the 12′-mer peptide has two, and the 10-mer peptide has none. The two residues in the 12′-mer peptide are not related to the corresponding sandwiched sequence in the 15-mer peptide. It may, therefore, be inferred that this part of the molecule does not significantly contribute to either structure, carbohydrate mimicry or the ConA binding activity of the peptide.Thus, the analysis involving mutual pAb cross-reactivity of a peptide and a carbohydrate ligand has provided a detailed description of the topological similarity between these two essentially dissimilar molecules. The structural features and the amino acid residues of the peptide ligand, critical for carbohydrate mimicry, were identified. A direct correlation was observed between the extent of carbohydrate mimicry and the ConA binding activities of various peptide analogs. The immunological probe involving pAbs used here in analyzing the topological relationship between peptide and carbohydrate ligands of ConA can also be effective in designing peptidomimetic drugs. INTRODUCTIONThe functional mimicry involving unrelated molecules is often encountered. Many times it occurs by design and is used as an effective control during various regulatory mechanisms. However, sometimes the accidental structural resemblances lead to aberrations, which are expressed in terms of clinical manifestations. For example, it has been suggested that the mimicry between microbial or viral peptides and the self-peptides presented inappropriately on a target tissue could initiate an autoimmune attack (1Baum H. Butler P. Davies H. Sternberg M.J.E. Burroughs A.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 140-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Receptor-regulated forms of PI 3-kinase are thought to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) at the 3-position of the inositol ring to give the putative lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). Cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are currently measured by time-consuming procedures involving radiolabeling with high levels of 32PO4, extraction, and multiple chromatography steps. To avoid these lengthy and hazardous procedures, many laboratories prefer to assay PI 3-kinase activity in cell extracts and/or appropriate immunoprecipitates. Such approaches are not readily applied to measurements of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in extracts of animal tissues. Moreover, they can be misleading since the association of PI 3-kinases in molecular complexes is not necessarily correlated with the enzyme's activity state. Direct measurements of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 would also be desirable since its concentration may be subject to additional control mechanisms such as activation or inhibition of the phosphatases responsible for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 metabolism. We now report a simple, reproducible isotope dilution assay which detects PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at subpicomole sensitivity, suitable for measurements of both basal and stimulated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 obtained from samples containing approximately 1 mg of cellular protein. Total lipid extracts, containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, are first subjected to alkaline hydrolysis which results in the release of the polar head group Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The latter is measured by its ability to displace [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 from a highly specific binding protein present in cerebellar membrane preparations. We show that this assay solely detects PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and does not suffer from interference by other compounds generated after alkaline hydrolysis of total cellular lipids. Measurements on a wide range of cells, including rat-1 fibroblasts, 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, HEK 293 cells, and rat adipocytes, show wortmannin-sensitive increased levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 upon stimulation with appropriate agonists. The enhanced utility of this procedure is further demonstrated by measurements of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in tissue derived from whole animals. Specifically, we show that stimulation with insulin increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in rat skeletal muscle in vivo with a time course which parallels the activation of protein kinase B in the same samples.

On the basis of their biochemical characteristics the larval resistance-associated GSTs are likely to be insect class I GSTs. Aggst1-2, a class I GST gene, which is expressed in larvae, has been cloned from the malaria vector A. gambiae. The gene was inserted into a bacterial expression system, and the detection of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) conjugating activity in Eschericia coli expressing the recombinant enzyme confirmed that aggst1-2 encodes a catalytically active GST. The gene encodes a 209 amino acid protein with 46% sequence similarity to a Drosophila melanogaster class I GST (GST-D1), 44% similarity with a Musca domestica class I GST (MdGST-1), but only low levels of homology with class II insect GSTs, including the adult specific AgGST2-1 from A. gambiae. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicated that A. gambiae has multiple class I GSTs.

They protect the cell from attack by a wide range of reactive electrophilic compounds by conjugating these compounds with the tripeptide, glutathione, thereby increasing their solubility and aiding excretion from the cell. GSTs are also involved in the glutathione-dependent dehydrochlorination of insecticides (7Clark A.G. Shamaan N.A. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 22: 249-261Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). They can also act as binding proteins and may be important in the intracellular transport and excretion of hydrophobic compounds (8Pemble S.E. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In mammals, five cytosolic classes (alpha, mu, pi, sigma, and theta) of GSTs have been distinguished on the basis of amino acid sequence and substrate specificity (6Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev.

The GSTs are differentially regulated with specific enzymes being expressed in different tissues during each developmental stage and in response to various xenobiotics. In insects, GSTs are classified as either class I or class II on the basis of their immunological cross-reactivity and amino acid sequences (11Fournier D. Bride J.M. Poirie M. Berge J.-B.

Elevated levels of GST activity are associated with insecticide resistance in many insects. Extensive past and current use of the organochlorine insecticide DDT in malaria control programs has selected for DDT-resistant mosquito populations throughout the world. In the principal sub-saharan malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, this resistance is mediated by GST-based metabolism of DDT (12Hemingway J. Malcolm C.A. Kissoon K.E. Boddington R.G. Curtis C.F. Hill N. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 24: 68-76Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Partial purification of the GSTs from this species resolved multiple peaks of GST activity with differential abilities to metabolise DDT (13Prapanthadara L. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Bull. Ent. Res. 1995; 85: 267-274Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further characterization of A. gambiae GSTs was complicated by the presence of multiple GST isoenzymes, each with overlapping substrate specificities and physical properties that made purification to homogeneity difficult to achieve. We therefore set out to characterize the genes encoding A. gambiae GSTs in order to determine the genetic changes that have occurred in response to exposure to insecticides. We targeted the A. gambiae class I GSTs since earlier biochemical analysis (14Prapanthadara L. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Pest. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 47: 119-133Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and Northern blots suggested that class I enzymes were more likely candidates for involvement in resistance. Two strains of A. gambiae sensu stricto were used. G3 was colonized from The Gambia in 1975 and has been maintained in the United Kingdom since then without exposure to insecticides. Suakoko 2La, originated from Suakoko in Liberia. This strain was used since it is now being employed internationally as the reference strain for A. gambiae mapping work (15Favia G. Dimopoulos G. Della Torre A. Toure Y.T. Coluzzi M. Louis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from A. gambiae G3 fourth instar larvae as described previously (16Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system IV (Promega). Reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA was achieved with the Promega Riboclone cDNA synthesis system using an oligo(dT) adaptor primer (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(dT)17-3′). Degenerate primers for insect class I GSTs were designed based on the sequence of Musca domestica GST-1 (11Fournier D. Bride J.M. Poirie M. Berge J.-B. Plapp Jr., F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1840-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these were used to amplify a homologous region from A. gambiae cDNA. The 50-μl PCR reaction contained 20 ng of first strand cDNA, 50 ng of each primer (5′-TA(C/T)AAAAGCTT(C/T)GCNGA(C/T)TA(C/T)TA(C/T)TA(C/T)CC-3′ and 5′-TCNGCNACNGTNA(A/G)N(C/G)(A/T)(A/G)TCNCCNGCAGC(A/G)TA(C/T)TC(A/G)TG-3′), 0.5 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and Taq DNA polymerase buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25°C), 0.1% Triton X-100). Thirty-five cycles of amplification were carried out (95°C for 1 min, 56°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min). The 155-bp PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced in both directions. An 18-bp antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GTCCAGGAAGCTGTTCAG-3′) specific to the 155-bp GST fragment was designed and used in a modified 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) procedure (16Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA. The 546-bp product, aggst1-1, was subcloned and sequenced. For each plasmid insert, both strands of DNA were sequenced at least twice. Alignments of the nucleotide sequences were carried out using the LASERGENE package (DNASTAR, Inc.). This package was also used to align multiple insect GSTs using the clustal method. Genomic DNA was isolated from G3 as described previously (16Vaughan A. Rodriguez M. Hemingway J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Separate 10 μg aliquots of G3 genomic DNA were digested to completion with SalI, EcoRV, and HindIII, separated on an 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Life Sciences) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled aggst1-1 probe (specific activity > 1 × 109 dpm/μg) at 60°C overnight in hybridization buffer (6 × SSC (20 × SSC contains 175.3 g of NaCl and 88.2 g of sodium citrate in 1 liter of water adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 1% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim)). A genomic library was made from the Suakoko 2La strain by partially digesting genomic DNA with Sau3A-1 and ligating into BamHI digested arms of Lambda Dash II (Stratagene). The library (150,000 plaque forming units) was screened with 32P-labeled aggst1-1 according to standard procedures (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Three positive recombinant clones were obtained: Ag_B1, Ag_B2 and Ag_B3. Recombinant bacteriophage DNA was obtained as described by Chang and Natori (18Chang P.K. Natori M. J. Biotech. 1994; 36: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The restriction digested DNA was hybridized with aggst1-1 as described above. An open reading frame encoding aggst1-2, a GST which was related to but distinct from aggst1-1, was identified in the recombinant clone Ag_B1. A 22 bp primer [5′ CGTGGCAATGTTGGATTTTTAC 3′] encompassing the predicted initiation codon (underlined) of aggst1-2 was constructed. This was used to amplify a cDNA containing the full length open reading frame of aggst1-2 from A. gambiae G3 in a PCR reaction utilizing the oligo-(dT) adaptor primer described above. The PCR reaction was performed as described above with the following modifications: the Taq DNA polymerase was added after an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min, the annealing temperature was dropped to 50°C and the extension time was decreased to 1 min. In vitro Expression of aggst1-2. Aggst1-2 was expressed in vitro by inserting the cDNA isolated above into the plasmid expression vector, pET 3a (Novagen) which contains the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The coding region of aggst1-2 was reamplified in a PCR reaction using primers which contained the initiation and termination codons of the gene preceded by BamHI sites. The 650 bp PCR product obtained was digested with BamHI, ligated into the BamHI site of pET3a and the resultant plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Colonies containing the appropriate insert in the correct orientation were identified by restriction digestion and grown at 30°C to an O.D. of 0.6. Expression of the recombinant enzyme was induced by the additon of 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the incubation was continued for a further 3 h at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000g, freeze thawed, resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mMβ mercaptoethanol, and disrupted by sonication. After the addition of 10 mM DTT, the cell debris was removed by centrifugaion (30000g 20 min) and the supernatants were assayed. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein reagent (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and GST activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the conjugation of glutathione to the standard GST substrate, 1-chloro-2,4 dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (20Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridizations were conducted on A. gambiae ovarian nurse cell polytene chromosomes as described earlier (21Kumar V. Collins F.H. Insect Mol. Biol. 1994; 3: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Separate hybridizations were conducted using the recombinant bacteriophage clone, Ag_B1, and the 5′-GST cDNA clone, aggst1-1. Alignment of the 155-bp fragment from A. gambiae G3 cDNA, isolated by PCR using degenerate primers for insect class I GSTs, to the sequence of M. domestica GST-1 (11Fournier D. Bride J.M. Poirie M. Berge J.-B. Plapp Jr., F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1840-1845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated this encoded a partial GST cDNA (Fig. 1). An antisense oligonucleotide based on the sequence of the PCR product was used to obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA by RACE techniques. A 546-bp cDNA, aggst1-1, with an open reading frame of 426-bp was obtained (Fig. 2). This partial cDNA encoded a protein whose sequence shared 70-75% homology with other insect class I GSTs, indicating that aggst1-1 is part of a class I GST gene (Table I). A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of aggst1-1 with the sequence of the initial 155-bp PCR fragment (Fig. 1) revealed several differences between the two clones, suggesting that these cDNAs represent different alleles or are the products of different genes.Fig. 2Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the aggst1-1 partial cDNA isolated by PCR from A. gambiae G3 cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IMultiple insect GST amino acid alignment showing two distinct classes of insect GSTsPercent Similarity12345678953.575.473.970.464.114.814.817.61agGST1-145.944.241.538.311.513.413.92agGST1-284.680.769.911.011.514.93GST-D190.368.311.112.514.44MdGST-166.710.111.112.55LUCILGST-111.210.715.36GST-D2154.134.27DmGST-240.68AgGST2-19MAND2GST Open table in a new tab To determine whether multiple class I GST genes occur in the insecticide-susceptible G3 strain of A. gambiae, a Southern blot of EcoRV-, SalI-, and HindIII-digested genomic DNA was probed with a class I cDNA (Fig. 3). Multiple bands were detected with all three restriction enzymes. The size and number of the bands detected suggests that either aggst1-1 is part of a large gene containing one or more introns or that multiple class I GST genes are present. In order to decide between these two interpretations, the genomic organization of class I GST genes from A. gambiae was investigated. To identify the structural gene encoding agGST1-1 and to determine whether this forms part of a contiguous gene family, an A. gambiae 2La genomic library was screened with the cDNA probe. Arrangement of the A. gambiae class I GST genes was studied in the 2La strain rather than G3 since this is the standard reference strain for large scale A. gambiae genome work (15Favia G. Dimopoulos G. Della Torre A. Toure Y.T. Coluzzi M. Louis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Three recombinant bacteriophage clones were isolated, and partial restriction mapping showed that they spanned a contiguous region of > 30 kb of A. gambiae 2La genomic DNA. The clone Ag_B1 was mapped and partially sequenced. A 3-kb SalI fragment contained two partial GST sequences, and a 5-kb ScaI fragment encompassing the SalI fragment was then sequenced. Three open reading frames, which encoded GSTs, were identified within this fragment. The arrangement of these genes is shown in Fig. 4. Aggst1-3 and aggst1-4 are thought to be pseudogenes since, based on homology with other class I GST genes, they are truncated at the 5′-end. Aggst1-2 encodes a full-length GST. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequences of aggst1-2 are shown in Fig. 5. The open reading frame contains no introns and encodes a 209 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 23.5 kDa. Two putative polyadenylation signals were identified.Fig. 5Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the aggst1-2 gene from A. gambiae 2La. An in-frame stop codon (TAA) upstream of the ATG start codon is indicated by an arrow. Two putative polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) are indicated, one overlapping the stop codon and the other starting at position 974. The two amino acid residues shown in bold are conserved throughout insect class I GSTs. The four amino acid residues underscored with an asterisk are thought to be critical in determining the GST fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The isolation, by 3′-RACE PCR techniques, of a full-length open reading frame of aggst1-2 from A. gambiae G3 larval cDNA confirmed that this gene is actively transcribed. To establish whether aggst1-2 encoded a catalytically active GST, the cDNA was expressed in vitro, and the CDNB conjugating activity of crude protein homogenates containing the recombinant protein was compared with similar homogenates containing the non-recombinant pET vector. Growth of the E. coli cultures containing the expression constructs at 37°C resulted in all the recombinant protein being produced in insoluble inclusion bodies. Lowering the incubation temperature to 30°C reduced but did not eliminate this sequestration, making comparisons between separate cultures difficult. Nevertheless, the GST activity of replicate cultures expressing recombinant agGST1-2 was always >15-fold higher than the GST activity of control cultures. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 6. An alignment of the agGST1-2 amino acid sequence with other insect GSTs was used to calculate percentage similarities (Table I). AgGST1-2 has 41-46% similarity indices with class I GSTs from other insect species but less than 14% similarity indices with class II GSTs, indicating that agGST1-2 is a class I insect GST. The four invariant residues that appear to be of critical importance in ensuring the correct folding of all GSTs (Pro-54, Leu-143, Gly-151, and Asp-158) are conserved in agGST1-2 (indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 5). In addition, agGST1-2 possesses a serine residue near the N terminus (Ser-10) and an asparagine (Asn-48) (shown in bold in Fig. 5) near the invariant proline, both of which are characteristics of insect class I GSTs (22Wilce M.C.J. Board P.G. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine the physical location of class I GSTs in A. gambiae, the aggst1-1 cDNA and genomic clones containing aggst1-2 were independently hybridized to adult ovarian nurse cell polytene chromosomes. All the probes hybridized to a single region on chromosome 2R, division 18B (Fig. 7). The GSTs of A. gambiae are primarily of interest because of their role in DDT resistance. Multiple GSTs have been partially purified from this mosquito, and resistance is associated with both qualitative and quantitative changes in a number of different GST enzymes (13Prapanthadara L. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Bull. Ent. Res. 1995; 85: 267-274Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of these enzymes suggested they were likely to be insect class I GSTs. This prediction is supported by the metabolism of DDT by a recombinant Drosophila class I GST (GST D1) (23Tang A.H. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27876-27884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the only expressed GST to date where DDT metabolism has been demonstrated. We have now cloned and sequenced the first class I GST gene, aggst1-2 from A. gambiae. The gene encodes a catalytically active GST as demonstrated by the ability of recombinant agGST1-2 to conjugate glutathione to the general GST substrate, CDNB. The open reading frame of aggst1-2 is uninterrupted by introns, which have also been observed in the Drosophila class I GSTs (24Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9737-9746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aggst1-2 gene is distinct from the aggst2-1 reported earlier (25Reiss R.A. James A.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 25-32Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two genes belong to different GST classes as determined by sequence homology. They also map to different regions of the polytene chromosome. In the ZANDS resistant strain of A. gambiae, although DDT resistance in both adults and larvae is GST based, the same enzymes are not involved in the different life stages (13Prapanthadara L. Hemingway J. Ketterman A.J. Bull. Ent. Res. 1995; 85: 267-274Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The class II GST cDNA, aggst2-1, was isolated from an adult female cDNA library (25Reiss R.A. James A.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 2: 25-32Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Attempts in our laboratory to isolate aggst2-1 cDNA from A. gambiae larvae were unsuccessful and Northern analysis using an AgGST2-1 probe provided by R. Reiss (University of Irvine, CA) detected an AgGST2-1 transcript in adult mosquitoes but not in larvae. This suggests that AgGST2-1 is an adult specific cDNA. In contrast, the agGST1-2 is clearly expressed in larvae as demonstrated by our ability to amplify it by PCR from larval derived cDNA. This stage specific expression of GSTs is not unique to A. gambiae. In D. melanogaster, certain class I GSTs are not expressed in adults but are expressed in earlier developmental stages (24Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9737-9746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In D. melanogaster, a cluster of class I GSTs, the GST D genes, are closely linked within a 60-kb DNA region. This GST family comprises at least eight genes although two of these are likely to be pseudogenes (24Toung Y.-P.S. Hsieh T. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9737-9746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the genes encoding the multiple class I GSTs present in the housefly, Musca domestica, are thought to be arranged sequentially within the genome (26Syvanen M. Zhou Z. Wang J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Southern blots of A. gambiae genomic DNA suggested that multiple class I GST genes are also present in this species. The identification of three overlapping genomic clones spanning an area >30 kb, which were shown by hybridization experiments to contain class I GSTs, indicated that the mosquito genes are also closely linked. In situ hybridization with A. gambiae class I GST cDNAs or genomic clones highlighted a single region on chromosome arm 2R. The failure to detect any other region of complementarity with any of the probes indicated that the class I GST genes in A. gambiae are arranged sequentially along chromosome 2R. As in Drosophila, this region also contains pseudogenes as two 5′ truncated class I GST genes were found upstream of the full-length aggst1-1 gene."

https://openalex.org/W2047162176,"Transient kinetic analysis of microtubule-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by the monomeric kinesin motor domain DKH357 was performed to investigate the kinetic pattern of a monomer. Both ATP and ADP produced dissociation of the complex, microtubule (MT)·E, of microtubules with DKH357 at a maximum rate of ∼45 s−1 as determined by decrease in turbidity. The maximum dissociation rate was independent of the KCl concentration between 25 and 200 mM. At subsaturating levels of nucleotide, ATP was more effective than ADP in dissociating DKH357 from MT·E (1.6 and 0.4 μM−1 s−1 for ATP and ADP, respectively, at 50 mM KCl). Addition of ATP to MT·E results in a burst of product formation with a maximum initial rate of ∼100 s−1 at saturating levels of ATP. This maximum hydrolysis rate of 100 s−1 is similar to the maximum steady state ATPase rate at saturating microtubules of ∼70 s−1, and thus hydrolysis is at least partially rate-limiting. When the MT lattice was highly occupied with bound DKH357, the amplitude of the burst was ∼2 per DKH357 active site (superstoichiometric). The rate constant for the burst transient was ∼45 s−1, which is the same as the rate for dissociation of DKH357 from the microtubule and this suggests that dissociation and termination of the burst phase are coupled. The size of the burst increased with decreasing initial occupancy of the MT lattice with bound DKH357 and approached the value of ∼4 ATP molecules predicted by previous steady state measurements (Jiang, W., Stock, M., Li, X., and Hackney, D.

Dimers of kinesin head domains are capable of generating processive movement along MTs 1The abbreviations used are: MTmicrotubuleACES2-[(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acidAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,β-imido)triphosphate. for extended distances without dissociation (1Howard J.

The detailed mechanism for generation of processivity and how it is coupled to ATP hydrolysis represents a considerable challenge. Analysis of the bimolecular rates for stimulation by MTs of steady state ATPase and ADP release of dimeric kinesin constructs indicates that ≥100 ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per dimer during each cycle of net binding and release of kinesin from a MT (4Hackney D.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This highly repetitive hydrolysis, without net diffusional dissociation of the kinesin dimer from the MT, is consistent with the hydrolysis of one ATP for each of the many steps of 8 nm (5Svoboda K. Schmidt C.F. Schnapp B.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) that occur during processive movement along the MT.

In analogy with the well known kinetic scheme of actomyosin (see Ref. 16Hackney D.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 732-750Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it has been generally assumed that kinesin head domains dissociate from the MT at some stage in their ATPase cycle. Additionally, most models for generation of motility require that kinesin heads dissociate from one site on the MT at some stage in their ATPase cycle and then reattach to a new site further along the MT in the direction of movement. Analysis of the bimolecular rates for stimulation by MTs of steady state ATPase and ADP release, however, indicates that monomers DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 hydrolyze ∼4 ATP molecules during each cycle of net binding and release of kinesin from a MT.2 This is equivalent to saying that the head domain has only a 1 in 4 probability of dissociating from the MT during hydrolysis of each ATP molecule. The value of ∼4 ATP molecules is significantly less than the value of ≥50 ATP molecules per head for dimers, but is still significantly greater than the value of 1 ATP per head per MT binding cycle that would result if the monomer head always dissociated from the MT at least once during each ATPase cycle. We now report transient kinetic results that directly demonstrate that hydrolysis of ATP by the MT·DKH357 complex is not only faster than dissociation of DKH357 from the MT, but also that dissociation does not even occur during most ATPase cycles. This results in a burst of product formation on addition of ATP to the rigor complex of kinesin with MTs that is larger than the concentration of kinesin active sites (superstoichiometric). The magnitude of this burst is ∼2 per kinesin head at DKH357:MT ratios close to 1:1, but increases at low initial occupancy of the MT lattice with heads and is consistent with the burst size of ∼4 per head predicted by the steady state measurements. A preliminary report of these results has been made (17Jiang W. Hackney D.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at 25°C in A25 buffer (25 mM potassium ACES, pH 6.9, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM potassium EGTA, 0.1 mM potassium EDTA, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), supplemented with KCl as indicated. Taxol (3 μM) was included in reactions containing MTs. Tubulin was prepared and polymerized into MTs as described previously (13Huang T-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that unpolymerized tubulin was removed after polymerization by a final centrifugation and gentle resuspension. MT concentrations are reported as the concentration of tubulin heterodimers. The concentration of DKH357 is reported as the concentration of ADP binding sites as determined by equilibration with [α-32P]ATP as described previously (18Hackney D.D. Malik A.-S. Wright K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15943-15948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This level of DKH357 binding sites was 90% of the molar level of total DKH357 determined by Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Pyruvate kinase and apyrase were obtained from Sigma. The MT·E complex of DKH357 with MTs was formed in A25 buffer with 50 mM KCl by incubation of DKH357 with an excess of MTs in the presence of a low level of apyrase to hydrolyze the ADP that is released on binding of DKH357 to MTs. Control experiments indicated that aggregation of MTs was more likely with other buffers and salts and when DKH357 was in excess of MTs. Consequently the complex was always formed in this way and then mixed with solutions of different KCl concentration to give the desired final concentration during the reaction. Stopped flow turbidity measurements were performed with an OLIS stopped flow spectrophotometer at 320 nm and 1.6 cm path length. The MT·E complex was dissociated by mixing with an equal volume of buffer containing MgATP or MgADP. Burst measurements were determined by quenched flow methods in a KinTek apparatus using either [α-32P]ATP or [β-32P]ATP. Typically the MT·E complex was mixed with an equal volume of buffer containing [32P]ATP and then quenched by mixing with 2 N HCl to give a final concentration of 0.67 N HCl. The quenched reaction mixture was immediately neutralized by addition of 12 ml of cold 32 mM Tris containing 0.5 μmol each of carrier Pi, ADP, and ATP. A sample (1 ml) was counted to determine the total counts, and 10 ml was chromatographed on a 1.5-ml column of AG MP-1 (Bio-Rad) generally as described previously (18Hackney D.D. Malik A.-S. Wright K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15943-15948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of [32P]Pi derived from reaction of [β-32P]ATP, the column was washed with water and then Pi was eluted with 10 mM HCl (eight fractions of 2 ml). The 10 mM HCl fractions were counted and the area of the peak of [32P]Pi was determined. For analysis of [α-32P]ADP derived from [α-32P]ATP, the columns were washed with water and 15 ml of 10 mM HCl and then ADP was eluted with 20 mM HCl (eight fractions of 2 ml), and the area of the [α-32P]ADP peak was determined. In each case the extent of hydrolysis was determined from the fraction of the total counts that were recovered as Pi or ADP. [32P]ATP was purchased from DuPont. In order to reduce the blank levels of counts that coelute with Pi and ADP, the [32P]ATP used in reactions was purified on AG MP-1. The [32P]ATP with 0.5 nmol each of carrier Pi, ADP, and ATP was adsorbed to 10 μl of AG MP-1; washed three times by centrifugation with cold 20 mM HCl; eluted with cold 160 mM HCl and immediately neutralized with Tris base. This typically reduced the blank level to < 0.5%. To correct for material in the [32P]ATP that is not hydrolyzable to Pi and ADP, a sample was exhaustively hydrolyzed by kinesin activated by MTs and the recovery as Pi or ADP determined (see Ref. 18Hackney D.D. Malik A.-S. Wright K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15943-15948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for discussion of this problem). Monomer heads bind to MTs with a stoichiometry of one head per tubulin heterodimer in the presence of AMP-PNP (13Huang T-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lockhart A. Crevel I.M.-T.C. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Addition to MTs of head domains with bound ADP results in the release of the ADP (E·ADP - MT ⇆ MT·E - ADP), which is essentially complete at low head concentrations (6Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), but becomes reversible at higher head concentration where the level of released ADP approaches the Kd for ADP rebinding. A low level of apyrase can hydrolyze the released ADP, and this allows the binding of heads to the MT to proceed to completion as indicated in Fig. 1A. In the presence of apyrase, addition of DKH357 to MTs produces a linear increase in the turbidity (A320) up to the equivalence point of one head per tubulin heterodimer. The turbidity continues to increase above the equivalence point, but with a lower slope that likely is related to the weaker nonspecific binding observed in the presence of AMP-PNP (13Huang T-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of apyrase, the initial increase in turbidity at low concentration of DKH357 is similar to that observed with apyrase, but further binding of DKH357 to the MTs is inhibited due to accumulation of free ADP. Control experiments at an initial ADP concentration of 10 μM indicate that the level of apyrase in Fig. 1A results in the hydrolysis of half of the ADP in 60 s. This is sufficient to remove free ADP during the several minutes required to load the drive syringes for stopped or quenched flow experiments, but not so fast as to interfere significantly during the short rapid mixing reactions. The rate of dissociation of the MT·E complex by ATP in 50 mM KCl was determined from the decrease in turbidity as indicated in Fig. 1B. The A320 decrease for dissociation observed in Fig. 1B is consistent with the turbidity increase observed for association in Fig. 1A, indicating that dissociation is essentially complete on this rapid time scale. The observed rate constant for dissociation is 43 s−1 at 400 μM ATP. The influence of the concentration of ATP on the kinetics of dissociation is indicated in Fig. 1C. The maximum dissociation rate, kd(MT)ATP, is 46 s−1 at saturating ATP and the Kd(MT)ATP value is 29 μM for the concentration of ATP required for half-maximum dissociation rate. The kd(MT)ADP and Kd(MT)ADP values for dissociation of MT·E by ADP were also determined and are 52 s−1 and 129 μM. Thus both ATP and ADP have similar maximum rates, but ATP is more effective at low concentration with bimolecular rates for dissociation of the MT·E complex of 1.6 and 0.41 μM−1 s−1 for ATP and ADP, respectively. The kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation were determined over a range of KCl concentrations as indicated in Fig. 1D. The maximum rate at saturating ATP is essentially independent of salt concentration at ∼45 s−1. The Kd(MT)ATP value increases modestly with increasing KCl concentration to 64 μM at 200 mM KCl. The transient kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by MT·E is indicated in Fig. 2. The initial rate increases with ATP concentration with an approximately hyperbolic dependence as indicated in Fig. 3 with a maximum rate of ∼100 s−1 at saturating ATP. This directly demonstrates that the hydrolysis rate is faster than dissociation at 45 s−1, even for monomeric kinesin, and is in stark contrast to actomyosin for which the dissociation of the myosin·ATP complex from F-actin is much faster than hydrolysis (see Ref. 16Hackney D.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 732-750Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At all 4 ATP concentrations there is a rapid burst followed by transition to a slower phase. At the two lower ATP concentrations of 10 and 25 μM in Fig. 2, A and B, detailed modeling was not attempted as the level of free ATP falls significantly during the time course due to conversion to product. At high ATP concentration in Fig. 2, C and D, depletion of free ATP is less significant and they were fit to a model with a rapid initial burst followed by transition to a slower steady state rate. Fitting these curves to a burst model gives burst amplitudes of 1.9 and 1.6 per DKH357 site and burst rates of 40 and 50 s−1, respectively, for C and D. Thus the burst is superstoichiometric with more than one molecule of product being formed per active site. This is incompatible with simple burst models in which the burst is due to stoichiometric or substoichiometric accumulation of product before a rate-limiting release step. The rate constant for completion of the burst phase of 40-50 s−1 at high ATP is the same as the rate constant of ∼45 s−1 for dissociation of DKH357 determined turbidimetrically (Fig. 1C).Fig. 3Dependence of initial rate of ATP hydrolysis in 50 mM KCl during the burst phase on the concentration of ATP. Data were from Fig. 2. The maximum rate of hydrolysis at saturating ATP is 102 s−1, and the ATP concentration for half-maximum saturation is 61 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to better separate the burst and steady state phases, additional experiments were conducted at 200 mM KCl where the steady state rate is reduced, but the maximum rate for dissociation of the head remains constant at ∼45 s−1 (Fig. 1D). The burst amplitude is ∼2.3 per DKH357 (Fig. 4, triangles) in 200 mM KCl at 2.25 μM DKH357 and 3.1 μM MTs, and there is good separation of the burst and steady state phases. For comparison, the kbiATPase and kbiADP values were determined in 200 mM KCl for DKH357 as described previously (4Hackney D.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and are 0.046 and 0.0107 μM−1 s−1, respectively. Thus the kbiratio for the average number of ATPs hydrolyzed is 4.3, and this is similar to the value of 4.0 for kbiratio obtained in 120 mM potassium acetate.2 Increasing the concentration of MTs to 10 μM at the same 2.25 μM concentration of DKH357 increases the burst amplitude to ∼3.3 per DKH357 (Fig. 4, circles). The rate constant for the burst phase is 22 s−1 at 3.1 μM MTs, and this is equal to the dissociation rate constant determined turbidimetrically at this subsaturating ATP level (the kd(MT)ATP and Kd(MT)ATP values in 200 mM KCl from Fig. 1D predict a rate constant of 22 s−1 at 53 μM ATP). As DKH357 only binds one nucleotide tightly, the superstoichiometric ADP that is generated in the burst phase must either be free, bound to a second site, or not really be stoichiometric due to an error in determination of the absolute concentration of DKH357 sites or the burst amplitude. In order to distinguish bound from free ADP, pyruvate kinase and P-enolpyruvate were included during the burst reaction as a trap for free ADP (Fig. 4, diamonds). The amount of pyruvate kinase used in Fig. 4 gave a t1/2 for reaction with free ADP of 1 s in control reactions. This level of pyruvate kinase activity is sufficient to reduce the level of free ADP over a period of seconds, but not sufficient to immediately deplete any free ADP generated during the rapid burst phase. The results of Fig. 4 in the presence of pyruvate kinase indicate an overshoot and subsequent recovery back toward the stoichiometric level that is consistent with initial formation of substantial free ADP during the burst, followed by reduction in the free ADP level by pyruvate kinase at longer times. During steady state hydrolysis, DKH357 will be mainly dissociated from the MT, and only a stoichiometric level of bound ADP is expected (18Hackney D.D. Malik A.-S. Wright K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15943-15948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in the burst amplitude on increasing the MT level (Fig. 4, circles) could be due to the increased absolute concentration of MTs or to the decrease in the DKH357:MT ratio. This distinction is illustrated by the scheme of Fig. 5. In case I, the MT lattice is close to fully occupied with head domains and interaction between heads may influence the rates of hydrolysis and the rate of dissociation of heads in the presence of ATP. This corresponds approximately to the triangles of Fig. 5, A and B. In case II, the increased level of MTs results in a lattice that is only partially occupied, corresponding to the circles of Fig. 5, A and B, in which heads are distributed over an excess of MTs before mixing with ATP. In case III, an initial population of MTs is highly occupied, but an excess of unoccupied MTs is added with the ATP, corresponding to the diamonds of Fig. 5, A and B. The absolute concentration of MTs is the same in cases II and III, but the distribution of heads differs. The results of Fig. 5, A and B, indicate that the burst amplitudes in cases I and III are both similar to each other and considerably smaller than the burst in case II. Thus the fractional occupancy of the MT lattice has an influence on the burst amplitude that is independent of the absolute concentration of MTs. Specifically, the burst amplitude increases with decreasing occupancy of the MT lattice. Steady state measurements indicate that DKH340 hydrolyzes a significantly greater number of ATP molecules during each productive encounter with a MT in 120 mM potassium acetate (26 versus ∼4 for other monomer heads).2 The kbiATPase and kbiADP values were determined for DKH340 in 200 mM KCl and are 1.11 and 0.086 μM−1 s−1, respectively. Thus the kbiratio for the average number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed is 12.8. Transient kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis by MT·DKH340 (Fig. 6) indicates that the burst amplitude is 5.5 per DKH340 even when the MT lattice is largely saturated. This value is significantly higher than that for DKH357, in agreement with the expectation based on the higher kbiratio value of DKH340. With monomeric DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365, MTs stimulate steady state ATP hydrolysis with a bimolecular rate constant that is ∼4-fold greater than that for stimulation of the rate of ADP release from E·ADP.2 The most direct explanation of this difference is that kinesin monomers hydrolyze 4 ATP molecules during each productive encounter with a MT, although more complex kinetic explanations are also possible. This is strikingly different from the case of actomyosin in which dissociation is much more rapid than hydrolysis and the corresponding ratio is 1 (Ref. 21White H.D. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5818-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar and see Ref. 16Hackney D.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 732-750Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The transient kinetic studies presented here now directly demonstrate that hydrolysis is faster than dissociation even for monomeric DKH357 and that multiple ATP molecules are hydrolyzed before kinesin diffusionally separates from a MT. A burst size of ∼2 per site is observed with DKH357 at both 50 and 200 mM KCl (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Inclusion of pyruvate kinase and P-enolpyruvate as a trap for released ADP (Fig. 4) indicates that a significant part of the ADP that is produced during the burst phase is not bound to kinesin. This release of ADP during the burst is consistent with hydrolysis of multiple ATP molecules per kinesin because the ADP that is produced by the first hydrolysis reaction must be released before additional ATP molecules can bind and be hydrolyzed. If the burst were due simply to rate-limiting product release, then the ADP that was produced by the burst would still be bound to kinesin and would not be accessible to pyruvate kinase, as is the case with myosin (22Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus the usual assumption that the burst and the turbidity transient are due to the steps of a single ATPase cycle is not valid for kinesin monomers and this greatly complicates analysis of the individual steps. The observed burst stoichiometry of ∼2 for MT·E complexes in which the MTs are largely saturated with DKH357 is lower than the stoichiometry of ∼4 per site predicted by the steady state measurements, but this disparity is likely due to differences in the DKH357:MT ratio for the two cases. The steady state measurements are performed with the MTs in large excess of DKH357, and most of the lattice of kinesin binding sites on the MT is unoccupied. Because of experimental limitations, the transient kinetic studies must start with a MT lattice with a significant fraction of the sites occupied with kinesin head domains. The MT concentration cannot be further increased without introduction of a large blank absorbance in the turbidity measurements or introduction of a high steady state rate in the burst measurements. Conversely, the DKH357 concentration cannot be reduced greatly without the magnitude of the turbidity change or fractional ATP hydrolysis becoming too close to the blank value in the absence of DKH357. High occupancy of the MT lattice can potentially lead to steric crowding that may accelerate the rate of diffusional separation of DKH357 after addition of ATP, particularly if conformational changes occur that bring a head into closer contact or overlap with heads on neighboring MT sites. Additionally, the rate of ATP hydrolysis may be sensitive to the fractional occupancy of the MT lattice. It is also possible that kinesin head domains transiently dissociate from one MT site and reattach to a new MT site, and thus the occupancy of neighboring sites by other kinesin head domains would prevent rebinding and result in more rapid net diffusional separation. The results of Fig. 4, Fig. 5, A and B, indicate that the stoichiometry of the burst reaction does increase as the occupancy of the MT lattice is reduced, although it is not possible to go to very low DKH357:MT ratios. This increase in burst amplitude at low MT occupancy is consistent with the burst amplitude approaching the value of 4 per site observed by ATPase measurements in the limit of low occupancy of the MT lattice with DKH357. An additional complication that results from the rate constants being sensitive to the occupancy of the MT lattice is that the transients observed here should not be strictly first order, although the deviations from first order behavior would be difficult to detect. At both 50 and 200 mM KCl the rate constant for termination of the burst phase equals the rate constant for dissociation of DKH357 from the MT as determined turbidimetrically. This indicates that diffusional separation of DKH357 from the MT is responsible for termination of the burst phase or the kinetic equivalent in which a conformational change leads to both termination of further ATP hydrolysis and to rapid dissociation from the MT. The analysis of this process is best illustrated by reference to the scheme of Fig. 7. In the absence of MTs, the lower pathway is followed with ADP release via step 4 being rate-limiting (15Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Addition of MTs stimulates the rate of steady state ATP hydrolysis by allowing more rapid ADP release to occur via steps 8 (reverse) and 4 (6Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 15Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) to generate the rigor-like complex MT·E. Addition of ATP to MT·E results in rapid hydrolysis with a rate constant of ∼100 s−1 for k2 at saturating ATP (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) without indication of a lag phase. Subsequent passage through steps 3 and 4 likely occurs at rates comparable with or greater than 100 s−1, as there is no indication of a delay between hydrolysis of the first and subsequent ATP molecules during the burst phase (particularly evident for DKH340 in Fig. 6) and because steady state hydrolysis is almost as fast at ∼70 s−1.2 This suggests that ATP hydrolysis itself is the major rate-determining step. As multiple ATP molecules are hydrolyzed before DKH357 diffusionally separates from the MT, all of the states on the top line of the scheme are more likely to proceed to the right with completion of a cycle of ATP hydrolysis than they are to proceed to the lower line via dissociation of DKH357. Thus k2 must be greater than k6 and similarly for k3 and k7 and for k4 and k8. All that can be said is that, on average, there are two to four sequential passages through steps 1-4 before dissociation occurs. The rigor binding of DKH357 to MTs is strong, and thus little dissociation is expected via step 5, but it is not known whether the bulk of the dissociation occurs via step 6, 7, or 8. Most previous transient studies of kinesin have been performed with dimeric species and do not directly relate to the kinetics of individual kinesin head domains. Dimeric species are known to move processively along a MT (1Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 2Block S.M. Goldstein L.S.B. Schnapp B.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) with hydrolysis of many ATP molecules per encounter (4Hackney D.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and to react with alternating head kinetics (6Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus the observation that initial hydrolysis of ATP by a dimer is faster than dissociation from the MT (9Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) is expected based on the processive nature of dimeric constructs and does not itself indicate whether hydrolysis is faster than dissociation for individual head domains. One factor complicating analysis of transient kinetic studies with dimers is that the tethered head can have different kinetics from that of the attached head. An additional factor is that tightly bound ADP dissociates from the tethered head in a MT·dimer complex in a slow process that is not part of the normal rapid ATPase cycle (6Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This altered state would have time to form during the loading of the drive syringes in transient kinetic studies, but in the work to date, the nature of the MT·dimer at the start of the reaction has not been determined. Moyer et al. (14Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have also investigated the kinetics of two monomeric kinesin constructs. Their transient kinetic analysis of ATP hydrolysis did detect an initial burst of product formation, but the amplitude was substoichiometric and not superstoichiometric as reported here. This is at least in part due to different experimental conditions. In the work by Moyer et al. (14Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the ionic strength and concentration of MTs was such that dissociated heads would rapidly reattach to the MT and continue the MT-stimulated reaction. Thus a larger burst is not observed, because the reaction continues at close to its maximal rate with no sharp transition to a slower steady state phase. In the experiments presented here, initial dissociation of DKH357 terminates its MT-stimulated phase, because conditions were chosen so that rebinding to MTs was slow. The failure of monomer head domains to dissociate from the MT during each cycle represents partial uncoupling of the ATPase reaction from motility, unless monomer heads have some mechanism to slide along the MT without net diffusional separation during each ATPase cycle. In contrast, the individual head domains of dimers likely do efficiently dissociate and move to a new site during each ATPase cycle, because the ATPase of ∼40 s−1 per head equals the dissociation rate of ∼40 s−1 per head needed to produce the observed sliding velocities with steps of 8 nm (see Ref. 6Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar for discussion). One possible mechanism for this interaction in dimers is that the movement of the detached head toward the MT, as it releases ADP, could induce strain in the trailing attached head that accelerates the rate of dissociation of the attached head from the MT.

INTRODUCTIONCytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome aa3; E.C.1.9.3.1) is one of the terminal oxidases in Paracoccus denitrificans (for reviews, see Refs. 1Gennis R.B. Trumpower B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3de Gier J.-W.L. Lübben M.

Subunit I contains three redox active centers, heme a and the binuclear site (heme a3·;CuB). CuA, the entry point for electrons from cytochrome c, is located in subunit II which represents the predominant binding site for this electron donor. The electrons are transferred from CuA to heme a and then to the binuclear site where the oxygen reduction takes place. The function of subunit III is still obscure. All three subunits show strong homologies to the mitochondrially coded subunits of the eukaryotic enzyme.Several years ago, Haltia discovered a small polypeptide copurifying with the oxidase, which was partially sequenced (4Haltia T. Finn. Soc. Sci. Lett. 1992; 136: 1-88Google Scholar, 5Haltia T. Semo N. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9731-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A fourth component was found in the crystalline oxidase as well (6Ostermeier C. Iwata S. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 10: 842-846Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and this small subunit could be characterized from the x-ray structure (7Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) as a polypeptide consisting of a single transmembrane helix and an N terminus protruding into the cytoplasmic space.Here we present the isolation and analysis of the gene coding for this fourth subunit. In addition, the purified 3-subunit enzyme complex resulting from a deletion of the gene is characterized. Furthermore, evidence for a putative promoter sequence is shown.DISCUSSIONThe gene ctaH encoding subunit IV of the P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase was isolated and analyzed. Fifty amino acids were derived from the DNA sequence but the N-terminal methionine does not appear in the mature protein. According to the crystal structure, residues 16-47 form a transmembrane helix (7Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a lysine residue is found within this helical region, with its side chain protruding into the hydrophobic membrane phase. In a sequence comparison, no similarity with other known subunits of bacterial quinol and cytochrome c oxidases was found, nor any significant homology to any other known protein.Deletion of the fourth subunit leads to the isolation of a 3-subunit enzyme complex which is obviously not affected by the loss in its functional properties. The catalytic activity is the same for wild type and the 3-subunit enzyme, indicating that subunit IV has no influence on the electron transfer reactions. In addition, both heme centers are left intact as judged from cyanide and carbon monoxide spectra which reveal no difference to wild type. The isolation of a functional 2-subunit complex from wild type membranes, leaving the two smallest subunits behind (17Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Ludwig B. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), is additional evidence that the two smallest subunits are not directly involved in functions of electron transport or energy transduction. Unlike the deletion of the gene (ctaE) for subunit III (19Haltia T. Finel M. Harms N. Nakari T. Raitio M. Wikström M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1989; 12: 3571-3579Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which leads to a heterogeneous population of oxidase complexes in the membrane in vivo, our data rule out the possibility that the ctaH gene product acts as an assembly factor.These results do not coincide with the general functional assignment and importance of subunits IV in quinol oxidases (20Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but may be explained by obvious structural differences. Although the location of the fourth subunit of the cytochrome oxidase of P. denitrificans and the quinol oxidase of Escherichia coli in a cleft between subunits I and III seems to be basically similar (see below), they clearly differ in length, with only one helix for the cytochrome oxidase but three for the quinol oxidase subunit. Investigation of the role of the fourth subunit of the quinol oxidase of E. coli revealed that the in vitro removal does not affect the catalytic activity (21Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while deletion of the complete cyoD gene or parts of its C terminus result in defects of assembly or of CuB insertion (20Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It could be shown that only the C-terminal two-thirds of this subunit are required for the functional expression of the quinol oxidase. Recently, a projection map obtained from two-dimensional crystalline arrays of cytochrome bo3 was fitted to the Paracoccus structure, showing that subunit IV of cytochrome bo3 basically maintains the same position as subunit IV of cytochrome aa3. 3M. Saraste, personal communication.In contrast to previous assumptions (7Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar), subunit IV is slightly shorter (49 instead of 56 amino acids). The N-terminal half of this subunit makes extensive contacts with residues in subunits I and III, while no protein contacts are seen for the upper half of the transmembrane helix, pointing to the periplasm; in this region a tightly bound phospholipid molecule is in close vicinity to all four subunits and establishes a number of contacts with subunits I, III, and IV. This nicely explains the fact that, upon genetic deletion or in vitro removal of subunit III, subunit IV is lost along with subunit III. An interesting question is whether subunit IV is under the control of its own promoter, or part of a larger transcriptional unit. To test this, promoter probe studies were carried out. Cloning two different fragments into the promoterless vector pRG leads to expression of subunit IV. As both contain at least the first 170 bp upstream of the start codon, this is clear evidence that a promoter must be located within this region.Fig. 5 suggests a promoter sequence about 90 bp upstream of the translational start (see also Fig. 1). This −10/−35 region is compared to 5 promoter regions mapped in P. denitrificans, and is in agreement with corresponding putative sequences of 14 other Paracoccus genes 4H. Witt, unpublished data. as well as with an earlier suggestion (22Steinrücke P. Ludwig B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 104: 83-118Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown that subunit IV in the cytochrome aa3 from P. denitrificans can be excluded to (i) act as an assembly factor, (ii) be required for cofactor insertion, or (iii), being in contact with subunits I and III, should provide some general stabilization of the complex (7Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). While the considerably larger subunit IV of quinol oxidases obviously is strictly required during the assembly process, the single transmembrane helix of this subunit in the P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase may be speculated to be an evolutionary remnant. INTRODUCTIONCytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome aa3; E.C.1.9.3.1) is one of the terminal oxidases in Paracoccus denitrificans (for reviews, see Refs. 1Gennis R.B. Trumpower B.L. Annu. Rev.

Subunit I contains three redox active centers, heme a and the binuclear site (heme a3·;CuB). CuA, the entry point for electrons from cytochrome c, is located in subunit II which represents the predominant binding site for this electron donor. The electrons are transferred from CuA to heme a and then to the binuclear site where the oxygen reduction takes place. The function of subunit III is still obscure. All three subunits show strong homologies to the mitochondrially coded subunits of the eukaryotic enzyme.Several years ago, Haltia discovered a small polypeptide copurifying with the oxidase, which was partially sequenced (4Haltia T. Finn. Soc. Sci. Lett. 1992; 136: 1-88Google Scholar, 5Haltia T. Semo N. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9731-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A fourth component was found in the crystalline oxidase as well (6Ostermeier C. Iwata S. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 10: 842-846Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and this small subunit could be characterized from the x-ray structure (7Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar) as a polypeptide consisting of a single transmembrane helix and an N terminus protruding into the cytoplasmic space.Here we present the isolation and analysis of the gene coding for this fourth subunit. In addition, the purified 3-subunit enzyme complex resulting from a deletion of the gene is characterized. Furthermore, evidence for a putative promoter sequence is shown."

Functional receptors for poliovirus are only expressed by primates; known rodent homologues lack the ability to bind virus due to amino acid differences. Human poliovirus infections are targeted to the gastrointestinal tract and, rarely, to motor neurons in the central nervous system. Available evidence suggests that poliovirus uses only one cellular receptor, implying that the tissue tropism of poliovirus is likely to be related to the expression of the human PVR (hPVR). However, low levels of expression of hPVR-specific mRNAs can be detected in many human tissues other than the apparent target cells. The nonpathogenic function of hPVR is unknown. For a study of the transcriptional control of hPVR expression, we have isolated and characterized the promoter of the hPVR gene. Deletion analysis defined an approximately 280 base pair minimal promoter fragment that: 1) lacks TATA- and CAAT-like elements, 2) is distinguished by a high GC content, and 3) promotes transcription at multiple start sites. The pattern of activity caused by transfection of serial 5′- and 3′-promoter deletions is almost identical in HEp2, HeLa, COS-1, and mouse L929 cells, indicating a similar transcriptional regulation of the hPVR promoter in these cell lines. However, on transfection of Raji cells, a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line harboring a transcriptionally inactive hPVR gene, all promoter reporter constructs tested exerted only residual activity. These results suggest that the cis-element(s) governing cell type-specific hPVR expression resides in the minimal promoter region.

Harber J.J. Bibb J.A. Gromeier M. Lu H.-H. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 101-127Google Scholar). Analyses of cDNAs and of genomic DNA suggested that hPVR-related proteins are expressed in the forms of four splice variants: two membrane-bound (hPVRα and hPVRδ) and two secreted (hPVRβ and hPVRβ) polypeptides (Refs. 1Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3217-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar and 2Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The membrane-bound receptors hPVRα and hPVRδ differ only in the sequences of their cytoplasmic C-terminal domains, and they are highly glycosylated (4Bernhardt G. Bibb J.A. Bradley J. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Bibb J.A. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, receptor hPVRα is phosphorylated on one or more serine residues of its cytoplasmic domain (6Bibb J.A. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the secreted splice variants (hPVRβ and hPVRβ) has been largely inferred only from analyses of their corresponding mRNA species (1Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N.

Humans are the only natural hosts for poliovirus. Monkeys, however, can be experimentally infected, because they express receptors homologous to hPVR. Koike et al. (7Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that, in contrast to hPVR, monkey poliovirus receptors (referred to in the following as mPVRs) of African green monkey cells are encoded by two related genes AGMα1 and AGMα2 (African green monkey receptor). The predicted gene products mPVRα1 and mPVRδ1 (for AGMα1) and mPVRα2 (for AGMα2) are integral membrane glycoproteins that were shown to be functional poliovirus receptors (7Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted splice variants of AGMα1 and AGMα2 have not been detected (7Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A gene (MPH, mouse poliovirus receptor homologue) homologous to the human and monkey poliovirus receptor genes exists also in mouse cells (8Morrison M.E. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2807-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Aoki J. Koike S. Ise I. Sato-Yoshida Y. Nomoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8431-8438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly to hPVRs and mPVRs, the receptor homologues encoded by MPH belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily possessing the putative domain structure V-C-C (reviewed in Ref. 3Wimmer E. Harber J.J. Bibb J.A. Gromeier M. Lu H.-H. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 101-127Google Scholar). The MPH gene product, however, is unable to function as a poliovirus receptor due to differences in its amino acid sequence in comparison with the human and monkey receptors. This is true particularly in the case of the V domain, the structure of hPVR that has been shown to bind the virus (9Aoki J. Koike S. Ise I. Sato-Yoshida Y. Nomoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8431-8438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bernhardt G. Harber J.J. Zibert A. deCrombrugghe M. Wimmer E.

Recently, two new human genes, PRR1 and PRR2 (poliovirus receptor-related genes) have been deduced from cDNA sequences that can be predicted to encode proteins related to hPVR (13Eberle F. Dubreuil P. Mattei M.G. Devilard E. Lopez M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Lopez M. Eberle F. Mattei M.G. Gabert J. Birg F. Bardin F. Maroc C. Dubreuil P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that a gene family encoding PVR-like molecules may exist in humans similar to families of Ig-like CEA (15Holmes K.V. Dveksler G.S. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 403-443Google Scholar) and PSG genes (16Chamberlin M.E. Lei K.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17152-17159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the latter two gene families map to human chromosome 19q, as does the hPVR gene (1Koike S. Horie H. Ise I.

Ropers H.-H. Wilfert C. Roses A.D. Genomics. 1988; 3: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cellular function(s) of hPVR and the hPVR-related proteins in humans, monkeys, and mice is obscure. Early studies have led to the prediction that the observed narrow tissue tropism of poliovirus would mirror the distribution of hPVR expression in human tissues (20Holland J.J. Virology. 1961; 15: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, results of Northern blot analyses have indicated that transcripts related to hPVR sequences can be detected in nearly all human tissues that have been analyzed (1, 2; see discussions in Refs. 21Koike S. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Sring Harbor, NY1994: 463-480Google Scholar and 22Freistadt M. Wimmer E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 445-461Google Scholar). Since human monocytes express hPVR (23Freistadt M. Fleit H.B. Wimmer E. Virology. 1993; 195: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the apparent ubiquity of hPVR transcripts in human tissues may be explained, at least in part, by contaminating blood cells in tissue samples. It is also possible that the probes used to detect hPVR-related transcripts cross-reacted with transcripts of PRR1 and PRR2. In our efforts to characterize cellular function(s) for hPVR and to gain insight into the pathology of poliovirus infection in humans, we have isolated and characterized the promoters of the hPVR and AGM genes. Structural as well as functional analyses indicate that the expression of the hPVR gene is controlled by a TATA and CAAT box-deficient promoter. Our results suggest that cis-acting elements of the hPVR core promoter and trans-acting factors available in cell lines of primate and mouse origin generally support hPVR expression, a result in concurrence with the expression of the hPVR gene in transgenic mice (24Koike S. Taya C. Kurata T. Abe S. Ise I. Yonekawa H. Nomoto A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 25Ren R.B. Costantini F. Gorgacz E.J. Lee J.J. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, the fine tuning of promoter activity of the hPVR gene may differ slightly depending on the cell type investigated. Interestingly, hPVR is not expressed in a variety of hematopoetic cell lines, including the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji. We provide evidence that the hPVR core promoter is inactive in these cells, indicating that this sequence harbors information for the control of basal and cell type-specific expression of the hPVR gene. A chromosome 19-specific genomic library was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 57766; library name LL19NL01). The bacterial strain used was LE392 (ATCC 33572). 2.5 × 106 plaque-forming units were screened with a 32P-labeled Bss HII-SacI fragment (153 bp) isolated from the 5′-NTR of cDNA clone H20A (2Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Positive plaques were picked, and 1500 plaque-forming units each were plated for a second screen, resulting in the identification of single positive plaques. 109 competent L392 bacteria were infected with 107 plaque-forming units of λ-phage. These suspensions (70 ml) were incubated at 3°C until lysis of the bacteria was almost complete. The infection was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform. Bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation, and RNase A and DNase I were added to the supernatant to final concentrations of 50 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Following an incubation at 3°C for 1.5 h the phages were pelleted at 27,000 rpm for 2 h at 4°C using a Sorvall SW 41 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), mixed with 5 μl of 10% SDS and 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, and incubated for 15 min at 65°C. Following a phenol extraction the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The 5.7-kbp BamHI fragment harboring the first exon and the upstream genomic region (see Fig. 2) was cloned into the BamHI site of vector Bluescript KS− (Stratagene), yielding plasmid p5.7/7. To generate subclones this fragment was mapped with respect to the restriction enzymes ApaI, ClaI, HindIII, KpnI, NotI, SalI, XbaI, SmaI, EcoRI, PstI, SpeI, and XhoI. No sites were found for ClaI, HindIII, KpnI, NotI, SalI, and XbaI. The 2.9-kbp SacI fragment (see Fig. 2; one SacI site is located in the vector) was subcloned into Bluescript KS−, yielding pSac2.9/2. Ten μg of plasmid pSac2.9/2 were linearized with HindIII and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 340 μl of water, mixed with 85 μl of 5 × buffer (3 M NaCl, 30 mM CaCl2, 60 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris/HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and prewarmed at 3°C before 15 units of Bal 31 (Biolabs) were added. Each minute 20 μl were removed from the reaction and added to an ice-cold mixture of 24 μl of water, 1 μl of 1 M EGTA, pH 7.0, and 5 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2. After 10 min at 65°C the samples were ethanol-precipitated, and the DNA was digested with BamHI and XbaI. Gel-purified DNA fragments (100 ng) were cloned into a SmaI-BamHI-cut Bluescript KS− vector. Colonies were analyzed according to standard procedures. Sequencing reactions were performed using the Pharmacia Biotech Inc. T7 sequencing kit. Seven ml of lysis buffer (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to 5 × 107 cells, and the viscous solution was homogenized by pipetting. The lysate was loaded onto a cushion of 5.7 M CsCl and spun for 18 h at 36,000 rpm in an SW 41 rotor. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of buffer (10 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% phenol) and precipitated twice with ethanol. Fifty μg of total RNA were dissolved in 50 μl of denaturing buffer (2.2 M formaldehyde, 50% formamide, 10% 10 × electrophoresis buffer (200 mM MOPS, 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.0)), heated to 65°C for 15 min, mixed with 5 μl of 10 × FF (10% Ficoll 400, 0.2% bromphenol blue), electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose gel (containing 2.2 M formaldehyde), and blotted onto nitrocellulose. For hybridization the filter was incubated overnight with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 50 mM PIPES, pH 6.5, 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% Denhardt's solution, 400 μg/ml yeast tRNA) at 42°C before radiolabeled probe was added. Incubation at 42°C was continued for another 24 h. The filter then washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS twice for 20 min. at room temperature followed by two additional washes with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min each. The filter was exposed to an x-ray film using an intensifying screen. For DNA labeling the Life Technologies, Inc. random-primed DNA labeling kit and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) were used according to the instructions of the manufacturers. End labeling of oligodeoxynucleotides was done by incubating 5 pmol of an oligonucleotide in a total volume of 25 μl with 50 μCi of [β-32P]ATP (Amersham) and 3 units of polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) for 15 min at 3°C. The labeled samples were desalted using a Sephadex G25 column (Pharmacia). PCR was done using a Perkin-Elmer or Biometra thermocycler. Conditions for the generation of deletion fragments were: 10 ng of plasmid template, 50 pmol of each primer, 5 μl of 10 × buffer, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 5 μl of formamide, and 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Boehringer Mannheim) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. PCR was started with five cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 3°C, and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. For genomic DNA (100 ng) as template the probe composition was essentially the same, but 2 μl of 10 mM dNTPs and 1 unit of vent polymerase (Biolabs) were used. PCR was done for 35 cycles.

Primer pairs used to generate the promoter and promoter deletion constructs were: 4438 and 4410 (H), 4533 and 4410 (A), 4532 and 4410 (B), 4531 and 4410 (C), 4530 and 4410 (D), 4438 and 4529 (E), 4438 and 4528 (F), 4438 and 4527 (G20), 4438 and 4526 (G17), 4532 and 4529 (BE), 4438 and 4411 (AGMα2), and 4438 and 4413 (AGMα1). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was done according to the protocol described by Frohman (26Frohman M. PCR Methods Applications. 1995; 4Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Partially purified mRNA from HEp2 and JA-1 cells was prepared using a Quickprep mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia). One μg of RNA in 12 μl of water containing 50 fmol of primer (primer 4463 or 1729, see below) was heated to 80°C and then allowed to cool to 40°C. After a 2-h incubation period at 40°C, buffer, dithiothreitol, dNTP, RNAsin, and Superscript reverse transcriptase were added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). The reaction mixture was incubated at 40°C for 90 min. GSP1 was primer 1729. Five cycles with 45 s at 94°C, 3 min at 48°C, and 45 s at 72°C were done, followed by 30 cycles with 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 50°C, and 45 s at 72°C. The annealing temperature was increased by 0.3°C/cycle. GSP2 was primer 4529. Thirty cycles with 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 50°C, and 45 s at 72°C were done. The increment for the annealing temperature was 0.2°C/cycle. RACE products were cut with BglII-HinDIII and cloned into Bluescript KS− and BamHI-HinDIII, and colonies were sequenced with T3 primer. The promoter fragments generated by PCR (see above) were cloned into the NheI-BglII site of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega), and the vector and insert transitions were sequenced. The H reporter construct was cut with SacI, and the insert was replaced by the 2.9-kbp SacI fragment of p5.7/7, thus generating the large promoter/reporter vector (promoter insert of approximately 3000 bp). HeLa R19, HEp2 (a human laryngeal cell line), Hep G2 (a human liver cell line), COS-7, COS-1 (African green monkey kidney cell lines), SK-N-SH (a human neuroblastoma-derived cell line), 293 (a human kidney cell line), RD (a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line), and mouse L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium DMEM with 8% bovine calf serum. L735, CEM (human T leukemia cell lines), HL60 (a human promyelocytic cell line), and Raji (a Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line) cells as well as all other BL cell lines (F126, JBL2, JI, LY66, LY67, LY91, BL40, BL60, BL70, BL72, BL90, and BL99) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum. JA-1 cells (a mouse L cell line harboring the hPVR gene) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% bovine calf serum and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine. HEp2, COS-1, Hep G2, HeLa, and L cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure. 5-20 μg of test plasmid, 2 μg of pSV2CAT (in combination with luciferase vectors only), and 62.5 μl of 2 M CaCl2 in a total volume of 500 μl were combined dropwise with 500 μl of ice-cold 2 × Hank's balanced salt solution. The precipitate was added to the cells. Four hours later the medium was removed, and a solution of 20% glycerol in Hank's balanced salt solution was added. Following a 3-min incubation at 3°C, 10 ml of medium was added, and the supernatant was removed again and replaced by fresh medium with serum. Raji cells were electroporated. 107 cells/transfection were spun, and the cell pellet was resuspended in medium without serum. The cell suspension was combined with 5-20 μg of test plasmid and 2 μg of pSV2CAT. Electroporation was done at 340 V and 1180 microfarads with a Life Technologies electroporator (electrode gap, 0.4 cm). Cells were allowed to sit for 10 min at room temperature and were then transferred with fresh medium and serum into culture flasks. All transfected cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and cell extracts (usually 400 μl) were made using the reporter lysis buffer from Promega. CAT activity was measured with a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim), whereas luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system from Promega. The hPVR gene maps to chromosome 19 (19q13.1-13.2; Refs. 1Koike S. Horie H. Ise I. Okitsu A. Yoshida M. Iizuka N. Takeuchi K. Takegami T. Nomoto A.

They found that the first coding exon hybridized to a 5.7-kbp genomic BamHI fragment. However, neither the start site of transcription nor the promoter of the gene has been characterized. To isolate the putative promoter region, a human chromosome 19-specific genomic library was screened for λ-phages harboring the 5′-region of the hPVR gene (see “Materials and Methods”). The 5′-NTR of cDNA clone H20B maps to the center of the 5.7-kbp BamHI fragment (Fig. 2B, open box; H20B contains the most extended 5′-sequence information). The BamHI-SacI fragment was likely to contain part or all of the promoter of the hPVR gene, for which reason it was subcloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Appropriately, this BamHI-SacI fragment was found to represent the 5′-end of a cosmid insert containing a functional hPVR gene (not shown). This cosmid has been used previously by us to generate the mouse cell line JA-1 expressing functional hPVRα and hPVRδ isotypes (4Bernhardt G. Bibb J.A. Bradley J. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The BamHI-SacI fragment was cloned into a CAT reporter plasmid and found to exert promoter activity. 2S. Schwarz, unpublished results. As discussed in greater detail below, the promoter region lacked TATA- and CAAT-like elements. Northern blot analyses were carried out to determine the level of transcriptional expression and to estimate the size of hPVR mRNAs in various cell lines. As can be seen in Fig. 3, hybridization of RNAs of different human and monkey cell lines (HEp 2, HeLa, RD, SK-N-SH, and COS7) with a probe recognizing all splice variants of the hPVR gene yielded a single band in all cases. A similar signal was obtained with RNAs of the human cell lines HL60 and 293, whereas, interestingly, RNAs of a variety of hematopoetic cell lines (CEM, L735, F126, 549, JI, LY66, LY67, LY91, BL40, BL60, BL64, BL70, BL72, BL90, BL99, and Raji) gave no detectable signals in Northern blots (data not shown). The intensity of the hPVR signal from cells known to be permissive for poliovirus replication suggests rather low levels of hPVR-related mRNA. In contrast to the blots using human and monkey cell line RNAs, experiments carried out using RNA obtained from JA-1 cells yielded a very intense signal, showing some bands below and above the authentic hPVR band. JA-1 cells are mouse cells stably transformed with the hPVR gene (see above); they harbor approximately 100 copies of the hPVR gene per cell. This is most likely the reason for the apparent huge overproduction of hPVR RNA-specific signal. Indeed, on short exposure of the blot, only a single band was seen in JA-1 cells (Fig. 3), migrating to the same position as that from HeLa cells (data not shown). We conclude that hPVR mRNAs are approximately 3.5 kilobases in size. The mRNAs for hPVRα, β, and β share the same 3′-NTR whereas that of hPVRδ is different (Fig. 1B). Analyses with probes specific for the detection of the isoforms hPVRα, β, and β or for hPVRδ revealed differences in the steady state levels of these two classes of mRNAs. Whereas hybridization with the former probe resulted in band intensities identical to those seen in Fig. 3, signals for the 3.5-kilobase-long hPVRδ mRNA were observed only on prolonged exposure of the Northern blots, regardless of the cell lines used (data not shown). However, the ratio of α, β, and β versus δ messages is approximately the same in all cell lines tested, including JA-1. Initial experiments to map the start sites of hPVR mRNA by RNase protection or primer extension yielded inconsistent results in that putative start sites were spread over a relatively large area of the promoter (data not shown). Therefore, we used the 5′-RACE technique to determine the hPVR mRNA 5′-ends (26; see “Materials and Methods”). Sequence analysis of HEp2 RACE clones revealed the presence of multiple start sites for transcription within HEp2 cells (Table I and Fig. 4). Seventeen of 22 events mapped to either of three start sites within a 20-bp region (Fig. 4, closed circles). Minor start sites were suggested by a few clones mapping to the 3′-vicinity of the major start sites (Fig. 4, open circles). We then performed the same analysis using RNA isolated from the JA-1 cell line. It was of interest to us to examine the pattern of transcriptional start sites in JA-1 cells, in which the hPVR gene is transcribed in the mouse cell context, to determine whether it was similar to one we had mapped in HEp2 cells. As listed in Table I, 10 of 25 RACE clones obtained from hPVR mRNA of JA-1 cells revealed starts sites at the same locations as found in HEp2 cells. These data suggest that the 5′-ends of hPVR transcripts isolated from JA-1 cells were slightly more heterogeneous with respect to the start sites mapped in the HEp2 cell line (data not shown).Table ITranscriptional start sites mapped by the RACE method−203 •… CAAC …−187 •… CAGT …−183 •… CACT …HEp25/229/223/22JA-12/253/255/25 Open table in a new tab We had reported earlier the isolation of two cDNA clones (H20A and H20B) with 5′-NTRs longer than those determined by the 5′-RACE method (see Fig. 4 for the location H20B). Therefore, we used RT-PCR to determine whether transcriptional initiation events took place in the region upstream of the major start sites detected by 5′-RACE (see “Materials and Methods”). Primer C (Fig. 4, arrow) yielded a product with mRNAs of HEp2, HeLa, COS-1, and JA-1 cells,"

This indicates that the active site's ability to stabilize and/or retain this intermediate is compromised by the absence of small subunits. Epimerization and isomerization of the substrate resulting from misprotonation of the enediol intermediate were not significantly exacerbated by lack of small subunits. The residual carboxylating activity partitioned product between pyruvate and 3-phosphoglycerate in a ratio similar to that of the holoenzyme, indicating that stablization of the penultimate three-carbon aci-acid intermediate is not perturbed by lack of small subunits.

We have changed codon 83 of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii atpB gene by site-directed mutagenesis to further examine the role of this amino acid in the response of the ATP synthase to tentoxin and in the mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Amino acid β83 was changed from Glu to Asp (βE83D) and to Lys (βE83K), and the highly conserved tetrapeptide βT82-E83-G84-L85 (ΔTEGL) was deleted. Mutant strains were produced by particle gun transformation of atpB deletion mutants cw15ΔatpB and FUD50 with the mutated atpB genes. The transformants containing the βE83D and βE83K mutant genes grew well photoautotrophically. The ΔTEGL transformant did not grow photoautotrophically, and no CF1 subunits were detected by immunostaining of Western blots using CF1 specific antibodies. The rates of ATP synthesis at clamped ΔpH with thylakoids isolated from cw15 and the two mutants, βE83D and βE83K, were similar. However, only the phosphorylation activity of the mutant βE83D was inhibited by tentoxin with 50% inhibition attained at 4 μM. These results confirm that amino acid β83 is critical in determining the response of ATP synthase to tentoxin. The rates of the latent Mg-ATPase activity of the CF1s isolated from cw15, βE83D, and βE83K were similar and could be enhanced by heat, alcohols, and octylglucoside. As in the case of the membrane-bound enzyme, only CF1 from the βE83D mutant was sensitive to tentoxin. A lower alcohol concentration was required for optimal stimulation of the ATPase of the βE83K-CF1 than that of CF1 from the other two strains. Moreover, the optimal activity of the βE83K-CF1 was also lower. These results suggest that introduction of an amino acid with a positively charged side chain in position 83 in the “crown” domain affects the active conformation of the CF1-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W1975107708,"Signal-initiated activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is mediated through proteolysis of its cytoplasmic inhibitory proteins IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta. While most NF-kappaB inducers trigger the degradation of IkappaBalpha, only certain stimuli are able to induce the degradation of IkappaBbeta. The degradation of IkappaBalpha is targeted by its site-specific phosphorylations, although the mechanism underlying the degradation of IkappaBbeta remains elusive. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of phosphatase inhibitors on the proteolysis of IkappaBbeta. We show that the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A induces the hyperphosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IkappaBbeta in both human Jurkat T cells and the murine 70Z-3 preB cells, which is associated with the nuclear expression of active NF-kappaB. The calyculin A-mediated degradation of IkappaBbeta is further enhanced by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), although TNF-alpha alone is unable to induce the degradation of IkappaBbeta. Mutational analyses have revealed that the inducible degradation of IkappaBbeta induced by calyculin A, and TNF-alpha requires two N-terminal serines (serines 19 and 23) that are homologous to the inducible phosphorylation sites present in IkappaBalpha. Furthermore, the C-terminal 51 amino acid residues, which are rich in serines and aspartic acids, are also required for the inducible degradation of IkappaBbeta. These results suggest that the degradation signal of IkappaBbeta may be controlled by the opposing actions of protein kinases and phosphatases and that both the N- and C-terminal sequences of IkappaBbeta are required for the inducible degradation of this NF-kappaB inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2054342062,"Nucleotide sequence analysis of independently isolated clones from a mouse liver cDNA library identified two additional splice variants of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) mRNA with novel sequence at the 5′ end. These variants incorporate two new alternatives (exons A1a and A1b) of exon 1 in the murine FPGS gene which are also spliced to exon 2. Exon A1a encodes most of the 5′-untranslated region. Exon A1b encodes a downstream segment of the 5′-untranslated region, two ATG start codons, and a unique mitochondrial leader peptide as well as 15 additional amino acids of cytosolic FPGS not encoded by all previously identified (Roy, K., Mitsugi, K., and Sirotnak, F. M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem., 271, 23820-23827) splice variants. It was also found by direct sequencing of genomic fragments that although exon A1b is spliced to exon 2, these new alternatives (i.e. exons A1a and A1b) to exon 1 are found approximately 9.5 kilobases upstream from exons B1a, B1b, and B1c. Exons A1a and A1b are separated from each other by a 124-nucleotide intron. Sequencing of the region 5′ to exon A1a revealed a nucleotide sequence that was promoter-like and different from the downstream promoter region in the content of putative cis-acting elements. Primer extension analysis identified a number of potential transcription start sites within the more 3′ end of this region.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9151-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) of human FPGS cDNA now makes it possible to address these issues at the level of gene expression. Other recent studies by Moran and co-workers (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have provided information pertaining to the most 5′ sequence of the human FPGS gene which included the sequence of a putative promoter-like region. Preliminary functional studies reported recently (15Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1996; 37: 384Google Scholar) provided evidence of promoter activity for this region. The earlier (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) studies also suggested alternate transcription start sites as a basis for the regulation of synthesis of both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of human FPGS with the former requiring the inclusion of a NH2-terminal leader peptide encoded by nucleotide sequence at the 5′ end of exon 1. This same group (16Taylor S.M. Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6030-6034PubMed Google Scholar) and Shane and co-workers (17Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y.-J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) provided detailed information on the structural organization of the human FPGS gene in the form of 15 exons spanning approximately 11 kb of DNA sequence. Shane and co-workers (17Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y.-J. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) also provided evidence for the existence of alternate splice variants of exon 1. Recent studies of our own (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) characterized the murine FPGS gene, a promoter-like region with somewhat different characteristics than the human promoter and revealed an interesting complexity with regard to exon 1. This was expressed in the form of three splice variants that differed in their content of sequence homologous to human exon 1. As only some variants incorporated a nucleotide sequence encoding both a mitochondrial leader peptide as well as cytosolic FPGS, the results of these studies raised the possibility that the regulation of synthesis of mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of FPGS could occur as a result of alternate splicing. We now report other results that identify two additional splice variants found in the form of cDNA in a murine liver cDNA library. These variants incorporate distinct alternatives to exons designated as exons 1a, 1b, and 1c of the murine FPGS gene in our previous publication (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and encode a distinctly different 5′ end and proximal open reading frame within the mRNA transcript. Hybridization screening of DNA restriction fragments showed that these new alternatives to exon 1 exist in the genome >10 kb upstream from the previously designated exons 1a, 1b, and 1c, and their transcription along with exons 2-15 also incorporated in these variants, appears to be under the control of a different promoter. We have putatively identified such a promoter in the sequence immediately 5′ of these new alternates to exon 1. We also report on data that show that transcription of these various splice variants that incorporate alternatives to exon 1 occurs in a tissue-specific manner reflecting the alternate usage of different promoters. Full-length cDNA clones were selected by hybridization (19Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirlin S. Shane B. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26918-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) screening of a murine liver cDNA library in λgt11 using an L1210 cell FPGS cDNA (19Roy K. Mitsugi K.

The hybridization screening of the cDNA library was carried out under conditions described earlier (20Hendricks S.M. Cohen D.I. Nielson E.A. Davis M.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The radioactive FPGS cDNA probe was prepared by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim) with [α-32P]dCTP and the L1210 cell FPGS cDNA as a template. Isolation of poly(A)- RNA was prepared as discussed earlier (21Badley J.E. Bishop G.A. St. John T. Frelinger J.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 114-116PubMed Google Scholar) and utilized in the synthesis of cDNA by a standard procedure (22Gubler V. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 269-275Crossref Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). A BALB/c mouse liver genomic library in EMBL3 SP6/T7 (Clontech; Palo Alto, CA) was screened with an exon-specific radioactive murine FPGS cDNA probe that was prepared by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Boehringer Mannheim). The nucleotide sequence of this FPGS cDNA was submitted to GenBank (GenBank/EMBL Accession U59517). After screening of a large number of plaques and purification several positive clones were obtained. The DNA insert from these clones was purified and characterized by restriction mapping and Southern hybridization (23Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar). One of these nonidentical clones designated clone 10 was selected by the above procedure for further analysis because of the large size of its insert (∼18 kb). Restriction fragments of these clones generated with SacI or EcoRI were selected for further study on the basis of hybridization with the region-specific probes. The fragments of interest after extraction were subcloned into Bluescript SK- (Stratagene) for sequencing. Double-stranded DNA was sequenced in both directions according to the dideoxy method of Sanger et al. (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligonucleotide primers based on the mouse FPGS cDNA were used initially. Additional oligonucleotide primers were prepared on the basis of the sequence data generated when necessary for extending the sequencing. Exon/intron junctions were determined by direct sequencing across these junctions using primers based upon the mouse FPGS cDNA sequences. Intron sizes were determined by sequencing through the region in question. Ten pmol of an antisense oligonucleotide primer corresponding to nucleotide sequence in the 3′ end of exon A1b (5′-GGAGGCAGTCTTAGCTTCGTAAG-3′) of the murine FPGS gene was end labeled (Promega, Madison, WI) at the 5′ terminus using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [β-32P]ATP. The labeled primer was hybridized to 5 μg of poly(A)- RNA isolated from mouse liver cells which was first treated with methyl mercuric hydroxide and the primer extension reaction carried out as well with a standard kit as specified (Promega). An mRNA preparation derived from a 1.2-kb kanamycin-resistant plasmid cDNA with an antisense primer was used as a control. Electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel was carried out by a standard protocol (25Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Kanarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a standard procedure, samples of poly(A)- RNA were blotted (26Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar, 27Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engle J. Blan H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) and analyzed by radioautography using exon-specific or nonspecific cDNA probes. The exon A1-specific probe incorporating all of the nucleotide sequence in exons A1a and A1b (see below) was prepared by PCR using variant IV murine liver cDNA as template. The exon B1-specific probe incorporating all of the nucleotide sequence in exons B1a, B1b, and B1c and intron B1c was prepared by PCR using a mouse liver genomic clone as template (clone 3, Ref. 18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A nonspecific probe incorporating the complete nucleotide sequence in exon 14 was prepared by PCR using murine liver cDNA as template (variant IV). The poly(A)- RNA content of each blot was normalized with a mouse 36B4 probe (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO, Ref. 28Krowczynska A.M. Coults M. Maknidey S. Braverman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Labeling of each probe was by random priming (Random Primers DNA Labeling Kit, Boehringer Mannheim) using [α-32P]dCTP and a 10-20-ng insert. The relative amount of cell FPGS mRNA transcript representing different splice variants in L1210 cells and murine liver was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR. Prior to cDNA synthesis (see above), poly(A)- RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I, treated with phenol chloroform and precipitated with ethanol followed by washing two times with 70% ethanol before dissolving in H20. All poly(A)- RNA was treated with methyl mercuric hydroxide to reduce secondary structure. Five μl of the prepared cDNA was utilized in a PCR using four different exon 1-specific sense primers and an exon 5 antisense primer. Ten pmol of an 18-mer oligonucleotide encompassing the ATG start site were used for each PCR. 5′-CCAAGTGATGATGAAAGC-3′ was used as the A1b-specific sense primer, and 5′-TAAGACTATGTCGCTGGGC-3′ was used as the B1a-specific sense primer. 5′-GAGCCGGGCATGGAGTAT-3′ was used as the B1b-specific sense primer, and 5′-ACAAAGATGGCCGTGATA-3′ was used as the B1c-specific sense primer. 5′-TTCAGGCCGTAATTCCGC-3′ was used as the exon 5-specific antisense primer. Initially, reactions were run with different amounts of cDNA and different PCR cycles to obtain conditions that ensured that amplification was in the linear range at the time the amount of product of each primer-specific reaction was compared. As a control, the cDNA reaction mixture without reverse transcriptase was used to initiate a PCR to make sure that there is no genomic contamination (data not shown). As an internal standard, sense (5′-CCTGGTGTCCCTGCCTTC-3′ and antisense (5′-TCCTATGGATGAAACCTC-3′ primers of FPGS representing exons 9 and 14, respectively, were used in a parallel reaction. The experimental reaction was run for 25 cycles using a standard procedure (28Krowczynska A.M. Coults M. Maknidey S. Braverman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6408-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the relative amount of product generated with each set of primers was determined by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). All radioactive isotopes used for the above studies were obtained from DuPont NEN. Specific activities for [α-32P]dCTP, [α-35S]dATP, and [β-32P]ATP were 3,000, 1,000, and 3,000 Ci/mmol, respectively. DNA restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Amplitag DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Nitrocellulose was purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, and oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Genelink. Solutions for polyacrylamide sequencing gels were obtained from National Diagnostics. All other materials were reagent grade. Screening of an L1210 cell cDNA library with a murine FPGS cDNA probe (19Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirlin S. Shane B. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26918-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and DNA sequencing originally identified (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) two different classes of clones exhibiting complexity with regard to exon 1 of the murine FPGS gene. The least common cDNA clone incorporates (Fig. 1A and Ref. 18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) all of the nucleotide sequence (now designated exons B1a and B1b in variant I) homologous to human exon 1 (16Taylor S.M. Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6030-6034PubMed Google Scholar) spliced to exons 2-15 and encodes both a mitochondrial leader peptide and the cytosolic form of FPGS. The most common variant (variant II) incorporates (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) only a portion (exon B1b spliced to exons 2-15) of the nucleotide sequence homologous to the human exon 1 and encodes only the cytosolic form of FPGS. A third variant was identified (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) initially in a liver cDNA library and subsequently in an L1210 cell cDNA library and incorporates an alternate to exon B1a (exon B1c) which is spliced to exon B1b plus exons 2-15. The 5′ nucleotide sequences of these variants aligned with respect to the sequences in exon 2 are given in Fig. 2 where it can be seen that variants I and III incorporate different 5′ ends and a different nucleotide sequence within the proximal segment of the open reading frame.Fig. 2Nucleotide sequence in the 5′ region of various murine FPGS cDNAs. The nucleotide sequences of the 5′ region of variants I, II, III, and IV are aligned with respect to exon 2. The details of the methodology employed are provided under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further screening of the mouse liver cDNA library was carried out using the same cDNA probe. In this library, cDNA representatives of variants I, II, and III were found to be relatively rare (Table TI) compared with their relative frequency in the L1210 cell cDNA library. Instead, the most common variant found (variant IV) incorporates (Fig. 1A and 2) a novel sequence in the form of alternates (exons A1a and A1b) to exons B1a and B1b or B1c and B1b spliced to exons 2-15. These clones were derived from mature transcripts with an appropriate poly(A) tail and properly positioned polyadenylation signal sequence at the 3′ end. The length and sequence of the 5′-untranslated region of variant IV, the position of the two ATG start codons, and the encoded mitochondrial leader peptide (MMKSTRSLPMSWPVREKFW) were distinctly different from those encoded by either exons B1a and B1b or exons B1c and B1b. The nucleotide sequence and the encoded amino acid sequence of all of these splice variants are compared in Fig. 2. These data show that the exons included in these splice variants differ considerably in their composition. Variants I, III, and IV all have in-frame upstream and downstream ATG start codons with properly positioned Kozak (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) consensus sequences. Variant II incorporates only the downstream ATG. In addition to the untranslated region incorporated in exon B1a, exons B1a and B1b in variants I encode different segments of a mitochondrial leader peptide. Along with a shorter untranslated region incorporated in exon B1c, exons B1c and B1b in variant III incorporate different segments of another mitochondrial leader peptide larger in size than that encoded by variant I. By contrast, exon A1a in variant IV only incorporates a untranslated region much longer than that found in variants I and III, whereas exon A1b encodes a different mitochondrial leader peptide in its entirety as well as 15 additional amino acids of cytosolic protein not encoded in variant I, II, or III. The results of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR obtained earlier (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in the current studies (data not shown) using poly(A)- RNA from L1210 cells and mouse liver were consistent with the relative frequency of these variants observed in the L1210 cell and mouse liver cDNA libraries summarized in Table TI.Table IRelative content of splice variants found in L1210 cell and murine liver cDNA librariesVariantL1210 cellsMurine liver%%I5<5II50<5III20<5IV2080V<55 Open table in a new tab During further screening, another splice variant (variant V) was eventually identified (Fig. 1) in the liver cDNA library which was also rare and extremely unusual. This cDNA was larger (2.67 kb in length) than the other variant cDNAs and incorporated not only exons A1a and A1b but also a portion (identified as exon B1d) of the putative promoter region described previously (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) along with exon B1c and B1b and exons 2-15. Using a cDNA probe derived from the novel sequence in exons A1a and A1b, screening of genomic clones (clones 3 and 5) incorporating the nucleotide sequence in the previously published (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) murine FPGS gene showed that these new alternatives to exon 1 were not located within or near the confines of that region of the gene (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the nucleotide sequence was subsequently found by hybridization within another clone (Fig. 1B) bearing an 18-kb insert (clone 10) which was identical to the novel sequence in the 5′ end of variant IV. The 3′ end of this clone overlaps with the 5′ end of clone 3. By restriction mapping and sequencing, the location of these new exons was found (Fig. 1B) to be approximately 9.5 kb upstream from exon B1a. Also, these two exons are separated by an intron 124 nucleotides in length. The exon compositions of all of the splice variants found so far in this mouse liver cDNA library are compared in Fig. 2. The nucleotide sequence at the intron/exon junctions pertaining to all of the alternatives of exon 1 are given in Table TII. These junctions match those for published (25Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Kanarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp R.A. Annu. Rev.

Open table in a new tab Sequencing of DNA 5′ of exon A1a identified a 2-kb region with stretches of the sequence that included a number of putative binding sites for various cis-acting factors known to affect transcription. The characteristics of this region (Fig. 3) are quite different from that of the promoter-like region 5′ of exon B1a (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast to this downstream region, there are no putative SP-1 binding sites. However, in addition to a GATA/TATA box, there are putative sites for 15-20 different transcription factors not found in the downstream promoter-like region, notably MyoD, Myc, Myb, and p53.Fig. 3Nucleotide sequence of the most upstream 5′ region of the murine FPGS gene.

The data suggest (Fig. 4) multiple transcription start sites distributed within this region spanning approximately 200 nucleotides (Fig. 3) upstream from the location of the primer. Start sites were found at -52, -55, -62, and -64 nucleotides. Major start sites were found at -53 and especially at −184. The usage of only the latter would result in the formation of a transcript encoding the putative mitochondrial leader peptide. The results of primer extension analysis pertaining to the downstream promoter-like region using exons B1b- and B1c-specific primers have already been reported (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using antisense probes specific for the A1 and B1 alternates of exon 1, a series of Northern blots was performed with poly(A)- RNA from a variety of normal and neoplastic murine tissues. Poly(A)- RNA from these same tissues was also blotted with a nonspecific probe incorporating the nucleotide sequence from a downstream exon. All of these blots were normalized as well by blotting with a 36B4 cDNA probe. The data in Fig. 5 show that FPGS mRNA transcripts in the range of 2.3 kb could be detected in all of the tissues examined using the exon nonspecific probe. In contrast, the detection of FPGS mRNA transcripts with the A1- and B1-specific probes was highly tissue-specific. With the nonspecific probe there was considerable variability in the relative amount of 2.3-kb FPGS mRNA detected depending upon the tissue. Among normal tissues examined, FPGS mRNA content was highest in kidney and liver and lowest in spleen, lung, and small intestine. Using the same probe, FPGS mRNA was readily detectable in all of the tumors except the hepatoma. This also included the Ehrlich tumor, which had less mRNA in the sample employed than was assumed (see also the blot with the 36B4 probe). With the exon A1-specific probe, relative levels of FPGS mRNA detected among these different tissues were similar to that obtained with the nonspecific probe. However, with the B1-specific probe, the level of FPGS mRNA detected was highest in the tumors with the exception of the mouse hepatoma. The level of mRNA detected by this probe in this tumor was relatively low by comparison and extremely low in kidney and small intestine and virtually undetected in spleen, lung, and liver. The low intensity overall of the blot obtained with this probe most likely reflects the relatively high GC content of this probe compared with the other probes used in this study. In addition to the tumors identified in Fig. 5, poly(A)- RNA from several other murine tumors was also probed with these two cDNA probes with similar results (data not given). These included B16 melanoma, T241 fibrosarcoma, P388 lymphoma, EO771 mammary carcinoma, and taper liver tumor. These studies provide further evidence for substantial heterogeneity at the 5′ end among murine FPGS RNA transcripts. Our earlier (18Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23820-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) studies documented 5′ end heterogeneity in the form of a splice variant (variants I and III) incorporating alternatives of exon B1 (exons B1a and B1c). The current studies extend these findings and document additional heterogeneity in the form of a transcript (variant IV) which incorporates two previously undescribed exons (A1a and A1b) which are located approximately 9.5 kb upstream of the exon B1 alternates. Like variants I and III, variant IV encodes a different mitochondrial leader peptide and unique amino acid sequence at the NH2-terminal end of cytosolic FPGS. Our results also appear to show that the generation of 5′ end heterogeneity during transcription of the murine FPGS gene in part reflects the activity of different promoters regulating transcription of this gene in the mouse. These promoters differ in their nucleotide sequence, the number and putative identity of various cis-acting elements, and the pattern of potential transcription start sites contained therein. Additional studies at a functional level will be necessary to characterize these promoters with regard to the extent that cis-elements, and trans-acting factors may initiate, enhance, or suppress transcription in either case. Of relevance to this question were other findings from Northern blotting using exon A1- and B1-specific probes, which strongly suggest that the activation of these promoters occurs in a tissue-specific manner. Activation of promoter A appears to occur in both normal mouse tissues and tumors and results mainly in the formation of transcripts incorporating exon A1a plus A1b spliced to exons 2-15. In contrast, activation of promoter B appears to occur primarily in tumor tissue resulting mainly in the formation of transcripts incorporating exons B1a plus B1b, exons B1c plus B1b, or only exon B1b spliced to exons 2-15. The relative transcriptional activity of promoter A appears to vary considerably among the various normal tissues examined with activity apparently highest in liver and kidney. In contrast, the relative transcriptional activity associated with promoter B appeared to be less variable among the different tumors examined. 5′ end heterogeneity associated with differential promoter usage has been documented or suggested to occur in the case of a variety of mammalian genes. These include rodent genes for β-glutamyl transferase (30Rajagopalon S. Wan D.-F. Habib G.M. Sepulveda A.R. McLeod M.R. Lebovitz R.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in view of the widespread distribution of FPGS in different tissues (4McGuire J.J. Coward J.K. Blakely R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Wiley Interscience, New York1984: 135-190Google Scholar) and evidence for the regulation of FPGS during development (19Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirlin S. Shane B. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol.

The functional significance, if any, of our finding pertaining to variant V, which incorporates a large portion (exon 1d) of promoter B, is not evident and may, in fact, reflect a splicing anomaly. However, the incorporation of a downstream promoter region within a mature RNA transcript while highly unusual is not without precedence. A similar finding has been reported in the case of a multidrug resistance gene (35Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar)."

https://openalex.org/W2032672848,"Abstract Deaminoneuraminic acid residue-cleaving enzyme (KDNase Sm) is a new sialidase that has been induced and purified from Sphingobacterium multivorum. Catalysis by this new sialidase has been studied by enzyme kinetics and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Vmax/Km values determined for synthetic and natural substrates of KDNase Sm reveal that 4-methylumbelliferyl-KDN (KDNα2MeUmb, Vmax/Km = 0.033 min−1) is the best substrate for this sialidase, presumably because of its good leaving group properties. The transition state analogue, 2,3-didehydro-2,3-dideoxy-D-galacto-D-glycero-nonulosonic acid, is a strong competitive inhibitor of KDNase Sm (Ki = 7.7 μM versus Km = 42 μM for KDNα2MeUmb). 2-Deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid and 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-glycolylneuraminic acid are known to be strong competitive inhibitors for bacterial sialidases such as Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase; however, KDNase Sm activity is not significantly inhibited by these compounds. This observation suggests that the hydroxyl group at C-5 is important for recognition of the inhibitor by the enzyme. Reversible addition of water molecule (or hydroxide ion) to the reactive sialosyl cation, presumably formed at the catalytic site of KDNase Sm, eventually gives rise to two different adducts, the α- and β-anomers of free 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid. 1H NMR spectroscopic studies clearly demonstrate that the thermodynamically less stable α-form is preferentially formed as the first product of the cleavage reaction and that isomerization rapidly follows, leading to an equilibrium mixture of the two isomers, the β-isomer being the major species at equilibrium. Therefore, we propose that KDNase Sm catalysis proceeds via a mechanism common to the known exosialidases, but the recognition of the substituent at C-5 by the enzyme differs."
https://openalex.org/W2078908750,"The adenovirus protease requires activation by an 11-residue peptide, GVQSLKRRRCF, to achieve maximum proteolytic activity. Derived from the C terminus of the viral protein pVI, the activating peptide (pVI-CT) forms a disulfide bond with cysteine 104 of the protease and causes a conformational change that accompanies the development of proteolytic activity. Results presented here show that the interaction of pVI-CT with the protease is dependent not only on the cysteine 10 but also on glycine 1 and valine 2. Removal of these residues, acetylation of the N-terminal glycine, or mutation of the valine to alanine or threonine significantly reduces or abolishes activation. Peptides lacking Gly-1 and Val-2 still form a disulfide bond with the protease but do not cause a conformational change in the protease also they are not effective inhibitors of activation as the interaction is readily reversed by full-length pVI-CT. These results suggest that pVI-CT causes activation by binding to two distinct regions of the protease and in doing so stabilizes the catalytic site.

The reversible nature of the activation, suggested by the results presented here, may well reflect an in vivo regulatory mechanism. The protease coded by adenovirus plays an essential role in the replication cycle of the virus (1Weber J. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 462-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has distinctive properties that make it of intrinsic scientific interest and an attractive target for antiviral therapy. It is known to cleave several capsid proteins (2Anderson C.W. Baum P.R. Gesteland R.F. J. Virol. 1973; 12: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that it has a role in virion maturation; it cleaves the preterminal protein (pTP), the protein primer for DNA replication, thereby altering the affinity of that protein for the viral polymerase (3Webster A. Leith I.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7292-7300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported to cleave the cellular protein cytokeratin 18 (4Chen P.H. Ornelles D.A. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raising the intriguing possibility that it has a role in the escape of the mature virus from the cell. Its properties are distinctive in several ways. It has an unusual substrate specificity (5Webster A. Russell S. Talbot P. Russell W.C. Kemp G.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Anderson C.W. Virology. 1990; 177: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that depends primarily on recognizing a hydrophobic residue (M, L, or I) in the P4 position (7Berger A. Shechter I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1970; 257: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and accepting only a glycine in P2. Although it appears to be a cysteine protease (8Webster A. Russell W.C. Kemp G.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the catalytic histidine and cysteine (His-54 and Cys-122) are in the reverse order of that found in the archetypal cysteine protease, papain (Cys-25 and His-159), which has led to them being classified in separate families within the category of cysteine protease (9Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most interesting facet of its mode of action, however, is that in contrast to most other proteases it does not require proteolytic activation (10Webster A. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The development of significant proteolytic activity depends on the participation of an 11-residue peptide (GVQSLKRRRCF), which is derived from the C terminus of the viral capsid protein pVI (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There have also been reports that viral DNA is involved in the catalytic mechanism (12Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Mangel W.F. Toledo D.L. Brown M.T. Martin J.H. McGrath W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 536-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but other reports (3Webster A. Leith I.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7292-7300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that DNA is not necessary for catalysis but may help to stabilize the protease in vitro and could enhance the interaction of protease and substrates in vivo. Previous studies (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that the cysteine residue of the activating peptide (pVI-CT) is essential and that the activation may be caused by the disulfide-bonded dimer of pVI-CT in a mechanism that involves disulfide interchange. However, the truncated peptide KRRRCF did not activate the protease indicating a role for the N-terminal half of the molecule. Jones et al. (14Jones S.J. Iqbal M. Grierson A.W. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have provided some insight into the mechanism by which pVI-CT operates by showing that it causes a conformational change in the protease through its interaction with one of the two conserved cysteines in the protease, Cys-104, leaving the other conserved cysteine, Cys-122, as the active site nucleophile. The crystal structure of the protease in combination with pVI-CT has recently been solved (15Ding J.Z. McGrath W.J. Sweet R.M. Mangel W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and this shows that pVI-CT is covalently bound forming an additional strand to a β-sheet structure within the protease stabilized by a disulfide bond with Cys-104. In this paper we provide more information on the structural parameters of pVI-CT that are important to the activation process and suggest a mechanism by which pVI-CT is able to induce the conformational change necessary for the development of catalytic activity by the protease. Peptides were synthesized as described previously (8Webster A. Russell W.C. Kemp G.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and purified by reversed phase chromatography on a C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted by increasing concentrations of acetonitrile. The peptide masses were verified by mass spectrometry, and the sequences were confirmed using an Applied Biosystems Procise Protein Sequencer. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was carried out essentially as described (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). The protease was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (6Anderson C.W. Virology. 1990; 177: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Grierson A.W. Nicholson R. Talbot P. Webster A. Kemp G. J. Gen Virol. 1994; 75: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using absorbance at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 0.28 for a 0.1 mg/ml solution (concentration verified by amino acid analysis) or by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained bands following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using known concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) as standard. Both methods gave identical results. Protease assays were carried out essentially as described previously (17Grierson A.W. Nicholson R. Talbot P. Webster A. Kemp G. J. Gen Virol. 1994; 75: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 10 μl of purified recombinant protease (20 pmol) were incubated with 10 μl (7.4 nmol) of GVQSLKRRRCF (or variant thereof) and 25 μl of 50 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0, for 10 min at 3°C. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl (120 nmol) of LSGAGFSW, and the initial rate was followed by removing 5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture into 5 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction, diluting to 50 μl with water, and quantitating the formation of the specific digestion products LSGA and GFSW by capillary electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad BioFocus 3000 with a 17 cm × 25 μm coated capillary tube. The activity of the protease in this assay was typically 9.1 nmol of GFSW min−1 nmol−1 protease. In some assays the peptide Ac-LRGAGRSR, which was cleaved by the protease at the A-G bond, was used in an otherwise identical manner. Mass spectrometry was carried out at the University of Aberdeen using a Vestec Lasertec benchtop laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometer. Samples (typically 1 mg/ml for peptides and 50-200 μg/ml for protease) were diluted 1:10 with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5 μl was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (1% (w/v) sinapinic acid in 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Spectra were an average of 64 scans. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25°C using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm as described previously (14Jones S.J. Iqbal M. Grierson A.W. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Use was made of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis package (18Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the mechanism by which pVI-CT operates, a series of peptides progressively shortened by one amino acid from the N terminus were synthesized and tested for their ability to activate the adenovirus protease. Fig. 1 shows that when compared to the activity achieved with the full-length peptide GVQSLKRRRCF, removal of the N-terminal glycine caused a significant reduction in substrate cleavage while removal of the valine as well essentially abolished proteolytic activity. As would be expected, a peptide lacking the first 4 residues was also inactive (results not shown) while previous work (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the peptide KRRRCF was also inactive. Further evidence for the importance of the N-terminal region of the peptide came from experiments where the N terminus was acetylated resulting in a reduction in the initial reaction rate to 46% of that achieved with the non-acetylated pVI-CT (Table I) and from peptides where the branched chain hydrophobic residue, valine, was replaced by a smaller hydrophobic residue (alanine) or by a branched chain but more hydrophilic residue (threonine). Both these mutations resulted in a similar reduction in activity.Table IGlycine 1 and valine 2 are important to the activation of the adenovirus proteasePeptideRelative activity%GVQSLKRRRCF100Ac-GVQSLKRRRCF46 ± 10GAQSLKRRRCF46 ± 9GTQSLKRRRCF39 ± 11 Open table in a new tab Previous work (11Webster A.

Virol. 1996; 77: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that activation of the protease is dependent on the cysteine residue in pVI-CT (Cys-10) and a cysteine residue in the protease (Cys-104) suggesting that the mechanism may involve the formation of a covalent complex between the two, and indeed this has been shown in the recently published structure of the complex (15Ding J.Z. McGrath W.J. Sweet R.M. Mangel W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The peptides GVQSLKRRRCF, VQSLKRRRCF, QSLKRRRCF, and SLKRRRCF were incubated at a protease to peptide ratio of 1:100 and subjected to mass analysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the matrix-assisted laser desorption technique (MALDITOF). The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that these four peptides form a 1:1 complex with the protease, while there was no evidence of such a complex with either the peptide GVQSLKRRRSF or a peptide corresponding to the first 5 residues (GVQSL). The observation that higher molecular weight complexes were only observed when the peptide added contained a cysteine residue provides evidence that these complexes are due to the formation of disulfide-bonded heterodimers. This is given further credence by the observation that no such complex was observed between the authentic activating peptide (GVQSLKRRRCF) and the protease mutant C104A (data not shown) and is in agreement with the interpretation of the crystal structure (15Ding J.Z. McGrath W.J. Sweet R.M. Mangel W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the experiments with the relatively inactive QSLKRRRCF and SLKRRRCF there is evidence of uncomplexed protease, even in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of peptide (Fig. 2), suggesting that these peptides bind less efficiently, again indicating a significant role for the N-terminal regions of the activating peptide. We have previously shown (14Jones S.J. Iqbal M. Grierson A.W. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that interaction of pVI-CT with the protease causes a change in the tryptophan fluorescence of the protease indicating a conformational change. Moreover, this conformational change mirrored the increase in proteolytic activity as the activating peptide was titered in, both fluorescence and proteolytic activity reaching a maximum at around a 100-fold molar excess of peptide, suggesting that this conformational change was a prerequisite for the development of activity. The importance of the N-terminal region of pVI-CT was further emphasized by an investigation into the ability of the pVI-CT variants, truncated at the N terminus, to influence the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protease. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that GVQSLKRRRCF and VQSLKRRRCF both cause an increase in the tryptophan fluorescence and a red shift in the wavelength of maximum emission. On the other hand, the peptides QSLKRRRCF and SLKRRRCF, neither of which were effective in causing activation of the protease, had little or no effect on the tryptophan fluorescence. Studies with the protease-deficient mutant Ad2ts1 (1Weber J. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 462-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that proteolysis is essential to the development of activity by the virus, and as a consequence there has been interest in the development of protease inhibitors as possible antiviral agents (19Cornish J. Murray H.A. Kemp G.D. Gani D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 25-30Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Inhibition of activation would achieve the same purpose, and it might be expected that the peptides that fail to activate the protease but still bind might be effective as inhibitors of activation. In order to test this, protease was incubated for 15 min at 3°C with a 100-fold molar excess of the activating peptide variant, at which point an equivalent molar excess of activating peptide was added and the incubation continued for 15 min. The reaction was then started by the addition of substrate, and the initial rate was measured. The results are shown in Table II.Table IITruncated versions of pVI-CT are poor inhibitors of activationPeptideActivity%GVQSLKRRRCF100QSLKRRRCF72 ± 11SLKRRRCF104 ± 16LKRRRCF100 ± 6KRRRCF108 ± 6GVQSL109 ± 6GV96 ± 4 Open table in a new tab The only variant of pVI-CT that inhibited activation to any extent was QSLKRRRCF, the largest of those which did not activate. This caused a 28% reduction in protease activity. None of the shorter peptides containing a cysteine residue showed any inhibition of activation despite the fact that mass spectrometry indicated that some of these did form a covalent complex with the protease. Neither of the peptides tested that contained the N-terminal region of pVI-CT, GV and GVQSL showed any inhibition of activation. The inability of these peptides to effectively inhibit the activation of the protease indicates that they are readily displaced by pVI-CT. The mass spectrometry results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the shorter cysteine-containing variants do not bind as effectively to the protease as the full-length peptide. The results presented here show that both the N- and C-terminal regions of the activating peptide are essential for productive interaction between pVI-CT and the adenovirus protease. The data are in agreement with the structure presented by Ding et al. (15Ding J.Z. McGrath W.J. Sweet R.M. Mangel W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in showing that full-length pVI-CT forms a 1:1 complex with the protease. In addition, the mass spectrometry results (Fig. 2) show that peptides lacking the N-terminal 2 or 3 residues bind to the protease, a conclusion that is supported by the ability of the larger peptide (QSLKRRRCF) to inhibit (albeit weakly) the development of proteolytic activity. There is also good evidence that the formation of the pVI-CT·protease complex is dependent on the N-terminal regions of the peptide. The ability to activate the protease is decreased significantly by removal of the N-terminal glycine and effectively abolished if the 2nd residue (valine) was also missing (Fig. 1). Additional evidence of the importance of these 2 residues is presented in Table I. Acetylation of the N-terminal residue decreases the ability of pVI-CT to activate indicating that the free amino group is important for binding. The size and hydrophobicity of the valine residue at position 2 is also important. Peptides where the valine is substituted by the smaller hydrophobic alanine or by the similarly sized branched chain hydrophilic threonine are less efficient activators of the protease. These results are in accord with existing sequence data. An alignment of the C-terminal 15 residues from pVI sequences in the SWISSPROT data base (release 33, April 1996) and sequences translated from nucleic acid sequences obtained from the “Updates” data base of recent releases (July 1996) held at the SEQNET facility (Daresbury, United Kingdom) is shown in Fig. 4. This alignment shows that the protease cleavage site and thus the length of activating peptide is conserved, as is the position of the cysteine residue. The glycine in position 1 is also completely conserved, and valine is found in all cases except one incidence of a conservative replacement by leucine. This alignment supports the contention that the cysteine residue and the GV sequence separated by a fixed distance are critical parameters for interaction. There is evidence from previous work that the protease does have some proteolytic activity in the absence of pVI-CT. Measurable rates of activity have been obtained in the absence of pVI-CT (13Mangel W.F. Toledo D.L. Brown M.T. Martin J.H. McGrath W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 536-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) while cleavage of pTP in insect cells, simultaneously infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing protease and pTP, has been demonstrated (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mangel et al. (13Mangel W.F. Toledo D.L. Brown M.T. Martin J.H. McGrath W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 536-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) further showed that addition of pVI-CT had little effect on Km but caused a significant increase in kcat. This suggests that the substrate-binding site is relatively intact in the absence of pVI-CT, and the consequence of its addition is to stabilize the catalytic apparatus of the protease. The crystal structure of the pVI-CT·protease complex (15Ding J.Z. McGrath W.J. Sweet R.M. Mangel W.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) shows that Cys-104 is on the surface of the molecule and Cys-10 of pVI-CT is disulfide linked to this cysteine whereas residues 3-9 are in a β-strand conformation and lie alongside a β-strand formed from the residues subsequent to Cys-104. The N-terminal region of pVI-CT is enfolded in a loop region of the protease in the region of residues 135-140 with contacts between the N-terminal glycine of pVI-CT and aspartate residue at position 142. This loop region immediately follows a region of helix in the protease where Cys-122 lies at the far end. Thus it is entirely plausible that the effect of pVI-CT is to “tie together” two distinct regions or minidomains of the protease, which in its absence are able to move independently. The effect of this would be to stabilize the catalytic residues in their optimum orientation and to achieve this, interaction from both ends of pVI-CT would be required. This model would also explain why the protease displays some activity in the absence of activating peptide, as the dynamic nature of the protein would allow a small proportion of the protease molecules to be in the active conformation at any one instant. The reduction of activation caused by acetylation of pVI-CT raises the question of how pVI-CT is produced from pVI in the first instance. Previous work (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) indicated that pVI is capable of activating the protease, and we have shown 1G. Cabrita and G. Kemp, unpublished observations. that the peptide IVGLGVQSLKRRRCF, which has the same preceding 4 residues as pVI from Ad2, effectively activates the protease and is very rapidly cleaved to the 11-residue pVI-CT. The analogues IVALGVQSLKRRRCF and VVGLGVQSLKRRRCF that do not contain the consensus sequence for cleavage also activate the protease and were, as expected, not cleaved. Secondary structure predictions suggest the presence of a turn region associated with the cleavage site, and this must allow the GV region to fit into its complementary site in the protease. The inability of the truncated activating peptides to act as effective inhibitors, in spite of their ability to bind to the protease, was surprising but is indicative of the importance of the GV dipeptide region. It is also possible that the disulfide bond formed between Cys-104 of the protease and pVI-CT is prone to disulfide exchange; certainly there is evidence from the mass spectrometry (Fig. 2) that cysteine-containing truncated versions bind less effectively. The pVI-CT sequences from different serotypes presented in Fig. 4 show that there is a conserved aromatic residue (phenylalanine or tyrosine) in position 11, next to the cysteine, and at least two arginines close by. Both of these factors may serve to destabilize disulfide bonds involving the activating peptide, an effect that may be further enhanced by the presence of an arginine (also well conserved) at position 103 in the protease. This would suggest that the binding of the intact pVI-CT may be reversible, and the need for a large molar excess to achieve effective activation of the protease (11Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.D.

The reversibility of the activation procedure may represent an aspect of the in vivo regulation of the protease. We are grateful to Dr. A.
