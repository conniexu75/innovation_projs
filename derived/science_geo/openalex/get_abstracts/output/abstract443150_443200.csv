https://openalex.org/W2154600934,"Researchers working in the field of global connectivity analysis using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can count on a wide selection of software packages for processing their data, with methods ranging from the reconstruction of the local intra-voxel axonal structure to the estimation of the trajectories of the underlying fibre tracts. However, each package is generally task-specific and uses its own conventions and file formats. In this article we present the Connectome Mapper, a software pipeline aimed at helping researchers through the tedious process of organising, processing and analysing diffusion MRI data to perform global brain connectivity analyses. Our pipeline is written in Python and is freely available as open-source at www.cmtk.org."
https://openalex.org/W2022896276,"Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance, and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients. Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC) functions, and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood. Here, we show, for the first time, that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF, IL-6, and CSC signature genes Nanog, Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis, and the formation of pancreatospheres, concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. The treatment of PC cells with CDF, a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6, and down-regulated the expression of Nanog, Oct4, EZH2 mRNAs, as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia. CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion, angiogenesis, and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia. Moreover, CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21, miR-210, IL-6, HIF-1Î±, VEGF, and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC. Collectively, these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways, and thus CDF could become a novel, and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2072247427,"Lysosomal enzymes function optimally in acidic environments, and elevation of lysosomal pH can impede their ability to degrade material delivered to lysosomes through autophagy or phagocytosis. We hypothesize that abnormal lysosomal pH is a key aspect in diseases of accumulation and that restoring lysosomal pH will improve cell function. The propensity of nanoparticles to end up in the lysosome makes them an ideal method of delivering drugs to lysosomes. This study asked whether acidic nanoparticles could traffic to lysosomes, lower lysosomal pH and enhance lysosomal degradation by the cultured human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Acidic nanoparticles composed of poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) 502 H, PLGA 503 H and poly (DL-lactide) (PLA) colocalized to lysosomes of ARPE-19 cells within 60 min. PLGA 503 H and PLA lowered lysosomal pH in cells compromised by the alkalinizing agent chloroquine when measured 1 hr. after treatment, with acidification still observed 12 days later. PLA enhanced binding of Bodipy-pepstatin-A to the active site of cathepsin D in compromised cells. PLA also reduced the cellular levels of opsin and the lipofuscin-like autofluorescence associated with photoreceptor outer segments. These observations suggest the acidification produced by the nanoparticles was functionally effective. In summary, acid nanoparticles lead to a rapid and sustained lowering of lysosomal pH and improved degradative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2084279845,"Immunity and metabolism are intimately linked; manipulating metabolism, either through diet or genetics, has the power to alter survival during infection. However, despite metabolism's powerful ability to alter the course of infections, little is known about what being ""sick"" means metabolically. Here we describe the metabolic changes occurring in a model system when Listeria monocytogenes causes a lethal infection in Drosophila melanogaster. L. monocytogenes infection alters energy metabolism; the flies gradually lose both of their energy stores, triglycerides and glycogen, and show decreases in both intermediate metabolites and enzyme message for the two main energy pathways, beta-oxidation and glycolysis. L. monocytogenes infection also causes enzymatic reduction in the anti-oxidant uric acid, and knocking out the enzyme uric oxidase has a complicated effect on immunity. Free amino acid levels also change during infection, including a drop in tyrosine levels which may be due to robust L. monocytogenes induced melanization."
https://openalex.org/W2030659751,"Background Anopheles gambiae is a major vector of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The arthropod-host interactions occurring at the skin interface are complex and dynamic. We used a global approach to describe the interaction between the mosquito (infected or uninfected) and the skin of mammals during blood feeding. Methods Intravital video microscopy was used to characterize several features during blood feeding. The deposition and movement of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites in the dermis were also observed. We also used histological techniques to analyze the impact of infected and uninfected feedings on the skin cell response in naive mice. Results The mouthparts were highly mobile within the skin during the probing phase. Probing time increased with mosquito age, with possible effects on pathogen transmission. Repletion was achieved by capillary feeding. The presence of sporozoites in the salivary glands modified the behavior of the mosquitoes, with infected females tending to probe more than uninfected females (86% versus 44%). A white area around the tip of the proboscis was observed when the mosquitoes fed on blood from the vessels of mice immunized with saliva. Mosquito feedings elicited an acute inflammatory response in naive mice that peaked three hours after the bite. Polynuclear and mast cells were associated with saliva deposits. We describe the first visualization of saliva in the skin by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antibodies directed against saliva. Both saliva deposits and sporozoites were detected in the skin for up to 18 h after the bite. Conclusion This study, in which we visualized the probing and engorgement phases of Anopheles gambiae blood meals, provides precise information about the behavior of the insect as a function of its infection status and the presence or absence of anti-saliva antibodies. It also provides insight into the possible consequences of the inflammatory reaction for blood feeding and pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2094763911,"The diversity of receptor signaling is increased by receptor heteromerization leading to dynamic regulation of receptor function. While a number of studies have demonstrated that family A G-protein-coupled receptors are capable of forming heteromers in vitro, the role of these heteromers in normal physiology and disease has been poorly explored. In this study, direct interactions between CB1 cannabinoid and delta opioid receptors in the brain were examined. Additionally, regulation of heteromer levels and signaling in a rodent model of neuropathic pain was explored. First we examined changes in the expression, function and interaction of these receptors in the cerebral cortex of rats with a peripheral nerve lesion that resulted in neuropathic pain. We found that, following the peripheral nerve lesion, the expression of both cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR) are increased in select brain regions. Concomitantly, an increase in CB1R activity and decrease in DOR activity was observed. We hypothesize that this decrease in DOR activity could be due to heteromeric interactions between these two receptors. Using a CB1R-DOR heteromer-specific antibody, we found increased levels of CB1R-DOR heteromer protein in the cortex of neuropathic animals. We subsequently examined the functionality of these heteromers by testing whether low, non-signaling doses of CB1R ligands influenced DOR signaling in the cortex. We found that, in cortical membranes from animals that experienced neuropathic pain, non-signaling doses of CB1R ligands significantly enhanced DOR activity. Moreover, this activity is selectively blocked by a heteromer-specific antibody. Together, these results demonstrate an important role for CB1R-DOR heteromers in altered cortical function of DOR during neuropathic pain. Moreover, they suggest the possibility that a novel heteromer-directed therapeutic strategy for enhancing DOR activity, could potentially be employed to reduce anxiety associated with chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2077524662,"We examined sex differences in familial resemblance for a broad range of behavioral, psychiatric and health related phenotypes (122 complex traits) in children and adults. There is a renewed interest in the importance of genotype by sex interaction in, for example, genome-wide association (GWA) studies of complex phenotypes. If different genes play a role across sex, GWA studies should consider the effect of genetic variants separately in men and women, which affects statistical power. Twin and family studies offer an opportunity to compare resemblance between opposite-sex family members to the resemblance between same-sex relatives, thereby presenting a test of quantitative and qualitative sex differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits. We analyzed data on lifestyle, personality, psychiatric disorder, health, growth, development and metabolic traits in dizygotic (DZ) same-sex and opposite-sex twins, as these siblings are perfectly matched for age and prenatal exposures. Sample size varied from slightly over 300 subjects for measures of brain function such as EEG power to over 30,000 subjects for childhood psychopathology and birth weight. For most phenotypes, sample sizes were large, with an average sample size of 9027 individuals. By testing whether the resemblance in DZ opposite-sex pairs is the same as in DZ same-sex pairs, we obtain evidence for genetic qualitative sex-differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits for 4% of phenotypes. We conclude that for most traits that were examined, the current evidence is that same the genes are operating in men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2039074671,"Probing molecular brain mechanisms related to increased suicide risk is an important issue in biological psychiatry research. Gene expression studies on post mortem brains indicate extensive changes prior to a successful suicide attempt; however, proteomic studies are scarce. Thus, we performed a DIGE proteomic analysis of post mortem tissue samples from the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of suicide victims to identify protein changes and biomarker candidates of suicide. Among our matched spots we found 46 and 16 significant differences in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, respectively; by using the industry standard t test and 1.3 fold change as cut off for significance. Because of the risk of false discoveries (FDR) in these data, we also made FDR adjustment by calculating the q-values for all the t tests performed and by using 0.06 and 0.4 as alpha thresholds we reduced the number of significant spots to 27 and 9 respectively. From these we identified 59 proteins in the cortex and 11 proteins in the amygdala. These proteins are related to biological functions and structures such as metabolism, the redox system, the cytoskeleton, synaptic function, and proteolysis. Thirteen of these proteins (CBR1, DPYSL2, EFHD2, FKBP4, GFAP, GLUL, HSPA8, NEFL, NEFM, PGAM1, PRDX6, SELENBP1 and VIM,) have already been suggested to be biomarkers of psychiatric disorders at protein or genome level. We also pointed out 9 proteins that changed in both the amygdala and the cortex, and from these, GFAP, INA, NEFL, NEFM and TUBA1 are interacting cytoskeletal proteins that have a functional connection to glutamate, GABA, and serotonin receptors. Moreover, ACTB, CTSD and GFAP displayed opposite changes in the two examined brain structures that might be a suitable characteristic for brain imaging studies. The opposite changes of ACTB, CTSD and GFAP in the two brain structures were validated by western blot analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2014159055,"The potential capability of stem cells to restore functionality to diseased or aged tissues has prompted a surge of research, but much work remains to elucidate the response of these cells to genotoxic agents. To more fully understand the impact of irradiation on different stem cell types, the present study has analyzed the radioresponse of human pluripotent and multipotent stem cells. Human embryonic stem (ES) cells, human induced pluripotent (iPS) cells, and iPS-derived human neural stem cells (iPS-hNSCs) cells were irradiated and analyzed for cell survival parameters, differentiation, DNA damage and repair and oxidative stress at various times after exposure. While irradiation led to dose-dependent reductions in survival, the fraction of surviving cells exhibited dose-dependent increases in metabolic activity. Irradiation did not preclude germ layer commitment of ES cells, but did promote neuronal differentiation. ES cells subjected to irradiation exhibited early apoptosis and inhibition of cell cycle progression, but otherwise showed normal repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Cells surviving irradiation also showed acute and persistent increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that were significant at nearly all post-irradiation times analyzed. We suggest that stem cells alter their redox homeostasis to adapt to adverse conditions and that radiation-induced oxidative stress plays a role in regulating the function and fate of stem cells within tissues compromised by radiation injury."
https://openalex.org/W2078584338,"In the present study we investigate the impact of a range of TLR ligands and chitosan as potential adjuvants for different routes of mucosal immunisation (sublingual (SL), intranasal (IN), intravaginal (IVag) and a parenteral route (subcutaneous (SC)) in the murine model. We assess their ability to enhance antibody responses to HIV-1 CN54gp140 (gp140) and Tetanus toxoid (TT) in systemic and vaginal compartments. A number of trends were observed by route of administration. For non-adjuvanted antigen, SC>SL>IN immunisation with respect to systemic IgG responses, where endpoint titres were greater for TT than for gp140. In general, co-administration with adjuvants increased specific IgG responses where IN = SC>SL, while in the vaginal compartment IN>SL>SC for specific IgA. In contrast, for systemic and mucosal IgA responses to antigen alone SL>IN = SC. A number of adjuvants increased specific systemic IgA responses where in general IN>SL>SC immunisation, while for mucosal responses IN = SL>SC. In contrast, direct intravaginal immunisation failed to induce any detectable systemic or mucosal responses to gp140 even in the presence of adjuvant. However, significant systemic IgG responses to TT were induced by intravaginal immunisation with or without adjuvant, and detectable mucosal responses IgG and IgA were observed when TT was administered with FSL-1 or Poly Iâ¶C. Interestingly some TLRs displayed differential activity dependent upon the route of administration. MPLA (TLR4) suppressed systemic responses to SL immunisation while enhancing responses to IN or SC immunisation. CpG B enhanced SL and IN responses, while having little or no impact on SC immunisation. These data demonstrate important route, antigen and adjuvant effects that need to be considered in the design of mucosal vaccine strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2040888814,"Adherence to medication is low in specific populations who need chronic medication. However, adherence to medication is also of interest in a more general fashion, independent of specific populations or side effects of particular drugs. If clinicians and researchers expect patients to show close to full adherence, it is relevant to know how likely the achievement of this goal is. Population based rates can provide an estimate of efforts needed to achieve near complete adherence in patient populations. The objective of the study was to collect normative data for medication nonadherence in the general population.We assessed 2,512 persons (a representative sample of German population). Adherence was measured by Rief Adherence Index. We also assessed current medication intake and side effects. We found that at least 33% of Germans repeatedly fail to follow their doctor's recommendations regarding pharmacological treatments and only 25% of Germans describe themselves as fully adherent. Nonadherence to medication occurs more often in younger patients with higher socioeconomic status taking short-term medications than in older patients with chronic conditions. Experience with medication side effects was the most prominent predictor of nonadherence.The major strengths of our study are a representative sample and a novel approach to assess adherence. Nonadherece seems to be commonplace in the general population. Therefore adherence cannot be expected per se but needs special efforts on behalf of prescribers and public health initiatives. Nonadherence to medication should not only be considered as a drug-specific behaviour problem, but as a behaviour pattern that is independent of the prescribed medication."
https://openalex.org/W2008912873,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the forced expression of four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. While a great variety of colonies grow during induction, only a few of them develop into iPS cells. Researchers currently use visual observation to identify iPS cells and select colonies resembling embryonic stem (ES) cells, and there are no established objective criteria. Therefore, we exhaustively analyzed the morphology and gene expression of all the colonies generated from human fibroblasts after transfection with four retroviral vectors encoding individual factors (192 and 203 colonies in two experiments) and with a single polycistronic retroviral vector encoding all four factors (199 and 192 colonies in two experiments). Here we demonstrate that the morphologic features of emerged colonies can be categorized based on six parameters, and all generated colonies that could be passaged were classified into seven subtypes in colonies transfected with four retroviral vectors and six subtypes with a single polycistronic retroviral vector, both including iPS cell colonies. The essential qualifications for iPS cells were: cells with a single nucleolus; nucleus to nucleolus (N/Nls) ratio â¼2.19: cell size â¼43.5 Âµm2: a nucleus to cytoplasm (N/C) ratio â¼0.87: cell density in a colony â¼5900 cells/mm2: and number of cell layer single. Most importantly, gene expression analysis revealed for the first time that endogenous Sox2 and Cdx2 were expressed specifically in iPS cells, whereas Oct3/4 and Nanog, popularly used markers for identifying iPS cells, are expressed in colonies other than iPS cells, suggesting that Sox2 and Cdx2 are reliable markers for identifying iPS cells. Our findings indicate that morphologic parameters and the expression of endogenous Sox2 and Cdx2 can be used to accurately identify iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002468166,"Spastin and katanin are ring-shaped hexameric AAA ATPases that sever microtubules, and thus crucially depend on a physical interaction with microtubules. For the first time, we report here the microtubule binding properties of spastin at the single-molecule level, and compare them to katanin. Microscopic fluorescence assays showed that human spastin bound to microtubules by ionic interactions, and diffused along microtubules with a diffusion coefficient comparable to katanin. The microscopic measurement of landing and dissociation rates demonstrated the ionic character of the interaction, which could be mapped to a patch of three lysine residues outside of the catalytic domain of human spastin. This motif is not conserved in Drosophila spastin or katanin, which also bound by non-catalytic parts of the protein. The binding affinities of spastin and katanin were nucleotide-sensitive, with the lowest affinities under ADP,, the highest under ATP-Î³S conditions. These changes correlated with the formation of higher oligomeric states, as shown in biochemical experiments and electron microscopic images. Vice versa, the artificial dimerization of human spastin by addition of a coiled coil led to a constitutively active enzyme. These observations suggest that dimer formation is a crucial step in the formation of the active complex, and thus the severing process by spastin."
https://openalex.org/W2068547283,"Human-caused alterations of the carbon and nutrient cycles are expected to impact tropical ecosystems in the near future. Here we evaluated how a combined change in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability affects soil and litter microbial respiration and litter decomposition in an undisturbed Amazonian rainforest in French Guiana. In a fully factorial C (as cellulose), N (as urea), and P (as phosphate) fertilization experiment we analyzed a total of 540 litterbag-soil pairs after a 158-day exposure in the field. Rates of substrate-induced respiration (SIR) measured in litter and litter mass loss were similarly affected by fertilization showing the strongest stimulation when N and P were added simultaneously. The stimulating NP effect on litter SIR increased considerably with increasing initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in litter, suggesting that the combined availability of N, P, and a labile C source has a particularly strong effect on microbial activity. Cellulose fertilization, however, did not further stimulate the NP effect. In contrast to litter SIR and litter mass loss, soil SIR was reduced with N fertilization and showed only a positive effect in response to P fertilization that was further enhanced with additional C fertilization. Our data suggest that increased nutrient enrichment in the studied Amazonian rainforest can considerably change microbial activity and litter decomposition, and that these effects differ between the litter layer and the underlying soil. Any resulting change in relative C and nutrient fluxes between the litter layer and the soil can have important consequences for biogeochemical cycles in tropical forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2016384948,"A motif in a network is a connected graph that occurs significantly more frequently as an induced subgraph than would be expected in a similar randomized network. By virtue of being atypical, it is thought that motifs might play a more important role than arbitrary subgraphs. Recently, a flurry of advances in the study of network motifs has created demand for faster computational means for identifying motifs in increasingly larger networks. Motif detection is typically performed by enumerating subgraphs in an input network and in an ensemble of comparison networks; this poses a significant computational problem. Classifying the subgraphs encountered, for instance, is typically performed using a graph canonical labeling package, such as Nauty, and will typically be called billions of times. In this article, we describe an implementation of a network motif detection package, which we call NetMODE. NetMODE can only perform motif detection for -node subgraphs when , but does so without the use of Nauty. To avoid using Nauty, NetMODE has an initial pretreatment phase, where -node graph data is stored in memory (). For we take a novel approach, which relates to the Reconstruction Conjecture for directed graphs. We find that NetMODE can perform up to around times faster than its predecessors when and up to around times faster when (the exact improvement varies considerably). NetMODE also (a) includes a method for generating comparison graphs uniformly at random, (b) can interface with external packages (e.g. R), and (c) can utilize multi-core architectures.

Previously published clinical trials have been all open-labeled. Aim To evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCV in progressive MS, in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Methodology Twenty-six patients with relapsing-progressive MS were enrolled in the study (mean age: 39Â±9.8 years; mean EDSS: 4.4Â±1.7). T-cell lines reactive to 9 different peptides of the myelin antigens, MBP, MOG and PLP were raised from the patients' peripheral blood. The patients were randomized into two groups: 19 were treated with TCV (four subcutaneous injections of 10â30Ã106 T-cells, attenuated by irradiation, on days 1, 30, 90 and 180) and 7 patients were treated with sham injections. Twenty-four patients (17 in the TCV group and 7 in the placebo) were eligible for per-protocol analysis. Results At one year following the inclusion, an increase in the EDSS (+0.50) and an increase in 10-meter walking time (+0.18 sec), were observed in the placebo group; in the TCV group there was a decrease in the EDSS (â0.44; p<0.01) and in the 10-meter walking time (0.84 sec; p<0.005). Sixteen of the 17 patients (94.1%) in the TCV group remained relapse-free during the year of the study, as compared to 42.9% in the placebo group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 with adjustment). The proportion of patients with any relapse during the year of the study in the TCV-group, was reduced by 89.6%., as compared to the placebo-treated group. MRI parameters did not change significantly. Conclusions This is the first controlled, double-blind trial with TCV in progressive MS. The results demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the procedure, and provide significant indications of clinical efficacy. Further studies with larger groups of subjects are warranted.

The D1 subunit of this complex contains most of the ligating amino acid residues for the Mn4CaO5 core of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). Most cyanobacteria have 3â5 copies of the psbA gene coding for at least two isoforms of D1, whereas algae and plants have only one isoform.

However, âlow lightâ D1:1 remains the dominant isoform in many cyanobacteria. Why have cyanobacteria maintained this seemingly inferior D1 isoform over billions of years of evolution? We hypothesized that under very low light intensities, D1:1 may have a functional advantage over D1:2. By expressing cyanobacterial D1 isoforms in a model green alga, we avoided background fluorescence interferences commonly encountered in experiments with cyanobacteria (30.Schreiber U. Chlorophyll a Fluorescence: A Signature of Photosynthesis.Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands. 2004; : 279-319Google Scholar) and were thus able to quantitatively compare the D1:1, D1:2, and algal isoforms both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we show that when compared with the D1:2 and algal isoforms, D1:1 has higher WOC cycling efficiency at low light intensities, which is supported by the observation of a more stable S3 WOC intermediate. We attribute this improved efficiency to fewer competing PSII-cyclic electron transfers from native cofactors (including QAâ and cyt b559). Heterologous psbA genes from Synechococcus 7942 were expressed in the chloroplast genome of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (hereafter Chlamydomonas). Chlamydomonas contains two identical psbA copies in the inverted repeat region of its chloroplast genome. A strain generated from wild type 137c (CC-125 mt+) in which both psbA copies had been inactivated and the native gene reintroduced at a distal single copy site in the chloroplast genome was available from a previous study (31.Manuell A.L. Beligni M.V. Elder J.H. Siefker D.T. Tran M. Weber A. McDonald T.L. Mayfield S.P. Robust expression of a bioactive mammalian protein in Chlamydomonas chloroplast.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2007; 5: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This strain, psbA-m-saa3+psbA-psbA, accumulates native D1 protein at wild type levels and does not express the mammalian protein introduced in the psbA-m-saa strain (31.Manuell A.L. Beligni M.V. Elder J.H. Siefker D.T. Tran M. Weber A. McDonald T.L. Mayfield S.P. Robust expression of a bioactive mammalian protein in Chlamydomonas chloroplast.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2007; 5: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we refer to this strain as C. reinhardtii-PSII. Gene sequences for the Synechococcus 7942 D1:1 and D1:2 (9.Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R.

Additionally, we replaced the cleaved C-terminal peptide with that of Chlamydomonas to avoid potential processing incompatibilities (supplemental Fig. S1). Gene synthesis was carried out by GeneArt (Germany). The synthetic genes were introduced into psbA-m-saa by particle bombardment into the same site as in C. reinhardtii-PSII (32.Rasala B.A. Muto M. Sullivan J. Mayfield S.P. Improved heterologous protein expression in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through promoter and 5â²-untranslated region optimization.Plant Biotechnol. J. 2011; 9: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The coding sequences were under the control of the Chlamydomonas psbA promoter, 5â²- and 3â²-untranslated regions. Transformants were selected for resistance to kanamycin and confirmed by PCR through sequencing of the PCR products. Both strains were rendered homoplasmic for the transgene insertion by propagation in kanamycin and confirmed by PCR. The resulting strains are referred to in this work as D1:1-PSII and D1:2-PSII. Chlamydomonas strains were grown in HS medium (33.Sueoka N. Mitotic replication of deoxyribonucleic acid in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1960; 46: 83-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 mm NaHCO3. For fast repetition rate fluorometry experiments, cultures were maintained in a turbidostat (FMT-150, Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) with continuous illumination at 100 Î¼E mâ2 sâ1 at 25 Â°C. Optical density (OD) at 730 nm was maintained at 0.200 Â± 0.005. For growth rate measurements, 40-ml cultures were grown in HS medium and continuously bubbled with 2% CO2 in air. Growth was monitored as OD at 730 nm. Full growth curves were recorded and then fit to a four-component Gompertz function (34.Zwietering M.H. Jongenburger I. Rombouts F.M. van 't Riet K. Modeling of the bacterial growth curve.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) to calculate doubling times. For biomass accumulation experiments, 9-liter cultures were grown in 12-liter glass carboys in HS medium and continuously bubbled with 2% CO2 in air. After the stationary phase was reached (monitored by OD730 nm), cells were harvested by centrifugation and dried at 90 Â°C overnight. Total dry weight was determined gravimetrically. Chl was extracted in methanol, and relative concentrations of Chl-a and Chl-b were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients reported by Porra et al. (35.Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Determination of accurate extinction coefficients and simultaneous equations for assaying chlorophylls ab extracted with four different solvents: verification of the concentration of chlorophyll standards by atomic absorption spectroscopy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4660) Google Scholar). All starting material corresponded to mid-log phase cultures (â¼106 cells/ml) grown at 100 Î¼E mâ2 sâ1 and 25 Â°C. The Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen) was used for all RNA extractions, following the small scale protocol with 5 ml of culture. 320 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using the Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). 20-Î¼l reactions were diluted 10-fold, and 2 Î¼l were used for qPCR with the Absolute Fast kit for probes and without ROX (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR assays were done in a CFX96 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). Samples from each strain were run with five replicates. The rbcL gene was used as a reference (36.Chen R. Gyokusen M. Nakazawa Y. Gyokusen K. Selection of housekeeping genes for transgene expression analysis in Eucommia ulmoides Oliver using real time RT-PCR.J. Bot. 2010; 2010Google Scholar). Expression levels were calculated with the CFX manager software (Bio-Rad) using the ÎÎCt method. Amplification efficiencies ranged from 90.7 to 93.2% and were also considered for the expression analysis. All qPCR primers and probes were purchased pre-mixed from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are shown in supplemental Table S1. Westerns blots were performed as described previously (37.Mayfield S.P. Cohen A. Danon A. Yohn C.B. Translation of the psbA mRNA of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii requires a structured RNA element contained within the 5â²-untranslated region.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Total protein extracts were used instead of insoluble fractions. Total protein was quantified using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The loading buffer also included 2 m urea, and denaturation was performed on ice for 30 min. The primary antibody corresponded to anti-D1 rabbit polyclonal raised against a conserved N-terminal peptide of the protein (Agrisera, Sweden). Dylight 488-conjugated anti-rabbit was used as the secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific). Chl fluorescence from light-harvesting complex II monomers was used as a loading control (38.Schuster G. Timberg R. Ohad I. Turnover of thylakoid photosystem II proteins during photoinhibition of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Fluorescence imaging was carried out with a Typhoon 8600 scanner (GE Healthcare). Image analysis and densitometry was performed with ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov). An equal number of D1:1-PSII and D1:2-PSII cells (determined by hemocytometer) were inoculated in either TAP medium (dark control) or HS medium supplemented with 5 mm NaHCO3 in vented large surface area untreated tissue culture flasks. Mixed cultures in TAP medium were grown in complete darkness without shaking at 25 Â°C. Mixed cultures in HS medium were grown at either 3 or 290 Î¼E mâ2 sâ1 with shaking (80 rpm) at 25 Â°C. For each time point, the total cell count of each flask was determined by a hemocytometer. Each resulting PCR used â¼1000 cells from the mixed culture for DNA template. Primers were designed that did not discriminate between the DNA sequences of D1:1-PSII or D1:2-PSII (supplemental Fig. S1) as follows: forward primer, TTCTAACGCAATCGGTCT, and reverse primer, GAATAATGAACCACCGAAT, which results in a 379-bp gene fragment. By chance, the D1:2-PSII gene sequence contains a PvuII restriction site (CAGâCTG) that is not present in the D1:1-PSII gene sequence (supplemental Fig. S1) and was used for identification. The 379-bp PCR fragment from D1:2-PSII DNA can be cleaved into 167- and 212-bp fragments by PvuII nuclease, although the 379-bp PCR fragment from D1:1-PSII DNA is unaffected (supplemental Fig. S2). Following 32 PCR cycles, two 10-Î¼l aliquots were taken from each reaction mixture. 5 units of PvuII (New England Biolabs) were added to only 1 aliquot, and both were incubated at 37 Â°C for 40 min. Then both aliquots were run on a 1.2% agarose gel at 80 V for â¼45 min and visualized using ethidium bromide. The fluorescence intensity of the 379-bp fragment in the control aliquot (no PvuII) was proportional to the sum total of D1:1-PSII and D1:2-PSII genes in the original mixed culture. The fluorescence intensity of the 379-bp fragment in the PvuII-treated fragment was proportional to the concentration of D1:1-PSII genes in the original mixed culture. These intensities were quantified using ImageJ and used to determine the fraction D1:1-PSII in the mixed culture at each specific time point. Knowledge of the total cell count and the fraction of D1:1-PSII enabled the determination of the number of D1:1-PSII cells and the number of D1:2-PSII cells. Thylakoid membrane fragments were isolated from Chlamydomonas strains using a modified procedure by Shim et al. and Gokhale and Sayre (39.Shim H. Cao J. Govindjee Debrunner P.G.

Briefly, â¼1-liter cultures were grown in HS medium supplemented with 5 mm NaHCO3 on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle at 100 Î¼E mâ2 sâ1 and 25 Â°C. To synchronize growth phase, cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,500 Ã g, 10 min) at 4 h into the third light cycle (42.Mason C.B. Bricker T.M. Moroney J.V. A rapid method for chloroplast isolation from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2227-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in Buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 350 mm sucrose, 2.0 mm MgCl2) at 1â2 mg of Chl/ml and then disrupted using a BeadBeater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) with 0.5-mm zirconia beads. Thylakoid membranes were isolated by centrifugation (40,000 Ã g, 20 min) to pellet thylakoids and whole cells, resuspended in Buffer 1, centrifuged (1200 Ã g, 30 s) to remove cell debris and whole cells, and then centrifuged (40,000 Ã g, 20 min) to pellet thylakoids. Purified thylakoids were resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EDTA) at â¥2.86 mg Chl/ml. 25% Triton X-100 (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2) was slowly added while stirring to a final Triton X-100/Chl ratio of 20:1 and Chl concentration of 2.0 mg/ml. Following slow stirring for 25 min, membrane fragments were washed three times with Buffer B (40,000 Ã g, 20 min) and flash-frozen in liquid N2 at â¼2 mg of Chl/ml in 25% glycerol, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 300 mm sucrose, 35 mm NaCl. All steps following cell harvesting were carried out at 4 Â°C under dim green light. All buffers contained 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 mm benzamidine as protease inhibitors. EPR measurements on thylakoid membrane fragments were made on a Bruker Elexsys E580 at 9.45 GHz frequency. Specific measurement conditions are provided in supplemental Fig. S3. Spin quantification was performed using Fremy's salt (K2NO(SO3)2, Sigma) standards, as described by Babcock et al. (43.Babcock G.T. Ghanotakis D.F. Ke B.

https://openalex.org/W2007107077,"The aggregation of Î±-synuclein into amyloid fibrils constitutes a key step in the onset of Parkinson's disease. Amyloid fibrils of Î±-synuclein are the major component of Lewy bodies, histological hallmarks of the disease. Little is known about the mechanism of aggregation of Î±-synuclein. During this process, Î±-synuclein forms transient intermediates that are considered to be toxic species. The dimerization of Î±-synuclein could represent a rate-limiting step in the aggregation of the protein. Here, we analyzed four covalent dimers of Î±-synuclein, obtained by covalent link of the N-terms, C-terms, tandem cloning of two sequences and tandem juxtaposition in one protein of the 1-104 and 29-140 sequences. Their biophysical properties in solution were determined by CD, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies. SDS-induced folding was also studied. The fibrils formation was analyzed by ThT and polarization fluorescence assays. Their morphology was investigated by TEM and AFM-based quantitative morphometric analysis. All dimers were found to be devoid of ordered secondary structure under physiological conditions and undergo Î±-helical transition upon interaction with SDS. All protein species are able to form amyloid-like fibrils. The reciprocal orientation of the Î±-synuclein monomers in the dimeric constructs affects the kinetics of the aggregation process and a scale of relative amyloidogenic propensity was determined. Structural investigations by FT IR spectroscopy, and proteolytic mapping of the fibril core did not evidence remarkable difference among the species, whereas morphological analyses showed that fibrils formed by dimers display a lower and diversified level of organization in comparison with Î±-synuclein fibrils. This study demonstrates that although Î±-synuclein dimerization does not imply the acquisition of a preferred conformation by the participating monomers, it can strongly affect the aggregation properties of the molecules. The results presented highlight a substantial role of the relative orientation of the individual monomer in the definition of the fibril higher structural levels."
https://openalex.org/W2013106815,"The availability of complete pathogen genomes has renewed interest in the development of diagnostics for infectious diseases. Synthetic peptide microarrays provide a rapid, high-throughput platform for immunological testing of potential B-cell epitopes. However, their current capacity prevent the experimental screening of complete âpeptidomesâ. Therefore, computational approaches for prediction and/or prioritization of diagnostically relevant peptides are required. In this work we describe a computational method to assess a defined set of molecular properties for each potential diagnostic target in a reference genome. Properties such as sub-cellular localization or expression level were evaluated for the whole protein. At a higher resolution (short peptides), we assessed a set of local properties, such as repetitive motifs, disorder (structured vs natively unstructured regions), trans-membrane spans, genetic polymorphisms (conserved vs. divergent regions), predicted B-cell epitopes, and sequence similarity against human proteins and other potential cross-reacting species (e.g. other pathogens endemic in overlapping geographical locations). A scoring function based on these different features was developed, and used to rank all peptides from a large eukaryotic pathogen proteome. We applied this method to the identification of candidate diagnostic peptides in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We measured the performance of the method by analyzing the enrichment of validated antigens in the high-scoring top of the ranking. Based on this measure, our integrative method outperformed alternative prioritizations based on individual properties (such as B-cell epitope predictors alone). Using this method we ranked 10 million 12-mer overlapping peptides derived from the complete T. cruzi proteome. Experimental screening of 190 high-scoring peptides allowed the identification of 37 novel epitopes with diagnostic potential, while none of the low scoring peptides showed significant reactivity. Many of the metrics employed are dependent on standard bioinformatic tools and data, so the method can be easily extended to other pathogen genomes."

Five common (frequencyâ¥5%) TLR4 htSNPs were selected to assess the association between TLR4 polymorphisms and the risk of LOAD in the Chinese ethnic population.Homozygosity of TLR4 rs1927907 was significantly associated with an increased risk of LOAD [TT vs. CC: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.30-4.64]. After stratification, the association increased further in ApoE e4 non-carriers (AOR = 3.07) and in hypertensive patients (AOR = 3.60). Haplotype GACGG was associated with a decreased risk of LOAD (1 vs. 0 copies: AOR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.36-0.96; 2 vs. 0 copies: AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14-0.67) in ApoE e4 non-carriers. ApoE e4 status significantly modified this association (p(interaction) = 0.01). These associations remained significant after correction for multiple tests.Sequence variants of TLR4 were associated with an increased risk of LOAD, especially in ApoE e4 non-carriers and in hypertensive patients. The combination of TLR4 rs1927907 and ApoE e4 significantly increased the screening sensitivity in identifying LOAD patients from 0.4 to 0.7."
https://openalex.org/W2066944932,"Fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) is one of a family of six transmembrane proteins that facilitate long- and very long-chain fatty acid uptake. FATP4 is expressed in several tissues, including skin. Mutations in human SLC27A4, which encodes FATP4, cause ichthyosis prematurity syndrome, characterized by a thick desquamating epidermis and premature birth. Mice lacking FATP4, which genetically model the human disease, are born with tight, thick skin and a defective skin barrier; they die neonatally due to dehydration and restricted movements. Both the skin phenotype and the lethality are rescued by transgene expression of FATP4 in suprabasal keratinocytes. Sebaceous glands in Fatp4 null skin grafted onto nude mice were found to be dystrophic and enwrapped by thick layers of epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2109583060,"Doctors' scarcity in rural areas remains a serious problem in Latin America and Peru. Few studies have explored job preferences of doctors working in underserved areas. We aimed to investigate doctors' stated preferences for rural jobs.A labelled discrete choice experiment (DCE) was performed in Ayacucho, an underserved department of Peru. Preferences were assessed for three locations: rural community, Ayacucho city (Ayacucho's capital) and other provincial capital city. Policy simulations were run to assess the effect of job attributes on uptake of a rural post. Multiple conditional logistic regressions were used to assess the relative importance of job attributes and of individual characteristics. A total of 102 doctors participated. They were five times more likely to choose a job post in Ayacucho city over a rural community (OR 4.97, 95%CI 1.2; 20.54). Salary increases and bonus points for specialization acted as incentives to choose a rural area, while increase in the number of years needed to get a permanent post acted as a disincentive. Being male and working in a hospital reduced considerably chances of choosing a rural job, while not living with a partner increased them. Policy simulations showed that a package of 75% salary increase, getting a permanent contract after two years in rural settings, and getting bonus points for further specialisation increased rural job uptake from 21% to 77%. A package of 50% salary increase plus bonus points for further specialisation would also increase the rural uptake from 21% to 52%.Doctors are five times more likely to favour a job in urban areas over rural settings. This strong preference needs to be overcome by future policies aimed at improving the scarcity of rural doctors. Some incentives, alone or combined, seem feasible and sustainable, whilst others may pose a high fiscal burden."
https://openalex.org/W2020563986,"MUC5AC is the most abundant gel-forming mucin in the ocular system. However, the specific function is unknown. In the present study, a Muc5ac knockout (KO) mouse model was subject to various physiological measurements as compared to its wide-type (WT) control. Interestingly, when KO mice were compared to WT mice, the mean tear break up time (TBUT) values were significantly lower and corneal fluorescein staining scores were significantly higher. But the tear volume was not changed. Despite the lack of Muc5ac expression in the conjunctiva of KO mice, Muc5b expression was significantly increased in these mice. Corneal opacification, varying in location and severity, was found in a few KO mice but not in WT mice. The present results suggest a significant difference in the quality, but not the quantity, of tear fluid in the KO mice compared to WT mice. Dry eye disease is multifactorial and therefore further evaluation of the varying components of the tear film, lacrimal unit and corneal structure of these KO mice may help elucidate the role of mucins in dry eye disease. Because Muc5ac knockout mice have clinical features of dry eye, this mouse model will be extremely useful for further studies regarding the pathophysiology of the ocular surface in dry eye in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2083141169,"Bacteria of the genus Brucella have the unusual capability to catabolize erythritol and this property has been associated with their virulence mainly because of the presence of erythritol in bovine foetal tissues and because the attenuated S19 vaccine strain is the only Brucella strain unable to oxydize erythritol. In this work we have analyzed the transcriptional changes produced in Brucella by erythritol by means of two high throughput approaches: RNA hybridization against a microarray containing most of Brucella ORF's constructed from the Brucella ORFeome and next generation sequencing of Brucella mRNA in an Illumina GAIIx platform. The results obtained showed the overexpression of a group of genes, many of them in a single cluster around the ery operon, able to co-ordinately mediate the transport and degradation of erythritol into three carbon atoms intermediates that will be then converted into fructose-6P (F6P) by gluconeogenesis. Other induced genes participating in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate shunt and the TCA may collaborate with the ery genes to conform an efficient degradation of sugars by this route. On the other hand, several routes of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis are up-regulated whilst amino acid transport and catabolism genes are down-regulated. These results corroborate previous descriptions indicating that in the presence of erythritol, this sugar was used preferentially over other compounds and provides a neat explanation of the the reported stimulation of growth induced by erythritol."
https://openalex.org/W2090000884,"The aim of the work was to find biomarkers identifying patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes after TAVI and SAVR in addition to currently used predictive model (EuroSCORE).There is limited data about the role of biomarkers in predicting prognosis, especially when TAVI is available.The multi-biomarker sub-study included 42 consecutive high-risk patients (average age 82.0 years; logistic EuroSCORE 21.0%) allocated to TAVI transfemoral and transapical using the Edwards-Sapien valve (n = 29), or SAVR with the Edwards Perimount bioprosthesis (n = 13). Standardized endpoints were prospectively followed during the 12-month follow-up.The clinical outcomes after both TAVI and SAVR were comparable. Malondialdehyde served as the best predictor of a combined endpoint at 1 year with AUC (ROC analysis) = 0.872 for TAVI group, resp. 0.765 (p<0.05) for both TAVI and SAVR groups. Increased levels of MDA, matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1), ferritin-reducing ability of plasma, homocysteine, cysteine and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine were all predictors of the occurrence of combined safety endpoints at 30 days (AUC 0.750-0.948; p<0.05 for all). The addition of MDA to a currently used clinical model (EuroSCORE) significantly improved prediction of a combined safety endpoint at 30 days and a combined endpoint (0-365 days) by the net reclassification improvement (NRI) and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) (p<0.05). Cystatin C, glutathione, cysteinylglycine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, nitrite/nitrate and MMP9 did not prove to be significant. Total of 14.3% died during 1-year follow-up.We identified malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress, as the most promising predictor of adverse outcomes during the 30-day and 1-year follow-up in high-risk patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI.

https://openalex.org/W2005675732,"The presence of pre-infarction angina (PIA) has been shown to confer cardioprotection after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the clinical impact of PIA in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) remains to be determined.From the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de CÃ´te d'Or (RICO) survey, 1541 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care unit with a first NSTEMI were included. Patients who experienced chest pain <7 days before the episode leading to admission were defined as having PIA and were compared with patients without PIA. Incidence of in-hospital ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), heart failure and 30-day mortality were collected. Among the 1541 patients included in the study, 693 (45%) patients presented PIA. PIA was associated with a lower creatine kinase peak, as a reflection of infarct size (231(109-520) vs. 322(148-844) IU/L, p<0.001) when compared with the group without PIA. Patients with PIA developed fewer VAs, by 3 fold (1.6% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.008) and heart failure (18.0% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.040) during the hospital stay. Overall, there was a decrease in early CV events by 26% in patients with PIA (19.2% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.002). By multivariate analysis, PIA remained independently associated with less VAs.From this large contemporary prospective study, our work showed that PIA is very frequent in patients admitted for a first NSTEMI, and is associated with a better prognosis, including reduced infarct size and in hospital VAs. Accordingly, protecting the myocardium by ischemic or pharmacological conditioning not only in STEMI, but in all type of MI merits further attention."
https://openalex.org/W1980096588,"Humans readily perceive ownership of a limb even when it is artificially induced as in the case of using a mirror reflection. However, mirror reflections are very constrained perceptions which do not allow transformations and varied contexts as often occurs in real life. The extent to which perceived limb ownership occurs with video-mediated manipulations is not known, particularly given the perception would no longer be a precise copy (reflection) of a person's own limb. The present study directly compared referred sensations of the limbs with the use of a mirror reflection to those obtained with a new video-mediated setup to assess perceived ownership. Manipulations that could not be performed with a standard mirror reflection, such as reversal of the spatial positions of the limbs, were also investigated to examine how far the perceived ownership effects could be pushed. Across a series of experiments, data on the quality, intensity and location of referred sensations were collected and analyzed together with measures of hand ownership and participants' experience of the two setups. Results reveal that participants felt referred sensations in both the optical and the video-mediated setup, and that video-mediated manipulations of hand-position reversals produced equal to stronger effects of ownership compared with the mirror reflection. These findings open up new possibilities for scientific experimentation and therapy that are discussed in the paper."
https://openalex.org/W1991601779,"Dexamethasone is widely used for pulmonary exacerbation in patients with cystic fibrosis, however, not much is known about the effects of glucocorticoids on the wild-type cystic fibrosis channel transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Our aim was to determine the effects of dexamethasone treatment on wild-type CFTR expression.Dose-response (1 nM to 10 ÂµM) and time course (3 to 48 h) curves were generated for dexamethasone for mRNA expression in Calu-3 cells using a real-time PCR. Within 24 h, dexamethasone (10 nM) showed a 0.3-fold decrease in CFTR mRNA expression, and a 3.2-fold increase in Î±ENaC mRNA expression compared with control groups. Dexamethasone (10 nM) induced a 1.97-fold increase in the total protein of wild-type CFTR, confirmed by inhibition by mifepristone. To access surface protein expression, biotinylation followed by Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment led to a 2.35-fold increase in the amount of CFTR in the cell surface compared with the untreated control groups. Once protein translation was inhibited with cycloheximide, dexamethasone could not increase the amount of CFTR protein. Protein stability was assessed by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (50 Âµg/ml) at different times in cells treated with dexamethasone and in untreated cells. Dexamethasone did not alter the degradation of wild-type CFTR. Assessment of the B band of CFTR within 15 min of metabolic pulse labeling showed a 1.5-fold increase in CFTR protein after treatment with dexamethasone for 24 h. Chaperone 90 (HSP90) binding to CFTR increased 1.55-fold after treatment with dexamethasone for 24 h, whereas chaperone 70 (HSP70) binding decreased 0.30 fold in an immunoprecipitation assay.Mature wild-type CFTR protein is regulated by dexamethasone post transcription, involving cotranslational mechanisms with HSP90 and HSP70, which enhances maturation and expression of wild-type CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2000727155,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a notorious human pathogen that is the major cause of infections related to implanted medical devices. Although redox regulation involving reactive oxygen species is now recognized as a critical component of bacterial signaling and regulation, the mechanism by which S. epidermidis senses and responds to oxidative stress remains largely unknown. Here, we report a new oxidation-sensing regulator, AbfR (aggregation and biofilm formation regulator) in S. epidermidis. An environment of oxidative stress mediated by H(2)O(2) or cumene hydroperoxide markedly up-regulates the expression of abfR gene. Similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa OspR, AbfR is negatively autoregulated and dissociates from promoter DNA in the presence of oxidants. In vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that Cys-13 and Cys-116 are the key functional residues to form an intersubunit disulfide bond upon oxidation in AbfR. We further show that deletion of abfR leads to a significant induction in H(2)O(2) or cumene hydroperoxide resistance, enhanced bacterial aggregation, and reduced biofilm formation. These effects are mediated by derepression of SERP2195 and gpxA-2 that lie immediately downstream of the abfR gene in the same operon. Thus, oxidative stress likely acts as a signal to modulate S. epidermidis key virulence properties through AbfR."
https://openalex.org/W2041892471,"Background B-cell activation factor (BAFF) and BAFF-receptor (BAFF-R) play crucial roles in the viability and proliferation of malignant lymphoma cells. Limited information exists regarding expression profiles and the prognostic role of BAFF and BAFF-R in follicular lymphoma (FL). We sought to determine the expression profiles of BAFF and BAFF-R in FL and to evaluate the correlation of BAFF and BAFF-R expression with clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome of FL. Correlation between expression levels of BAFF detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) and serum levels of BAFF was also evaluated. Methods Paraffin-embedded specimens from 115 patients were immunohistochemically examined for BAFF and BAFF-R expression. Expression levels were dichotomized into low versus high categories based on immunostaining intensity. The correlation of BAFF and BAFF-R expression with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcome was assessed. Serum levels of BAFF in 35 of the 115 patients with IHC data were measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results BAFF and BAFF-R were expressed in 88.7% (102/115) and 87.8% (101/115) of the cases, respectively. BAFF expression was significantly correlated with only one clinicopathologic feature: Ann Arbor stage. No significant correlation was found between expression levels of BAFF detected by IHC and serum levels of BAFF detected by ELISA. High expression of BAFF-R, but not BAFF, was significantly correlated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.013) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.03). High expression of BAFF-R, bulky disease, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were correlated with inferior PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. A prognostic scoring system incorporating these 3 risk factors identified 3 distinct prognostic groups with 5-year PFS of 59.4%, 41.9%, and 10.7% and OS of 91.3%, 79.7%, and 45.8%, respectively. Conclusions Most patients with FL variably express BAFF and BAFF-R. High expression of BAFF-R, but not BAFF, may be an independent risk factor for PFS and OS in FL."
https://openalex.org/W2059611538,"Studying physiology and pathophysiology over a broad population for long periods of time is difficult primarily because collecting human physiologic data can be intrusive, dangerous, and expensive. One solution is to use data that have been collected for a different purpose. Electronic health record (EHR) data promise to support the development and testing of mechanistic physiologic models on diverse populations and allow correlation with clinical outcomes, but limitations in the data have thus far thwarted such use. For example, using uncontrolled population-scale EHR data to verify the outcome of time dependent behavior of mechanistic, constructive models can be difficult because: (i) aggregation of the population can obscure or generate a signal, (ii) there is often no control population with a well understood health state, and (iii) diversity in how the population is measured can make the data difficult to fit into conventional analysis techniques. This paper shows that it is possible to use EHR data to test a physiological model for a population and over long time scales. Specifically, a methodology is developed and demonstrated for testing a mechanistic, time-dependent, physiological model of serum glucose dynamics with uncontrolled, population-scale, physiological patient data extracted from an EHR repository. It is shown that there is no observable daily variation the normalized mean glucose for any EHR subpopulations. In contrast, a derived value, daily variation in nonlinear correlation quantified by the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI), did reveal the intuitively expected diurnal variation in glucose levels amongst a random population of humans. Moreover, in a population of continuously (tube) fed patients, there was no observable TDMI-based diurnal signal. These TDMI-based signals, via a glucose insulin model, were then connected with human feeding patterns. In particular, a constructive physiological model was shown to correctly predict the difference between the general uncontrolled population and a subpopulation whose feeding was controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2020042644,"Signal transduction is the process of routing information inside cells when receiving stimuli from their environment that modulate the behavior and function. In such biological processes, the receptors, after receiving the corresponding signals, activate a number of biomolecules which eventually transduce the signal to the nucleus. The main objective of our work is to develop a theoretical approach which will help to better understand the behavior of signal transduction networks due to changes in kinetic parameters and network topology. By using an evolutionary algorithm, we designed a mathematical model which performs basic signaling tasks similar to the signaling process of living cells. We use a simple dynamical model of signaling networks of interacting proteins and their complexes. We study the evolution of signaling networks described by mass-action kinetics. The fitness of the networks is determined by the number of signals detected out of a series of signals with varying strength. The mutations include changes in the reaction rate and network topology. We found that stronger interactions and addition of new nodes lead to improved evolved responses. The strength of the signal does not play any role in determining the response type. This model will help to understand the dynamic behavior of the proteins involved in signaling pathways. It will also help to understand the robustness of the kinetics of the output response upon changes in the rate of reactions and the topology of the network."

Objective To assess the independent and interaction effects of prenatal zinc and vitamin A deficiencies on birthweight in rural Sidama, Southern Ethiopia. Methodology A community-based prospective cohort study design was employed. Six hundred fifty pregnant women in their second or third trimester were randomly selected and their serum zinc and retinol concentrations were determined. About 575 subjects were successfully followed until delivery and birthweight was measured within 72 hours after delivery. The association between the exposures and birthweight was examined using log-binomial and liner regression analyses. Potential interaction between ZD and VAD was examined using Synergy Index (SI). Results The mean birthweight (Â± standard deviation) was 2896 g (Â±423). About 16.5% (95% CI: 13.5â19.6%) of the babies had Low Birthweight (LBW). Prenatal ZD and VAD were not significantly associated to LBW with Adjusted Relative Risk (ARR) of 1.25 (95 CI: 0.86â1.82) and 1.27 (95% CI: 0.86â1.87), respectively. Stratified analysis on the basis of gestational trimester showed that the occurrence of the deficiencies neither in the second nor third trimester were associated to LBW. The deficiencies did not show synergetic interaction in causing LBW [SI = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.17â6.28)]. Important risk factors of LBW were maternal illiteracy [RR = 1.80 (95% CI: 1.11â2.93)], female sex of the newborn [RR = 1.79 (95% CI: 1.19â2.67)], primiparity [RR = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.02â1.35)], short maternal stature [RR = 1.63 (95% CI: 1.06â2.51)] and maternal thinness [RR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.03â2.25)]. In the linear regression model, elevated CRP was also negatively associated to birthweight. Conclusion LBW is of public health significance in the locality. The study did not witness any independent or interaction effect of prenatal ZD and VAD on birthweight."

https://openalex.org/W2096441539,"Background The National Lung Screening Trial showed that CT screening for lung cancer led to a 20% reduction in mortality. However, CT screening has a number of disadvantages including low specificity. A validated autoantibody assay is available commercially (EarlyCDTÂ®-Lung) to aid in the early detection of lung cancer and risk stratification in patients with pulmonary nodules detected by CT. Recent advances in high throughput (HTP) cloning and expression methods have been developed into a discovery pipeline to identify biomarkers that detect autoantibodies. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the successful clinical application of this strategy to add to the EarlyCDT-Lung panel in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity (and hence positive predictive value, (PPV)). Methods and Findings Serum from two matched independent cohorts of lung cancer patients were used (n = 100 and n = 165). Sixty nine proteins were initially screened on an abridged HTP version of the autoantibody ELISA using protein prepared on small scale by a HTP expression and purification screen. Promising leads were produced in shake flask culture and tested on the full assay. These results were analyzed in combination with those from the EarlyCDT-Lung panel in order to provide a set of re-optimized cut-offs. Five proteins that still displayed cancer/normal differentiation were tested for reproducibility and validation on a second batch of protein and a separate patient cohort. Addition of these proteins resulted in an improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of the test from 38% and 86% to 49% and 93% respectively (PPV improvement from 1 in 16 to 1 in 7). Conclusion This is a practical example of the value of investing resources to develop a HTP technology. Such technology may lead to improvement in the clinical utility of the EarlyCDTÂ­-Lung test, and so further aid the early detection of lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2013477281,"Transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with p53. Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and ÎNp63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, ÎNp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting ÎNp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress ÎNp63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits ÎNp63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of ÎNp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of ÎNp63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of ÎNp63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of ÎNp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of ÎNp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades ÎNp63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of ÎNp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death."
https://openalex.org/W2050561213,"Non-negative matrix factorization is a useful tool for reducing the dimension of large datasets. This work considers simultaneous non-negative matrix factorization of multiple sources of data. In particular, we perform the first study that involves more than two datasets. We discuss the algorithmic issues required to convert the approach into a practical computational tool and apply the technique to new gene expression data quantifying the molecular changes in four tissue types due to different dosages of an experimental panPPAR agonist in mouse. This study is of interest in toxicology because, whilst PPARs form potential therapeutic targets for diabetes, it is known that they can induce serious side-effects. Our results show that the practical simultaneous non-negative matrix factorization developed here can add value to the data analysis. In particular, we find that factorizing the data as a single object allows us to distinguish between the four tissue types, but does not correctly reproduce the known dosage level groups. Applying our new approach, which treats the four tissue types as providing distinct, but related, datasets, we find that the dosage level groups are respected. The new algorithm then provides separate gene list orderings that can be studied for each tissue type, and compared with the ordering arising from the single factorization. We find that many of our conclusions can be corroborated with known biological behaviour, and others offer new insights into the toxicological effects. Overall, the algorithm shows promise for early detection of toxicity in the drug discovery process."
https://openalex.org/W2029566382,"Although the structural properties of online social networks have attracted much attention, the properties of the close-knit friendship structures remain an important question. Here, we mainly focus on how these mesoscale structures are affected by the local and global structural properties. Analyzing the data of four large-scale online social networks reveals several common structural properties. It is found that not only the local structures given by the indegree, outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar scaling behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of close-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The degree correlation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We propose a simple directed network model that captures the observed properties. The model incorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and preferential attachment. Through rate equation analysis of our model, the local-scale and mesoscale structural properties are derived. In the local-scale, the same scaling behavior of indegree and outdegree distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes both growing as the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal degree distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear relationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In the mesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing close-knit friendship structures are found to exhibit identical power-laws, a behavior attributed to the negligible degree correlations. Intriguingly, all the power-law exponents of the distributions in the local-scale and mesoscale depend only on one global parameter, the mean in/outdegree, while both the mean in/outdegree and the reciprocity together determine the ratio of the reciprocal degree of a node to its in/outdegree. Structural properties of numerical simulated networks are analyzed and compared with each of the four real networks. This work helps understand the interplay between structures on different scales in online social networks."
https://openalex.org/W2111472196,"Although liver function tests (LFTs) are routinely measured in primary care, raised levels in patients with no obvious liver disease may trigger a range of subsequent expensive and unnecessary management plans. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction model to guide decision-making by general practitioners, which estimates risk of one year all-cause mortality in patients with no obvious liver disease.In this population-based historical cohort study, biochemistry data from patients in Tayside, Scotland, with LFTs performed in primary care were record-linked to secondary care and prescription databases to ascertain baseline characteristics, and to mortality data. Using this derivation cohort a survival model was developed to predict mortality. The model was assessed for calibration, discrimination (using the C-statistic) and performance, and validated using a separate cohort of Scottish primary care practices.From the derivation cohort (n = 95 977), 2.7% died within one year. Predictors of mortality included: age; male gender; social deprivation; history of cancer, renal disease, stroke, ischaemic heart disease or respiratory disease; statin use; and LFTs (albumin, transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyltransferase). The C-statistic for the final model was 0.82 (95% CI 0.80-0.84), and was similar in the validation cohort (n = 11 653) 0.86 (0.79-0.90). As an example of performance, for a 10% predicted probability cut-off, sensitivity = 52.8%, specificity = 94.0%, PPV = 21.0%, NPV = 98.5%. For the model without LFTs the respective values were 43.8%, 92.8%, 15.6%, 98.1%.The Algorithm for Liver Function Investigations (ALFI) is the first model to successfully estimate the probability of all-cause mortality in patients with no apparent liver disease having LFTs in primary care. While LFTs added to the model's discrimination and sensitivity, the clinical utility of ALFI remains to be established since LFTs did not improve an already high NPV for short term mortality and only modestly improved a very low PPV."
https://openalex.org/W2005570002,"Making only the assumption that twins are representative of the population from which they are drawn, we here develop a simple mathematical model (using widely available epidemiological information) that sheds considerable light on the pathogenesis of complex human diseases. Specifically, for the case of multiple sclerosis (MS), we demonstrate that the vast majority of patients (â¥94%), possibly all, require genetic susceptibility in order to get MS. Nevertheless, only a tiny fraction of the population (â¤2.2%) is actually susceptible to getting this disease; a finding which is highly consistent in all of the studied populations across both North America and Europe. Men are more likely to be susceptible than women although susceptible women are more than twice as likely to actually develop MS compared to susceptible men (i.e., they have a greater disease penetrance). This is because women are more responsive to the environmental factors involved in MS pathogenesis than men. These differences account for the current gender-ratio (3â¶1, favoring women) and also for the increasing incidence of MS in women around the world. By contrast, the most important genetic marker for MS susceptibility (DRB1*1501) influences the likelihood of susceptibility but not the penetrance of the disease. Nevertheless, even for this major susceptibility allele, only a very small fraction of DRB1*1501carriers (<5%) are susceptible to getting MS and for only a minority of MS patients (â¼41%) does this allele contribute to their susceptibility. Moreover, each copy of this allele seems to make an independent contribution to susceptibility. Finally, at least three environmental events are necessary for MS pathogenesis and, during the course of their lives, the large majority of the population (â¥69%) experiences an environmental exposure, which is sufficient to produce MS in, at least, some susceptible genotypes. Also, susceptible men (compared to susceptible women) have a lower threshold, a greater hazard-rate, or both in response to the environmental factors involved in MS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1987867518,"The dissolution of CaCO(3) is one of the ways ocean acidification can, potentially, greatly affect the ballast of aggregates. A diminution of the ballast could reduce the settling speed of aggregates, resulting in a change in the carbon flux to the deep sea. This would mean lower amounts of more refractory organic matter reaching the ocean floor. This work aimed to determine the effect of ocean acidification on the ballast of sinking surface aggregates. Our hypothesis was that the decrease of pH will increase the dissolution of particulate inorganic carbon ballasting the aggregates, consequently reducing their settling velocity and increasing their residence time in the upper twilight zone. Using a new methodology for simulation of aggregate settling, our results suggest that future pCO(2) conditions can significantly change the ballast composition of sinking aggregates. The change in aggregate composition had an effect on the size distribution of the aggregates, with a shift to smaller aggregates. A change also occurred in the settling velocity of the particles, which would lead to a higher residence time in the water column, where they could be continuously degraded. In the environment, such an effect would result in a reduction of the carbon flux to the deep-sea. This reduction would impact those benthic communities, which rely on the vertical flow of carbon as primary source of energy."

However it remains an unresolved challenge to detect their active forms in biological samples. To prove the efficacy of a recently developed MMP activity-based probe, we examined the content in MMP active forms of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALf) from male C57BL/6 mice exposed to ultrafine carbon black nanoparticles, a model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This probe was shown to label proteins, mostly expressed in BALf of mice exposed to nanoparticles.

https://openalex.org/W2022182490,"Clinical guidelines do not recommend maintenance tocolysis for the management of preterm labour. The French national survey EVAPRIMA revealed it was administered to more than 50% of women hospitalised for preterm labour. Our aim was to identify the individual and organisational determinants associated with maintenance tocolysis.The study was a secondary analysis of the prospective population-based EVAPRIMA study database. Population study included every women hospitalised for preterm labour and at risk of receiving maintenance tocolysis, over a one month period, in 99 randomly selected French maternity units. Main outcome was the prescription of maintenance tocolysis. The association between maintenance tocolysis and individual (maternal or obstetrical) and organisational determinants were evaluated with multilevel analysis.Of the 531 women included, 68.9% (95% CI 0.65-0.73) received maintenance tocolysis. The only individual factor associated with maintenance tocolysis was gestational age at admission; the rate of maintenance tocolysis was higher among women hospitalised before 32 weeks of gestation. The significantly different rates between maternity units demonstrated the existence of a maternity unit effect. Maintenance tocolysis was also associated with organisational determinants and was more frequent in level 1 (ORa = 6.54[2.21-19.40]) and level 2 maternity units (ORa = 3.68[1.28-10.59]), in units with less than 1500 deliveries/year (ORa = 5.27[4.43-19.44]), and in specific areas of France.A maternity unit effect, explained partly by the organisational characteristics of the units, plays a major role in the practice of maintenance tocolysis. Widespread dissemination of these results might improve adherence to clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2008241458,"Individual-level immunization data captured electronically can facilitate evidence-based decision-making and planning. Populating individual-level records through manual data entry is time-consuming. An alternative is to use scannable forms, completed at the point of vaccination and subsequently scanned and exported to a database or registry. To explore the suitability of this approach for collecting immunization data, we conducted a feasibility study in two settings in Ontario, Canada.Prior to the 2011-2012 influenza vaccination campaign, we developed a scannable form template and a corresponding database that captured required demographic and clinical data elements. We examined efficiency, data quality, and usability through time observations, record audits, staff interviews, and client surveys. The mean time required to scan and verify forms (62.3 s) was significantly shorter than manual data entry (69.5 s) in one organization, whereas there was no difference (36.6 s vs. 35.4 s) in a second organization. Record audits revealed no differences in data quality between records populated by scanning versus manual data entry. Data processing personnel and immunized clients found the processes involved to be straightforward, while nurses and managers had mixed perceptions regarding the ease and merit of using scannable forms. Printing quality and other factors rendered some forms unscannable, necessitating manual entry.Scannable forms can facilitate efficient data entry, but certain features of the forms, as well as the workflow and infrastructure into which they are incorporated, should be evaluated and adapted if scannable forms are to be a meaningful alternative to manual data entry."
https://openalex.org/W2147116054,"Context Zinc-Î±2-Glycoprotein (ZAG) is an adipokine with lipolytic action and is positively associated with adiponectin in adipose tissue. We hypothesize that ZAG may be related with hydrocarbonate metabolism disturbances observed in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Objective The aim of this study was to analyze serum ZAG concentration and its relationship with carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women and its influence on fetal growth. Design 207 pregnant women (130 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 77 with GDM) recruited in the early third trimester and their offspring were studied. Cord blood was obtained at delivery and neonatal anthropometry was assessed in the first 48 hours. ZAG was determined in maternal serum and cord blood. Results ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood than in maternal serum, but similar concentration was observed in NGT and GDM pregnant women. Also similar levels were found between offspring of NGT and GDM women. In the bivariate analysis, maternal ZAG (mZAG) was positively correlated with adiponectin and HDL cholesterol, and negatively correlated with insulin and triglyceride concentrations, and HOMA index. On the other hand, cord blood ZAG (cbZAG) was positively correlated with fat-free mass, birth weight and gestational age at delivery. After adjusting for confounding variables, gestational age at delivery and HDL cholesterol emerged as the sole determinants of cord blood ZAG and maternal ZAG concentrations, respectively. Conclusion mZAG was not associated with glucose metabolism during pregnancy. ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood compared with maternal serum. cbZAG was independently correlated with gestational age at delivery, suggesting a role during the accelerated fetal growth during latter pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2043925771,"During early demersal ontogeny, many marine fishes display complex habitat-use patterns. Grunts of the speciose genus Haemulon are among the most abundant fishes on western North Atlantic coral reefs, with most species settling to shallow habitats (â¤12 m). To gain understanding into cross-shelf distributional patterns exhibited by newly settled stages of grunts (<2 cm total length), we examined: 1) depth-specific distributions of congeners at settlement among sites at 8 m, 12 m, and 21 m, and 2) depth-variable predation pressure on newly settled individuals (species pooled). Of the six species identified from collections of newly settled specimens (n = 2125), Haemulon aurolineatum (tomtate), H. flavolineatum (French grunt), and H. striatum (striped grunt) comprised 98% of the total abundance; with the first two species present at all sites. Prevalence of H. aurolineatum and H. flavolineatum decreased substantially from the 8-m site to the two deeper sites. In contrast, H. striatum was absent from the 8-m site and exhibited its highest frequency at the 21-m site. Comparison of newly settled grunt delta density for all species on caged (predator exclusion) and control artificial reefs at the shallowest site (8-m) revealed no difference, while the 12-m and 21-m sites exhibited significantly greater delta densities on the caged treatment. This result, along with significantly higher abundances of co-occurring piscivorous fishes at the deeper sites, indicated lower predation pressure at the 8-m site. This study suggests habitat-use patterns of newly settled stages of some coral reef fishes that undergo ontogenetic shifts are a function of depth-variable predation pressure while, for at least one deeper-water species, proximity to adult habitat appears to be an important factor affecting settlement distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2104776061,"A multi-interface domain is a domain that can shape multiple and distinctive binding sites to contact with many other domains, forming a hub in domain-domain interaction networks. The functions played by the multiple interfaces are usually different, but there is no strict bijection between the functions and interfaces as some subsets of the interfaces play the same function. This work applies graph theory and algorithms to discover fingerprints for the multiple interfaces of a domain and to establish associations between the interfaces and functions, based on a huge set of multi-interface proteins from PDB. We found that about 40% of proteins have the multi-interface property, however the involved multi-interface domains account for only a tiny fraction (1.8%) of the total number of domains. The interfaces of these domains are distinguishable in terms of their fingerprints, indicating the functional specificity of the multiple interfaces in a domain. Furthermore, we observed that both cooperative and distinctive structural patterns, which will be useful for protein engineering, exist in the multiple interfaces of a domain."
https://openalex.org/W2019976261,"Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play broad biological roles in plants. We report on a conserved receptor-like protein kinase (RPK) gene from wheat and other Triticeae species. The TaRPK1 was isolated from the Triticum aestivum cv. Prins - Triticum timopheevii introgression line IGVI-465 carrying the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm6. The TaRPK1 was mapped to homoeologous chromosomes 2A (TaRPK1-2A), 2D (TaRPK1-2D) and the Pm6-carrier chromosome 2G (TaRPK1-2G) of IGVI-465. Under the tested conditions, only the TaRPK1-2G allele was actively transcribed, producing two distinct transcripts via alternative splicing. The predicted 424-amino acid protein of TaRPK1-2G contained a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain, but lacked a typical extracellular domain. The expression of TaRPK1-2G gene was up-regulated upon the infection by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt) and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but down-regulated in response to treatments of SA and ABA. Over-expression of TaRPK1-2G in the powdery mildew susceptible wheat variety Prins by a transient expression assay showed that it slightly reduced the haustorium index of the infected Bgt. These data indicated that TaRPK1-2G participated in the defense response to Bgt infection and in the JA signaling pathway. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaRPK1-2G was highly conserved among plant species, and the amino acid sequence similarity of TaRPK1-2G among grass species was more than 86%. Based on its conservation, the RPK gene-based STS primers were designed, and used to amplify the RPK orthologs from the homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of all the tested Triticeae species, such as chromosome 2G of T. timopheevii, 2R of Secale cereale, 2H of Hordeum vulgare, 2S of Aegilops speltoides, 2Sl of Ae. longissima, 2Mg of Ae. geniculata, 2Sp and 2Up of Ae. peregrina. The developed STS markers serve as conserved functional markers for the identification of homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of the Triticeae species."
