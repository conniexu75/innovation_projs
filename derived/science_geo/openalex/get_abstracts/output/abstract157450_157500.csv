https://openalex.org/W3103786587,"In a cell or microorganism, the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer and cell-fate specification are seamlessly integrated through a complex network of cellular constituents and reactions1. However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems2. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks2,3,4,5, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents."

We and others have shown that serum response factor (SRF) contributes to SMC-specific gene transcription, and because the small GTPase RhoA has been shown to regulate SRF, the goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that RhoA signaling is a critical mechanism for regulating SMC differentiation. Coexpression of constitutively active RhoA in rat aortic SMC cultures significantly increased the activity of the SMC-specific promoters, SM22 and SM α-actin, whereas coexpression of C3 transferase abolished the activity of these promoters. Inhibition of either stress fiber formation with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μm) or actin polymerization with latrunculin B (0.5 μm) significantly decreased the activity of SM22 and SM α-actin promoters. In contrast, increasing actin polymerization with jasplakinolide (0.5 μm) increased SM22 and SM α-actin promoter activity by 22-fold and 13-fold, respectively. The above interventions had little or no effect on the transcription of an SRF-dependent c-fos promoter or on a minimal thymidine kinase promoter that is not SRF-dependent. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that in SMC, RhoA-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton selectively regulates SMC differentiation marker gene expression by modulating SRF-dependent transcription. The results also suggest that RhoA signaling may serve as a convergence point for the multiple signaling pathways that regulate SMC differentiation.

Gabbiani G. Reidy M.A. Cokay M.S. Peters H. Huttner I. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 459-470PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that SMC do not terminally differentiate and that SMC phenotype is regulated by a complex array of local environmental cues including humoral factors, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, inflammatory stimuli, and mechanical stresses (reviewed in Refs. 4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar and5Owens G.K. Wise G. Agents Actions Suppl. 1997; 48: 3-24PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these diverse signals regulate SMC phenotype and the transcription mechanisms that ultimately regulate SMC differentiation are largely unknown. It is clear though that the identification of the signaling and transcription pathways that control SMC-specific gene expression will be an important step toward our understanding of blood vessel development and the role played by SMC during the development of cardiovascular disease. To date, no transcription factors have been identified that specify SMC lineage or by themselves can explain SMC-specific gene expression. However, serum response factor (SRF), a MADS box transcription factor, has been shown to contribute to the regulation of most SMC differentiation marker genes and may be a key transcriptional regulator of SMC differentiation (6Mack C.P.

Interestingly, CArG cis-elements (CC(A/T)6GG) that bind SRF are present in the promoters of virtually all of the SMC-specific marker genes including SM α-actin, SM myosin heavy chain, SM22, h-caldesmon, calponin, and telokin. The CArGs within any given SMC-specific promoter are highly conserved among species and have been shown to be required for the high level of activity that these promoters exhibit in SMC cultures (7Madsen C.S.

Results from transgenic studies demonstrate that CArG elements within the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters were also required for the expression of these genes in vivo (8Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev.

Indeed, we have shown that interactions among multiple CArG elements are important for the in vivo expression of SM α-actin and that a CArG element within the SM α-actin first intron functions as a SMC-specific enhancer-like element (10Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because SRF is ubiquitously expressed, the mechanisms whereby it contributes to SMC differentiation are somewhat unclear. However, evidence suggests that other factors including additional cis- and trans-regulatory elements may mediate cell-type-specific regulation by SRF (6Mack C.P. Thompson M.M. Lawrenz-Smith S.

Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The CArG motif was first identified as the core sequence of the serum response element (SRE) within early response genes such as c-fos, and much of what is known regarding the signaling pathways that regulate SRF-dependent transcription resulted from studies on the c-fos promoter (reviewed in Ref. 23Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). During serum- or growth factor-mediated stimulation, SRF forms an initiation complex with a protein from the ternary complex factor family whose members (Elk-1, SAP-1, and Net/Erp) are regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation (24Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The ternary complex is stabilized by protein interactions between SRF and the ternary complex factor and by interactions between the ternary complex factor and the Ets cis-element that flanks the SRE CArG (27Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that SRF-dependent transcription is also regulated by the small GTP-binding protein RhoA, which is required for serum-induced c-fos expression, and may be important for regulating CArG-dependent genes in the skeletal muscle as well (28Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The effects of RhoA on SRF-dependent transcription are not dependent upon the presence of an Ets domain or on the known SRF accessory proteins suggesting that RhoA activates SRF-dependent transcription in a ternary complex-independent manner. Importantly, the CArG elements within the SMC-specific promoters are not flanked by a consensus Ets domain and do not appear to be regulated by an Ets-dependent mechanism. Recently, Sotiropoulos et al. (32Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) have shown that in NIH 3T3 cells, the effects of RhoA on SRF-mediated transcription may be secondary to the actions of RhoA on the actin cytoskeleton. These results are of particular importance because they are the first to suggest that SRF-dependent transcription is positively regulated through increases in actin polymerization. The exact mechanisms for SRF activation remain to be identified, and the significance of these findings in regard to the expression of SRF-dependent gene targets is unclear because an artificial c-fos promoter (lacking a consensus Ets domain) was used as the primary measure of Rho-dependent SRF activation. In the present studies, we extend the observations of Sotiropoulos et al. (32Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) by demonstrating in SMC that multiple SMC-specific promoters are regulated via RhoA-dependent changes in actin dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that these RhoA-induced changes are at least partially mediated by Rho kinase. Because virtually all of the SMC-specific promoters identified to date are regulated by SRF, these results suggest that RhoA signaling regulates SMC phenotype. Moreover, because many of the environmental factors that regulate SMC phenotype have also been shown to activate RhoA, these results also suggest that RhoA may help to integrate multiple environmental signals that regulate SMC differentiation. SMC from rat thoracic aorta were isolated, cultured, and transfected as described previously (33Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C. Thompson M.M. Takeyasu K. Schwartz R.J. Owens G.K. J. Biol.

In short, cells were maintained in 10% serum and were transfected 24 h after plating at 70–80% confluency with 2 μg of reporter plasmid DNA, using the transfection reagent Superfect (Qiagen) as per protocol. The SM22 promoter (from −450 to +88), the SM α-actin promoters (p2600Int, from −2560 to +2784, and p125, from −125 to +44), and the c-fos promoter (from −356 to +109) that were used in this study have been described previously (8Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev.

Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Coexpression experiments were carried out by including 0.25 μg of the following expression constructs: empty Prk5 vector; Prk5 containing constitutively active RhoA (L63), Cdc42 (L61), or Rac (L61); or Prk5 containing C3 transferase (expression plasmids were a generous gift from Alan Hall, University College, London, United Kingdom). Cells expressing C3 were maintained in 10% serum, whereas cells expressing the small G proteins were maintained in defined serum-free medium. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared for the measurement of CAT activity using standard methods (34Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The CAT activity of each sample was normalized to the protein concentration of each cell lysate as measured by the Bradford assay. A promoterless CAT construct was also transfected to serve as a base-line indicator of CAT activity, and the activity of each promoter construct was expressed relative to promoterless activity. Additionally, an SV40 promoter-CAT construct with enhancer (Promega) served as a positive control of transfection and CAT activity. All CAT activities represent at least three independent experiments with each construct tested in triplicate per experiment. Relative CAT activity data are expressed as the means ± S.D. computed from the results obtained from each set of transfection experiments. We did not cotransfect a viral promoter/LacZ construct as a control for transfection efficiency because we have previously shown that such constructs exhibit unknown and variable squelching effects on the SM-specific promoters, presumably due to competition for common transcription factors (34Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that the inclusion of such controls is unnecessary in that variations in transfection efficiency among independent experimental samples are routinely very small (<10%) (34Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Latrunculin B and cytochalasin D were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Jasplakinolide was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Y-27632 was a generous gift from Akiko Yoshimura (Welfide Corporation, Osaka, Japan). Before drug treatment, SMC were transfected with SMC-specific and c-fos reporter constructs as described above. Immediately after the removal of the Superfect transfection reagent, cells were treated with either latrunculin B (0.5 μm), jasplakinolide (0.5 μm), cytochalasin D (2.0 μm), Y-27632 (10 μm), or vehicle. SMC treated with latrunculin B or Y-27632 were maintained in 10% serum, and those treated with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D were maintained in defined serum-free medium. After 12 h, cells were harvested, and reporter assays were performed as described above. Drug-induced effects on actin polymerization were measured in parallel experiments for all groups. At 0, 5, 10, and 24 h after drug treatment, cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with FITC-phalloidin, and visualized with a fluorescent microscope. SMC transfected with a constitutively active Myc-tagged L63 RhoA were immunostained with an anti-c-Myc antibody and counterstained with FITC-phalloidin. Control- or Y-27632-treated SMC were maintained in minimal methionine medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12 h. Cells were then switched to fresh medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and were incubated for an additional 12 h. Cells were then rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in loading buffer. Equal amounts of DNA were loaded onto tube gels, and actin isoforms were visualized by standard two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (36Blank R.S. Owens G.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Multiple labeling experiments were performed, and three separate gels were run for each treatment group per experiment. The ratio of radiolabeled SM α-actin to nonmuscle β-actin was determined by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA). Current evidence suggests that signaling through RhoA is required for SRE-dependent c-fos expression and regulates several CArG-containing genes in the skeletal muscle (28Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 30Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Balasubramanyam A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether RhoA was important for CArG-dependent SMC-specific gene regulation, we cotransfected CAT reporter constructs driven by the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters into rat aortic SMC along with an expression vector containing C3 transferase, which specifically ADP-ribosylates and irreversibly inhibits RhoA. The SM22 promoter (from −450 to +88) and the SM α-actin promoter (from −2600 to +2754) used in these studies were shown to direct SMC-specific regulation of these genes in transgenic models (8Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Li L. Liu Z. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). C3 transferase expression completely abolished the activity of both promoters, indicating that RhoA activity is required for the expression of these constructs in SMC (Fig.1 A). To test the involvement of RhoA more directly, we also cotransfected a constitutively active RhoA (L63) into serum-starved SMC. L63 RhoA trans-activated the SM22 and the full-length SM α-actin promoters by 10-fold and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Constitutively active RhoA also dramatically increased the activity of a minimal SM α-actin promoter (−125 to +44) that is regulated by two CArG elements within this short promoter region but had no effect on the same construct that contained mutations to the CArG elements (data not shown). These results indicate that the effects of RhoA on SMC-specific gene expression were mediated by a CArG/SRF-dependent mechanism. Significantly, L63 RhoA had relatively modest effects on the activity of an Ets-containing SRE-dependent c-fospromoter in SMC. Because the Rho family members Cdc42 and Rac have also been shown to up-regulate the SRF activity of c-fos, we also tested whether the constitutively active forms of these proteins would regulate SMC differentiation marker gene expression. Although all three small GTPases slightly but significantly increased c-fospromoter activity (p < 0.01), SM α-actin promoter activity was not affected by constitutively active Rac and was slightly inhibited by constitutively active Cdc42 (Fig. 1 C). Sotiropoulos et al. (32Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) have suggested that RhoA activation regulates gene expression through its effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, to test the effects of RhoA activation on actin polymerization, we transfected a Myc-tagged L63 RhoA expression plasmid into SMC that were then stained for F-actin stress fibers with FITC-phalloidin. Fig. 2 B shows that untransfected SMC maintained in 10% serum had fairly well developed stress fibers (small arrows). However, SMC expressing L63 RhoA had dramatically increased actin stress fiber networks (large arrows), demonstrating that RhoA activation regulates stress fiber formation in SMC. Our results suggested that RhoA activation regulates both SMC-specific gene transcription and stress fiber formation in SMC. To test whether the effects of RhoA on SMC-specific promoter activity were mediated by its effects on actin dynamics, we treated SMC with latrunculin B, a toxin that disrupts actin polymerization. Latrunculin B treatment (0.5 μm) of SMC in 10% serum disrupted stress fiber formation for up to 12 h (Fig. 3 A). After this time, actin polymerization gradually returned, and by 24 h SMC treated with latrunculin B were virtually indistinguishable from untreated cells. In addition, latrunculin B also had little effect on total cellular protein, which indicated that this drug was not overtly cytotoxic under these conditions. Latrunculin B did not affect c-fos promoter activity but dramatically attenuated the activities of the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, latrunculin B also inhibited trans-activation of the SM α-actin promoter by L63 RhoA as well as L63 RhoA-induced stress fiber formation. The results presented in Fig. 3 suggest that RhoA activation induces SMC-specific gene expression by increasing actin polymerization. Therefore, to further test whether SM α-actin transcription was sensitive to actin dynamics, we treated SMC with jasplakinolide, a toxin known to increase actin polymerization (37Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). SMC treated with 0.5 μm jasplakinolide and labeled with FITC-phalloidin had very disorganized actin structures and contained large amorphous actin aggregates (data not shown). These effects are consistent with the known actions of this toxin, which severs F-actin, creating new nucleation sites that support actin polymerization (37Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide increased SM22 and SM α-actin promoter activities by 22-fold and 14-fold, respectively, but increased c-fos promoter activity by only 3-fold. Cytochalasin D had similar effects increasing the activities of the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters but having no effect on the c-fos promoter. The fact that cytochalasin D (which disrupts actin polymerization) increased SMC-specific promoter activity suggests that cytochalasin-induced SRF activity is not directly regulated by increased actin polymerization per se and that additional mechanisms that sense actin dynamics in SMC may be involved in regulating SMC-specific transcription. Interestingly, Sotiropoulos et al. (32Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R.

To determine whether the effects of cytochalasin D were independent of those mediated by RhoA, we treated SMC transfected with L63 RhoA with cytochalasin D. The treatment of SMC with cytochalasin D prevented both the L63 RhoA-induced increase in differentiation marker gene expression (Fig. 4 B) and L63 RhoA-induced stress fiber formation (data not shown). It is well known that RhoA-dependent activation of Rho kinase induces actin polymerization and stress fiber formation in many cell types (reviewed in Ref. 38Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the activity of Rho kinase correlates with the effects of RhoA on the transcription of c-fos (39Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa Y. Motley E.D. Ichihara S. Inagami T.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25121-25127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that in SMC, the SMC-specific promoters were significantly more sensitive than the c-fos promoter was to activation by RhoA signaling. Therefore, to test whether SMC-specific transcription was regulated through the activation of Rho kinase, we treated SMC with the highly specific Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (43Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). The micrograph in Fig. 5 Ashows that 10 μm Y-27632 significantly inhibited stress fiber formation in SMC and also led to the appearance of long thin cellular extensions. Y-27632 also reduced the activity of transiently transfected SMC-specific promoters by 50–60% (Fig. 5 B), although it had little effect on the c-fos promoter or on the minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter that does not contain CArG elements. Fig. 5 C is an autoradiograph from a representative two-dimensional gel that illustrates the effects of Y-27632 on the expression of endogenous actin isoforms. Interestingly, the results showed that all of these CArG-containing actin genes were down-regulated to some extent. However, the synthesis of the SM-specific α-actin isoform was inhibited to a greater extent than the ubiquitously expressed β-actin isoform (α:β synthesis ratios were reduced by greater than 40% in Y-27632-treated SMC,p < 0.01). Taken together, these results suggest that Rho kinase plays an important role in the regulation of SMC differentiation marker gene expression and that ubiquitously expressed CArG-dependent genes, such as c-fos and nonmuscle β-actin, may be less sensitive to this regulatory pathway. A major goal of our laboratory has been to elucidate control processes that regulate SMC differentiation by identifying the mechanisms that coordinately control the transcription of SMC differentiation marker genes. The focus of the present study was to investigate the role of RhoA signaling in the regulation of SMC-specific gene transcription. Because RhoA activates SRF, a transcription factor that has been shown to regulate virtually all of the SMC-specific marker genes identified to date (7Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9814-9822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RhoA signaling contributes to the coordinate regulation of SMC-specific gene expression. The data presented indicate that: 1) RhoA activation is important for the expression of several SMC-specific marker genes; 2) regulation of actin polymerization by RhoA (but not by Cdc42 or Rac) may be an important determinant of SMC-specific gene transcription; 3) RhoA-dependent regulation of SMC-specific gene transcription is mediated at least in part by Rho kinase; and 4) in SMC, the CArG-dependent SMC-specific genes (i.e. SM22, SM α-actin) and the CArG-dependent genes (i.e. c-fos, β-actin) that are ubiquitously expressed are differentially regulated by RhoA. Results presented in Fig. 1 provide strong evidence that RhoA activity is required for SMC-specific promoter activity because C3 transferase, which ADP-ribosylates and irreversibly inactivates RhoA, completely inhibited the activities of the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters. Constitutively active RhoA up-regulated several SMC-specific CArG-dependent genes, further indicating that RhoA activation is important for this response. RhoA activation has been shown to have similar effects on the SRF-dependent activity of several CArG-dependent skeletal muscle-specific genes (30Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R.

Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting that RhoA activation may be a common signaling pathway that regulates muscle-specific gene expression. In fact, RhoA also regulates SRF expression (probably through CArG elements within the SRF promoter) and may be part of an important positive feedback mechanism for maintaining high levels of SRF expression in all three muscle cell types (44Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 45Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16535-16543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although our results indicate that RhoA-dependent activation of SRF plays a major role in SMC-specific transcription, other mechanisms must be involved that distinguish SRF-dependent transcriptional regulation in SMC from SRF-dependent transcriptional regulation in the other muscle cell types. For example, it is well known that in cardiac and skeletal muscles, SRF interacts with other cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific factors, such as myoD, GATA-4, and Nkx2.5, to regulate cell-type-specific expression (22Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 46Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sepulveda J.L.

Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, factors that confer SMC-specific gene regulation have not been identified in SMC. We have recently provided evidence that an SRF-associated protein that is selectively expressed in SMC may contribute to SMC-specific gene regulation by SRF (6Mack C.P. Thompson M.M. Lawrenz-Smith S. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Several splice variants of SRF have also been described recently, but a detailed description of the expression patterns and activities of these variants has not been reported, which makes it difficult to determine whether alternative splicing of SRF contributes to cell-type-specific gene regulation (49Belaguli N.S. Zhou W. Trinh T.H. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 50Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 445-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results also indicate that multiple SMC-specific differentiation marker genes are regulated by RhoA-induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Constitutively active RhoA trans-activated the SM22 and SM α-actin promoters but had little effect on the CArG-containing c-fos promoter. Inhibiting actin polymerization with latrunculin B blocked trans-activation by constitutively active RhoA, which supports a model in which RhoA-mediated increases in F-actin promote SMC differentiation marker gene transcription. Our observation that jasplakinolide, an actin polymerizing agent, dramatically increased SMC-specific promoter activity is also consistent with such a model. The constitutively active forms of Cdc42 and Rac did not stimulate SMC-specific promoter activity, suggesting that actin polymerization at the cell periphery does not regulate SMC-specific transcription and suggests that separate pools of actin may differentially regulate SMC function. Our data also indicate that signaling through Rho kinase is significant, but because Y-27632 only inhibited promoter activity by 50–60%, we cannot rule out the involvement of other Rho effectors, such as PKN, citron kinase, rhotekin, and the diaphanous family of proteins. The precise mechanisms by which actin dynamics affect SRF-dependent transcription are currently unclear. Based in part on the observed effects of cytochalasin D, Sotiropoulos (32Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) has suggested a model whereby G-actin inhibits SRF directly or sequesters cofactors required for SRF activation. Our data indicate that cytochalasin D-induced activation of SRF-dependent SMC-specific transcription does not require an intact actin stress fiber network. However, we did show that the expression of constitutively active RhoA in cytochalasin D-treated SMC did not result in stress fiber formation or in an increase in SM α-actin promoter activity above that seen with cytochalasin D alone. These data indicate that in SMC these interventions probably converge at some level and that RhoA must affect actin polymerization to increase SMC marker gene transcription. There is some evidence to suggest that nuclear actin may regulate transcription by helping to modify chromatin structure (51Rungger D. Rungger-Brandle E. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Nature. 1979; 282: 320-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that G-actin shuttles through the nucleus (52Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and binds specifically to important nuclear proteins including the SWI·SNF complex (53Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M.C. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 54Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). It is also important to consider that the observed effects of RhoA activation (and of the cytoskeletal inhibitors) may be partially due to secondary changes in cell morphology that occur under these conditions. In addition, the pharmacological mechanisms of the cytoskeletal inhibitors used in this study are only partially understood, and undescribed side effects of these drugs may have affected SMC differentiation marker gene expression. The signal transduction pathways that regulate SMC differentiation are only partially understood, but results from the present studies suggest that RhoA activation may serve as a convergence point for multiple environmental factors known to regulate SMC-specific gene expression and differentiation. For example, integrin-matrix interactions, mechanical stretch, and contractile agonists, such as endothelin-1 and angiotensin II, are known to regulate SMC-specific gene expression as well as the activity of RhoA (40Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa Y. Motley E.D. Ichihara S. Inagami T. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ.

Commun. 1997; 232: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whether these environmental factors regulate SMC differentiation through RhoA-dependent signaling mechanisms and/or changes in actin dynamics will be an important area for future studies. RhoA activation is also required for growth factor-induced expression of c-fos, and recent evidence suggests that RhoA activation may mediate the growth response of SMC to angiotensin II, thrombin, and mechanical stretch (40Yamakawa T. Tanaka S. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa Y. Motley E.D. Ichihara S. Inagami T. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 313-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ.

The data presented in this manuscript, however, demonstrate that c-fos expression in SMC is not dramatically up-regulated by constitutively active RhoA or by drug-induced modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, indicating that the RhoA signaling pathways that regulate SMC differentiation marker gene expression diverge from those that regulate cell growth and proliferation. SMC proliferation and differentiation are not necessarily mutually exclusive (4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), and it will be very important to further clarify the specific signals that differentiate these two SRF-dependent pathways. Indeed, Seasholtz et al.(58Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Kaplan D.D. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) found that constitutively active RhoA only potentiated SMC proliferation in the presence of activated Ras, and results from Alberts et al. (28Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) indicate that additional signaling through the SAPK/JNK pathway may be important for the Rho-mediated regulation of c-fos. Integrin signaling also requires Rho activation (59Renshaw M.W. Toksoz D. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21691-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 60Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 61Barry S.T. Flinn H.M. Humphries M.J. Critchley D.R. Ridley A.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and it interesting to speculate that Rho and integrin pathways may converge (perhaps at the level of the actin cytoskeleton) to regulate SMC growth and/or differentiation. In summary, the data presented herein indicate that RhoA signaling plays a major role in the SRF-dependent regulation of SMC differentiation marker gene expression. Although the exact mechanisms involved in controlling the transcriptional activation of SRF are not completely clear, the activation of Rho kinase and RhoA-specific changes in actin polymerization seem to be involved. Interestingly, most SMC-specific differentiation marker genes identified to date code for contractile or contractile-associated proteins (4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Therefore, RhoA signaling may also help to determine SMC phenotype (and possibly the phenotype of other muscle cell types as well) by increasing contractile protein gene expression. Moreover, when coupled with extensive evidence that RhoA increases SMC contractility (43Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 62Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), our data suggest that short term regulation of SMC contractile force may be coupled to long term regulation of SMC contractile-associated gene expression by a RhoA-dependent mechanism. Finally, given the importance of SMC growth and differentiation during blood vessel development and cardiovascular pathophysiology, further studies to identify the mechanisms that regulate RhoA-dependent changes in SMC differentiation marker gene expression may provide novel insights regarding the mechanisms that contribute to the abnormal regulation of SMC differentiation characteristic of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

In cardiac myocytes, constitutively active c-Src inhibited endogenous interaction between connexin-43 and ZO-1 by binding to connexin-43. In HEK293 cells, by contrast, a connexin-43 mutant lacking the Src phosphorylation site (Tyr265) interacted with ZO-1 despite cotransfection of a constitutively active c-Src. Moreover, in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins synthesized from regions of connexin-43 and ZO-1 showed that the tyrosine-phosphorylated C terminus of connexin-43 interacts with the c-Src SH2 domain in parallel with the loss of its interaction with ZO-1. Cell surface biotinylation revealed that, by phosphorylating Tyr265, constitutively active c-Src reduces total and cell surface connexin-43 down to the levels seen in cells expressing a mutant connexin-43 lacking the ZO-1 binding domain. Finally, electrophysiological analysis showed that both the tyrosine phosphorylation site and the ZO-1-binding domain of connexin-43 were involved in the regulation of gap junctional function. We therefore conclude that c-Src regulates the interaction between connexin-43 and ZO-1 through tyrosine phosphorylation and through the binding of its SH2 domain to connexin-43.

The channels of gap junctions are permeable to small (<1 kDa) molecules, including such second messengers as Ca2+, inositol phosphates, and cyclic nucleotides, and in excitable tissues, such as cardiac myocytes and neurons, they permit rapid and synchronous propagation of action potentials. Gap junctions are assembled from connexins, specialized proteins encoded by a multigene family (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), and the principal member in cardiac myocytes is connexin-43 (Cx43).1 Communication through gap junctions is sensitive to a variety of physiological stimuli, including changes in the level of intracellular Ca2+ (3Rose B. Mehta P.P. Loewenstein W.R. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1073-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), pH (4Spray D.C. Biophys.

Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the finding that several protein kinases can influence junctional permeability (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor-induced activation of protein kinase C or mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK), which correlates with enhanced phosphorylation of Cx43 on serines within a region spanning amino acids 365–382 (6Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Moreno A.P. Spray D.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 163-198PubMed Google Scholar) or on Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 (7Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol.

Piwnica Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and possibly Tyr247 (10Lau A.F. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Warn Cramer B.J. Eckhart W. Lampe P.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), reduces junctional coupling. The phosphorylation of Tyr265 has been shown to be important for the binding of v-Src to Cx43, as has the second of two proline-rich putative SH3 binding domains in the C terminus of Cx43 (11Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Tyr265 may thus be the key element in the regulation of gap junctions, although recent studies indicate that this issue is still controversial. Zhou et al. (12Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) found that in oocytes v-Src phosphorylates Cx43 at Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 by activating MAPK and that eliminating the effect of MAPK blocked v-Src-mediated gap junctional closure. On the contrary, Postma et al. (13Postma F.R. Hengeveld T. Alblas J. Giepmans B.N. Zondag G.C. Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) found that c-Src, which is activated via G protein-coupled receptors in mammalian cells, closes gap junctions by phosphorylating Tyr265. The phosphorylation of gap junctional proteins appears to regulate channel function and the rates of channel assembly and turnover (14Brissette J.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Kwak B.R. van Veen T.A. Analbers L.J. Jongsma H.J. Exp.

In addition, channel assembly also appears to be regulated by the interaction of Cx43 and ZO-1 (17Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 18Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether c-Src-mediated closure of gap junctions is related to a change in the interaction of Cx43 and ZO-1. Indirect evidence supporting that hypothesis includes the observations that gap junctions in cardiomyopathic heart cells appear disparate rather than as dense particles as they do in normal cardiac myocytes (19Luque E.A. Veenstra R.D. Beyer E.C. Lemanski L.F. J. Morphol. 1994; 222: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which suggests improper incorporation of Cx43 into the gap junctional plaque in the cardiomyopathic heart, and that cardiomyopathic heart cells reduce gap junctional communication through c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 (20Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By using immunoprecipitation-immunoblot assays, we show here that constitutively active c-Src disrupts the interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1. Our electrophysiological analysis, moreover, confirms that the inhibitory effect of c-Src on gap junctional conductance is due in part to disruption of this interaction. This molecular mechanism may thus explain how Src kinase depresses gap junctional communication in the diseased heart. Mammalian expression vectors, pcDNA3 and pZeoSV, the expression in eukaryotic cells is under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, and Zeocin were obtained from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA). Expression vector pPET28a,Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS, and a His-bind column were from Novagen (Madison, WI). G418 was from Sigma.

A purified c-Src was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). cDNAs encoding the full-length of Cx43, wild-type c-Src (c-Src), and constitutively active c-Src (c-Src(Y527F)) have been described previously (18Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K.

Res. 1999; 85: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other mutant forms of Cx43 and c-Src were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis (18Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). After verifying the nucleotide sequences, the respective mutated fragments were ligated into their original positions in the cDNA. The Cx43 mutants included the following: Cx43(Y265F), containing a Tyr265 to Phe substitution; Cx43(S255/279/282F), containing Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 to Phe substitutions; Cx43(P277/280/283/284A), containing Pro277, Pro280, Pro283, and Pro284 to Ala substitutions; Cx43(Δ303–382), lacking amino acids 303–382; and Cx43(L380S/I382V), containing Leu380 to Ser and Ile382 to Val substitutions. c-Src mutants included the following: c-Src(Y527F), containing a Tyr527 to Phe substitution; c-Src(Δ83–142), lacking amino acids 83–142; c-Src(Δ143–245), lacking amino acids 143–245; and c-Src(K295M), containing a Lys295 to Met substitution. For transfection, the full-length cDNAs encoding Cx43 and c-Src, respectively, were ligated into the EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 and pZeoSV expression vectors. cDNA encoding Cx43-C, the C-terminal domain of Cx43 (amino acid residues 227–382), was synthesized by PCR. The amplified fragment was excised with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated, in-frame, into a PET28a vector, after which the resultant vector encoding fusion proteins carrying His tag and T7 tag at the N terminus was transfected into E. coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:10, incubated for 2 h, and then induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Expressed proteins carrying His tag and T7 tag epitopes in the region of the N terminus were affinity-purified on His-Bind columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. ZO-P2, the PDZ2 domain of ZO-1 (amino residues 150–312), and c-Src-SH2, the SH2 domain of c-Src (amino residues 143–245), were synthesized by PCR. They were excised using EcoRI and ligated, in-frame, into pGEX-3X vector and encoded a fusion protein carrying GST at the N terminus. After expression in E. coli(DH5α), ZO-P2 and c-Src-SH2 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (22Meidell R.S. Sen A. Henderson S.A. Slahetka M.F. Chien K.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: H1076-H1084PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were isolated from 1-day-old HLA-Wistar rats. The ventricles were minced, and the cells were dispersed by digestion with 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C. The dispersed cells were resuspended in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine and pre-plated onto culture dishes for 30 min to remove fibroblasts. The cells were then plated at an initial density of 105 cells/ml and maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. HEK293 cells were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin at 37 °C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, 95% air. For stable expression of Cx43 mutants and c-Src constructs, stable cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutant Cx43s were established by transfecting HEK293 cells with the pcDNA3 vector containing Cx43 cDNA and subsequently selected with 800 μg/ml G418 (20Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Clones expressing Cx43 constructs were then transfected with pZeoSV vectors containing c-Src or c-Src(Y527F) cDNAs, after which the transfectants were grown for selection in DMEM containing 250 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml G418. Clone selected with Zeocin and G418 were then subjected to Northern blot and immunoblot analyses. For transient expression of c-Src constructs in cardiac myocytes, the cells were cotransfected with vectors Cx43 cDNA and the cDNA for either c-Src or c-Src(Y527F), respectively, by electroporation using a Gene Pulser Transfection Apparatus (BioRad). Cardiac myocytes or HEK293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were solubilized in SDS loading buffer, after which samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were then incubated with primary Ab against the target protein, washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with peroxidase-labeled affinity purified Ab against the primary Abs, washed again, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL). By repeated concentration and re-dilution in a Centriprep 30 microconcentrator, lysates prepared from cardiac ventricles were equilibrated against phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl). The protein was then incubated for 4 h at 30 °C in the presence of 2 units of molecular biology grade calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Control reactions were run after the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm PO4) to the reaction mixture. By repeated concentration and redilution in a Centriprep 30 microconcentrator, lysates prepared from cardiac myocytes or HEK293 cells were equilibrated against immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were then incubated with 0.1% albumin-coated protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated in a rotating vessel for 2 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose. The resultant immunoprecipitates were then extensively washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, and samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a primary Ab against the target protein. Primary Ab-antigen complexes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab against mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies and visualized using ECL. For the metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation assay of cell surface Cx43, cells were first starved in methionine-free minimum essential medium for 45 min and then labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (specific activity >1180 Ci/mmol, ICN, UK) for 2 h at 37 °C. The labeling medium was then removed, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. During the chase period, normal growth medium supplemented with 5 mmmethionine (Sigma) was added to the cells. Biotinylation of the cell surface was conducted as described previously (16Lampe P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Briefly, metabolically labeled cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 500 μg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS. The reaction was terminated by rinsing the cells five times with 15 mm glycine, after which the cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and each extract was immunoprecipitated with ant-Cx43 Ab. After removing an aliquot for determination of whole-cell levels of Cx43, avidin-agarose was added to the neutralized supernatant for 1 h to precipitate the biotinylated proteins (Pierce), which were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Once dried, the gels were analyzed by autoradiography, or they were exposed to a PhotoImaging cassette (model 425E using ImageQuant version 4.2 software; Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) for several hours, after which the bands read with a PhosphorImager and quantified. T7-tagged Cx43 protein was purified on His-Bind columns, concentrated using an Amicon concentrator 10, and re-equilibrated to a concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. Samples containing 1 μg of purified protein were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 10 units of purified c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μmNa2VO4) also containing 1 mm ATP in a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction was stopped with addition of 10 volumes of binding buffer containing 100 μmNa2VO4 and then purified using a His-Bind column. The reaction was confirmed in a parallel experiment, in which purified Cx43 protein was incubated with purified c-Src in kinase buffer and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP. ZO-P2 proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were extensively washed, first with PBS and then with binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% bovine serum albumin, proteinase Inhibitor Complete), after which they were incubated in a rotating vessel with purified Cx43-C proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The molar ratio of Cx43-C to ZO-P2 was 1:10, a condition under which all of the Cx43-C was bound to ZO-P2. After incubation, the beads were extensively washed with binding buffer, which was collected as the glutathione-Sepharose-unbound fraction for later experimentation. Proteins associated with the beads (glutathione Sepharose-bound fraction) were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the glutathione-Sepharose-unbound fraction were purified on a His-Bind column, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-T7 IgG Ab. Primary Ab-antigen complexes were visualized using ECL and peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab against mouse IgG. In addition, T7-fused Cx43-C protein extracted from the glutathione-Sepharose-unbound fraction, to which ATP and c-Src had been added, were also immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 Ab; the immobilized complexes were then incubated with or without purified GST or GST-fused c-Src-SH2 proteins before immunoblotting. Gap junctional currents (I j ) were measured using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and a double whole-cell patch clamp procedure (23Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Neyton J. Trautmann A. Nature. 1985; 317: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C195-C205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells overexpressing mutant Cx43, with or without c-Src(Y527F), were obtained by freshly dissociating pure populations from confluent cultures and aliquoting them onto 1-cm diameter glass coverslips. At 12–36 h after splitting, coverslips with attached cells were mounted in a chamber, which was placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope, and the cells were continuously exchanged with the bath solution (133 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 16 mm glucose, 3.0 mm HEPES at pH 7.2) at the rate of 5 ml/min. For each cell of the pair that was identified by phase-contrast microscopy, access to the cell interior was achieved by applying gentle suction to the rear of a fire-polished glass pipette (3–5 MΩ) filled with solution containing 10 nm free Ca2+ (135 mm CsCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm HEPES at pH 7.2) and sealed to the cell membrane (seal resistance >1 GΩ). Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −40 mV, and voltage pulses (10 mV, 200–500 ms in duration) were alternately applied to each cell. Within each cell pair, I j was measured keeping constant the membrane potential in one cell and applying the voltage steps (V j ) to the other cell. Junctional conductances (G j ) were calculated from the equation,G j = I j /V j . The nonjunctional membrane resistance was usually on the order of 0.3–0.6 GΩ, which was more than 100-fold greater than the series resistance (2–5 MΩ). Consequently, the current flowing through the junction was approximately equal to the recorded current change (I j ). Since series resistance of the electrode was always less than 1% of the parallel sum of the seal resistance (>1 GΩ) and the nonjunctional membrane resistance (0.3–0.6 GΩ), we rarely used series resistance compensation in this study. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and unpaired Student's t tests as appropriate. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered significant. The kinase activity of c-Src is regulated by its phosphorylation state; activity is initiated by auto-phosphorylation of Tyr419 and terminated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr527 by Csk (27Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate its function, we synthesized a series of c-Src mutants with differing kinase activities (Fig.1 A). Constitutively active c-Src was created by substituting a Phe for Tyr527, which is not inactivated by Csk (c-Src(Y527F)), and nonfunctional c-Srcs were created by deleting the SH3 domain, which is required for substrate binding (c-Src(Δ83–142)) by deleting of SH2 domain, which is required signal transduction through binding to a phosphorylated target residue (c-Src(Δ143–245)), or by substituting an Met for Lys295, which is essential for the catalytic activity of c-Src (c-Src(K295M)). To determine the extent to which the aforementioned c-Src mutants alter the levels or the phosphorylation state of Cx43, cardiac myocytes were transfected with each clone, lysed, and immunoblotted with anti-Cx43 Ab. This analysis showed that the Cx43 band migrated as a doublet with a major band at 43–45 kDa (Fig. 1 B, left panel,P1 and P2, respectively) and a very faint band of 41 kDa (NP). Transfection with c-Src or c-Src(Y527F) did not alter the mobilities of Cx43. When protein samples were treated with alkaline phosphatase before immunoblotted with anti-Cx43 Ab, the 43–45-kDa forms collapsed into the 41-kDa form, indicating that the lower electrophoretic mobilities could be attributed to phosphorylation of the products. To obtain an indication as to whether c-Src-phosphorylated Cx43 on a Tyr residue, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-Tyr Ab linked to protein A-Sepharose beads, after which the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Cx43 Ab (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Anti-phospho-Tyr Ab was found to pull down an ∼45-kDa form of Cx43 from cardiac myocytes transfected with either c-Src or c-Src(Y527F), the latter yielding a more intense band indicative of the higher kinase activity of the constitutively active mutant. In contrast, anti-phospho-Tyr Ab did not precipitate any form of Cx43 from cells transfected with the other c-Src mutants, indicating their lack of kinase activity (data not shown). We next transfected cardiac myocytes with mutant c-Src and carried out an immunoprecipitation-immunoblot analysis aimed at detecting any interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1. The transfectants were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and the soluble cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-ZO-1 Ab. The precipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-ZO-1, anti-Cx43, or anti-c-Src Ab (Fig.1 C). All of the samples yielded similar amounts of endogenous ZO-1 when precipitated with anti-ZO-1 Ab. Cx43 was precipitated by the anti-ZO-1 Ab in the absence of overexpressed c-Src, as has been observed previously (18Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Src or c-Src(Y527F) decreased the amount of precipitated Cx43, although overexpression of c-Src(Δ143–245), c-Src(Δ83–142), or c-Src(K295M) had no effect. Conversely, when the soluble cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cx43 Ab and the precipitates immunoblotted with anti-Cx43, anti-ZO-1, or anti-c-Src Ab, c-Src, and c-Src(Y527F) but not other c-Src mutants reduced the amount of associated ZO-1 in parallel with their increased binding to Cx43. c-Src(Y527F) induced a greater reduction in the interaction of Cx43 and ZO-1 than c-Src and was more extensively bound to Cx43, most likely due to its increased kinase activity (Fig. 1 B). It appears, therefore, that c-Src disrupts the interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1 by binding to Cx43. That c-Src(Δ143–245), c-Src(Δ83–142), and c-Src(K295M) lack the ability to phosphorylate Cx43 (data not shown) suggests the inhibitory effect of c-Src may be due to c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43. The v-Src regulatory sites in the C terminus of Cx43 are now known; Tyr265 is a direct target of v-Src (9Swenson K.I. Piwnica Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 are targets of v-Src-activated MAPK (7Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Eckhart W. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3779-3786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); and a proline-rich region (amino acids 274–284) is the site where the SH3 domain of v-Src binds (11Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). To determine which sites are involved in the regulatory effect of c-Src on the interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1, we synthesized a series of Cx43 mutants as follows: Cx43(Y265F), containing a Tyr265 to Phe substitution and lacking the Src kinase-targeted tyrosine phosphorylation site; Cx43(S255/279/282F), containing Ser255, Ser279, and Ser282 to Phe substitutions and lacking the MAPK-targeted serine phosphorylation sites; Cx43(P277/280/283/284A), containing Pro277, Pro280, Pro283, and Pro284 to Ala substitutions and lacking the SH3 domain necessary for binding to Src; Cx43(Δ303–382), lacking the ZO-1-binding site; and Cx43(L380S/I382V), containing Leu380 to Ser and Ile382 to Val substitutions and alteration of the C-terminal tetrapeptide from DLEI to ESXV, a PDZ domain consensus motif. HEK293 cells contain minimal amounts of Cx43 and show minimal junctional conductance (18Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 23Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol.

Therefore, to analyze the function of the Cx43 mutants, we used HEK293 cells to establish stable cell lines overexpressing respective Cx43 mutants, with or without c-Src(Y527F). Transfectant cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cx43 Ab, and the precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-ZO-1 or anti-c-Src Ab (Fig. 2 B).

https://openalex.org/W2073458757,"A major control element of the human c-myc oncogene is the nuclease-hypersensitive purine/pyrimidine-rich sequence. This double-stranded DNA fragment, corresponding to the 27-base pair segment in the nuclease-hypersensitive element of the c-myc promoter region, forms a stable Watson-Crick double helix under physiological conditions. However, this duplex DNA can be effectively converted to G-quadruplex DNA by a small molecular weight ligand. Both intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex forms can be induced by this ligand. Similar transitional changes are also observed with the duplex telomeric sequence from the Oxytricha species. These results provide additional support to the idea that G-quadruplex structures may play structural roles in vivo and also provide insight into novel methodologies for rational drug design. These structurally altered DNA elements might serve as regulatory signals in gene expression or in telomere dynamics and hence are promising targets for drug action."
https://openalex.org/W2048923264,"Serine proteases are involved in many processes in the nervous system and specific inhibitors tightly control their proteolytic activity. Thrombin is thought to play a role in tissue development and homeostasis. To date, protease nexin-1 is the only known endogenous protease inhibitor that specifically interferes with thrombotic activity and is expressed in the brain. In this study, we report the detection of a novel thrombin inhibitory activity in the brain of protease nexin-1(−/−) mice. Purification and subsequent analysis by tandem mass spectrometry identified this protein as the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP). We demonstrate that PEBP exerts inhibitory activity against several serine proteases including thrombin, neuropsin, and chymotrypsin, whereas trypsin, tissue type plasminogen activator, and elastase are not affected. Since PEBP does not share significant homology with other serine protease inhibitors, our results define it as the prototype of a novel class of serine protease inhibitors. PEBP immunoreactivity is found on the surface of Rat-1 fibroblast cells and although its sequence contains no secretion signal, PEBP-H6can be purified from the conditioned medium upon recombinant expression."

https://openalex.org/W1606891122,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposits of the 4-kDa amyloid β peptide (Aβ). The Aβ protein precursor (APP) is cleaved by β-secretase to generate a C-terminal fragment, CTFβ, which in turn is cleaved by γ-secretase to generate Aβ. Alternative cleavage of the APP by α-secretase at Aβ16/17 generates the C-terminal fragment, CTFα. In addition to Aβ, endoproteolytic cleavage of CTFα and CTFβ by γ-secretase should yield a C-terminal fragment of 57–59 residues (CTFγ). However, CTFγ has not yet been reported in either brain or cell lysates, presumably due to its instability in vivo. We detected the in vitro generation of Aβ as well as an ∼6-kDa fragment from guinea pig brain membranes. We have provided biochemical and pharmacological evidence that this 6-kDa fragment is the elusive CTFγ, and we describe an in vitro assay for γ-secretase activity. The fragment migrates with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 57-residue CTFγ fragment.

Consistent with reports that presenilins are the elusive γ-secretases, subcellular fractionation studies showed that presenilin-1, CTFα, and CTFβ are enriched in the CTFγ-generating fractions.

Furthermore, there is evidence that in typical late onset AD, as in FAD, there are genetic determinants that increase levels of Aβ42 (18Younkin S.G. Ertekin-Taner N. Younkin L.H. Hutton M. Graff-Radford N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 42PubMed Google Scholar). To generate Aβ, APP is sequentially cleaved by proteases referred to as β- and γ-secretase as described below. β-Secretase cleaves at the N-terminal end of the Aβ sequence, producing a secreted derivative, sAPPβ (19Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and the Aβ-bearing C-terminal fragment of 99 residues, CTFβ, which is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to release Aβ (2Sinha S. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11049-11053Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). An alternative activity, α-secretase, cleaves APP within Aβ (between residues 16 and 17) to the larger secreted derivative, sAPPα (20Anderson J.P. Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Sambamurti K. Lieberburg I. Robakis N.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 128: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J.

Qu X. Tabira T. Greenberg B. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Cleavage of CTFβ and CTFα by γ-secretase generates Aβ and a smaller fragment of 24–26 residues called P3, respectively (4Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In addition, γ-secretase cleavage should theoretically yield an ∼6-kDa fragment of 57–59 residues, CTFγ (Fig. 1). Although the focus of the field has been on Aβ, it is important to recognize that Aβ42 is naturally linked to CTFγ-57. Expression of CTFβ was shown to be toxic to neurons (23Yankner B.A. Dawes L. Fisher S. Villa-Komaroff L. Oster-Granite M.L. Neve R.L. Science. 1989; 245: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 24Berger-Sweeney J. McPhie D. Arters J.A. Greenan J. Oster-Granite M.L. Neve R.L. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1999; 66: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and more recently, it was suggested that the 31 C-terminal residues of APP are responsible for at least part of the toxicity (25Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ellerby L.M. Ye X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Since CTFγ can also serve as a precursor for this toxic 31-residue peptide, its production and turnover are important parameters that can influence the course of AD. The secretases that ultimately cleave APP to Aβ and CTFγ have been the subject of intense research as potential targets for the treatment of AD. A novel pepstatin A-insensitive aspartyl protease, BACE/Asp2, was recently identified as the β-secretase that cleaves at positions 1 and 11 of the Aβ sequence (26Lin X.L. Koelsch C. Wu S.L. Downs D.

In addition to BACE, thimet oligopeptidase, a metalloprotease, was shown to be involved in β-secretase activity in COS7 cells (30Koike H. Seki H. Kouchi Z. Ito M. Kinouchi T. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Suzuki K. Ishiura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We recently showed that GPI-anchored proteins play an important role in β-secretase activity (31Sambamurti K. Sevlever D. Koothan T. Refolo L.M. Pinnix I. Gandhi S. Onstead L. Younkin L. Prada C.M.

Recently, a family of disintegrin metalloproteases, the adamalysins such as tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme and ADAM 10, has been implicated in α-secretase cleavage of APP (32Arribas J.

However, tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme was shown to be specific for the phorbol ester-induced α-secretase activity (33Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J.

Although ADAM 10 appeared to be involved in both constitutive and inducible pathways, inhibition of this activity by a dominant-negative mutation indicated that it also plays a more important role in the inducible α-secretase pathway (34Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The final step in Aβ biogenesis is γ-secretase cleavage and is the activity responsible for generating CTFγ in vivo. This cleavage is particularly interesting as the scissile bond lies within the transmembrane domain (35Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5690-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Evin G. Cappai R. Li Q.X. Culvenor J.G. Small D.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14185-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since the discovery that a PS1 knockout mutant mouse was deficient in γ-secretase activity, the possibility was raised that PS1 and PS2 are the elusive γ-secretases (37De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). The finding that PS1 and PS2 show conserved and essential aspartate residues within their respective transmembrane domains led to the suggestion that they are unusual aspartyl proteases with active sites within or close to the membrane (38Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Recently, an in vitro assay for γ-secretase was described, and PS1 was found to be a part of the active protease (39Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). By using this assay, a biotinylated inhibitor was cross-linked to PS1 and PS2, showing that the presenilins are indeed the active subunits of γ-secretase (40Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Moore C.L. Tsai J.Y. Rahmati T. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar,41Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, the active enzyme was shown to be a large complex, presumably with many unidentified subunits, of which some may be also essential for γ-secretase activity. To understand this interesting cleavage event, it is important to tease out each component of the γ-secretase and examine its individual role in detail by a combination of biochemical and genetic methods. To address these issues, it is necessary to have a robust in vitroγ-secretase assay in both the membrane-associated and soluble states. To develop such an assay, we incubated membranes from guinea pig and cow brains as well as from cultured cells to look for production of Aβ and CTFγ. The CTFγ fragment was detected in all systems tested, but guinea pig brain was used because the entire APP sequence is known, and the sequence of Aβ is identical to human allowing the use of human-specific reagents for its analysis. After appropriate fractionation, we observed a consistent time-dependent generation of a putative CTFγ fragment from these membranes. In addition to describing a useful robust cell-free assay for γ-secretase, this study presents the initial characterization of CTFγ from brain membranes. All buffers and reagents were obtained from VWR Scientific, Sigma, Life Technologies, Inc., or Fisher Scientific unless otherwise stated. Guinea pig brain and cow brain were obtained from Cocalico Biologicals Inc. Fetal calf serum and newborn calf serum were obtained from HyClone. Bis-Tris precast gels, MES buffer concentrate, and molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen Corp. Maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), Supersignal West Pico substrate, the BCA protein assay kit, and Brij 35 were from Pierce.

Sevlever (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL) and Lahiri (Indiana University, IN). The anti-cross-reacting determinant (anti-CRD) antibody (Oxford Glycosciences) reacts with a neoepitope generated after the cleavage of GPI-anchored proteins by PI-PLC. Pf998, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the juxtamembrane cytoplasmic domain of APP (726–744 of APP770) and the synthetic C-terminal 57 residues of APP (CTFγ-57) were kind donations from Pfizer. CTFγ-57 includes 10 residues from the transmembrane domain and the entire 47-residue cytoplasmic domain of APP and corresponds to one of the predicted CTFγ fragments. The monoclonal antibodies BNT77, BA27, and BC05 utilized for the quantification of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were kind gifts of Dr. Nobu Suzuki and have been described previously (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T.

The rabbit antibody O443 was raised against a maleimide-activated KLH-conjugated synthetic peptide (CKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN) prepared at the Mayo Clinic Protein Core Facility, which corresponds to the C-terminal 20 residues of APP. The animal care, injections, and bleeds were carried out by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Animal approval number A3669-01), and the sera were characterized in our laboratory. The antibody detects less than 0.1 fmol (0.6 pg) of synthetic CTFγ by Western blot analysis. The anti-PS1 antibody was a copy of that reported by Duff et al. (45Duff K. Eckman C. Zehr C., Yu, X. Prada C.M. Perez-tur J. Hutton M. Buee L. Harigaya Y. Yager D. Morgan D. Gordon M.N. Holcomb L. Refolo L. Zenk B. Hardy J. Younkin S. Nature. 1996; 383: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and was prepared against a KLH-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 2–13 (CRKTELPAPLSYF). The LC99 construct in the pCEP4 vector consisting of the signal sequence of APP fused to its C-terminal 99 residues, starting at the Aβ sequence, was transfected into CHO cells (CHO C99) for use as a standard for CTFβ. Brains were minced and homogenized for 1 min on ice in 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Homogenates were sequentially fractionated by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 15 min to collect unbroken cells and nuclei (F1P), and the post-nuclear supernatant was spun at 10,000 × gfor 15 min (F2P) followed by 100,000 × g for 1 h (F3P). The supernatant (F3S) was discarded, and the three pellets were washed once in buffer A and resuspended in 200 μl/g initial brain weight of buffer B (50 mm HEPES buffer, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.0). For Aβ measurements, the F2P fraction was incubated in buffer B supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm PNT, and 1 mm thiorphan. The G9PLAP cell line was similarly prepared, except that the initial homogenate was directly centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to obtain a F2P pellet that included membranes from F1P as well. For most assays, fraction F2P was rehomogenized for 10 s and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. The reactions were stopped by chilling on ice, and the membranes were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min unless otherwise specified. Finally, the supernatants were analyzed for Aβ and the released C-terminal fragments of APP. To determine the pH optimum of fragment generation, aliquots of F2P were resuspended and incubated either in 50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0–6.5, buffer B, pH 7.0–7.5, or 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0–9.0. To make sure that the alternative buffers were not interfering with the assay, we also carried out the pH optimum analysis in buffer B adjusted to the various pH levels and essentially obtained the same results (data not shown). Step gradients were set up using 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, 35, 37.5, and 40% sucrose in buffer A containing 5 mm PNT in 7 layers of 0.6 ml each. The F2P obtained from 0.75 g of guinea pig brain was resuspended in buffer A containing 20% sucrose, overlaid onto the gradient, and centrifuged for 20 h at 48,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Eight fractions (0.6 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient and diluted 5-fold in buffer A. Membrane pellets were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and then resuspended in equal volumes of buffer B. The protein concentration peaked in fractions 5 and 8. Fractions 1 and 2 containing low levels of protein were pooled for further analysis. The fractions were incubated, and the supernatants were analyzed for the release of CTFγ as described earlier. The membrane pellets from the fractions were analyzed for the presence of marker proteins. Markers of the Golgi, syntaxin-6 (31 kDa), synaptic vesicles and synaptophysin (38 kDa), were readily identified by their size. The anti-CRD antibody detects multiple GPI-anchored proteins as broad patches of ∼38 and 62 kDa. The bands were considered as specific as they were only detected after PI-PLC treatment (data not shown). Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (46Sambamurti K. Shioi J. Anderson J.P. Pappolla M.A. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), except that Hammerstein grade casein (1%) in 25 mm Na2HPO4, 0.2m NaCl, pH 7.0 was used as a blocking agent for some of the antibodies, and Bis-Tris gels with the MES running buffer system was used for protein separation. Where relevant, scanned images were quantified using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For comparison of treatments between experiments, treated samples were compared with controls adjusted to 100%. Aβ was measured as reported earlier by a specific and sensitive sandwich ELISA using a monoclonal antibody BNT77 against Aβ11-28 for capture and horseradish peroxidase-labeled end-specific antibodies BA27 (Aβ40) or BC05 (Aβ42) for detection (12Suzuki N.

To assay for γ-secretase activity, guinea pig brains were homogenized and fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures” into F1P, F2P, and F3P and resuspended in equal volumes of buffer B. Since the yield of membranes from CHO cells was low, these membranes were only fractionated into 10,000 and 100,000 ×g pellets (F2P and F3P). Equal volumes of each fraction were incubated for 0 and 2 h at 37 °C, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove the membranes. Supernatants were examined by Western blotting with the O443 antibody raised against the C-terminal 20 residues of APP (Fig.1). Western blots detected a soluble C-terminal fragment of ∼6 kDa from the F1P and F2P of guinea pig brain and the F2P fraction of CHO cells, which increased considerably after 2 h at 37 °C (Fig.2 A). The fragment was not detected upon incubation of F3P (Fig. 2 A). For further characterization, we immunoprecipitated the supernatant obtained from the F2P fraction of guinea pig brain with Pf988, an antibody against the juxtamembrane domain of APP (residues 726–744; Fig. 1), and we analyzed the recovered APP C-terminal fragments by Western blotting with O443 as above. The capacity to immunoprecipitate the putative CTFγ with Pf998 shows that it includes epitopes from the juxtamembrane region on the cytoplasmic domain of APP (Fig.2 B). We also measured the levels of Aβ in the supernatant using a well characterized sandwich ELISA (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The data obtained from 10 independently processed brain samples in three experiments detected moderate levels of Aβ40 (62.3 ± 3.3 pm; Fig.3). Aβ42 was also detected at low levels of 5.4 ± 1 pm consistent with the in vivo findings that Aβ42 constitutes 5–10% of the secreted Aβ (12Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The increase in Aβ40 was highly significant (p= 4.7 × 10−12) but Aβ42 was not (p = 0.18), presumably due to the large variance in background levels (two-tailed t test). To determine the stability of CTFγ, the supernatant obtained after removal of membranes from the incubation mix was incubated further for 2 and 4 h in the absence of membranes. The CTFγ fragment was degraded by over 50% after 2 h and by over 90% after 4 h at 37 °C. Addition of PNT, a metalloprotease inhibitor, partially protected the fragment from degradation after 4 h (Fig.4). In addition, PNT increased the yield of the C-terminal fragment by over 2-fold, suggesting that one or more metalloproteases in the preparation degrade the fragment and/or the enzyme responsible for its generation (Fig. 4). Although several protease inhibitors including phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, E64, leupeptin, and ALLN were tested, protection was only seen by EDTA and PNT, making metalloproteases the only identified class important for degrading the released CTFγ in vitro (data not shown). The pH optimum of the observed γ-secretase activity was between pH 7 and pH 7.5, but activity was detected in a broad range from pH 5 to pH 9 (Fig. 5). This pH optimum is similar to that recently reported for γ-secretase activity using membranes purified from HeLa cells (39Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P.

Probably all CLC channels form homodimers, and some CLC proteins may also associate to heterodimers.

We generated concatemeric channels containing one subunit of ClC-0 together with one subunit of ClC-1 or ClC-2. They should display two different conductances if one monomer were sufficient to form one pore. Indeed, we found a 8-picosiemens (pS) conductance (corresponding to ClC-0) that was associated with either a 1.8-pS (ClC-1) or a 2.8-pS (ClC-2) conductance. These conductances retained their typical gating, but the slow gating of ClC-0 that affects both pores simultaneously was lost. ClC-2 and ClC-0 current components were modified by point mutations in the corresponding subunit. The ClC-2 single pore of the mixed dimer was compared with the pores in the ClC-2 homodimer and found to be unaltered. We conclude that each monomer individually forms a gated pore.

Structure-function studies have been undertaken for a number of structurally unrelated chloride channel classes, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (1Akabas M.H. Cheung M. Guinamard R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), ligand-gated anion channels (3Bormann J. Rundstrom N. Betz H. Langosch D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3729-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and CLC channels (4Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Sedimentation studies suggested that ClC-0 (5Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), ClC-1 (6Fahlke C. Knittle T. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a bacterial CLC protein (7Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) are dimers. For the bacterial CLC, this was confirmed by cross-linking experiments. In single-channel recordings, ClC-0 displays two conductance levels of equal magnitude. These gate independently, but are shut off together by a different, slow gating process. This led to the suggestion that ClC-0 is a “double-barreled” channel, which has two identical, largely independent pores (8Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This model was confirmed by studies in which only of the subunits in the homodimer was mutated (9Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These channels displayed single-channel conductances that were compatible with one wild-type pore and one mutated pore. The important question if each subunit individually forms a pore has also been addressed for ClC-0. Concatemers with two mutant subunits suggested that one subunit forms one pore (10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), although the presence of two mixed pores, formed by different parts of each subunit, could not be completely ruled out. However, the double-barreled structure of CLC channels has recently been questioned. The effect on whole cell-currents caused by the modification of cysteines in mutant ClC-1 channels led to the suggestion (11Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that the two subunits of ClC-1 form a single pore that includes the D3-D4 region from each subunit. In single-channel records, however, ClC-1 displays a double-pore behavior comparable to that of ClC-0 (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All CLC channels identified so far are homologous in the entire segment encompassing the 10–12 transmembrane domains. Hence, a common pore architecture must be assumed. This implies that either the “one-subunit/one-pore” model postulated for ClC-0 is valid for all members of this gene family, or it is valid for none of the channels, including ClC-0. To demonstrate the functional and structural separation of individual pores in a CLC channel dimer, we constructed concatemers of two CLC channel monomers, linked in a head-to-tail fashion. The expression of concatenated subunits rather than coexpression of the corresponding monomers offers the advantage that only a single type of dimer will be formed. This approach has been used in the past to demonstrate separate pores in the ClC-0 channel (9Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 789-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We now extend it to the study of concatemers composed of different CLC monomers, namely those of ClC-0, -1, and -2. Both ClC-1 and ClC-2 are highly homologous to ClC-0, with 54% and 49% identity at the amino acid level, respectively (14Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,15Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). ClC-1 and ClC-2, which share 55% of sequence identity (15Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), have already been shown to form functional mixed dimers with altered properties in coexpression experiments (16Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since ClC-0 has been studied extensively on the single-channel level (8Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Biophys.

Steinmeyer K. Schwarz J.R. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11052-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), its presence in the mixed channels may be demonstrated unambiguously by single-channel analysis. Only one study (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) showed single-channel recordings of ClC-1, and single ClC-2 channels have not yet been reported. In mixed concatemers of ClC-0, -1, and -2, we observed properties of both constituent pores in the macroscopic current. In single-channel recordings, we could clearly distinguish two different conductance levels that can be attributed to the pores of the constituent subunits. This demonstrates that one CLC subunit forms one pore, which retains most of its properties in a dimer irrespective of its partner. This is also the first time that single-channel traces of the ClC-2 pore are reported. To generate concatemeric channels, the stop codon of the N-terminal subunit was replaced with a PacI restriction site, which was then used to link it to the C-terminal subunit. The linker sequence consisted of four amino acids (L-I-K-A). Point mutations were introduced by recombinant PCR1 and verified by sequencing. Constructs were expressed in the pTLN vector (16Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro with the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 8–10 ng of cRNA were injected intoXenopus oocytes as described (19Ludewig U. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and measurements were performed 2–4 days after injection, with mock-injected oocytes as controls. Voltage-clamp measurements were performed using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp (Turbo Tec 01C, npi, Tamm, Germany) in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For inhibitor measurements, oocytes were continuously superfused with ND96 containing varying concentrations of 9-AC, up to the solubility limit, which was ∼4 mm at neutral pH. Voltage protocols were generated using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch clamp measurements were performed in the excised inside-out mode after manual removal of the vitellin envelope. Patch pipettes of 2–3-megohm resistance were made from aluminosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany), coated with Sylgard (General Electric, Waterford, NY), and filled with 100 mm NMG-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained 106 mm NMG-Cl, 2 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, resulting in a symmetrical chloride concentration of 110 mm. Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) using pClamp software, low pass-filtered at 1 or 4 kHz, and recorded on digital tape or on a hard disc, with acquisition rates of 2 and 10 kHz, respectively. For display purposes, single-channel data were digitally filtered at 330 Hz. To determine the IC50 values for 9-AC (Fig. 1 C), the following function was used. I/I0=(1−Imin)/(1+(c/IC50)n)+IminEquation 1 c denotes the inhibitor concentration andI min the current remaining at saturating inhibitor concentration. For the mixed concatemer with two inhibitor binding sites, the following function was fitted to the data.I/I0=(1−I1)/(1+(c/IC50/1)n1)+(I1−Imin)/(1+(c/IC50/2)n2)+IminEquation 2 I 1 is the current remaining at saturating inhibitor concentration for the high affinity binding site andI min the current remaining at saturating concentration for the low affinity binding site. Single-channel current amplitudes were calculated from Gaussian fits to all-points histograms. Mean open times were obtained from exponential fits to dwell-time histograms. Fitting was done using the Origin analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). To test whether different CLC subunits may associate to form mixed pores with novel characteristics, or whether one pore is formed exclusively by one subunit, we constructed mixed concatemers of two CLC monomers. For simplicity, we will describe our results in the framework of the one-subunit/one-pore model and evaluate alternative models in the discussion section. Using a four-amino acid linker sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”), ClC-0 and ClC-1 were linked in both possible orientations, i.e. ClC-1∼ClC-0 and ClC-0∼ClC-1. For comparison, homomeric concatemers of ClC-1 and of ClC-0 with the same linker sequence were constructed. All four concatemers could be expressed functionally in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.1 A). Apart from a reduced expression efficiency, no conspicuous differences were found between concatemeric and monomeric ClC-0, in accordance with previous studies of concatenated ClC-0 (10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 789-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which reported wild-type behavior for macroscopic and single-channel properties of the concatemer. This indicated that concatemerization per se did not alter channel properties. The current amplitudes for the different concatemers differed significantly at the peak of expression (3 days after RNA injection). The slope conductance at 0 mV of the 0∼0 concatemer (116 ± 23 μS) was about 4–5 times higher than for the 1∼1 concatemer (26 ± 6 μS), and the two mixed concatemers had conductances of 67 ± 21 μS in the 1∼0 and 159 ± 24 μS in the 0∼1 orientation (n = 10–21). Protein levels were not measured, so the differences in steady-state current amplitudes may be caused either by a different conductance or by differences in expression level. In general, however, current amplitudes increased with the number of ClC-0 subunits in the concatemer, consistent with the higher single-channel conductance of ClC-0 (8 pS (Ref. 19Ludewig U. Jentsch T.J. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) as compared with ClC-1 (1.2 pS (Ref. 12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). Both ClC-0 and ClC-1 are voltage-gated in more than one way. This has been described as a “fast” gate and a “slow” gate for ClC-0 (8Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,18Bauer C.K. Steinmeyer K. Schwarz J.R. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11052-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the slow gate in ClC-1 is much faster than in ClC-0, the same terminology has been used for ClC-1 by Pusch and co-workers (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of the fast gate is qualitatively similar for ClC-0 and ClC-1. Both channels are closed by hyperpolarization, with the midpoint of the activation curve at −100 mV for ClC-0 (20Pusch M. Ludewig U. Rehfeldt A. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and −20 mV for ClC-1 (21Pusch M. Steinmeyer K. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) in the oocyte system. Normal gating of ClC-1 is retained in the ClC-1∼ClC-1 concatemer. However, no ClC-1-like currents were seen in the mixed concatemers with ClC-0. When a fast voltage protocol was used, their currents were very similar to ClC-0 (Fig. 1 A). The steady-state current voltage dependence of the 1∼0 and 0∼1 concatemers was indistinguishable from that of the 0∼0 concatemer (data not shown). Because of its lower single-channel conductance, the contribution of ClC-1 to the macroscopic current is expected to be small in mixed concatemers with ClC-0 (∼10%), but it should still be detectable. Although indistinguishable in their fast gating, both mixed concatemers differ from the ClC-0 concatemer by the absence of the hyperpolarization-activated slow gate, indicating that a different channel than in the 0∼0 concatemer is formed (Fig.1 B). The conclusion that the ClC-1 pore does not contribute significantly to macroscopic currents of the mixed concatemers is further supported by currents obtained from concatemers bearing the K519E mutation in the ClC-0 pore. Although the single-channel conductances of ClC-1 (1.2 pS (Ref. 12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) and ClC-0(K519E) (1 pS (Ref. 10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)) are about equal, the macroscopic current of the mixed concatemers was very similar to the current obtained with the ClC-0(K519E) homodimer in terms of steady-state voltage dependence and open channel rectification. This was true irrespective of the order of the two subunits in the mixed concatemer (data not shown). However, the differential sensitivity of ClC-1 and ClC-0 to the inhibitor 9-AC (14Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 22Astill D.S. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) may be exploited to demonstrate the presence of a ClC-1 conductance in the 1∼0(K519E) concatemer. Extracellular 9-AC inhibited the ClC-1 concatemer with an apparent IC50 of 8.2 ± 1.0 μm (Fig.1 C). This inhibition was not complete, because about 30% of the current remained at 500 μm 9-AC. The ClC-0(K519E) concatemer could only be inhibited by much higher 9-AC concentration, with an apparent IC50 of 9.8 ± 0.8 mm. In the mixed concatemer, a biphasic inhibition was observed. A small fraction of the current (about 12%) was inhibited by similar concentrations of 9-AC as was the ClC-1 (IC50 of 10.6 ± 11.7 μm), whereas the remaining current required equally high 9-AC concentrations as the ClC-0(K519E) to become blocked (IC50 of 10.7 ± 3.4 mm). This indicates that the macroscopic current of the 1∼0(K519E) concatemer is the sum of two current components with the same 9-AC sensitivity as the ClC-1 and ClC-0(K519E), respectively. Contrary to expectation, the highly 9-AC-sensitive component is much smaller in amplitude than the 9-AC-insensitive component. This indicates that the activity of ClC-1 is reduced in the concatemer. Since the properties of single ClC-0 and ClC-1 pores are known, it should be evident from single-channel currents of the mixed concatemer if both pores are present. Excised patches of 1∼0 concatemers clearly showed two different pores, a large pore with the typical properties of a single ClC-0 pore and a small pore with properties of a ClC-1 pore (Fig. 2 A). These two pores were invariably found together in the patch (12 out of 12 patches). The single-pore current voltage relationship was linear in the range of −60 and −160 mV (−80 and −160 mV for the small pore). Mean conductance of the small pore was 1.8 pS, about 50% larger than reported for wild-type ClC-1 pore at a lower pH of 6.5 (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The conductance of the large pore was 7.8 pS and thus of the same magnitude as in the ClC-0 homodimer (∼8 pS) (Ref. 13Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 789-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and data not shown). Dwell-time analysis was performed in three patches with a stable single-channel at −100 mV. The large pore had a mean open time of 34 ± 2 ms, which is in the range reported for individual pores in the ClC-0 dimer (17Hanke W. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Bauer C.K. Steinmeyer K. Schwarz J.R. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11052-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The small pore had a mean open time of 29 ± 2 ms, slightly shorter than that of individual pores in the ClC-1 dimer at pH 6.5 (∼45 ms at −140 mV (Ref. 12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). This difference is expected because a lower pH slows the overall gating of ClC-1 (23Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D.S. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Very long closed times that lead to the bursting behavior normally associated with ClC-0 single-channel currents were not observed in the mixed concatemer. Even in the absence of a clearly visible common gate, the gating of the pores might be interdependent. We therefore determined the open probability of the large pore in the 1∼0 concatemer in relation to the open state of the small pore. The single-channel record was subdivided into sections of small pore open and closed events, and the open probability of the large pore calculated under both conditions. When the small pore was closed, the open probability (at −100 mV) of the large pore was 0.45 ± 0.03 (n = 5 patches). When the small pore was open, a value of 0.48 ± 0.02 was obtained, suggesting that the gating of the large pore did not depend on the open state of the small pore. The large pore open probability agrees with the corresponding value for individual pores in homomeric ClC-0, which is ∼0.45 at this voltage (10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The gating of ClC-2 differs significantly from ClC-1 and ClC-0. It opens very slowly upon hyperpolarization, is virtually closed at positive potentials, and can be opened by cell swelling and extracellular acidification (24Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 25Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An N-terminal inactivation domain (residues 21–39) was proposed to influence channel gating from the cytoplasmic side by a ball-and-chain mechanism (24Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear how many of these inactivation domains are needed to gate a channel dimer. Possible movement restrictions of the second inactivation domain in the 2∼2 concatemer apparently did not interfere with normal gating (compare Fig.3 A). However, when we generated mixed concatemers of ClC-2 and ClC-0, only the concatemer with the N-terminal ClC-2 moiety could be expressed functionally. In stark contrast to the ClC-1/ClC-0 concatemers, where the ClC-0 pore dominated the macroscopic current, current traces obtained with the ClC-2∼ClC-0 mixed concatemer showed only a small depolarization-activated ClC-0 type conductance and a rather large hyperpolarization-activated ClC-2 type conductance (Fig.3 A). To investigate whether the hyperpolarization-activated current was indeed carried by ClC-2 pores, we tested its modulation by external pH. The current increased by ∼40% upon lowering the pH by 1 unit, and decreased by the same amount upon raising the pH by 1 unit (Fig.3 C). This is comparable to the pH sensitivity of ClC-2 wild-type currents, which are increased/decreased by ∼60% upon lowering/raising the pH by 1 unit (25Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ClC-0 is also weakly dependent on extracellular pH, but the moderate changes of ±1 pH unit employed here would not affect the steady-state current at the test potential of +40 mV (Ref. 17Hanke W. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and results not shown). This demonstrates that pH-dependent activation, which is a characteristic feature of ClC-2, is preserved in the 2∼0 mixed concatemer. Mutational analysis was used to identify the contribution of either pore to the macroscopic current. To this end, point mutations in either of the two subunits were inserted into the 2∼0 concatemer and the resulting changes in the macroscopic current analyzed (Fig.4). The ClC-2(K210Q) mutation accelerated the gating of homomeric ClC-2, resulting in a faster inactivation at depolarized potentials (data not shown). Inserting this mutation in the 2∼0 concatemer (Fig. 4, left panel) accelerated the decay of the hyperpolarization-activated current upon switching to positive voltages. The K210Q mutation also reduced the hyperpolarization-activated current relative to the current at neutral potentials. This was determined from the ratio of the slope conductances at −120 mV and −40 mV, which was 2.43 and 1.33 for the traces shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. A different effect was seen with the ClC-2(K566E) mutation, which caused outward rectification of the open-pore currents in the homomer (25Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This effect is preserved in the mixed concatemer (Fig. 4, middle panel), since the current at negative voltages is significantly reduced in comparison with wild-type 2∼0 currents. Finally, the ClC-0-like current could be suppressed by the introduction of the ClC-0(K519E) mutation, which greatly reduces the single-channel amplitude (10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The current of the 2∼0(K519E) concatemer is only slightly different from that of the 2∼2 concatemer (Fig. 4, right panel), indicating that a ClC-2 pore with wild-type gating behavior is present in the mixed concatemer. Single-channel analysis of the 2∼0 mixed concatemer is complicated by the fact that no single-channel currents of ClC-2 have been published. Macroscopic currents suggest that the ClC-2 pore should be open only at negative potentials, and noise analysis indicated a single-channel conductance of 2–3 pS (16Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When single-channels of the 2∼0 concatemer were recorded (Fig. 5), a pore conforming to these predictions was indeed found in association with a ClC-0 type pore. In all recordings that showed a single ∼8-pS conductance level, a smaller conductance of 2.8 pS was also found (7 patches). In contrast to the ClC-0 pore, which was always active and gated rapidly, the small pore opened only slowly after switching from positive to negative potential and closed quickly upon returning to positive potential. Once opened by negative voltage, very long open times, interrupted only by brief closings, could be observed (Fig.5 A, bottom trace). To finally ascertain the identity of the small pore in the 2∼0 concatemer, single-channel recordings of the 2∼2 concatemer were performed. This revealed pores with a single-channel conductance of 2.6 ± 0.1 pS (Fig. 6) that gated similarly to the small pore in the 2∼0 mixed concatemer. Again, positive voltage caused the pores to close, and upon switching to negative voltage, the pores re-opened only after a significant delay (compare Fig. 6 B). Unlike the ClC-0, where the slow gating mechanism closes both pores simultaneously, ClC-2 showed no bursting behavior. This constant channel activity of ClC-2, in combination with its slow activation after a hyperpolarizing voltage step, did not allow us to unequivocally determine the minimum number of active pores,i.e. the pore stoichiometry of the homomeric channel. Ever since the first double opening of the Torpedoelectric organ voltage-gated chloride channel appeared on the chart recorder, the question whether this functional duplicity corresponded also to a structural duplicity, i.e. a two-pore channel, has been under debate. For the Torpedo channel, ClC-0, it has been answered in favor of two separate conduction pathways in terms of gating behavior (8Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Hanke W. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 82: 25-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and inhibitor blockade (26Miller C. White M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2772-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The most stringent proof for this “double-barreled” model comes from the analysis of point mutations in mixed concatemers (9Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Nature. 1996; 383: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 789-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the existence of a common gate that affects both pores simultaneously in ClC-0 (8Miller C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 299: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 27Lin Y.W. Lin C.W. Chen T.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and ClC-1 (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), together with dominant negative mutations in ClC-1 that alter channel gating (21Pusch M. Steinmeyer K. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and dominant negative effects of biochemical modification of single monomers in mixed ClC-1 concatemers (11Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggest a functional interaction between both halves of the dimer. The cysteine modification studies of Fahlke and co-workers (11Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were even taken as direct evidence for of a single conduction pathway in the dimeric channel, although neither true pore properties nor single-channel behavior were investigated. The question we have asked is this: are pore properties such as single-channel conductance retained when subunits of different channels are expressed together in a single dimer? If they are, the double-pore arrangement observed in ClC-0 will be extended to other CLC channels. In addition, this will show that the permeation pathway is completely contained in a single subunit of the CLC dimer, as opposed to being lined by parts of either subunit. In mixed concatemers containing ClC-0, we have found that the smallest channel unit consisted of a single ClC-0 pore accompanied by a smaller pore. The small pore behaved like a ClC-1 pore in the 1∼0 concatemer and like a ClC-2 pore in the 2∼0 concatemer. Neither pore was encountered alone, but both pores were invariably found together. Moreover, the gating kinetics of the individual pores closely mimic the gating observed in homodimers of the respective subunit. This means that the structures responsible for pore formation and for voltage-dependent (fast) gating are present in any one subunit. Other properties, however, are dependent on both pores in the dimer. This is clearly the case for the slow gate of the ClC-0, which is no longer seen in the macroscopic current if one ClC-0 subunit is replaced with a ClC-1 subunit. In the single-channel records of the mixed concatemers, two types of coordinated gating activity may be discerned, the direct transition between fully open and fully closed states, and the direct transition between small and large open levels. The former is nothing else but the slow gating well known in ClC-0, but the latter interlevel transitions would be missed in homomeric channels with two pores of equal conductance. Close inspection of the traces shown (Figs.2 A and 5 A) seems to yield a few examples of either type of gating, i.e. coordinated opening/closing events as well as interlevel transitions. Considering the limited bandwidth of our recordings (2 kHz prior to filtering), these could result from incompletely resolved sequential gating events, but we cannot rule out the possibility that coordinated gating activity takes place in the mixed dimers with a low incidence. Since the frequency of these events is in any case too low to significantly alter channel behavior, we have not systematically investigated this example of subunit interdependence. Furthermore, the contribution of the ClC-1 pore is very much reduced under voltage-clamp conditions when expressed alongside the ClC-0 pore, although both pores are clearly active in excised patches. This discrepancy may be due to the interaction with cytoplasmic cofactors or depend on the low [Cl−] of the oocyte interior. Interestingly, in earlier studies of ClC-1 and ClC-2 coexpression (16Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), ClC-1 contributed little to the macroscopic current (and this most likely resulted from ClC-1 homodimers). Rather, the macroscopic current resembled that of a constitutively open ClC-2 channel. Quite different from the apparent suppression of ClC-1 in the 1∼0 and 0∼1 concatemers, ClC-2 dominates the macroscopic current in the 2∼0 concatemer under whole cell conditions, indicating that ClC-0 is suppressed. Again, in the excised patch, ClC-0 and ClC-2 pores show normal gating. Assuming that two separate pores are present in a channel consisting of two subunits, the question remains whether one pore is contained completely within a single subunit or formed by parts of each subunit. This question has been addressed in the past in concatemers of ClC-0 carrying two different mutations (10Ludewig U. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although these experiments were fully compatible with a one-subunit/one-pore arrangement, they could not entirely resolve the issue, because the pore structure of CLC channel is not known. The experiments with dimers of two different CLC channels that are reported here demonstrate that the basic channel properties of the monomer are not altered by its interaction with other subunits. This shows that a pore is formed entirely by a single CLC monomer. We have interpreted our results based on the assumption that only two CLC subunits are required to form a functional channel, but is this justified? Our assumption is well supported by biochemical evidence, which suggests a dimeric structure for ClC-0 (5Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13189-13198Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), ClC-1 (6Fahlke C. Knittle T. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. George Jr., A.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a bacterial CLC homologue (7Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Purdy M.D. Wiener M.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a dimerization of the concatemers used in this study (resulting in a dimer of dimers) cannot strictly be ruled out. If this should happen, dimers of the two constituent pores rather than mixed dimers could be formed, rendering the single-channel studies meaningless. The presence of single pores of each constituent channel type in the mixed dimers, however, argues against this possibility, for in a tetrameric arrangement, four pores should be present. Can our results be explained in terms of a single-barreled channel, in which both subunits contribute to a single pore? This alternative model of CLC pore architecture was brought forward by Fahlke et al. (11Fahlke C. Rhodes T.H. Desai R.R. George Jr., A.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) based on the interaction of single cysteine mutants of ClC-1 with mono- and bifunctional reagents. In the framework of this model, the two equal-sized conductance values observed in single-channel recordings must be regarded as subconductance states of a common pore. A pore consisting of two different CLC proteins, as is the case in our mixed concatemers, could then have two different subconductance states. However, it seems impossible that such subconductance states retain their conductance levels and gating properties they have in the respective homodimer, and that they gate independently of each other in the asymmetric heterodimer. Taken together, our results argue for a common structural basis of all CLC channels, with a separate conduction pathway, i.e. a pore, in each subunit. The fundamental characteristics of channel activity, namely permeation of ions, mirrored in a defined single-channel conductance, and voltage-dependent gating transitions, are present in the monomeric channel and do not depend on the partner subunit. Any CLC dimer, therefore, must be viewed as an association of two basically independent pores. This does not exclude the possibility that some CLC channels are monomers. However, since the dimeric structure found in the bacterial channel (7Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) appears to be conserved in the mammalian channels, this seems unlikely. Last but not least, we have shown on the single-channel level that ClC-2 is a slowly gating, hyperpolarization-activated channel of 2–3 pS single-channel conductance, in agreement with prior studies of macroscopic currents. This enables a comparison with single-channel recordings from native tissues in which ClC-2 is expressed. What are the consequences of the one-subunit/one-pore arrangement? One important feature of such a pore architecture is the mechanism by which mutations may affect channel function. In potassium channels, where four subunits contribute equally to a single pore, mutations in the pore as well as in other parts of the protein often have dominant negative effects. On the other hand, mutations in CLC channels will only show a dominant phenotype if they affect a common gating mechanism or if they lead to a retention or misprocessing of heteromeric channels before they reach their target membrane. This observation is consistent with the analysis of a dominant negative mutation in ClC-1 causing myotonia congenita (12Saviane C. Conti F. Pusch M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which was found to affect the common (slow) gating but not the individual (fast) gating of the channels. Elucidating channel structure may therefore be an important tool for the understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis in human inherited diseases. The double pore arrangement further implies that the design of dominant-negative mutants, which could be useful in cell biological or transgenic approaches, will not be an easy task for all members of the CLC family. We thank Michael Pusch for valuable advice, Siegfried Waldegger for critical reading of the manuscript, and Sven-Eric Jordt for the construction of some of the mutants used in this study."

All, with the exception of integrin CD11b A-domain (11bA), were found only in the closed noncomplexed form, leading to the suggestion that the open form is a noninformative crystal artifact (17Baldwin E.T.

However, recent studies provided evidence that the open and closed forms correspond to the high and low affinity states (6Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J.

The finding that one A-domain, CD49b, crystallized in the closed form in the absence of ligand, but in the open form in its presence, further suggested that the ligand may trigger or stabilize the high affinity state (15Emsley J.

In this communication we describe the binding isotherms and structure of stable and homogeneous low and high affinity forms of the CD11b A domain. The low affinity form generated by removing an extrinsic N-terminal extension of the domain, crystallized in the closed conformation. The high affinity form was generated by unlocking an invariable C-terminal Ile316 from a hydrophobic socket, which normally coordinates this residue in the closed conformation. The resulting domain crystallized in the open conformation and induced a high affinity state when introduced in the CD11b/CD18 receptor. Thus, an intrinsic isoleucine-based switch regulates affinity and shape shifting in the CD11b A-domain. We suggest that a similar mechanism may regulate integrin affinity in response to inside-out signals. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc.

The following mutagenic primers were used: ΔIFA forward, 5′-TATAGGATCCGAGGCCCTCCGAGGGAGTCCTCAAGAGGATAG-3′; ΔIFA reverse, 5′-CTACTCGAGTTACTTCTCCCGAAGCTGGTTCTGAATGGTC-3′; Ile → Gly reverse, 5′-CTACTCGAGTTAACCCTCGATCGCAAAGCCCTTCTC-3′. Introduction of the respective mutation was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The recombinant DNA work used standard molecular biology protocols. ThePvuI-BspEI-restricted cDNA fragment of the CD11b A-domain (11bA) containing the mutation was subcloned into thePvuI-BspEI-restricted CD11b cDNA and cloned into 11bpcDNA3 plasmid (which contains full-length human CD11b).

Open table in a new tab Single 11bA123–315 and 11bAIle-316→Gly crystals were used to collect, respectively, 2.3 and 3.0 Å resolution data sets, at 100 K, on beamline X12B of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory using a charge-coupled device detector. A 2.6-Å resolution data set was collected from a single 11bA123–321 crystal, using an in-house rotating anode generator/imaging plate system. Data were integrated and reduced with the HKL package (23Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar). Structures were determined by molecular replacement. We used the refined 1.8-Å Mg2+structure (residues Asp132 to Lys315, Protein Data Bank accession code 1ido) (3Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) as a starting model for 11bA123–315, and the resulting refined 11bA123–315 model was then used as the starting model for 11bAIle-316→Gly. The refined structure of F302W 11bA (residues Glu131 to Gly321), 2J.-P. Xiong, R. Li, M. Essafi, T. Stehle, and M. A. Arnaout, manuscript in preparation. which is similar to the Mn2+ structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1jlm) (16Lee J.-O. Anne-Bankston L. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure ( Lond. ). 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), was used as the starting model for 11bA123–321. The models were modified by deleting ions and water molecules. Rigid body refinement was initially used to improve each solution. Subsequent refinement rounds consisted of alternating cycles of torsion-angle dynamics and restrained individual isotropic B factor refinement protocols in XPLOR (24Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). In each case, 5% of the data were excluded from the refinement to monitor the freeR-factor (24Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). After each refinement round, the models were inspected with (2Fo − Fc) and (Fo − Fc) electron density maps and modified using O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). For 11bA123–321, NCS restraints were used in early refinement and gradually released as the resolution increased. Solvent and metal ions were added during later stages of model refinement based on peaks > 3ς in (Fo − Fc) difference maps, reasonable hydrogen bond distances, and refined temperature factors of less than 50 Å2. The final models comprise all non-hydrogen atoms of residues Asp132 to Lys315for 11bA123–315 and 11bAIle-316→Gly , and residues Asp132 to Gly321, for 11bA123–321. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Ligand binding was measured using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The physiologic ligands iC3b, fibrinogen, CD54, the antagonist NIF, and the mAbs 904 or 44a were covalently coupled individually via primary amines to the dextran matrix of separate CM5 sensor chips. BSA immobilized in the same way was used as a control surface. 11bA123–321, 11bA123–315, or 11bAIle-316→Gly domains were flowed over the chip at 5 μl/min at different times. TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 2 mmMgCl2 and 0.005% P20 (BIAcore AB) was used as the running buffer unless otherwise indicated. 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was used to remove the bound proteins and to regenerate the surface. Binding was measured as a function of time, and binding isotherms were determined as described previously (26Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Eisenstein E. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9667-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), after subtracting background binding to the BSA-coated chip. COS M7 simian fibroblastoid cells at ∼70% confluence were transfected with supercoiled cDNAs encoding full-length wild-type (WT) or CD11bIle-316→Gly together with full-length CD18. Heterodimer formation and binding of iC3b-coated erythrocytes to WT and Ile-316→GlyCD11b/CD18 holoreceptors were carried out as described previously (13Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15858-15861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Specific binding of iC3b to the holoreceptors was obtained by subtracting background binding to mock-transfected COS cells. Binding toIle-316→GlyCD11b/CD18 was expressed as a percentage of binding to WT, after correcting for the degree of surface expression using binding of mAb 904 (13Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L.

In attempting to express stable and homogeneous forms of the low and high affinity forms of CD11bA, we took note of the following unexplained observations. First, integrin A-domains that bind to their respective physiologic ligands contain an N-terminal amino acid extension (16 amino acids N-terminal to Gly127 in CD11b); domains lacking this extension bind physiologic ligands poorly (4Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Eble J. Kuhn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32182-32191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, one major difference in the crystal structure of the open and closed forms is the position of Ile316 close to the C terminus. In the closed form, Ile316 is part of the last turn of helix α7 and fits tightly into a conserved hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1,a–d). In the open structure, Leu312 replaces Ile316 in this pocket (Fig. 1, c–f). Ile316 is strictly conserved in all integrin A-domains (Fig. 1 g). Third, some crystal and NMR structures of other integrin A-domains (3Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 5Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) show structural flexibility in the C-terminal helical turn of α7, suggesting a potential physiologic regulatory role. We evaluated the structural and functional consequences of modifying Ile316 in integrin 11bA that lacks the bulk of the extrinsic N-terminal extension. The ligand binding properties of 11bA123–321 and 11bA123–315 were determined using surface plasmon resonance (6Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 11bA123–321 showed no binding to the activation-dependent physiologic ligands, complement iC3b, fibrinogen, and CD54 (ICAM-1) (Fig. 2 a, c, ande) in the presence of MgCl2. In contrast, 11bA123–315 displayed high affinity binding to all three ligands (Fig. 2, b, d, and f). The divalent cations Mn2+ and Mg2+, but not Ca2+ (each at 2 mm), supported the interaction of 11bA123–315 with iC3b (Fig. 2 b); no binding of iC3b to 11bA123–315 was observed in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (Fig. 2 b). Physiologic ligand binding to 11bA123–321 in the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or EDTA was minimal (Fig. 2 a). The structural differences observed between the low and high affinity forms did not require the presence of a physiologic ligand, as mAb 44a, which binds in the C-terminal region of 11bA (12Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), displayed a ∼500-fold difference in affinity between the low and high affinity forms (Fig. 2, k and l). Both A-domain forms bound equally well to the activation-independent antagonist NIF (Fig. 2, g and h), and to mAb 904 (Fig. 2, i and j), indicating that the differences observed are not caused by variations in A-domain concentrations. These data establish the feasibility of expressing stable and homogeneous low and high affinity forms of 11bA and show that structural differences between the two can be detected in solution in the absence of physiologic ligands. To provide a structural basis for the functional differences observed in solution, we determined the crystal structures of 11bA123–321 and 11bA123–315. The crystal structure 11bA123–321 was that of the closed conformation (Fig. 3, a,c, and e), with a Mn2+ ion occupying MIDAS, as shown previously (16Lee J.-O. Anne-Bankston L. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure ( Lond. ). 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 11bA123–315 crystallized in the open form (Fig. 3,b, d, and f). Although the crystallization conditions for both proteins were different, our observation that 11bA123–321 did not form crystals under the 11bA123–315 crystallization condition strongly suggests that the introduced C-terminal deletion played an essential role in generation of the open state. These data, combined with the ligand binding results, indicate that the high affinity state assumes the open conformation. In the high affinity 11bA123–315 open structure, MIDAS is occupied by a metal ion. We assigned a calcium ion at this position based on the following observations. First, crystals grew in the calcium-containing crystallization buffer; direct metal ion quantitation using the inductively coupled argon plasma method revealed predominantly calcium, with no other divalent cation present among 17 sought (including Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, not shown). Second, the typical octahedral coordination distinguishes it from solvent (31Katz A.F. Glusker J.P. Beebe S.A. Bock C.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5752-5763Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Third, the average unrestrained distance from this metal ion to coordinating ligands (2.28 Å) is more close to Ca2+ in the octahedral coordination (2.35 Å) than Mg2+ (2.07 Å) or Mn2+ (2.17 Å) (32Bock C. Katz A. Markham G. Glusker J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7360-7372Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The refined B-factor for calcium is slightly lower than that of the surrounding side chains but is still within the margin of error for a 2.3-Å resolution. These data suggest that Ca2+ may be coordinated in MIDAS in the open conformation, at least under the nonphysiologic crystallization conditions used here. An alternative interpretation of the above structural and functional data is that Ca2+ does bind under physiologic conditions to the open form but exerts a suppressive effect on physiologic ligand binding. Measurements of Ca2+ affinity to the high versuslow affinity A-domain states may help in differentiating between these two possibilities. The above data also support previous findings that the nature of the metal ion per se is not sufficient to induce the open state (6Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Nolte M. Pepinsky R.B. Venyaminov S. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P.J. Karpusas M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ile316 is invariable in all integrin α A-domains cloned to date (Fig. 1 g). We determined the effect of removing the hydrophobic side chain “finger” of this isoleucine on affinity and structure of the A-domain. The 11bAIle-316→Gly form exhibited “high affinity” (Fig. 4 a). The same substitution created in the holoreceptor dramatically increased its ligand binding activity (Fig. 4 b). The 11bAIle-316→Gly crystal structure (TableI) was essentially identical to that of the open 11bA123–315 form, including the predicted presence of calcium in MIDAS; the two structures can be superimposed onto each other with an root mean square deviation of 0.17 Å for main chain atoms. Taken together, these data indicate that an Ile316-based switch, intrinsic to this domain, acts allosterically to regulate its ligand binding affinity and topology. A conserved hydrophobic intramolecular socket (SILEN, socket for isoleucine), fastens the Ile316 finger in the closed conformation; Ile316 is replaced by Leu312 at this site in the open structure (Fig. 1, a–f). SILEN is formed by the hydrophobic side chains of Ile135, Leu164, Ile236, and Tyr267 both in the closed and open conformations (Fig. 1, c–f) and are either identical or conserved in all the other A-domains. In the CD11b/CD18 integrin, certain mutations that lie outside MIDAS produce gain-of-function effects in the holoreceptor and are believed to act allosterically (12Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar data were recently reported in the CD11a/CD18 heterodimer, while this manuscript was in preparation (33Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All these studies were carried out in the holoreceptors and therefore did not determine whether allosteric regulation is intrinsic to the A-domain, since potential interdomain interactions and/or other quaternary effects in the holoreceptor may also be operative. While the transition from the closed to the open conformation undoubtedly involves multiple intradomain realignments, the data presented here suggest that interference with SILEN may be a key component in allosteric regulation. We note that mutations that up-regulate integrin function occur in or around SILEN. For example, substitution of the α1−βB loop of CD11b with that of CD11a generates a constitutively active integrin (19Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This region includes Leu164, one of the SILEN residues. Integrin activation also occurs in an Leu164 to Phe substitution (18Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which predictably makes SILEN smaller and therefore less accommodating to Ile316. Other activating mutations involving Glu131, Asp132, Lys231, and Phe234 lie at the bottom of the structure, in close proximity to SILEN (18Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and may thus exert their effects through interference with the proper coordination of the Ile316 finger in SILEN. The inhibitory effect of certain mAbs with epitopes on the opposite side of MIDAS (e.g. mAb 44a, the epitope of which spans residues on the top of SILEN (12Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) may similarly be explained through stabilization of the SILEN pocket. The binding site for the CD11a/CD18 inhibitor lovastatin (34Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) includes two of the four SILEN residues (Leu132 and Tyr257 in CD11a, which correspond to Ile135 and Tyr267, respectively, in CD11b), and may therefore act by stabilizing the low affinity state. Interestingly, an Ile306 to Ala substitution in CD11a (equivalent to Ile316 in CD11b) was found to increase ligand binding affinity of the CD11a/CD18 heterodimer (33Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that the present observations may extend to other A-domains. Integrins exist in low and high affinity states in the absence of ligand (2Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18726-18731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the high affinity state of the ligand binding A-domain has so far been seen crystallographically only in complex with a pseudoligand (3Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) or ligand (15Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (836) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that the ligand triggers or stabilizes the active state. The low and high affinity forms of 11bA reported here assume different structures even in solution and in the absence of ligand, as revealed by the differential binding of mAb 44a. Although not strictly proven, it is likely that the differences detected in solution correspond to the open and closed conformers. Generation of the high affinity 11bA in a stable form should now permit an examination of this question. Previous studies in all integrin A-domains expressed to date have shown that the presence of a short N-terminal amino acid extension extrinsic to the A-domain itself allows the respective domain to bind to its physiologic ligands. Removal of this N-terminal extension or reducing it to four residues, as shown here, generates a low affinity state that assumes the closed form. These data suggest that the N-terminal extension plays a role in affinity regulation within the domain. The underlying structural basis for this effect is unknown, since none of the residues in the N-terminal extension are included in the three-dimensional structures of this domain. It has been observed, however, that residues within this extension regulate ligand binding in A-domains. First, naturally occurring point mutations in this segment of the vWF A1 domain cause gain-of-function phenotypes in patients with type IIB vWf disease (35Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This region also contains an activating mutation in CD11b (18Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Second, structural data from the CD49b A-domain also show that three residues that extend beyond the α7 helix can pack into a crevice formed in part by N-terminal residues, bringing the N and C termini into close spatial proximity (5Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Flexibility of the C-terminal residues in α7 has also been observed in the crystal (36Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure ( Lond. ). 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and NMR (8Legge G.B. Kriwacki R.W. Chung J. Hommel U. Ramage P. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) structures of the CD11a A-domain. Based on these data, we speculate that the N-terminal extension in the isolated A-domain may loosen Ile316 coordination into SILEN, thus allowing some molecules to exist in the high affinity open form. A similar mechanism may be operative in the holoreceptor; inside-out signals may through intramolecular repacking, free the N-terminal extension to access and therefore modify SILEN. Validation of such a mechanism will require the three-dimensional structure determination of a whole integrin. The ability to express a stable form of the high affinity A-domain and to identify the structural basis of A-domain affinity switching should have broad biologic and pharmaceutical applications. Elucidation of the structures of other A-domains in their open conformation in the absence or presence of physiologic ligands may now be feasible. Also, integrin affinity is increased in many common diseases. High affinity forms of integrin A-domains could be of value therapeutically or utilized in high throughput screens to develop effective small molecule antagonists.

Treatment of HepG2 cells with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl choline (OX-PAPC), or biologically active lipids present in mildly oxidized low density lipoprotein, increased apolipoprotein J (apoJ), and decreased paraoxonase (PON) mRNA levels. Antibodies to IL-6 blocked these changes. IL-6 treatment in the absence of OXPL produced the same pattern of mRNA changes observed with OXPL treatment alone.In vivo, OX-PAPC injected into C57BL/6J mice resulted in a marked reduction in PON activity and an increase in apoJ levels in plasma after 16 h. Injection of OX-PAPC into IL-6-deficient C57BL/6J mice (IL-6 −/−) did not alter either PON activity or apoJ levels. We then tested if other mechanisms involved in fatty streak formation depended upon IL-6. Antibody to IL-6 had no effect on OX-PAPC-induced secretion of MCP-1 by endothelial cells nor on MCP-1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. C57BL/6J and IL-6 −/− mice fed an atherogenic diet both demonstrated markedly reduced plasma PON activities and the IL-6 −/− mice developed fatty streaks to a greater degree than wild-type mice. We conclude that IL-6 is critical to short term but not long term regulation of PON and that IL-6 is not required for OXPL regulation of MCP-1.

However, we also reported that during an acute phase response (APR) in both humans and rabbits, HDL lost these protective enzymes and was converted from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory particle (3Van Lenten B.J.

In other studies we observed that feeding an atherogenic diet to mice genetically susceptible to atherosclerosis resulted in changes similar to those seen in the APR. Both the plasma and hepatic expression of two HDL- associated proteins, apolipoprotein (apo) J and paraoxonase (PON), were altered. ApoJ, a marker of the acute phase response, was increased, but there was a marked decline in PON expression and activity (3Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M.

Injection of oxidized phospholipids responsible for the biological activity of mildly oxidized LDL into susceptible mice resulted in a similar pattern of expression,i.e. apoJ was increased, whereas PON was reduced (4Navab M.

Previously, we had demonstrated that injection of mildly oxidized LDL but not native LDL induced the expression of JE, the murine homologue for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (5Liao F.

We also had reported that an atherogenic diet induced conjugated dienes and the expression of several inflammatory and oxidative stress-responsive genes in the liver of C57BL/6J mice (6Liao F.

More recently we reported that an atherogenic diet when fed to mice induced the hepatic formation of the oxidized phospholipids that are responsible for the biologic activity of mildly oxidized LDL (7Leitinger N.

Another principal mediator of the APR, IL-6, is also known to affect the hepatic synthesis of a number of apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants (10Koj A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), in vivo and in vitro (11Mullen P.G. Windsor A.C. Walsh C.J. Fowler III, A.A. Sugerman H.J. J. Surg. Res. 1995; 58: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), however its role in artery wall metabolism is less well understood. Studies from the literature support both a positive (12Huber S.A. Sakkinen P. Conze D. Hardin N. Tracy R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2364-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and negative role (13Sukovich D. Kauser K. Rubanyi G.M. Circulation. 1999; 100: 217Google Scholar) for IL-6 in the development of atherosclerosis. The data reported here demonstrate that oxidized phospholipids found in mildly oxidized LDL act to acutely alter the expression of PON and apoJ, at least in part, through the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. However, the mechanisms by which oxidized phospholipids alter PON and apoJ expression in the liver are different from those required to induce MCP-1, and the short-term regulation of PON differs from long term regulation.DISCUSSIONOur previous results in animal models demonstrated that the decrease in the PON/apoJ ratio induced by administration of oxidized phospholipids, by a high fat atherogenic diet, or during an APR contributed to the formation of HDL that were no longer anti-inflammatory in nature but were in fact pro-inflammatory (3Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 4Navab M.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that specific oxidized phospholipids found in MM-LDL affected the gene expression of two HDL-associated proteins, PON and apoJ, when incubated with cultured HepG2 cells. This response was blocked by antibodies to IL-6. HepG2 cells treated directly with IL-6 in the absence of oxidized phospholipids showed the same pattern of response for PON and apoJ mRNA expression.Others have noted effects of cytokines on hepatic lipoprotein synthesis, suggesting a link between the acute phase response and the development of atherosclerosis. Memon and co-workers (14Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Seki T. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Cytokine. 1998; 10: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) observed that IL-1β and TNF-α suppressed apoA-I expression in HepG2 cells but not expression of apoE.

Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with the other major APR cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1, showed a decrease in PON mRNA levels. Moreover, other changes in lipoprotein metabolism that could potentially influence the development of atherosclerosis are increases in serum triglyceride levels, an increase in small dense LDL, changes in the composition of HDL, including the activities of its enzymes other than PON, particularly lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (16Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Khovidhunkit W. Memon R.A. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181 Suppl. 3: S462-S472Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that PON is capable of abolishing the bioactivity of mildly oxidized LDL and that of OX-PAPC (1Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 774-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in plasma PON activity have been reported in several pathological conditions. Abbott and colleagues (18Abbott C.A. Mackness M.I. Kumar S. Boulton A.J. Durrington P.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and Mackness and Durrington (19Mackness M.I. Durrington P.N. Lancet. 1995; 346: 856Abstract PubMed Google Scholar) have reported low PON activity in diabetes and that a low serum PON activity was associated with increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (20McElveen J. Mackness M.I. Colley C.M. Peard T. Warner S. Walker C.H. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). ApoJ, also known as clusterin, is a glycoprotein that is present in a subpopulation of HDL together with PON and apoA-I (21Kelso G.J. Stuart W.D. Richter R.J. Furlong C.E. Jordan-Starck T.C. Harmony J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Blatter M.C. James R.W. Messmer S. Barja F. Pometta D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It has been reported to have roles in complement regulation and prevention of cytolysis (23Tschopp J. French L.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 97 Suppl. 2: 11-14Google Scholar), lipid transport (24Rosenberg M.E. Silkensen J. Int. J, Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), apoptosis (24Rosenberg M.E. Silkensen J. Int. J, Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and membrane protection at fluid-tissue interfaces where it is expressed (25French L.E. Wohlwend A. Sappino A.P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells secrete apoJ as a lipoprotein, indicating its ability to be associated with lipid (26Aronow B.J. Lund S.D. Brown T.L. Harmony J.A. Witte D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One could postulate that the association of apoJ and PON in the plasma, and their reciprocal regulation by the liver, might act as a coordinated protection during inflammatory conditions.These studies support the notion that, during an acute oxidative stress, the effects of oxidized phospholipids may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines. The action of IL-6 may be via its activation of gp130, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in many cytokine-mediated cellular responses (27Alonzi T. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Probert L. Kollias G. De Benedetti F. Poli V. Ciliberto G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Additional support for a role of oxidant stress on cytokine activation comes from the work of Eugui et al. (28Eugui E.M. DeLustro B. Rouhafza S. Ilnicka M. Lee S.W. Wilhelm R. Allison A.C. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These investigators found that antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole, tetrahydropapaveroline, nordihydroguiauretic acid, and 10,11-dihydroxyaporphine inhibited the production of IL-6 as well as TNF-α and IL-1β by human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that suppressing oxidation can limit the inflammatory response.In the present study, injection of OX-PAPC into C57BL/6J mice resulted in a dramatic reduction in plasma PON activity after 16 h. However, injection of OX-PAPC into IL-6 −/− mice had no such effect. Others have found that, in IL-6-deficient mice, IL-6 was absolutely required for the transcriptional induction of hepatic APR genes following injection of turpentine oil (29Dahmen H. Horsten U. Kuster A. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. Kerr I.M. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. Heinrich P.C. Muller-Newen G. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Tissue levels of oxidized phospholipids were not measured in thein vivo studies reported here. Therefore, we cannot determine the role of oxidized lipids in vivo directly from these studies. For the purpose of discussion, we assume that these lipids were formed as they were in our previous studies (7Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Ivandic B. Qiao J.H. Huber J. Faull K.F. Grass D.S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. de Beer F.C. Lusis A.J. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cells of the artery wall behave differently with respect to IL-6 in response to oxidized phospholipids, we incubated aortic endothelial cells with OX-PAPC in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody to IL-6 and measured the release of MCP-1 into the tissue culture medium. We had previously demonstrated, using neutralizing antibody to MCP-1, that >95% of the monocyte chemotactic activity in an artery wall coculture system was due to the presence of MCP-1 (30Navab M. Imes S.S. Hough G.P. Hama S.Y. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Although IL-6 itself increased MCP-1 secretion from endothelial cells, we found that neutralizing antibody to IL-6 did not alter OX-PAPC-induced MCP-1 secretion by endothelial cells (Fig. 6). Moreover, neutralizing antibody to IL-6 had no effect on OX-PAPC-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7). We reasoned that if indeed IL-6 had a role in mediating the action of oxidized lipids in the liver, then this cytokine might also have an influence on the events in the artery wall leading to the development of fatty streaks. To test this hypothesis, IL-6 −/− mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 15 weeks and compared with their background strain, C57BL/6J mice, for the extent of lesion development. To our surprise, IL-6 −/− mice were found to have significantly greater areas of fatty streak involvement in their aortas than did WT mice (Fig. 9) despite the small but significant changes in PON activity. Sukovich (13Sukovich D. Kauser K. Rubanyi G.M. Circulation. 1999; 100: 217Google Scholar) recently reported in abstract form that there was no difference in plaque surface area in apoE/IL-6 double knockout mice compared with apoE −/− mice, but that the plaques were less fibrotic. IL-6 −/− mice treated with lipopolysaccharide had a 3-fold greater production of TNF-α than in wild type controls (31Tilg H. Dinarello C.A. Mier J.W. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 428-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In other studies, IL-6 −/− mice had 30–50% of the circulating plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-1β (32Cuzzocrea S. De Sarro G. Costantino G. Ciliberto G. Mazzon E. De Sarro A. Caputi A.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our study, the decrease in PON activity in IL-6 −/− mice was slightly although significantly less than in the WT mice on the atherogenic diet. However, there was a substantial reduction in PON activity in both the IL-6 −/− and the WT mice fed the atherogenic diet compared with the mice fed a chow diet. The difference between the results in Figs. 5 and 8 may result from a difference in the magnitude and duration of the oxidative stress (15 weeks on the atherogenic diet). In the chronic situation, PON activity was decreased despite the absence of IL-6. This suggests that IL-6 may be critical to short term regulation of PON, but not to long term regulation. If these results can be extrapolated to humans, it might also suggest that short term regulation of PON activity mediated by IL-6, together with the IL-6 induction of MCP-1 in endothelial cells (Fig. 6), might exacerbate the inflammatory reaction in an established atherosclerotic lesion.A number of epidemiological studies have observed a link between acute inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in the levels of plasma C-reactive protein have been linked with an increased cardiovascular risk (33Kuller L.H. Tracy R.P. Shaten J. Meilahn E.N. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1996; 144: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Concentrations of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A have also been shown to increase acutely after cholescystectomy, returning to normal within 2 weeks (34Kumon Y. Nakauchi Y. Kidawara K. Fukushima M. Kobayashi S. Ikeda Y. Suehiro T. Hashimoto K. Sipe J.D. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasma concentrations of IL-6 are elevated in a number of inflammatory states as diverse as rheumatoid arthritis (35Robak T. Gladalska A. Stepien H. Robak E. Mediat. Inflamm. 1998; 7: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), lymphoma (36Herbelin C. Roux-Lombard P. Herbelin A. Peuchmaur M. De Groote D. Griscelli C. Dayer J.M. Prieur A.M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1998; 9: 57-60PubMed Google Scholar), orthopedic surgery (37van Deuren M. Twickler T.B. de Waal Malefyt M.C. Van Beem H. van der Ven-Jongekrijg J.

Filella X. Heras M. Sanz G. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 2000; 19: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since IL-6 has been shown to induce the serum amyloid A promoter (39Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is possible that factors that can elevate IL-6 levels, such as oxidized phospholipids, may be an initial step in the alterations observed during an acute phase response. In mice, inoculation with murine cytomegalovirus increased LDL-derived cholesterol and resulted in a greater incidence of early atherosclerotic lesions (40Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5006) Google Scholar).Chlamydia pneumoniae has been repeatedly demonstrated to be associated with the incidence of atherosclerosis by both serology and the demonstration of the organism in atherosclerotic lesions (41Kol A. Sukhova G.K. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. Circulation. 1998; 98: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). An intriguing relationship has also been made between acute respiratory infections and the risk of first time acute myocardial infarction (42Meier C.R. Jick S.S. Derby L.E. Vasilakis C. Jick H. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1467-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that the presence of an inflammatory response has a prognostic value in patients with unstable angina and may predict the long term risk of cardiovascular events (43Biasucci L.M. Vitelli A. Liuzzo G. Altamura S. Caligiuri G. Monaco C. Rebuzzi A.G. Ciliberto G. Maseri A. Circulation. 1996; 94: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Finally, there are results of two preliminary antibiotic treatment trials using azithromycin for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (44Grayston J.T. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1669-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that the nonspecific immune response to these infectious agents, the APR, may play a role, and may be a mechanism linking infections with chronic inflammatory processes. Work in this laboratory is currently focused on the specific initiators of the oxidant stress-mediated development of early atherosclerotic lesions, and investigating further the relationship between lipid oxidation and the APR. We previously reported that high density lipoprotein (HDL)1-associated enzymes can protect LDL against oxidation by aortic wall cells (1Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Sevanian A. Prescott S.M.

Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). However, we also reported that during an acute phase response (APR) in both humans and rabbits, HDL lost these protective enzymes and was converted from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory particle (3Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In other studies we observed that feeding an atherogenic diet to mice genetically susceptible to atherosclerosis resulted in changes similar to those seen in the APR. Both the plasma and hepatic expression of two HDL- associated proteins, apolipoprotein (apo) J and paraoxonase (PON), were altered. ApoJ, a marker of the acute phase response, was increased, but there was a marked decline in PON expression and activity (3Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M.

These changes were not seen in mice genetically resistant to atherosclerosis (4Navab M. Hama-Levy S. Van Lenten B.J. Fonarow G.C. Cardinez C.J. Castellani L.W. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. La Du B.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2005-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Injection of oxidized phospholipids responsible for the biological activity of mildly oxidized LDL into susceptible mice resulted in a similar pattern of expression,i.e. apoJ was increased, whereas PON was reduced (4Navab M. Hama-Levy S. Van Lenten B.J. Fonarow G.C. Cardinez C.J. Castellani L.W. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. La Du B.N. J. Clin.

Previously, we had demonstrated that injection of mildly oxidized LDL but not native LDL induced the expression of JE, the murine homologue for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (5Liao F.

We also had reported that an atherogenic diet induced conjugated dienes and the expression of several inflammatory and oxidative stress-responsive genes in the liver of C57BL/6J mice (6Liao F.

More recently we reported that an atherogenic diet when fed to mice induced the hepatic formation of the oxidized phospholipids that are responsible for the biologic activity of mildly oxidized LDL (7Leitinger N.

Another principal mediator of the APR, IL-6, is also known to affect the hepatic synthesis of a number of apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants (10Koj A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), in vivo and in vitro (11Mullen P.G. Windsor A.C. Walsh C.J. Fowler III, A.A. Sugerman H.J. J. Surg.

Studies from the literature support both a positive (12Huber S.A. Sakkinen P. Conze D. Hardin N. Tracy R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2364-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and negative role (13Sukovich D. Kauser K. Rubanyi G.M. Circulation. 1999; 100: 217Google Scholar) for IL-6 in the development of atherosclerosis. The data reported here demonstrate that oxidized phospholipids found in mildly oxidized LDL act to acutely alter the expression of PON and apoJ, at least in part, through the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. However, the mechanisms by which oxidized phospholipids alter PON and apoJ expression in the liver are different from those required to induce MCP-1, and the short-term regulation of PON differs from long term regulation. DISCUSSIONOur previous results in animal models demonstrated that the decrease in the PON/apoJ ratio induced by administration of oxidized phospholipids, by a high fat atherogenic diet, or during an APR contributed to the formation of HDL that were no longer anti-inflammatory in nature but were in fact pro-inflammatory (3Van Lenten B.J. Hama S.Y. de Beer F.C. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Navab M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 4Navab M.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that specific oxidized phospholipids found in MM-LDL affected the gene expression of two HDL-associated proteins, PON and apoJ, when incubated with cultured HepG2 cells. This response was blocked by antibodies to IL-6. HepG2 cells treated directly with IL-6 in the absence of oxidized phospholipids showed the same pattern of response for PON and apoJ mRNA expression.Others have noted effects of cytokines on hepatic lipoprotein synthesis, suggesting a link between the acute phase response and the development of atherosclerosis.

(1999) FEBS Lett. 446, 264–268). The TMSs form two clusters separated by a large intracellular loop between TMS5 and TMS6. We have combined cysteine mutagenesis and oxidative cross-linking to study proximity relationships of TMSs in the exchanger. Pairs of cysteines were reintroduced into a cysteine-less exchanger, one in a TMS in the NH2-terminal cluster (TMSs 1–5) and the other in a TMS in the COOH-terminal cluster (TMSs 6–9). The mutant exchanger proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, and disulfide bond formation between introduced cysteines was analyzed by gel mobility shifts. Western blots showed that S117C/V804C, A122C/Y892C, A151C/T815C, and A151C/A821C mutant proteins migrated at 120 kDa under reducing conditions and displayed a partial mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions. This shift indicates the formation of a disulfide bond between these paired cysteine residues. Copper phenanthroline and the cross-linker N′,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide enhanced the mobility shift to 160 kDa. Our data suggest that TMS7 is close to TMS3 near the intracellular side of the membrane and is in the vicinity of TMS2 near the extracellular surface. Also, TMS2 must adjoin TMS8.

These polytopic membrane proteins are electrogenic transporters that can utilize the Na+electrochemical gradient to exchange three extracellular Na+ ions for one intracellular Ca2+ ion (4Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a Ca2+ efflux mechanism, the primary function of the exchanger is to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, especially in excitable cells where rapid and substantial Ca2+ fluxes are important in signaling pathways. In heart, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is the dominant Ca2+ efflux mechanism important in beat-to-beat relaxation (reviewed in Ref. 5Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From deletion experiments, it has been determined that the large cytoplasmic domain (loop f) is not essential for ion transport (12Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the exchanger also reveals that there are two homologous regions consisting of residues spanning portions of TMSs 2–3 and TMS7 plus part of loop h, respectively (shading in Fig. 1). These regions are designated as the α1 and α2 repeats and are conserved among all exchangers (14 and reviewed in Ref. 5Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 113-133Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies show that exchanger activity is highly sensitive to mutagenesis of residues in the α-repeats. Even conservative mutations alter or eliminate activity (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The putative α-helices of the α-repeats (TMSs 2, 3, and 7) are amphipathic, and the hydrophilic faces of these helices may form a portion of the ion translocation pathway (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The electrophoretic mobility of the exchanger is different under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The exchanger proteins purified from canine cardiac sarcolemma migrate on SDS-PAGE as two bands with apparent molecular masses of 70 and 120 kDa in the presence of reducing agents (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 120-kDa protein species represents the mature protein, whereas the 70-kDa protein is an active proteolytic fragment of variable amount. Under nonreducing conditions, the apparent molecular mass of the 120-kDa protein shifts to 160 kDa (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that this mobility shift is due to an intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine at position 792 in loop g and the cysteine at either position 14 or 20 near the NH2 terminus of the exchanger (17Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation apparently induces a significant conformational change in the exchanger protein under SDS-PAGE conditions.The three-dimensional arrangement of the TMS helices of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is unknown. Understanding the transport mechanism of the exchanger will require knowledge of the helix packing. It is not yet possible to crystallize the exchanger protein because of difficulties in producing a large amount of pure functional protein as well as difficulty in crystallizing membrane proteins in general. Alternative approaches to obtain structural information on membrane proteins are being developed. In this study, we employed an approach combining cysteine mutagenesis with disulfide cross-linking (18Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to analyze the arrangement of TMSs in the exchanger. Pairs of cysteines were reintroduced into a cysteine-less (cys-less) exchanger, and the mutant exchanger proteins were expressed in HEK cells. Disulfide cross-linking was detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Four cross-links have been identified, which provide initial information on the helix packing of the exchanger. Our data indicate that the same interface of TMS7 is close to TMS2 near the extracellular side but is adjacent to TMS3 near the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and that TMS2 adjoins TMS8. This suggests that the functionally important domains, the α 1 and α2 repeats, are in the close proximity.DISCUSSIONA number of membrane proteins have been reported to have a retarded electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to what has been observed for many soluble proteins in which preserving intramolecular disulfide bonds during SDS-PAGE generally leads to an increased mobility. It has been further noted that for the mobility shift of membrane proteins to occur in the absence of reducing agents, residues involved in disulfide bond formation or cross-linking must be distantly spaced (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have reported that purified cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins migrate differently in SDS-PAGE depending on the redox environment: a 120-kDa band in the presence and a 160-kDa band in the absence of dithiothreitol (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By systematically removing each of the 15 endogenous cysteine residues, Santacruz-Toloza et al. (17Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) determined that the mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions is primarily due to the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond between residues Cys-20 and Cys-792. Residues Cys-20 and Cys-792 are located in extracellular segments connecting TMSs in the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal clusters, respectively. Between the two clusters is a large intracellular loop (loop f about 550 amino acid residues in length) that is capable of undergoing dramatic conformational changes (22Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformation of loop f may contribute to the variation in apparent molecular mass of the exchanger. Under reducing conditions, when there is no disulfide bond connecting the two TMS clusters, loop f may form a more compact structure, and the exchanger migrates as a 120-kDa band. When a disulfide bond between the two TMS clusters brings helices into a more tightly packed bundle, loop f may extend further from the membrane. This “parachute” effect may result in the mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions.By introducing paired cysteine residues back into the cys-less background, one in each half of the protein, we show here that a number of exchanger mutants also displayed a mobility shift under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). This implies that spontaneous disulfide bond formation occurs between the introduced paired cysteines. Treatment with CuPhe significantly enhanced the mobility shift. Thus, the mobility shift provides a useful tool to study proximity relationships of transmembrane helices in the exchanger.We screened a total of 66 exchanger mutants with double cysteines (Table I). Four pairs induced mobility shifts that were enhanced with cross-linking reagents (Figs. 3 and 4). Based on these data, we propose an initial packing model for TMSs 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the exchanger (Fig.6). Disulfide bond formation between S117C and V804C indicates that TMS7 is in close proximity to TMS2 at the extracellular side of the membrane. At the intracellular side of the membrane, TMS7 is in the vicinity of TMS3 as indicated by cross-linking of A151C/A821C. Furthermore, residues Cys-804 and Cys-821 in TMS7, which are adjacent to TMS2 and TMS3, are located on the same surface of TMS7 (Fig. 6) according to helical wheel modeling. This suggests that the same surface of TMS7 interacts with TMS2 at the extracellular and TMS3 at the intracellular side of the membrane. Possibly TMS7 tilts in the membrane between TMSs 2 and 3 or has a bend. A proline residue at position 813 in the center of TMS7 may facilitate a nonhelical structure and/or a bend. On this surface of TMS7, mutations S811T (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Also, there is experimental evidence that loop c connecting TMSs 2 and 3 re-enters the membrane from the extracellular side of the membrane (7Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the two proposed re-entrant loops may be constrained to be in close proximity.It has been suggested previously that the α1 and α2 repeats, comprising parts of TMSs 2, 3, and 7 and loop h, form a portion of the ion translocation pathway (14Schwarz E.M.

Within the α-repeat regions, we have previously identified mutations in TMSs 2, 3, and 7, which either abolish or lead to a decreased exchanger activity, including mutations at Ser-109, Ser-110, Glu-113, and Glu-120 (TMS2); Ser-139 and Asn-143 (TMS3); Ser-811, Asp-814, and Ser-818 (TMS7) (Ref. 15Nicoll D.A.

Nicoll, and K. D. Philipson, unpublished results.). Strikingly, these residues line the helical surfaces that face one another according to our initial helix packing model. Therefore, our data provide structural evidence for the earlier suggestion that hydrophilic faces of amphipathic TMSs 2, 3, and 7 form a portion of the ion translocation pathway.Also, our data support recent topology models (6Nicoll D.A.

In initial models (23Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), this would not be possible as the orientation of TMS7 (TMS8 of earlier models) would be reversed. This information will be helpful in designing future experiments to further elucidate helical interactions within the exchanger. More importantly, accumulation of structural information will greatly facilitate understanding of the mechanism of ion translocation. Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins are present in a wide variety of tissues (1Kofuji P. Lederer W. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lee S.L., Yu, A.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These polytopic membrane proteins are electrogenic transporters that can utilize the Na+electrochemical gradient to exchange three extracellular Na+ ions for one intracellular Ca2+ ion (4Reeves J.P. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a Ca2+ efflux mechanism, the primary function of the exchanger is to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, especially in excitable cells where rapid and substantial Ca2+ fluxes are important in signaling pathways. In heart, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is the dominant Ca2+ efflux mechanism important in beat-to-beat relaxation (reviewed in Ref. 5Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 113-133Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Based on a combination of hydropathy analysis, cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl modification, immunolocalization, and functional measurements, the exchanger is modeled to have nine transmembrane segments (TMSs)1 and two possible re-entrant loops (see Fig. 1) (6Nicoll D.A.

The amino-terminal cluster is comprised of TMSs 1–5 with a possible re-entrant loop between TMSs 2 and 3, whereas the C-terminal cluster is comprised of TMSs 6–9 with a possible re-entrant loop between TMSs 7 and 8 (6Nicoll D.A.

Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From deletion experiments, it has been determined that the large cytoplasmic domain (loop f) is not essential for ion transport (12Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the exchanger also reveals that there are two homologous regions consisting of residues spanning portions of TMSs 2–3 and TMS7 plus part of loop h, respectively (shading in Fig. 1). These regions are designated as the α1 and α2 repeats and are conserved among all exchangers (14 and reviewed in Ref. 5Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 113-133Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies show that exchanger activity is highly sensitive to mutagenesis of residues in the α-repeats. Even conservative mutations alter or eliminate activity (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The putative α-helices of the α-repeats (TMSs 2, 3, and 7) are amphipathic, and the hydrophilic faces of these helices may form a portion of the ion translocation pathway (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of the exchanger is different under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The exchanger proteins purified from canine cardiac sarcolemma migrate on SDS-PAGE as two bands with apparent molecular masses of 70 and 120 kDa in the presence of reducing agents (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 120-kDa protein species represents the mature protein, whereas the 70-kDa protein is an active proteolytic fragment of variable amount. Under nonreducing conditions, the apparent molecular mass of the 120-kDa protein shifts to 160 kDa (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that this mobility shift is due to an intramolecular disulfide bond between the cysteine at position 792 in loop g and the cysteine at either position 14 or 20 near the NH2 terminus of the exchanger (17Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation apparently induces a significant conformational change in the exchanger protein under SDS-PAGE conditions. The three-dimensional arrangement of the TMS helices of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is unknown. Understanding the transport mechanism of the exchanger will require knowledge of the helix packing. It is not yet possible to crystallize the exchanger protein because of difficulties in producing a large amount of pure functional protein as well as difficulty in crystallizing membrane proteins in general. Alternative approaches to obtain structural information on membrane proteins are being developed. In this study, we employed an approach combining cysteine mutagenesis with disulfide cross-linking (18Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to analyze the arrangement of TMSs in the exchanger. Pairs of cysteines were reintroduced into a cysteine-less (cys-less) exchanger, and the mutant exchanger proteins were expressed in HEK cells. Disulfide cross-linking was detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Four cross-links have been identified, which provide initial information on the helix packing of the exchanger. Our data indicate that the same interface of TMS7 is close to TMS2 near the extracellular side but is adjacent to TMS3 near the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and that TMS2 adjoins TMS8. This suggests that the functionally important domains, the α 1 and α2 repeats, are in the close proximity. DISCUSSIONA number of membrane proteins have been reported to have a retarded electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Rice W.J. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to what has been observed for many soluble proteins in which preserving intramolecular disulfide bonds during SDS-PAGE generally leads to an increased mobility. It has been further noted that for the mobility shift of membrane proteins to occur in the absence of reducing agents, residues involved in disulfide bond formation or cross-linking must be distantly spaced (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have reported that purified cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins migrate differently in SDS-PAGE depending on the redox environment: a 120-kDa band in the presence and a 160-kDa band in the absence of dithiothreitol (16Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By systematically removing each of the 15 endogenous cysteine residues, Santacruz-Toloza et al. (17Santacruz-Toloza L.K. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) determined that the mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions is primarily due to the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond between residues Cys-20 and Cys-792. Residues Cys-20 and Cys-792 are located in extracellular segments connecting TMSs in the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal clusters, respectively. Between the two clusters is a large intracellular loop (loop f about 550 amino acid residues in length) that is capable of undergoing dramatic conformational changes (22Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformation of loop f may contribute to the variation in apparent molecular mass of the exchanger. Under reducing conditions, when there is no disulfide bond connecting the two TMS clusters, loop f may form a more compact structure, and the exchanger migrates as a 120-kDa band. When a disulfide bond between the two TMS clusters brings helices into a more tightly packed bundle, loop f may extend further from the membrane. This “parachute” effect may result in the mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions.By introducing paired cysteine residues back into the cys-less background, one in each half of the protein, we show here that a number of exchanger mutants also displayed a mobility shift under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3). This implies that spontaneous disulfide bond formation occurs between the introduced paired cysteines. Treatment with CuPhe significantly enhanced the mobility shift. Thus, the mobility shift provides a useful tool to study proximity relationships of transmembrane helices in the exchanger.We screened a total of 66 exchanger mutants with double cysteines (Table I). Four pairs induced mobility shifts that were enhanced with cross-linking reagents (Figs. 3 and 4). Based on these data, we propose an initial packing model for TMSs 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the exchanger (Fig.6). Disulfide bond formation between S117C and V804C indicates that TMS7 is in close proximity to TMS2 at the extracellular side of the membrane. At the intracellular side of the membrane, TMS7 is in the vicinity of TMS3 as indicated by cross-linking of A151C/A821C. Furthermore, residues Cys-804 and Cys-821 in TMS7, which are adjacent to TMS2 and TMS3, are located on the same surface of TMS7 (Fig. 6) according to helical wheel modeling. This suggests that the same surface of TMS7 interacts with TMS2 at the extracellular and TMS3 at the intracellular side of the membrane. Possibly TMS7 tilts in the membrane between TMSs 2 and 3 or has a bend. A proline residue at position 813 in the center of TMS7 may facilitate a nonhelical structure and/or a bend. On this surface of TMS7, mutations S811T (15Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

This requires a reasonable length for the loop connecting TMSs 7 and 8. Significantly, loop h connecting TMSs 7 and 8 is modeled to be 49 amino acid residues in length and includes a speculative P-loop-like region (Ref. 6Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu Y. Lu L. Philipson K.D.

Within the α-repeat regions, we have previously identified mutations in TMSs 2, 3, and 7, which either abolish or lead to a decreased exchanger activity, including mutations at Ser-109, Ser-110, Glu-113, and Glu-120 (TMS2); Ser-139 and Asn-143 (TMS3); Ser-811, Asp-814, and Ser-818 (TMS7) (Ref. 15Nicoll D.A.

Therefore, our data provide structural evidence for the earlier suggestion that hydrophilic faces of amphipathic TMSs 2, 3, and 7 form a portion of the ion translocation pathway. Also, our data support recent topology models (6Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu Y. Lu L. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

In initial models (23Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), this would not be possible as the orientation of TMS7 (TMS8 of earlier models) would be reversed. This information will be helpful in designing future experiments to further elucidate helical interactions within the exchanger. More importantly, accumulation of structural information will greatly facilitate understanding of the mechanism of ion translocation. We are grateful to Dr. H. R.

To test whether pathways leading to oxidative apoptosis in epithelial cells are sensitive to molecular O2, A549 cells were exposed to 95% O2 prior to exposure to lethal concentrations of H2O2. The extent of H2O2-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in cells preexposed to hyperoxia compared with room-air controls. Preexposure of the hyperoxia-resistant HeLa-80 cell line to 80% O2 also inhibited oxidant-induced apoptosis, suggesting that this inhibition is not due to O2toxicity. Because hyperoxia generates reactive oxygen species and activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), the role of antioxidant enzymes and NF-κB were examined in this inhibitory process. The onset of inhibition appeared to be directly related to the degradation of IκB and subsequent activation of NF-κB (either by hyperoxia or TNF-α), whereas no significant up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities was found. In addition, suppression of NF-κB activities by transfecting A549 cells with a dominant-negative mutant construct of IκB significantly augmented the extent of H2O2-induced apoptosis.

These observations raise the possibility that hyperoxia actually inhibits apoptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells.There are several possible ways that hyperoxia might inhibit apoptosis in pulmonary epithelial cells. First, one or more enzymes in the apoptotic pathway might be sensitive to direct oxidation by high levels of molecular O2, resulting in an irreversible abrogation of the apoptotic pathway in these cells. Alternatively, hyperoxia may activate pathways that inhibit apoptosis. Several laboratories have shown that activation of the transcription factor NF-κB can prevent apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation in cultured cells (6Wang C.Y.

In this report, we examined whether preexposure of cultured epithelial cells to hyperoxia prevents subsequent oxidant-induced apoptosis and whether NF-κB activation or up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs)1 mediate this inhibitory process.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that preexposure of epithelial cells to hyperoxia inhibits the onset of apoptosis caused by exposure to H2O2 or paraquat. Because this protection occurs in cells that do not suffer from oxygen toxicity, this effect is not merely a consequence of overall cell poisoning of an apoptotic pathway but appears to result from the activation of NF-κB-mediated survival pathways. That these pathways might be activated by NF-κB was demonstrated not only by the activation of NF-κB by both hyperoxia and TNF-α, which afford similar protection from oxidative apoptosis, but also by the augmentation of oxidative apoptosis in cells with suppressed NF-κB activity.Resistance to Oxidative Injury Is Mediated by Specific Survival Pathways Instead of Oxygen ToxicityExposure to sublethal levels of hyperoxia has been shown to increase resistance to further hyperoxic injury and improve survival rates in animal models (26Crapo J. Tierney D. Am. J. Physiol. 1974; 226: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 27Capellier G. Maupoil V. Boussat S. Laurent E. Neidhardt A. Minerva Anestesiol. 1999; 65: 388-392PubMed Google Scholar). Preexposing cultured mammalian cells to oxidants can also prime or “desensitize” the cells to further oxidative injury (22Pietarinen-Runtti P. Raivio K. Saksela M. Asikainen T. Kinnula V. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Wiese A. Pacifici R. Davies K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms for this acquired resistance have not been well delineated and, based on correlative data, may in some cases be a consequence of preinduction of antioxidant enzyme defenses (29Clerch L. Massaro D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Yoo J. Erzurum S. Hay J. Lemarchand P. Crystal R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 297-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations in A549 cells (Fig. 5) indicate that resistance to oxidant-induced apoptosis is not mediated through increased activities of endogenous AOEs. This notion is further supported by results from HeLa-80 cells preexposed to hyperoxia and TNF-α-treated A549 cells that do not up-regulate AOE activities but show resistance to oxidant-induced apoptosis.Although prolonged exposure to hyperoxia is lethal to most cells, it does not kill pulmonary epithelial cells via apoptosis. On the other hand, oxidants such as H2O2 and paraquat cause these cells to undergo apoptosis (3Kazzaz J.A. Xu J. Palaia T.A. Mantell L. Fein A.M. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15182-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Jyonouchi H. Sun S. Abiru T. Chareancholvanich S. Ingbar D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The reasons for this remain unclear. It is likely that at least some of the organellar and/or macromolecular sites of O2 damage are different from sites affected by other oxidants, because molecular O2diffuses throughout the cell and can target virtually all organelles and cytosolic molecules. One possible explanation for the lack of apoptosis associated with hyperoxia in these cells is that one or more steps in the oxidative pathway to apoptosis might be sensitive to direct oxidation by high levels of molecular O2. For example, caspases may become oxidized and lose their ability to initiate and execute apoptosis (31Hampton M. Orrenius S. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 102–103: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, our results demonstrate that cells preexposed to hyperoxia still undergo apoptosis upon subsequent exposure to H2O2, suggesting that apoptotic pathways are either incompletely inhibited by molecular O2 or circumvented by subsequent oxidant injury. Our studies further suggest that hyperoxia inhibits apoptosis by activation of prosurvival pathways, rather than via inactivating the apoptotic pathway through oxidization of the macromolecules.Activation of NF-κB via the IKK Pathway in Hyperoxic Preexposed Cells May Be Responsible for the Inhibition of Oxidant-induced ApoptosisNF-κB is an oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor that can be activated by a variety of agents, including cytokines and oxidants (32Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 33Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D., IV Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar), and has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 family members and caspases (34Wang C. Guttridge D. Mayo M. Baldwin A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar,35de Moissac D. Zheng H. Kirshenbaum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29505-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hyperoxia activates NF-κB in both animal models and epithelial cells (5Li Y. Zhang W. Mantell L. Kazzaz J. Fein A. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20646-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Choi A.M.K. Sylvester S. Otterbein L. Holbrook N.J. Am. J.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that preexposure to hyperoxia inhibits subsequent oxidant-induced apoptosis. This inhibition was effective even with limited (30 min) preexposure to hyperoxia. This time frame of inhibition, from 30 min to 48 h, associates closely with the activation of NF-κB (5Li Y. Zhang W. Mantell L. Kazzaz J. Fein A. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20646-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and IκB degradation (Fig. 7 A), an indicator for the activation of the IKK signal transduction pathway. These data suggest that activation of NF-κB via the IKK pathway is involved in this inhibitory process. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that the extent of oxidative apoptosis is concomitantly affected by the levels of NF-κB activity altered either by preexposure to TNF-α (Fig. 6) or by transfection with a DNM construct of IκB in A549 cells (Fig. 8). Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced inhibition corresponds to an increase of nuclear translocation of NF-κB in oxygen-resistant HeLa-80 cells exposed to hyperoxia (data not shown). Because hyperoxia activates NF-κB in both rat and mouse lungs (36Choi A.M.K. Sylvester S. Otterbein L. Holbrook N.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Shea L. Beehler C. Schwartz M. Shenkar R. Tuder R. Abraham E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar), activation of NF-κB may also be important in conferring resistance to further oxidative injury by reducing oxidant-induced apoptosis in these animal models.The mechanism by which NF-κB may inhibit oxidant-induced apoptosis is unclear. One possibility is that activation of NF-κB may change the oxidative equilibrium in the cellular milieu to a less oxidative state. This notion is supported by the studies reported by Haddad and colleagues (38Haddad J.J.E. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An increase in NF-κB activation can be achieved by treating cells with an antioxidant, N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine, suggesting a correlation between NF-κB activation and increased antioxidant capacity. On the other hand, inhibiting NF-κB activation by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate favors an oxidative equilibrium of glutathione (GSH) by lowering the ratio of GSH to its oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (38Haddad J.J.E. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). NF-κB may also participate in the protective process by up-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and/or survival and stress-response factors such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 can be markedly up-regulated by hyperoxia (30Yoo J. Erzurum S. Hay J. Lemarchand P. Crystal R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 297-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee P. Alam J. Sylvester S. Inamdar N. Otterbein L. Choi A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and over-expression of HO-1 protects A549 cells from further hyperoxic injury (40Lee P. Alam J. Wiegand G. Choi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10393-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 5′-upstream region of HO-1 contains some potential NF-κB binding consensus sequences (41Elbirt K. Bonkovsky H. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and over-expression of NF-κB can specifically enhance the expression of HO-1 (42Lavrovsky Y. Song C. Chatterjee B. Roy A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 114: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further work on characterizing these signal transduction pathways will lead to greater understanding of how these pathways can be regulated. Pulmonary epithelial cell injury is an unfortunate consequence of therapy with supraphysiological concentrations of oxygen (hyperoxia) and a prominent feature of acute inflammatory lung injury (1Freeman B.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that preexposure to hyperoxia inhibits subsequent oxidant-induced apoptosis. This inhibition was effective even with limited (30 min) preexposure to hyperoxia. This time frame of inhibition, from 30 min to 48 h, associates closely with the activation of NF-κB (5Li Y. Zhang W. Mantell L. Kazzaz J. Fein A. Horowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20646-20649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and IκB degradation (Fig. 7 A), an indicator for the activation of the IKK signal transduction pathway. These data suggest that activation of NF-κB via the IKK pathway is involved in this inhibitory process. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that the extent of oxidative apoptosis is concomitantly affected by the levels of NF-κB activity altered either by preexposure to TNF-α (Fig. 6) or by transfection with a DNM construct of IκB in A549 cells (Fig. 8). Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced inhibition corresponds to an increase of nuclear translocation of NF-κB in oxygen-resistant HeLa-80 cells exposed to hyperoxia (data not shown). Because hyperoxia activates NF-κB in both rat and mouse lungs (36Choi A.M.K. Sylvester S. Otterbein L. Holbrook N.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Shea L. Beehler C. Schwartz M. Shenkar R. Tuder R. Abraham E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar), activation of NF-κB may also be important in conferring resistance to further oxidative injury by reducing oxidant-induced apoptosis in these animal models.The mechanism by which NF-κB may inhibit oxidant-induced apoptosis is unclear. One possibility is that activation of NF-κB may change the oxidative equilibrium in the cellular milieu to a less oxidative state. This notion is supported by the studies reported by Haddad and colleagues (38Haddad J.J.E. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An increase in NF-κB activation can be achieved by treating cells with an antioxidant, N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine, suggesting a correlation between NF-κB activation and increased antioxidant capacity. On the other hand, inhibiting NF-κB activation by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate favors an oxidative equilibrium of glutathione (GSH) by lowering the ratio of GSH to its oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (38Haddad J.J.E. Olver R.E. Land S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21130-21139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). NF-κB may also participate in the protective process by up-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and/or survival and stress-response factors such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 can be markedly up-regulated by hyperoxia (30Yoo J. Erzurum S. Hay J. Lemarchand P. Crystal R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 297-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee P. Alam J. Sylvester S. Inamdar N. Otterbein L. Choi A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and over-expression of HO-1 protects A549 cells from further hyperoxic injury (40Lee P. Alam J. Wiegand G. Choi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10393-10398Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 5′-upstream region of HO-1 contains some potential NF-κB binding consensus sequences (41Elbirt K. Bonkovsky H. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and over-expression of NF-κB can specifically enhance the expression of HO-1 (42Lavrovsky Y. Song C. Chatterjee B. Roy A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 114: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further work on characterizing these signal transduction pathways will lead to greater understanding of how these pathways can be regulated. We have shown that preexposure of epithelial cells to hyperoxia inhibits the onset of apoptosis caused by exposure to H2O2 or paraquat. Because this protection occurs in cells that do not suffer from oxygen toxicity, this effect is not merely a consequence of overall cell poisoning of an apoptotic pathway but appears to result from the activation of NF-κB-mediated survival pathways. That these pathways might be activated by NF-κB was demonstrated not only by the activation of NF-κB by both hyperoxia and TNF-α, which afford similar protection from oxidative apoptosis, but also by the augmentation of oxidative apoptosis in cells with suppressed NF-κB activity. Resistance to Oxidative Injury Is Mediated by Specific Survival Pathways Instead of Oxygen ToxicityExposure to sublethal levels of hyperoxia has been shown to increase resistance to further hyperoxic injury and improve survival rates in animal models (26Crapo J.

In the present study we investigated the mechanism of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in response to H. pylori infection. We demonstrate that H. pyloriinduces the synthesis of PGE2 via release of arachidonic acid predominately from phosphatidylinositol. In contrast to H. pylori wild type, an isogenic H. pylori strain with a mutation in the pathogenicity island exerts only weak arachidonic acid and PGE2 synthesis. The H. pylori-induced arachidonic acid release was abolished by phospholipase A2(PLA2) inhibitors and by pertussis toxin (affects the activity of Gαi/Gαo).

In gastrointestinal epithelia, PGE2 is implicated in maintaining the normal function and structure of the gastric mucosa by modulating diverse cellular functions such as secretion of fluid and electrolytes, mucosal blood flow, and cell proliferation (5Eberhart C.E.

Studies have shown that H. pylori strains differ in their virulence and in their ability to trigger the induction of inflammatory mediators in gastric epithelial cell lines (1Bodger K. Crabtree JE.

One of the mechanisms for increased PG production in response to H. pylori infection is an induction of COX-2 expression (20Eckmann L. Stenson W.F. Savidge T.C. Lowe D.C. Barrett K.E. Fierer J. Smith J.R. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,21Romano M. Ricci V. Memoli A. Tuccillo C. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Acquaviva A.M. Del Vecchio B. Bruni C.B. Zarrilli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28560-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Another rate-limiting step in the control of PG production is the release of AA from membrane phospholipids, which is known to occur via a number of different pathways. One involves the activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), others involve the action of PLC or phospholipase D (PLD) (22Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 23Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 24Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In this report, we studied the control of PGE2 and AA production in response to H. pylori infection of epithelial cells after specific labeling of potential phospholipid precursors and selective inhibition of enzymes involved in the pathways of AA production. The presented results provide evidence that colonization of epithelial cells by H. pylori induces a release of PGE2 and AA by activation of the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) via pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gαi/Gαo proteins and the p38 stress-activated kinase cascade. This process does not seem to involve PLC or PLD pathways. The identification of H. pylori-specific signaling pathways leading to the induction of putative anti-inflammatory immune response mediators is of substantial interest for therapeutic intervention to overcome H. pylori-induced diseases. The isogenic H. pylori strains P12 wild type, cagA (mutation affect cagA with a probable polar effect in the PAI), and vacA (25Schmitt W. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) were used for colonization of human epithelial cell lines. For cultivation, the bacteria were resuspended in brain heart infusion (Difco) medium. 103 bacteria were seeded on agar plates containing 10% horse serum and cultured for 48–72 h at 37 °C in a microaerophilic atmosphere (generated by Campy Gen, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). For stock cultures, H. pylori was resuspended in brain heart infusion medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20% glycerol, and maintained at −70 °C. Gastric epithelial cells (AGS) and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), and 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were seeded into 35-mm-diameter Petri dishes or 6-well plates for 48 h before infection. 24 h before infection, the medium was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS. For the infection, the bacteria were harvested in PBS (pH 7.4) using sterile cotton swabs and diluted corresponding to the multiplicity of infection (MOI) as described in the figure legends. Cells were incubated for different periods of time in the absence (controls) or presence of the bacteria. To enhance the bacteria host cell interaction, bacteria were centrifuged onto the epithelial cell monolayer for 2 min at 500 × g. Infection with H. pylori was routinely monitored by light microscopy. Stimulation of the cells with 125 ng/ml melittin (Sigma) or 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, (Sigma) was performed for the indicated periods of time. Cells in 35-mm Petri dishes were metabolically labeled with 0.2 μCi of 14C-labeled AA (specific activity 55 mCi/mmol), 0.5 μCi of [methyl-14C]choline chloride (55 mCi/mmol), or 0.5 μCi of [14C]palmitic acid (57 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% FCS for 24 h. Approximately 95% of the total AA radioactivity, 35% of the total choline radioactivity, and 90% of the total palmitic acid radioactivity added to the medium was incorporated into the cells during this time. Lysophosphatidylinositol (lysoPI) formation was studied in cells prelabeled with 2 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol (16 Ci/mmol) (ICN Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% FCS for 24 h. Before infection, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with nonradioactive RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the same medium for 30 min. In some experiments, various inhibitors of kinases or lipid-metabolizing enzymes were added to the cells during this incubation. After the incubations, the medium was carefully removed for analysis, and lipids were extracted from the cells by the addition of chloroform, methanol, 20 mm acetic acid (50:220:10, v/v) to the dishes. In the case of the incubation media, chloroform/methanol (1:2.2, v/v) was added to give a single phase. The phase were split according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was dried, and lipids were applied on high performance thin layer chromatography (TLC, Merck) plates. For determination of lysoPI, the cells and media were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The organic extracts were dried and then subjected to butanol/water partition. The radiolabeled lipids were recovered in the butanol phases, which were washed with water, dried, and analyzed by TLC. For phospholipid analysis, the plates were first developed in chloroform, methanol, 30% aqueous ammonium hydroxide, water (90:54:5.5:5.5, v/v) followed by chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v) for the second direction. For improved separation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS), the plates were first developed in chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (60:12:24:18:6, v/v) followed by 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (80:26:26, v/v) for the second direction. The separation of lysolipids was obtained by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography using chloroform, methanol, 4 mammonium hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v). The 14C-containing radiolabeled spots were imaged for 2 h on a14C-sensitive screen and quantified on a Fuji Imaging System imager (FUJIFILM BAS-1000, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The 3H-containing radioactive lipids were detected by fluorography. The TLC plates were dipped in 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazol dissolved in 2-methylnaphthalene supplemented with 10% xylene (27Bonner W. Stedman J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat S films at −80 °C. The individual lipids were identified by comparison with commercial standards (Sigma). Phosphatidylethanol (PEt) standard was prepared as described in Huang and Cabot (28Huang C.F. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14858-14863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); LysoPI was prepared by PLA2 (Sigma) treatment of PI. Lipids and standards were visualized with common lipid-locating agents such as iodine or molybdenum blue spray for phosphate on the same plates. When analysis of the choline release was required, radioactivity released into the medium and associated with the cells was measured in aliquots of the media and the cell extracts before phase splitting using a Wallac 409 β-counter (Berthold-Wallac, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The content of PGE2 in the medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the procedure indicated by the manufacturer (DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany). For analysis of the formation of inositol phosphates, cells in 6-well plates were incubated for 24 h in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% FCS and 2 μCi of myo[3H]inositol (ICN Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany). Cells were washed two times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and preincubated with 10 mm LiCl (in this solution) for 10 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, PLC inhibitor was added to the cells during this incubation. Cells were then incubated with the bacteria for 120 min at 37 °C or stimulated either with lysophosphatidic acid (Sigma) or 0.1 mm ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as positive controls. The incubation was terminated by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 0.1m NaOH to the dishes. Neutralization of the extracts was performed with 0.2 m formic acid. Total inositol phosphates were determined as described in Schulz et al. (29Schulz A. Schöneberg T. Paschke R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the analysis of p38 activation, the cells were infected with H. pylori for the indicated periods of time, and the lysed cells were analyzed in an Immunoblot using a p38 phospho-specific antibody (sc-7973, Santa Cruz). The stripped blot (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with an anti-p38 antibody (sc-535, Santa Cruz) to indicate equivalent protein amounts in all lanes. For cPLA2 detection an anti-PLA2 antibody (sc-454, Santa Cruz) was used. The inhibitors used in this study were as follows: mepacrine, sodium arsenite (Sigma); 1-(6-(17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5-(10)trien-17-yl)amino/hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) (U73122), 1,6-bis-(cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino) hexane (RHC80267), methyl arachidonylfluorophosphonate (MAFP) (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany); aristolochic acid, haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS), 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA/AM), pertussis toxin (PTX), 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD98059), 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB202190), staurosporine, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), K-252a (Calbiochem). Stock solutions of U73122 and RHC80267 were prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C; mepacrine, aristolochic acid, HELSS, BAPTA/AM, PD98059, SB202190, BIM, and K-252a were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide; PTX was prepared in double-distilled water. For all experiments, the effect of the appropriate vehicle was also determined. To investigate whether H. pylori might elicit release of AA for PGE2 formation (PGE2 release was induced in HeLa and AGS cells infected with H. pylori wild type and an isogenic vacA mutant but not by an isogenic cagAmutant (data not shown)), 14C-labeled AA-labeled AGS and HeLa cells were incubated for different periods of time in the absence or presence of different H. pylori strains. To trap the released radioactivity (free AA and its metabolites) in the extracellular medium, incubation was performed in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Lipids were extracted from cells and their medium and analyzed by two-dimensional chromatography. As shown in Fig.1, colonization of AGS (Fig.1 A) and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B) by the P12 wild-type strain increased the intracellular accumulation and extracellular release of free radiolabeled AA as compared with controls. Typically, a 3–6-fold increase of free AA (intra- and extracellular 14C-labeled AA) over the basal release was observed within 60 min at a MOI of 200 (Fig.1 C), which did not increase further, suggesting reincorporation and/or metabolism of the released AA. Incubation of cells with isogenic vacA mutant induced a comparable increase in AA release like the wild-type strain, whereas incubation with the isogenic cagA mutant caused a significant lower increase in AA release. Melittin, known to stimulate AA release by direct activation of PLA2 (30Shier W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control and typically induced a 7–10-fold increase of AA over basal release. The analysis of 14C radioactivity in the cellular phospholipids revealed that the AA release induced by H. pylori (P12) was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the percentage of the total 14C-labeled AA content in the PS/PI pool (Table I). The magnitude of the decrease ranged from 30 to 50% within the experiments. In terms of total counts, the amount of 14C-labeled AA that disappeared from the phospholipid pool in H. pylori-colonized cells matched approximately the amount of radioactivity released. Two-dimensional phospholipid analysis, which separates PS from PI, revealed that PI was the exclusive source of AA in the PS/PI spot. The percentage of [14C]phosphatidylcholine (PC) decreased slightly, although these changes were only significant after longer time points (12% after 180 min). At longer time points, H. pyloricaused also a small increase (14% after 180 min) in the percentage of [14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) presumably by interconversion of intact phospholipids and reincorporation of released AA into PE specifically. In melittin-treated cells (positive control), the phospholipids whose radiolabeled content decreased were PC and PI. Exposure of cells to P12 wild-type strain or treatment with melittin resulted also in a small but significant increase in14C-labeled AA-labeled PA and probably reflects the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) via activation of PLC (see below) and its phosphorylation by DAG kinase (31Kanoh H.

Significant differences compared with the untreated control were determined by Student's paired t test. NL, neutral lipids. As shown in Fig.2, H. pylori(P12)-induced release of 14C-labeled AA was significantly inhibited by both mepacrine (30 and 100 μm), a nonspecific inhibitor of the PLA2(32Flower R.J. Blackwell G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and MAFP (10 and 50 μm), a potent inhibitor of cPLA2 and Ca2+-independent PLA2(iPLA2) (33Ackermann E. Conde-Friboes K. Dennis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In parallel with inhibition of AA release, both inhibitors abolished the decrease in the radiolabeled content of the PI pool while not affecting that of PC (data not shown), indicating that this lipid may serve as a major source for AA. To further delineate the type of PLA2 that is involved in the H. pylori-induced AA release, the effect of the iPLA2-specific inhibitor HELSS (33Ackermann E. Conde-Friboes K. Dennis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and the secretory PLA2 inhibitor aristolochic acid (34Vishwanath B.S Fawzy A.A. Franson R.C. Inflammation. 1988; 12: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was tested. H. pylori-induced AA release from the cells was not affected by aristolochic acid (50 μm) (data not shown). Likewise, HELSS at 10 μm did not affect the AA release, whereas higher concentrations (50 μm) inhibited both basal and H. pylori-induced AA release (data not shown), probably by inhibiting other important effectors in the signal transduction (35Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Schaffer M. Seehre J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-85677.5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These findings support a role of cPLA2 in the AA release. H. pylori induces an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ when colonizing epithelial cells (19Chan E.C. Chen C.T. Lin Y.L. Chen K.T. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 421-425PubMed Google Scholar), and intracellular Ca2+regulates cPLA2 activity; therefore, we studied the role of Ca2+ in AA release. Chelating intracellular calcium by preincubation of cells with BAPTA/AM (200 and 400 μm) abolished release of AA in response to H. pylori (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that AA release stimulated by H. pylori is Ca2+-dependent. The release of AA from membrane phospholipids could also occur through PLC activation followed by the action of the DAG lipase (23Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). However,H. pylori-induced AA release from the cells was insensitive to inhibition by U73122 (1 and 10 μm) (Fig.2 D), an inhibitor of the PLC (36Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith RJ Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, U73122itself caused an increase in basal AA release, thereby increasing the AA formation in H. pylori-infected cells. Under the same experimental conditions, H. pylori caused a 1.2- and 2-fold increase of total inositol phosphates (mono-, bis-, and trisphosphate) in myo-[3H]inositol-labeled HeLa and AGS cells, respectively, which was prevented by the PLC inhibitor U73122(results not shown), demonstrating that the failure of the inhibitor to block H. pylori-induced AA release is not the result ofU73122 failing to inhibit PLC. RHC80267 (40 and 80 μm), an inhibitor of the DAG lipase (37Balsinde J. Diez E. Mollinedo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15638-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), slightly inhibited the basal release of AA from cells by about 30% but had no effect on H. pylori-induced AA release (Fig. 2 E). Therefore, PLC and DAG lipase signaling pathways are not involved in the H. pylori-induced AA release. Another potential pathway of AA release involves activation of PLD (24Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the release of water-soluble reaction products into the medium was measured in HeLa cells that had been labeled with [14C]choline. Of the radioactivity incorporated into lipids, about 90 and 10% was found in PC and sphingomyelin, respectively. The addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (100 nm), known to activate PLD in HeLa cells (38Hii C.S. Kokke Y.S. Pruimboom W. Murray A.W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), resulted in a sustained release of radioactivity into the medium (about 2-fold over control), whereas incubation of cells with H. pylori up to 180 min did not increase the release of choline metabolites as compared with control cells (Table II). In addition, no significant decrease of [14C]PC in cells incubated with H. pylori (P12) was observed. These results indicate that H. pylori cells do not activate hydrolysis of PC by PLD. To gain further evidence that H. pylori does not affect the PLD activity, the effect of wortmannin, known to inhibit activation of PLD (39Bonser R. Thompson N. Randall R. Tateson R. Spacey G. Hodson H. Garland L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was tested. At a concentration of 100 nm, wortmannin had no effect on H. pylori-induced AA release (data not shown).Table IIEffect of H. pylori on the release of [ 14 C]choline metabolites in HeLa cellsTreatmentRelease of [14C]choline metabolitesControlP12TPA (100 nm)%30 min2.10 ± 0.392.06 ± 0.283.78 ± 0.1160 min3.44 ± 0.763.36 ± 0.479.48 ± 0.21180 min11.01 ± 4.3610.97 ± 2.9223.31 ± 0.24The amount of radioactivity released is expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity associated with cells and medium.

To locate those ATP-binding sites on IP3R1 and IP3R3, both proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and covalently labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. IP3R1 and IP3R3 were then purified and subjected to a controlled proteolysis, and the labeled proteolytic fragments were identified by site-specific antibodies. Two fragments of IP3R1 were labeled, each containing one of the previously proposed ATP-binding sites with amino acid sequence GX GXX G (amino acids 1773–1780 and 2016–2021, respectively). In IP3R3, only one fragment was labeled. This fragment contained the GX GXX G sequence (amino acids 1920–1925), which is conserved in the three IP3R isoforms. The presence of multiple interaction sites for ATP was also evident from the IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized A7r5 cells, which depended on ATP over a very broad concentration range from micromolar to millimolar.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The IP3R is composed of three functionally different domains: an N-terminal IP3-binding region, a large transducing domain, and a C-terminal channel region (2Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The transducing domain contains interaction sites for several modulators of IP3-induced Ca2+ release such as Ca2+, calmodulin, kinases, phosphatases, ATP, and FKBP12 (reviewed in Refs. 1Berridge M.J.

The stimulatory effect of ATP is likely to occur via binding to one or more sites on the IP3R, because purified IP3Rs bind [α-32P]ATP in a specific manner (17Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H.

Based on the glycine-rich amino acid sequence GX GXX G (25Wierenga R.K. Hol W.G. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), two ATP-binding sites were postulated on the neuronal form of IP3R1 (aa 1773–1780 and 2016–2021). The former is only present in IP3R1, whereas the latter is common to the three IP3R isoforms (2Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C.

In a previous study, we have expressed the cDNA domains of IP3R1 containing these glycine-rich motifs as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria and showed that they both were able to bind ATP (29Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Bultynck G. Zizi M. De Smet P. Casteels R. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine the location and number of ATP-binding sites on the intact IP3R. We did this by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP of microsomes of Sf9 insect cells expressing recombinant IP3R1 or IP3R3 homotetramers, followed by purification and controlled proteolysis with chymotrypsin. We found that controlled proteolysis of IP3R1 and IP3R3 yielded roughly the same major fragments, indicating that both isoforms have a similar general structure. Moreover, the results indicated that the IP3R1 contained two ATP-binding sites, because two separate fragments obtained by proteolysis were labeled. These two fragments each contained one of the presumed ATP-binding sites (aa 1773–1780 and 2016–2021, respectively), as identified using site-specific antibodies. In IP3R3, only one proteolytic fragment was labeled. This fragment contained the proposed ATP-binding site that is conserved in all IP3R isoforms (aa 1920–1925). The unequal number of ATP-binding sites in IP3R1 and IP3R3 could have implications for the modulation of these isoforms by ATP. Recently, we found that IP3R1 and IP3R3 have a different ATP affinity (EC50 values of 1.6 and 177 μm, respectively) (24Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H.

In this study, the ATP dependence of IP3-induced Ca2+ release measured in permeabilized A7r5 cells, which express both IP3R1 and IP3R3, extended over a very broad range from micromolar to millimolar concentrations. This finding confirms the presence of multiple nucleotide-binding sites with different affinities for ATP in IP3R1 and IP3R3. CHAPS was obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL).

After wash steps in high (600 mm) and low (100 mm) salt conditions, the specifically bound proteins were eluted in low salt conditions with 300 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. All centrifugation steps were for 17 min at 35,700 × g at 4 °C. Purified IP3R was partially digested with chymotrypsin (0.05 μg/ml) for 2, 5, 10, or 30 min on ice as described previously (32Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. DeLisle S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Campbell K.P.

The digestion was stopped by the addition of 100 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and by boiling the samples for 5 min in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE.

Two rabbits were injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly with Freund's complete adjuvant containing 0.5 mg of LoopI17a fused to GST. Animals were boosted 2 weeks later with the same antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant and regularly thereafter. After three boost injections, both rabbits produced high titers of antibody. Both antibodies (named anti-loopI17a-1 and anti-loopI17a-2) reacted with mouse, rat, human, hamster, and rabbit IP3R1. They also recognized rat IP3R3, although with lower sensitivity. 2J. B.

We therefore expressed IP3R1 or IP3R3 in Sf9 insect cells, resulting in a 2.5 times higher expression of IP3R1 and a >50 times higher expression of IP3R3 as compared with rabbit cerebellar and 16HBE14o-microsomes, respectively (24Maes K.

This method was based on the ability of heparin to bind to the IP3R with high affinity (41Hill T.D. Berggren P.O. Boynton A.L. Biochem. Cell Biol.

It has been suggested that IP3R3 is also a glycoprotein (45Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although only oneN-glycosylation site is predicted based on the primary sequence (46Yamamoto-Hino M.

In this study, we have used an identical approach to purify recombinant IP3R1 and IP3R3 overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. It had to be verified whether the glycosylation patterns of these proteins were the same as in mammalian cells. Briefly, microsomes from Sf9 cells overexpressing either IP3R1 or IP3R3 were solubilized with 2.5% CHAPS. Subsequently, the solubilized microsomes were incubated with heparin-agarose. After elution of the bound fraction, the latter was incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. Both receptors could be purified with high efficiency and were recognized by isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 1, A andB, first lane of each blot), confirming that they are both glycoproteins and that the post-translational glycosylation of the IP3Rs in insect cells is similar to that in mammalian cells. The purified IP3R1 migrated on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 273 kDa, which deviated from the molecular mass of 313 kDa predicted from the primary structure (Fig. 1 A, first lane of each blot). The purified IP3R3 also migrated with a lower apparent molecular mass (248 kDa) than predicted (304 kDa) (Fig. 1 B, first lane of each blot). Because a similar behavior is also found for endogenous IP3Rs from, e.g. cerebellar or 16HBE14o-cells (20Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), this discrepancy is likely due to aberrant mobility of higher molecular mass proteins on SDS-PAGE. The purified IP3Rs were subjected to a controlled proteolysis with chymotrypsin (0.05 μg/ml, up to 30 min on ice), and the digestion fragments were detected by a panel of different site-specific antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table I).

The proteolytic pattern, resulting from up to 30 min of incubation with chymotrypsin, and as detected by the four antibodies against IP3R1, is shown in Fig. 1 A. We determined the length of the fragments using Rainbow molecular mass markers. Based on these data, we were able to localize the chymotrypsin-sensitive sites on IP3R1 (Fig.2 A). The sum of the molecular mass of the five major proteolytic fragments (40, 65, 80, 40, and 90 kDa) was close to the molecular mass of the intact IP3R1 (313 kDa). This result was in complete agreement with the study of Yoshikawa et al. (48Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where trypsin was used to digest cerebellum-purified IP3R1 and where five similar major proteolysis-insensitive fragments were found. Although we were able to recognize most of the intermediate digestion products with site-specific antibodies, two proteolytic fragments, which were predicted based on Fig. 2 A, could not be detected when the digestion was performed for 30 min. Particularly, a 145-kDa fragment, precursor of the 65- and 80-kDa fragments should be recognized by the anti-cytI3b antibody and a 185-kDa fragment, precursor of the successive fragments of 65, 80, and 40 kDa should be recognized by the anti-(1829–1848) antibody. Because it is possible that these intermediate fragments have a short life time, we decreased the time of proteolysis to 2, 5, and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 1 A,insets of blots 1 and 2). Upon staining with the anti-cytI3b-2 antibody (blot 1 andinset), we detected a proteolytic band corresponding to a molecular mass of 145 kDa, which is most intense at 2 and 5 min of incubation with chymotrypsin. This fragment is rapidly degraded into smaller fragments, because it is poorly or not visible in the proteolytic patterns representing 10 and 30 min of incubation of IP3R1 with chymotrypsin. Upon staining with the anti-(1829–1848) antibody, no clear fragment with a mass of 185 kDa was visible, even at shorter time points (blot 2 andinset). Because the corresponding predicted fragment was also not detected in the study of Yoshikawa et al. (48Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the latter intermediate fragment is rapidly degraded into smaller subfragments during proteolysis and has therefore a steady-state level below the detection limit for the antibodies. All identified fragments, with indication of their molecular mass and the recognizing antibodies, are represented in TableII.Table IIIdentification of proteolytic fragments of IP3R1 by site-specific antibodies and 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP labelingkDaAnti-cytI3B-2Anti-(1829–1848)Anti-loopI17a-2Rbt0332P label273xxxxx225xxx210xxxx185xx145x130xxxxo120xxo105x90xxx65x40xxIP3R1 was purified from Sf9 insect cells and subjected to a controlled proteolysis.

Only two site-specific antibodies are available for this isoform: the MMAtype3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) (4De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) directed against the N terminus, and the anti-CIII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) against the C terminus. However, the anti-loopI17a-2 antibody could also recognize IP3R3,2 although with lower sensitivity. The proteolytic pattern as stained by the three antibodies against IP3R3 is shown in Fig. 1 B. The time dependence of the occurrence of the proteolytic fragments was also investigated for IP3R3, but incubation with chymotrypsin for shorter times (2–10 min) revealed the same pattern of proteolytic fragments (data not shown). All identified fragments, with their molecular mass and the recognizing antibodies, are represented in TableIII. In addition we have verified the N-terminal boundaries of some of the major proteolytic fragments by N-terminal amino acid microsequencing (data not shown). A schematic presentation of IP3R3 with the major proteolytic fragments (105, 70, 35, and 95 kDa) is shown in Fig. 2 B. The sum of the molecular mass of the fragments was close to the molecular mass of the intact receptor (304 kDa) as calculated from the cloned rat IP3R3. The general structure of IP3R3 resembled that of IP3R1: Both receptor isoforms were sensitive to proteolysis at similar sites. Only the chymotrypsin-sensitive site that is present in the IP3-binding domain of IP3R1, could not be detected in IP3R3. This could however be due to the lack of an antibody that recognized the relevant part of the IP3-binding domain. Alternatively, it is also possible that IP3R3 lacks the chymotrypsin-sensitive site in the IP3-binding domain. It is conceivable that the proteolysis-sensitive sites represent regions that are exposed on the surface of the protein and thereby accessible to the proteolytic enzymes as well as to different modulators of IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Because functional IP3Rs are mostly organized in heterotetramers (9Wojcikiewicz R.J. He Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1995; 213: 334-341Google Scholar, 10Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T.

As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, the smallest labeled fragment was the 95-kDa C-terminal fragment. The details of the photoaffinity labeling, purification, and controlled proteolysis are described under “Experimental Procedures.” In a previous study, we showed that two GST fusion proteins, each containing a putative ATP-binding domain of IP3R1, could bind ATP (29Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Bultynck G. Zizi M. De Smet P. Casteels R. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both predicted ATP-binding domains were situated near chymotrypsin-sensitive sites (Fig.2 A). It is therefore likely that they are both accessible to ATP in the intact protein. To prove this, we incubated microsomes from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant IP3R1 with the photoaffinity label 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Covalent labeling of the ATP-binding sites by UV irradiation was followed by purification and controlled proteolysis of IP3R1 and identification of the labeled proteolytic fragments by site-specific antibodies. The two smallest labeled proteolytic fragments of IP3R1 (90 and 40 kDa, Fig.3 A) were recognized by the Rbt03 antibody and the anti-(1829–1848) antibody, respectively (TableII), indicating that they represented the proteolytic fragments containing the previously proposed ATP-binding sites (Fig.2 A). IP3R3 contained only one of these proposed ATP-binding sites, which is conserved in all IP3R isoforms and which is also located near a chymotrypsin-sensitive site (Fig. 2 B). To confirm this, we performed the same photoaffinity labeling experiment for the IP3R3 isoform. The smallest labeled band of 95 kDa (Fig. 3 B) was recognized by the anti-CIII antibody (Table III), indicating that this band represented the proteolytic fragment containing the putative ATP-binding site of IP3R3 (Fig. 2 B). In summary, covalent labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP occurred at two different proteolytic fragments of IP3R1 and only at one proteolytic fragment of IP3R3. The labeled fragments contained the two previously proposed ATP-binding sites, one of which is conserved in all IP3R isoforms. The unequal number of ATP-binding sites found in IP3R1 and IP3R3 may explain the differential modulation of these isoforms by ATP. IP3R1 showed a higher affinity for ATP than IP3R3 (13Missiaen L.

The latter property can be assigned to the ATP-binding site present in IP3R3 and conserved in all IP3R isoforms.

Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In permeabilized A7r5 cells, which express IP3R1 and IP3R3 in a 3 to 1 ratio (5De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21691-21698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATP dependence of IP3-induced Ca2+ release was found over a very broad concentration range (Fig.4). ATP stimulated IP3-induced Ca2+ release from the low micromolar range up to 1 mm. At still higher ATP concentrations, the release was inhibited probably due to competition of ATP for the IP3-binding site (18Iino M. J. Gen.

The broad concentration dependence in A7r5 cells is in very good agreement with the different ATP affinities described previously for recombinant IP3R1 and IP3R3 (EC50 values of 1.6 μm and 177 μm, respectively) (24Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This difference in ATP affinities between IP3R1 and IP3R3 was also observed by other groups: recent findings of Hagar and Ehrlich (49Hagar R.E. Ehrlich B.E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IP3R3 incorporated in lipid bilayers was activated by ATP with an EC50of about 3 mm, whereas a much lower EC50 (40 μm) was observed for IP3R1 (19Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, IP3-induced Ca2+ release in genetically engineered DT40 B cells that express a single IP3R subtype was also found to respond differently to ATP. In IP3R1-expressing cells, the rate of Ca2+release was enhanced by ATP with an EC50 of 0.39 mm, whereas IP3R3-expressing cells were much less sensitive to ATP (14Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Because it was not possible to resolve the ATP concentration dependence in A7r5 cells by curve-fitting procedures, the present data do not allow a determination of whether the presence of two IP3R isoforms in A7r5 is reflected in two separate stimulatory ATP-binding sites. However, for preparations from rat cerebellum containing nearly exclusively IP3R1, the maximum stimulation by ATP was found at 50 μm. At 1 mm ATP, IP3-induced Ca2+ release in cerebellar preparations was close to control values (50Kaplin A.I. Snyder S.H. Linden D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2002-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 1 mmATP was the maximum stimulatory concentration in A7r5 cells. The much higher maximum for ATP stimulation found for A7r5 cells is therefore very probably a reflection of the presence of IP3R3. It was also not possible to decide whether these properties of IP3R3 are inferred in A7r5 cells by homo- or heterotetramers. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that a significant fraction of IP3R1 and IP3R3 expressed in A7r5 cells is present as heterotetramers.2 Our data clearly showed that the presence of different ATP-binding sites on IP3R1 and IP3R3 resulted in a nucleotide sensitivity of IP3-induced Ca2+ release that extended over a broad concentration range. The ATP concentration that yielded maximum stimulation seems very variable and to be dependent on the IP3R isoform composition in the particular cell type.

https://openalex.org/W2026306003,"The latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) of Epstein-Barr virus induces gene transcription, phenotypic changes, and oncogenic transformation. One cellular gene induced by LMP1 is that for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which participates in a wide range of inflammatory and immune responses. ICAM-1 may enhance the immune recognition of cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus, and thus combat development of malignancy. Despite growing understanding of the various signaling functions of LMP1, the molecular mechanisms by which LMP1 induces ICAM-1 are not understood. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional activation by LMP1 is absolutely dependent upon a variant NF-κB motif within the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) response element of the ICAM-1 promoter. Although the TNFα response element is sufficient for TNFα induction of the ICAM-1 promoter, LMP1 also required the cooperation of additional upstream sequences for optimal induction. Inhibitor studies of known LMP1-induced signaling pathways ruled out the involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the Janus-activating tyrosine kinase 3 (JAK3), and confirmed NF-κB as a critical factor for induction of ICAM-1. However, although constitutive activation of NF-κB efficiently induced promoter activity, it was not sufficient to induce either ICAM-1 mRNA or ICAM-1 protein. Using signaling defective LMP1 mutants and deacetylation inhibitors, we showed that the C-terminal activator region 1 of LMP1 delivers a new cooperating signal to induce ICAM-1 mRNA."

In the last step of methanogenesis, the methyl group of methylated coenzyme M (2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid, HS-CoM) is reduced to methane by methyl-S-CoM reductase. Coenzyme B (7-mercaptoheptanoyl-threonine phosphate, HS-CoB) is the electron donor, and the product of the reaction is the heterodisulfide, CoB-S-S-CoM (reaction 1) (1Ellermann J. Hedderich R.

The cofactors, HS-CoM and HS-CoB, are regenerated by reduction of the disulfide bond of CoB-S-S-CoM in a reaction catalyzed by HDR (reaction 2).

The direct electron donor for HDR appears to be a membrane-bound cofactor, methanophenazine (MPhen) (10Bäumer S. Murakami E. Brodersen J. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. Deppenmeier U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This cofactor has been isolated from membranes of M. mazei strain Gö1 (11Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S.

It has a 25-carbon isoprenoid chain attached to position 2 of phenazine via an ether bond, which makes it insoluble in aqueous solution (11Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Beifuss U. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-hydroxyphenazine (HPhen) derivative is a suitable water-soluble substitute for MPhen that can accept electrons from F420H2 and can donate electrons to the purified HDR from M. thermophila (10Bäumer S. Murakami E. Brodersen J. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. Deppenmeier U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from F420H2 to HPhen results in the translocation of two protons per two electrons transferred (12Baumer, S., Ide, T., Jacobi, C., Johann, A., Gottschalk, G., and Deppenmeier, U. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar). Another two protons (per two electrons) are translocated during reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM by HPhen (13Ide T. Baumer S. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HDR from M. thermophila consists of two subunits. A 53-kDa subunit contains two distinct [Fe4S4] clusters with midpoint potentials of −100 and −400 mV (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A 27-kDa membrane-associated subunit contains two b-type hemes, one that is low spin and is hexacoordinate and another that is high spin and is five-coordinate. The midpoint potentials of the low and high spin hemes are −180 and −23 mV, respectively (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have used steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics to answer some key questions about the HDR mechanism. Which of the metal centers in HDR is the initial electron acceptor from reduced HPhen (HPhenH2)? The midpoint potentials of some of the metal centers are outside the range of the HPhen/HPhenH2 and CoB-S-S-CoM/CoB-SH, CoM-SH couples; therefore, are all of the metal clusters involved in the electron transfer reaction? What is the intramolecular electron transfer pathway? Based on our results, we propose that the physiological electron transfer pathway from methanophenazine to the heterodisulfide is: MPhenH2 → [Fe4S4]high → hemelow → CoB-S-S-CoM. HPhen was synthesized as described (11Abken H.J. Tietze M. Brodersen J. Bäumer S. Beifuss U. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2027-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo). M. thermophila TM1 was cultured on acetate at 50 °C and pH 6.8 in a 5-liter New Brunswick fermentor equipped with a pH auxostat (14Sowers K.R. Nelson M.F. Ferry J.G. Curr. Microbiol. 1984; 11: 227-230Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as described (15Becker D.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2639-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HDR was purified as described previously (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except for enzyme concentration steps. As mentioned by Thauer et al. (16Kunkel A. Vaupel M. Heim S. Thauer R.K. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), higher activity was recovered when membranes with molecular/pore molecular mass cut-off of 50 kDa (Spectrum) were used. HDR activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of reduced methyl viologen at 604 nm (ε = 13.9 mm−1 cm−1) and 55 °C (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Kuhn W. Gottschalk G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,18Meuer J. Bartoschek S. Koch J. Kunkel A. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One unit of HDR activity corresponds to 1 μmol of CoB-S-S-CoM reduced per minute. HDR activity was also assayed using 2-hydroxyphenazine as the electron donor. A solution containing HPhen (final concentration of 200 μm) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 10% glycerol) was reduced by bubbling with 100% hydrogen gas for 20 min, adding partially purified hydrogenase from M. thermophila, and incubating at 55 °C for 2 h. For steady-state kinetic experiments, varying amounts of the HPhenH2 stock solution were added to Buffer A. Then, HDR was added and the reaction was started by adding CoB-S-S-CoM. The oxidation of HPhenH2 was monitored either at 25 °C or at 55 °C by following an increase in absorbance at 365 nm. The difference (oxidized minus reduced, Δε) extinction coefficient at 365 nm was measured to be 3.58 mm−1cm−1. One unit is defined as 1 μmol of CoB-S-S-CoM reduced min−1 mg−1. The data were fit to eq. 3 for a ping-pong reaction, where v 0 is initial velocity and A and B are HPhenH2 and CoB-S-S-CoM, respectively, as follows. v0=Vmax[A][B]/(KmA[B]+KmB[A]+[A][B])Equation 3 Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. UV-visible spectra were collected on a Cary-14 spectrophotometer modified by On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc. (Bogart, GA). EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller (Oxford ITC4) and automatic frequency counter (Model 5340A, Hewlett-Packard Co.). HDR was oxidized by adding thionin (E′0 = +60 mV) until the blue color disappeared. Excess thionin was removed by passing the solution through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oxidized HDR (6 μm before mixing) and varied concentrations of HPhenH2 (10, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μmbefore mixing) were rapidly mixed at 25 °C in a 1:1 ratio. Heme reduction was followed at 423 nm in a rapid-scanning stopped flow instrument (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc.). Purified HDR was diluted 4-fold with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.6% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdodecylmaltoside, 2 mm dithiothreitol for at least 5 column volumes, HDR was eluted with 0.4 m KCl-containing dodecylmaltoside buffer. The enzyme was concentrated for freeze-quench EPR experiments. Thionin-oxidized HDR (60 μm) was rapidly mixed with 200 μmHPhenH2 at room temperature using a chemical/freeze-quench apparatus (Update Instrument, Inc., Madison, WI). The HDR-containing and HPhenH2-containing syringes (2 ml) were connected by a mixer, and the reaction time was controlled using aging hoses of different lengths. The solutions were mixed using four sequential ram displacements of 1.3 mm (83 μl per shot) and ram velocity of 8 cm/s. The reaction was quenched by rapidly freezing the mixture in a funnel attached to an EPR tube that was filled with low temperature (−120 °C) isopentane. The frozen snow containing the quenched reaction mixture was then packed tightly in EPR tubes. The 0-ms time point was obtained by mixing the oxidized HDR with buffer. Oxidized HDR (above) was treated with 1 mm (final concentration) mersalyl acid for 30 min. Then, excess mersalyl acid was removed by centrifuging the solution through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Steady-state kinetic experiments were performed at 55 °C at varying concentrations of HPhenH2 and CoB-S-S-CoM to determine the overall mechanism of the HDR reaction. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig.1), which yielded theK m values for HPhenH2 and CoB-S-S-CoM of 92 ± 22 and 144 ± 33 μm, respectively. The specific activity was 52 μmol min−1 mg−1(k cat of 70 s−1, assuming a dimeric unit of 80 kDa). In a ternary-complex mechanism, theV/K value for one substrate increases with the concentration of the other substrate. TheV max/K m values for CoB-S-S-CoM do not increase with HPhenH2 concentration (Fig. 1, inset), indicating that the reaction follows a ping-pong mechanism. At higher concentrations of HPhenH2, the V/K value decreases, indicating some degree of substrate inhibition. The electron transfer pathway from HPhenH2 to HDR was studied by rapid-scanning stopped-flow kinetics at 25 °C. The enzyme used in the stopped-flow experiments was highly active, with a turnover number at 25 °C of 72 s−1. HPhenH2 was rapidly mixed with oxidized HDR, and heme reduction was monitored at 423 nm. Two phases of equal amplitude were evident, and the data fit well to a biexponential equation, corresponding to reduction of the two b-type hemes of HDR (Fig. 2). Only the first phase of this reaction appears to be kinetically relevant (87 s−1), because the rate constant for the second phase (9.4 s−1) is significantly slower than the turnover number (72 s−1) for the enzyme. Results described below indicate that it is the low potential heme that is reduced at catalytically competent rates. Furthermore, only the first rate constant is dependent on HPhenH2 concentration; the heme reduced in the second phase was HPhen-independent. These results suggest that one heme (the high potential heme, see below) is not involved in CoB-S-S-CoM reduction by HPhenH2. We had hoped to independently monitor reduction of the heme and the Fe-S cluster; however, the heme absorbance dominated the spectra of HDR. When the HPhenH2 concentration is similar to that of HDR and is well below its K m value, there are two clearly distinguishable phases: a rapid increase in absorbance (k obs1 = 34 s−1) followed by a slower decay (k obs2 = 2.3 s−1) (Fig. 3). The difference spectrum generated by subtracting the spectrum collected at 300 ms from that at 70 ms (Fig. 3 B) matches that of the difference spectrum of the reduced minus oxidized HDR. The amplitudes of the two phases are equal and correspond to 0.25 heme. The electron acceptor is likely to be either an FeS cluster or some other redox site on the protein, possibly a redox-active disulfide. If the acceptor is an FeS cluster, the results would be most consistent with reoxidation of the heme group by the high-potential Fe-S cluster. Given the slow rate of heme reoxidation, however, this event is unlikely to be involved in catalysis. Because we are unable to follow the reduction of FeS clusters by stopped-flow due to dominating absorbance of hemes at 400–450 nm, rapid freeze-quench EPR studies were performed. The FeS cluster is fully reduced within 35 ms (Fig.4 A). The rate constant for Fe-S reduction by HPhen is 73 ± 31 s−1 at 20 °C (Fig. 4 B). These results clearly show that the FeS cluster is reduced at catalytically competent rates. Given the standard error in the freeze-quench measurement, we cannot conclude whether the cluster is reduced before, after, or simultaneously with the low potential heme. It is the high potential cluster that undergoes reduction, because HPhenH2 reduces only the high-potential FeS cluster; the low potential cluster remains oxidized (see below). The EPR signal of the low potential heme is observed at very low intensity (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and could not be detected in the freeze-quench experiments; however, we were able to follow the rate at which HPhenH2 reduces the high potential high spin heme (Fig.4 C). The high spin heme signal (g = 6.2) remained more than 60% oxidized 415 ms after reaction with HPhenH2. The rate constant for reduction of the high spin heme is 1.3 ± 0.1 s−1 (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the freeze-quench EPR and stopped-flow results show that reduction of the high potential heme by HPhenH2 occurs about 10-fold slower than k cat, indicating that this heme is not involved in electron transfer from HPhenH2 to CoB-S-S-CoM. This is consistent with stopped-flow and inhibition studies described below. We showed earlier that CO binds tightly to one of the hemes (K d = 0.8 μm) (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, even at 1 mm concentration, CO does not affect the rate of reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM when HPhenH2 or methyl viologen is the electron donor (Fig.5). Because only the high spin high potential heme binds CO (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these results indicate that only the low potential heme is required for CoB-S-S-CoM reduction. When dithionite is added to HDR, both hemes are reduced [Fig.6A]. When excess CoB-S-S-CoM is then added, the UV-visible spectrum shows a broad Soret peak around 420 nm (Fig. 6B, solid line). This spectrum can be fit to the sum of two hemes with 66% in the oxidized and 34% in the reduced state (dashed line). Therefore, the remaining reduced heme is not involved in substrate reduction. To determine which of the two hemes is involved in catalysis, we added CO to the CoB-S-S-CoM treated enzyme. The Soret peak for the reduced heme shifts to 420 nm (dotted line), which corresponds to the CO-bound form of HDR (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the spectrum of the oxidized heme was unchanged. This result clearly shows that, when CoB-S-S-CoM is added, the high potential heme remains reduced and the low potential hexacoordinate heme undergoes oxidation. These combined results strongly indicate that the high potential heme is not involved in CoB-S-S-CoM reduction and that electrons from the reduced low potential heme can reduce CoB-S-S-CoM to the dithiol products at kinetically relevant rates. Mersalyl acid is known to disrupt FeS clusters (20Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of mersalyl acid to HDR only slightly affects the heme spectra. This indicates that mercury treatment does not alter the heme environment. This is expected, because mercury only affects hemes with sulfur ligands, not histidine-ligated hemes like those in HDR (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum between the native and the mersalyl acid-treated HDR showed a broad band around 400–500 nm that is characteristic of FeS clusters (Fig.7). There is a small peak at 420 nm above the broad absorption band, which is likely to be from the heme. However, this would constitute less than 10% alteration of the heme. Using a typical extinction coefficient for ferredoxin, which is 16 mm−1 cm−1 per cluster (21Elliott J.I. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 328-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicate that the mersalyl acid disrupted 1.8 clusters per dimeric unit. HDR contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HPhenH2 was unable to reduce the hemes of the mersalyl acid-treated oxidized enzyme, whereas dithionite reduced both hemes. The mersalyl acid-treated enzyme was also unable to catalyze the reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM, when either HPhenH2 or methyl viologen was used as the electron donor. Assuming that mersalyl acid only affects the FeS cluster, these results indicate that an iron-sulfur cluster is the initial acceptor of electrons from HPhenH2. Another possibility is that disruption of the FeS cluster damages the HPhen binding site, which would prevent heme reduction. The redox potentials of the two clusters are −100 and −400 mV (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the midpoint redox potential for HPhen/HPhenH2 is ∼−250 mV, it seems likely that the high potential cluster is the electron acceptor from HPhenH2. Because the results described above indicated that the high potential heme is not involved in CoB-S-S-CoM reduction, we hypothesize that the electron pathway from HPhenH2 to the heme is: HPhenH2 → [Fe4S4]H→ [heme b]L, where the H and L subscripts designate the high and low potential centers. However, this is not the most thermodynamic electron transfer pathway, because the midpoint potential of the low potential heme is 80 mV more negative than that of the high potential cluster. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI) is a lipophilic reagent that inhibits a variety of flavoproteins such as NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases and oxidases (22Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Gatley S.J. Sherratt S.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Ragan C.I. Bloxham D.P. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The inhibitor is thought to interact with flavins and low potential b-type cytochromes in these enzymes. DPI also inhibits the reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM by factor F420H2dehydrogenase in the membrane-bound electron transport chain ofM. mazei Gö1 (25Brodersen J. Baumer S. Abken H. Gottschalk G. Deppenmeier U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To elucidate the intramolecular electron transfer pathway among the centers of HDR, we studied inhibition of the purified enzyme by DPI. When HPhenH2 is the electron donor, DPI is a strong inhibitor of CoB-S-S-CoM reduction (Fig.8 A). DPI inhibits heterodisulfide reduction in a competitive manner with respect to HPhenH2 with a K i value below 1 μm (Fig. 9). Surprisingly, it increases the rate of methyl viologen oxidation by CoB-S-S-CoM (Fig.8 B). When CoB-S-S-CoM is absent, methyl viologen oxidation is not observed. These results suggest that the mechanism of CoB-S-S-CoM reduction is different with the two electron donors. One possibility is that DPI, in competing with the HPhen binding site, blocks electron transfer to the high potential Fe-S cluster. However, methyl viologen, which can reduce CoB-S-S-CoM in the presence of DPI, has a different binding site than HPhen; it may transfer electrons directly to the heme.Figure 9Competitive inhibition of the HDR reaction by DPI. Steady-state kinetic studies were performed at 25 °C in the presence of DPI at the following concentrations: 0 (●), 1 (▪), 2 (▴), and 5 (■) μm. The data points were fit globally to the equation describing competitive inhibition. The derived kinetic parameters were: K m for HPhenH2, 31 μm; K i for DPI, 0.7 μm; V max, 38 μmol min−1 mg−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of DPI on the oxidation states of the metal centers of HDR are summarized in Table I. When HPhenH2 is used as the electron donor, both of the hemes are reduced (Fig.10). Adding DPI to the HPhenH2-reduced enzyme causes the Soret band at 425 nm to shift to 410 nm, corresponding to the oxidized form of HDR. This indicates that both hemes are oxidized by DPI. Dithionite reduces both hemes in the absence of DPI. However, when dithionite is then added to HPhenH2-reduced and DPI-oxidized HDR, a composite spectrum is obtained with peaks at 425 and 410 nm. The spectrum fits a mixture of 50% oxidized and 50% reduced heme. These results indicate that, although dithionite has a low enough potential to reduce both hemes, reduction of one of the two hemes is inhibited by prior treatment with DPI. CO shifts the spectrum of the reduced heme in the DPI-treated enzyme indicating that, after treatment of HDR with DPI, only the high potential 5-coordinate heme can be reduced. Reduction of the low potential hexacoordinate heme is inhibited. This constitutes further evidence that the low potential, but not the high potential, heme is involved in electron transfer from HPhenH2 to the heterodisulfide.Table IRedox states of HDR after treating with DPIForm of HDRHemeL 1-aHemeL, low potential heme; HemeH, high-potential heme; FeSL, low-potential [4Fe-4S] cluster; FeSH, high-potential [4Fe-4S] cluster.HemeHFeSLFeSHHDRoxOxOxOxOxPhen-reduced HDRRedRedOxRedDithionite-reduced HDRRedRedRedRedPhen-red HDR + DPIOxOxOxOxDithionite-red HDR + DPIOxRedOxRed1-a HemeL, low potential heme; HemeH, high-potential heme; FeSL, low-potential [4Fe-4S] cluster; FeSH, high-potential [4Fe-4S] cluster. Open table in a new tab EPR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the effects of DPI on the metal centers in HDR (Fig.11). Oxidized HDR displays an EPR spectrum with g values at 6.2, 5.8, and 2.0 that derives from the high spin (spin = 5/2) heme (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11 A). The low spin heme displays a “large g max” EPR spectrum with very low intensity and values ofg max that are >3. When the oxidized enzyme is reduced with HPhenH2 (Fig. 11 B), the high spin heme spectrum disappears and a new EPR signal with g values at 2.06, 1.95, and 1.90 appears, which is from a singly reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unlike dithionite (Fig. 11 C), HPhenH2 is not a strong enough electron donor to reduce the low potential cluster. When DPI is added to HPhenH2-reduced HDR (Fig. 11 D), the EPR spectrum of the cluster disappears as the g = 6 signal from the high spin heme reappears. These results combined with the UV-visible spectroscopic results described above indicate that the high potential FeS cluster and the two hemes undergo oxidation by DPI. When the thionin-oxidized enzyme is treated with dithionite (Fig. 11 C), all the metal centers of HDR are reduced; the characteristic complex spectrum of the doubly reduced protein is observed with g values at 2.03, 1.97, 1.92, and 1.88 (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The complicated signals result from dipolar coupling between the two clusters. Addition of DPI to the dithionite-reduced enzyme led to the oxidation of one cluster (Fig.11 E). Presumably, DPI does not oxidize the high potential cluster. Electron transfer from HPhenH2 through the redox centers of HDR to CoB-S-S-CoM drives the translocation of two protons across the cytoplasmic membrane per two electrons transferred (13Ide T. Baumer S. Deppenmeier U. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of HDR by HPhenH2 has been studied here by kinetic and spectroscopic methods. Stopped-flow and freeze-quench EPR experiments indicate that only one of the two hemes and one of the two clusters undergoes reduction by HPhenH2 with rate constants exceeding k cat. Our CO-binding and DPI inhibition experiments indicate that the low potential heme is involved in the electron transfer pathway and that the high potential heme is not involved in catalysis. This is consistent with the redox demands of the reaction; i.e. the midpoint potential for the CoB-S-S-CoM/(RSH)2 couple is approximately −200 mV, whereas that of the high spin high potential heme is −23 mV (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Why would HDR retain an unnecessary high potential heme throughout evolution? One possibility is that this heme is involved in stabilizing the protein or in generating the proton gradient associated with the HDR reaction. There is a high potential c-type cytochrome in the membranes of M. mazei with unknown function. It is attractive to consider an electron transfer chain leading from the oxidized heme to cytochrome c that would be coupled to proton translocation. Such a pathway would make the HDR reaction analogous to cytochrome bc 1. Which redox center is the direct electron acceptor from HPhenH2? HPhenH2 reduces the FeS cluster and the low potential heme at similar rates. Thus, the rapid kinetics experiments cannot distinguish between the following electron transfer pathways: HPhenH2 → FeS → hemeL, HPhenH2 → hemeL → FeS, or a simultaneous reduction of hemeL and FeS by HPhenH2. Inhibition experiments provide further information about the possible electron transfer pathways. HPhenH2 does not reduce either heme group of mersalyl-treated HDR. Because the heme spectra are not appreciably altered by the treatment and mercury is known to disrupt FeS clusters, we assume that inhibition of heme reduction is due to a direct effect of Hg2+ on the cluster. Therefore, it appears that electrons are transferred directly from HPhenH2 to an iron-sulfur cluster, indicating that the electron transfer pathway is HPhenH2 → FeS → hemeL. There are two 4Fe-4S clusters in HDR (6Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Which of the two clusters is the initial electron acceptor? DPI oxidizes only the low potential Fe-S cluster, leaving the high potential cluster reduced; however, this form of HDR can still reduce CoB-S-S-CoM. Thus, apparently, the low potential Fe-S cluster does not undergo redox cycling during the catalytic mechanism. Therefore, we propose that the electron transport pathway is HPhenH2 → high potential [Fe4S4] → low potential [heme b]L. If the low potential cluster is not involved in the relay of electrons from HPhenH2 to CoB-S-S-CoM, why would it be present in HDR? One possibility, described below, is that the oxidized low potential cluster is involved in a catalytic step and not in redox chemistry. Another is that HDR can accept electrons from several sources and that, under some conditions, a redox partner with a more negative midpoint potential than MPhen could donate electrons to the low potential cluster, which would in turn donate electrons to the high potential cluster. The electron transport pathway from CODH and CO, with a midpoint potential below −500 mV, has not been elucidated. The experiments described in this report were performed in aqueous solution with the water-soluble HPhen analog of MPhen. It is important to determine whether the membrane-bound enzyme uses the same electron transfer pathway. If the physiologically relevant order of electron flow is indeed HPhenH2 → [Fe4S4]H → [heme b]L, the high potential cluster is expected to be located near the subunit interface. This is because the large subunit containing the clusters is cytoplasmic and the heme is in the membrane-associated subunit (16Kunkel A. Vaupel M. Heim S. Thauer R.K. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This would be similar to several quinone-coupled enzymes whose FeS clusters are in close contact with a quinone-binding site in membrane, such as quinol:fumarate reductase (26Kowal A.T. Werth M.T. Manodori A. Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12284-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Me2SO reductase (27Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (28Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D. Burbaev D.S. Grivennikova V.G. Moroz I.A. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). How do electrons passing through one-electron redox centers accomplish the two-electron reduction of CoB-S-S-CoM? Because the two classes of HDRs are heme iron-sulfur or flavin iron-sulfur proteins, Thaueret al. (16Kunkel A. Vaupel M. Heim S. Thauer R.K. Hedderich R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) proposed that the iron-sulfur subunits harbor the active site of heterodisulfide reduction and that the mechanism of disulfide reduction could resemble that of the ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductases from chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. In the plant thioredoxin reductase mechanism, a sulfur radical, which is formed as an intermediate, appears to be stabilized by binding to a [Fe4S4] cluster (29Staples C.R. Ameyibor E. Fu W.G.

Telser J. Hoffman B.M. Schurmann P. Knaff D.B. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4612-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence presented here indicates that the low potential cluster of HDR is not involved in electron transfer reactions. Because the midpoint potential of this cluster (−400 mV) is much lower than that of HPhen (∼−250 mV) or CoB-S-S-CoM (∼−220 mV), this cluster may play a catalytic role, analogous to that of the cluster in thioredoxin reductase. This putative role is to stabilize a radical anion formed by one electron reduction of the disulfide substrate. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis."

In CaMKII, a C-terminal segment blocks the catalytic site in the absence of calmodulin; upon calmodulin binding, a threonine within that segment is phosphorylated, disrupting autoinhibition and leading to a calcium-independent active state of the enzyme (25Yang E. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26199-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When compared with these single-domain enzymes, RSKs with two kinase domains and regulatory sites in linker and C-terminal tail present more complex regulation. Commonly, the N-terminal kinase of RSKs phosphorylates substrates, whereas the C-terminal kinase has a role in regulating RSKs activity. For example, the stepwise activation of RSK1 involved phosphorylations of a threonine in the C-terminal activation loop and of a serine in the linker through ERK, and further phosphorylations of linker and N-terminal activation loop sites through autophosphorylation (27Dalby N.K. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). RSK2 is activated through integrating signals from two independent upstream kinase pathways, ERK and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, targeting the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, respectively (28Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Specific docking sites in the C-terminal tail of RSKs, facilitating interaction with upstream MAPKs, in some instances were found to be essential for activation (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The profound control exerted by C-terminal tail elements was further demonstrated by the constitutive activity generated by truncation or mutation in the conserved putative autoinhibitory C-terminal helix of RSK2 (31Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22135-22138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RSK1–RSK3 interact with ERK independent of activation state and locate both to the cytoplasm and nucleus under resting conditions; upon activation, the complex translocates to the nucleus (32Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison suggested that elements directing RSKs in general to the nuclear compartment reside in the C-terminal tail (29Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of subcellular location, autoinhibition, and protein-protein recognition in the association with upstream MAPKs all appear to be functions of the C-terminal sequences of RSKs. Here, we present a study of regulatory sites in the C-terminal tail of RSKB. Sequential truncations of the C-terminal tail revealed elements mediating nuclear location and p38 association. The C-terminal kinase of RSKB has sequence similarities with CaMKs. The structure of rat CaMKI (33Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) was of particular interest, because it presented an autoinhibited conformation with a key AFN motif adjoining a helical stretch of the C-terminal extension (26Miller S.G. Patton B.L. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1988; 1: 593-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Rich R.C. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28424-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); the phenylalanine of this motif played a crucial role in the binding of the C-terminal extension to the body of CaMKI and maintaining the resting state (33Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This AFN motif is conserved in RSKB. Sequence alignment and structure prediction suggested a study of the role of Phe709 within that motif in the control of RSKB function. Standard reagents were from various sources as reported (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

CREBtide (123KRREILSRRPSYRK136) was purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies (Lake Front Circle, TX). Antibodies to p38 (C-20) and epitope tag FLAG (antibody M2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Sigma, respectively. SB202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl-2-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole) was obtained from Dr. Wyss (Hoffmann-La Roche, Switzerland). Phorbol myristate acetate was from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem. Expression constructs for MAPKs and wt-RSKB were generated as described (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

RSKB point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites in vitromutagenesis system (Promega) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Expression plasmids of truncated RSKB were constructed by replacing the NotI-SalI insert of Flag-wt-RSKB/pALTER (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29661-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by the NotI-SalI fragment of the polymerase chain reaction product generated using the forward primer 5′-GAAAATCATCGACTTCGGG and one of the following reverse primers, (i) 5′-ACTAGGAGCTCGCGCTGCCGT (Δ682–772-RSKB), (ii) 5′-ATTAGAGCTCATTCTCCACGCTCTT (Δ725–772-RSKB), and (iii) 5′-ATTAGGAGCTCCGCAGCTTCTGCTT (Δ738–772-RSKB). One day after transfection with the indicated plasmids, HEK293 cells were harvested, and 20,000 cells/cm2 were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and cultivated for 1 additional day in minimal essential medium containing 0.3% fetal calf serum. The slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 5 min in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for immunohistochemistry as previously reported (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29661-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For p38 detection, C-20 antibody (10 μg/ml) was used as primary reagent, with Texas red-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) as secondary antibody. For FLAG-tagged truncated and wt-RSKB detection, M2 antibody (10 μg/ml) was used as primary reagent, with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark) as secondary antibody. Cells were analyzed on a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope. Subcellular RSKB localization was scored for each mutant by counting the first 100 successive, positively transfected cells using a Leica DRMB fluorescence microscope and assigning a nuclear, mixed (i.e.strong nuclear combined with weak cytoplasmic), or homogeneous cytoplasmic staining pattern. Immunoblots were incubated with specific primary and secondary horseradish-conjugated antibodies and revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Storm PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573) cells were cultured in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4. Transfections were done by the Transfectam procedure as recommended by manufacturer. In parallel transfection experiments, total amount of DNA was normalized with empty vector. In studies of cells stimulated by the cotransfected mMKK6/p38 upstream kinase pathway, a constitutively active mutant of MKK6 (mMKK6) was used (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.L. Tomás-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29661-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured for 2 days, including serum starvation for the last 16 h in 0.3% fetal calf serum-containing medium. The p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm) was added together with the starvation medium; a second dose of SB202190 (10 μm) was added 1 h before harvesting the cells. After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 500 μmdithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were cleared at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA reagents (Pierce). wt-RSKB and truncated RSKB genes were in vitrotranscribed with T7 RNA polymerase and translated at 30 °C for 90 min in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as specified by Promega. Aliquots of reticulocyte lysate containing wt-RSKB or the various truncated RSKBs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to verify expression of the in vitro translated proteins. 5–10 μl of the reticulocyte lysate were used in the p38 binding assay performed in 2 mm Tris, 30 mm HEPES, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 25 μl. Active recombinant Flag-tagged human p38α was purified by affinity chromatography from Escherichia coliexpression. 1 μg of unlabeled p38α was used in the binding assay. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, 5 μl of SDS-free loading buffer was added to the reaction that was then electrophoresed on a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel at 7 mA overnight using standard SDS-PAGE running buffer (acrylamide/N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide weight ratio of 29:1). The gels were fixed for 15 min (10% acetic acid, 40% ethanol) and amplified for 30 min in NAM-P 100 amplifier solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gels were dried and autoradiographed with Kodak Scientific X-OMAT AR film overnight. Cell extracts were subjected to M2 immunoprecipitation followed by kinase assay using CREBtide as a substrate. Cell extracts normalized to total protein content (200 μg unless specified otherwise) were precleared twice with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry for 20 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. Antibody was added to precleared lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry were added. After 1 h of incubation, immune complexes were pelleted and washed twice with {min}-kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 140 mm KCl) supplemented with 5 mm NaPPi. Forin vitro kinase assays, beads were resuspended in 25 μl of {plus}-kinase buffer (33 μm CREBtide, 30 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02 μCi/μl [γ-33P]ATP, in {min}-kinase buffer) and incubated at 22 °C for 30 min under constant agitation. Similar to wt-RSKB (36Tomás-Zuber M. Mary J.L. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), SB202190 (10 μm) added directly to the kinase reactions had no effect on the elevated basal activities of F709A- and T687E-RSKB. Furthermore, 10 μm SB202190 had no effect on stimulated F709A-RSKB activity when added to the in vitro kinase reaction with precipitates from cells activated by mMKK6/p38 cotransfection and cultured without SB202190. A minor reduction of stimulated activity (<15%) of T687E-RSKB was seen when 10 μm SB202190 was added to kinase assays with precipitates from cells activated by mMKK6/p38 cotransfection. A possible effect of SB202190 on T687E-RSKB depends on relative affinities and binding kinetics of ATP versus SB202190 for the C-terminal ATP binding site; ATP concentrations in the in vitro kinase assay and in vivo are 30 μmand in the mm range, respectively. The assay may also be influenced by coprecipitated p38, and spontaneous decay kinetics of activity of distinct RSKB mutants. Thus, the assay format may explain the weak reduction of stimulated T687E-RSKB activity by SB202190 independently of a hypothetical direct effect of the inhibitor. Reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μl of 0.75% phosphoric acid, and 100 μl of the mix reaction were filtered in a 96-well phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA), washed (five times) with 100 μl of 0.75% phosphoric acid, washed once with ethanol, and air-dried. Bound radioactivity was measured in a Packard top counter, using 100 μl of microscintillation mixture (Packard). All alignments were obtained with the help of the in-house program Xsae 2C.

Sequences were accessed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Swiss-Prot data bases under the following accession numbers: AJ010119 (RSKB), L07597 (RSK1), P51812(RSK2), Q15349 (RSK3), Q14012 (human CaMKI, kcc1_human), and Q63450(rat CaMKI, kcc1_rat). All modeling calculations were made on a Silicon Graphics Octane with a single R12000 processor using in-house modeling package Moloc (38Gerber P.R. Mueller K. J. Comp. Aided Mol. Design. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 39Gerber P.R. J. Comp. Aided Mol. Design. 1998; 12: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Model building was performed in a three-step procedure. An initial C-α model of the C-terminal domain of RSKB was built by fitting the aligned sequence on the C-α template of rat CaMK-I (33Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1A06 (40Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27938) Google Scholar)). This model was subsequently improved by searching a Moloc internal data base of loops obtained from highly resolved protein structures. A loop selection was made on the basis of minimal steric interactions with the rest of the model. Subsequently newly introduced loops were optimized with the Moloc C-α force field. In a next step, a full atom model was generated. φ and ψ angles were obtained for aligned amino acids from the x-ray structure. χ angles were also adopted from the template where possible, and in cases of nonidentical amino acids generated by using the most probable value, applying the method of Ponder and Richards (41Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). An energy calculation of the initial full peptide structure revealed regions with bad van der Waals contacts of amino acid side chains that were subsequently improved by manually adjusting the relevant χ angles. Newly inserted loop regions were then optimized individually, with the rest of the protein kept stationary. Repulsive van der Waals interactions were removed manually where necessary. Refinement of the peptide model was performed using Moloc. Neither water nor other molecules were added. In the first step, only amino acid side chains were allowed to move while all backbone atoms were kept in fixed positions. This step greatly removed repulsive interactions between side chains, further improved χ angles of nonconserved amino acids, and revealed regions with unfavorable interactions. In further optimization, only C-α atoms were kept in a fixed position, and all other atoms were allowed to move. In a third round of optimization, no atoms were kept stationary, but positional constraints were applied to C-α atoms. The quality of the model was then checked with (i) Moloc internal programs, (ii) a program by Luthyet al. (42Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), and (iii) PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Earlier immunostainings of transfected HEK293 cells had shown that RSKB and its isolated C-terminal domain located to the nucleus, whereas the N-terminal domain distributed in the cytoplasm (8Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J.

The C-terminal tail sequence of RSKB contains a putative bipartite713KRX 14KRRKQKLRS nuclear location signal (NLS) (Fig. 1). To investigate its role, mutants were generated with successive truncations of the C-terminal tail, Δ682–772-RSKB, Δ725–772-RSKB, and Δ738–772-RSKB (Fig.1), and their subcellular location was determined in HEK293 cell transfectants by immunostaining for the fused Flag epitope. wt-RSKB and Δ738–772-RSKB presented clearly dominant nuclear staining, but some cells showed cytoplasmic and mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic staining; to quantify, the first 100 successive transfected cells were counted up in the fluorescence microscope with each mutant and assigned to one of the three staining patterns as defined under “Experimental Procedures” (TableI and Fig. 2). In contrast to wt-RSKB and Δ738–772-RSKB, Δ725–772-RSKB and Δ682–772-RSKB, both of which lack the NLS, were predominantly found in the cytoplasm (Table I and Fig. 2). This indicates that elements of the sequence between Ala725 and Ser737 were essential to direct RSKB to the nuclear compartment.Table IPercentages of transfected cells with nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic location of Δ682–772-RSKB, Δ725–772-RSKB, Δ738–772-RSKB, and wt-RSKBNuclearCytoplasmicMixedΔ682–772-RSKB177112Δ725–772-RSKB19765Δ738–772-RSKB65278wt-RSKB76169 Open table in a new tab Figure 2RSKB nuclear location is determined by the NLS element.

https://openalex.org/W2062261044,"The mRNA capping apparatus of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans consists of three components: a 520- amino acid RNA triphosphatase (CaCet1p), a 449-amino acid RNA guanylyltransferase (Cgt1p), and a 474-amino acid RNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (Ccm1p). The fungal guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase are structurally similar to their mammalian counterparts, whereas the fungal triphosphatase is mechanistically and structurally unrelated to the triphosphatase of mammals. Hence, the triphosphatase is an attractive antifungal target. Here we identify a biologically active C-terminal domain of CaCet1p from residues 202 to 520. We find that CaCet1p function in vivo requires the segment from residues 202 to 256 immediately flanking the catalytic domain from 257 to 520. Genetic suppression data implicate the essential flanking segment in the binding of CaCet1p to the fungal guanylyltransferase. Deletion analysis of theCandida guanylyltransferase demarcates an N-terminal domain, Cgt1(1–387)p, that suffices for catalytic activity in vitro and for cell growth. An even smaller domain, Cgt1(1–367)p, suffices for binding to the guanylyltransferase docking site on yeast RNA triphosphatase. Deletion analysis of the cap methyltransferase identifies a C-terminal domain, Ccm1(137–474)p, as being sufficient for cap methyltransferase function in vivo and in vitro. Ccm1(137–474)p binds in vitro to synthetic peptides comprising the phosphorylated C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Binding is enhanced when the C-terminal domain is phosphorylated on both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of the YSPTSPS heptad repeat. We show that the entire three-component Saccharomyces cerevisiae capping apparatus can be replaced by C. albicans enzymes.

C-terminal domain S-adenosylmethionine polymerase chain reaction dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 5-fluoroorotic acid yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium The m7GpppN cap structure of eukaryotic mRNA is formed by three enzymatic reactions as follows. (i) The 5′ triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA 5′ triphosphatase, (ii) the diphosphate end is capped with GMP by GTP:RNA guanylyltransferase, and (iii) the GpppN cap is methylated by AdoMet:RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). RNA capping is essential for cell growth. The mRNA capping apparatus differs in significant respects in fungi, metazoans, protozoa, and viruses (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, the cap-forming enzymes are potential targets for antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal drugs that would interfere with capping of pathogen mRNAs but spare the mammalian host capping enzymes. Mammals encode a two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide (named Mce1p in the mouse and Hce1p in humans) and a separate methyltransferase polypeptide (Hcm1p in humans) (2McCracken S.

In considering ways to identify antifungals that target cap formation, one wishes to focus on the capping apparatus from a clinically significant human pathogen such as C. albicans. The triphosphatase (CaCet1p), guanylyltransferase (Cgt1p), and methyltransferase (Ccm1p) components of the Candida capping apparatus have now been identified (8Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Here, we define a minimal functional domain of the RNA triphosphatase CaCet1p capable of complementing a S. cerevisiae cet1Δ mutant. Analysis of the guanylyltransferase Cgt1p includes the demarcation of functional domain boundaries and studies of the binding of recombinant Cgt1p to its docking site on yeast triphosphatase. We also present studies of the cap methyltransferase Ccm1p including delineation of a minimal functional domain and biochemical characterization of recombinant Ccm1p and truncated version thereof. We show that Ccm1p binds to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD)1 of RNA polymerase II and that binding is enhanced when the CTD is phosphorylated on both Ser-2 and Ser-5. Finally, we construct yeast strains in which the entire S. cerevisiae capping apparatus is replaced byC. albicans enzymes. The availability of isogenic yeast cells expressing all-Candida versus all-mammalian capping components should facilitate screening in vivo for antifungals that block cap formation. Yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid vectors containing CaCET1, CaCET1(203–520), orCaCET1(217–520) under the control of the yeastTPI1 promoter were described previously (13Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). New N-terminal deletion mutants CaCET1(223–520),CaCET1(229–520), CaCET1(257–520), andCaCET1(267–520) were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense-strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codons for Thr-222, Asn-228, or Lys-266 or an NdeI restriction site at the Met-257 codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, then inserted into pYN132 (CEN TRP1). The inserts of each deletion plasmid were sequenced to verify that no unwanted coding changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. The CGT1 open reading frame encoding C. albicans mRNA guanylyltransferase was amplified from a genomic library (28Janbon G. Rustchenko E.P. Klug S. Scherer S. Sherman F. Yeast. 1997; 10: 985-990Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) by PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the translation start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI and inserted into yeast expression vector pYN132. In this vector, expression of the C. albicansguanylyltransferase is under the control of the yeast TPI1promoter. C-terminal truncation mutants of CGT1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic antisense-strand primers that introduced stop codons in lieu of the codons for Gln-427, Arg-409, Arg-388, or Lys-368 along with a BamHI site 3′ of the new stop codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, then inserted into pYN132. The inserts of each plasmid were sequenced to verify that no unwanted coding changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. NdeI-BamHI restriction fragments containing the wild type CGT1 gene or C-terminal truncation mutants were excised from the respective yeast expression vectors and inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid pET16b. The resulting plasmids, pET-Cgt1, pET-Cgt1-CΔ23, pET-Cgt1-CΔ41, pET-Cgt1-CΔ62, and pET-Cgt1-CΔ82, were introduced into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). Cultures (500-ml) derived from single transformed colonies were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The cultures were placed on ice for 20 min and then adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. Incubation was continued for 20 h at 17 °C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 10% sucrose). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of 50 μg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble lysates were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The columns were washed with 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of a buffer solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant Cgt1p proteins were recovered in the 100 and 200 mmimidazole eluate fractions. The peak fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled, adjusted to 5 mm EDTA, and dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100. The enzyme preparations were stored at −80 °C. The CCM1 open reading frame encoding C. albicans cap methyltransferase was amplified from genomic clone pCCM1–6.6 (8Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16553-16562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the translation start codon and a XhoI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and XhoI and inserted into yeast expression vector pYN132 (CEN TRP1), placing expression of the C. albicans cap methyltransferase gene under the control of the yeastTPI1 promoter. N-terminal deletion mutants ofCCM1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense-strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Ser-136 or Val-150 or an NdeI restriction site at the Met-175 codon. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, then inserted into pYN132. The inserts of each plasmid were sequenced to verify that no unwanted coding changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. KpnI-XhoI fragments containing the CCM1 gene and the N-terminal deletion mutants were then transferred from their respective CEN plasmids to the yeast high copy vector pYX232 (2μ TRP1), with methyltransferase expression under the control of the TPI1promoter. NdeI-XhoI restriction fragments containing the wild type CCM1 gene and N-terminal deletion mutants were excised from the respective yeast CENexpression vectors and inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid pET16b. The resulting plasmids, pET-Ccm1, pET-Ccm1Δ136, pET-Ccm1Δ150, and pET-Ccm1Δ174, were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (1 liter) derived from single transformed colonies were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A 600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer L (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was mixed for 1 h with 2 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin that had been equilibrated with buffer L. The suspension was poured into a column and washed with buffer L followed by IMAC buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) containing 30 mm imidazole. The column was then eluted stepwise with IMAC buffer containing 50, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant Ccm1p proteins were recovered in the 200 mm imidazole eluate. Aliquots of the nickel-agarose fraction (60 μg of protein) were applied to 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged for 12 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. The fractions were stored at −80 °C. YBS50 (MATa leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2p360-CET1/CEG1) is deleted at the chromosomal loci encoding RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase. YBS40 (MATaleu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 abd1::hisG p360-ABD1) and YBS10 (MATα ura3 trp1 lys2 his3 leu2 abd1::LEU2 p360-ABD1) are deleted at the chromosomal locus encoding cap methyltransferase. YBS52 (MATa leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2 abd1::KANp360-CET1/CEG1/ABD1) is deleted at the chromosomal loci encoding all three components of the yeast capping apparatus. We reported previously that either full-length CaCET1 or N-terminal deletion allelesCaCET1(179–520), CaCET1(196–520), orCaCET1(203–520) complemented growth of a cet1Δ mutant of S. cerevisiae, whereas the more extensively truncated CaCET1(217–520) gene did not complement (13Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).CaCET1(203–520) cells displayed a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype that was suppressed by overexpression ofCEG1. These experiments delineated a short peptide segment between residues 203 and 216 that is required for CaCet1p functionin vivo and also implied a functional interaction between the Candida triphosphatase and the endogenousSaccharomyces guanylyltransferase. Here we tested complementation of the cet1Δ mutation by a new series of truncated CaCET1 alleles aloneversus complementation by truncated CaCET1alleles plus the wild type Candida guanylyltransferase geneCGT1 present on the same CEN plasmid (Fig.1). Note that biochemical studies of the purified recombinant proteins encoded by CaCET1 alleles Δ202, Δ216, Δ222, Δ228, and Δ256) showed that the N-terminal truncated versions of CaCet1p were fully active in γ-phosphate hydrolysis in vitro (29Pei Y. Lehman K. Tian L. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present in vivo experiments, CaCET1expression was driven by the TPI1 promoter, andCGT1 expression was driven by the strong constitutiveGPD1 promoter. The temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype of the CaCET1(203–520) triphosphatase mutant (Δ202) was completely suppressed by GPD-CGT1. The temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype was also suppressed when GPD-CEG1 was present in cis on aCaCET1(203–520) plasmid (Fig. 1). The new and instructive findings were that GPD-CGT1 suppressed the lethality of the more extensively truncated Δ216, Δ222, and Δ228 mutations ofCandida triphosphatase (Fig. 1). Yeast cells containingGPD-CGT1 plus CaCET1(217–520),CaCET1(223–520), or CaCET1(229–520) formed wild type-sized colonies on rich medium at 16, 25, 30, and 37 °C (not shown). The segment of CaCet1p from residues 203 to 228 corresponds to the guanylyltransferase-binding site of S. cerevisiae Cet1p (30Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Apparently, the overexpression of Candidaguanylyltransferase can compensate for the loss of key contacts between the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase. The lethal Δ216 and Δ222 mutations of Candida triphosphatase were also suppressed by GPD-CEG1 (Fig. 1). The lethal CaCET1(257–520) allele (Δ256) was weakly complemented by GPD-CGT1 at 25 °C. Cells containingCaCET1(257–520) plus GPD-CGT1 formed tiny colonies on rich medium at 25° and were unable to grow at either 15° or 37 °C, i.e. they were cold-sensitive and temperature-sensitive (Fig. 1). The Δ266 allele was lethal at all temperatures, even when cotransformed with GPD-CGT1. The C. albicans CGT1 gene encodes a 449- amino acid polypeptide with extensive sequence similarity toS. cerevisiae Ceg1p (25Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The active-site lysine that becomes covalently bound to GMP during the nucleotidyltransferase reaction is located at position 67 in Cgt1p and position 70 in Ceg1p. Because even small deletions from the N terminus of Ceg1p result in loss of function in vivo and in vitro (19Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we presumed that N-terminal deletions of Cgt1p would also be deleterious. Therefore, we constructed a series of C-terminal deletion alleles ofCGT1 that were cloned into CEN vectors under the control of the TPI1 promoter and then tested by plasmid shuffle for complementation of the S. cerevisiae ceg1Δ mutant. The CGT1(1–426), CGT1(1–408), andCGT1(1–387) mutants were viable, whereasCGT1(1–367) was lethal (Fig.2 A). Full-length Cgt1p and the C-terminal deletion mutants Cgt1(1–426)p (CΔ23), Cgt1(1–408)p (CΔ41), and Cgt1(1–387)p (CΔ62), and Cgt1(1–367)p (CΔ82) were expressed in bacteria as His10-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose column chromatography. The elution profile of full-length Cgt1p is shown in Fig.3. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a 55-kDa polypeptide corresponding to Cgt1p was recovered in the 100 and 200 mm imidazole eluate fractions (Fig. 3 A). Guanylyltransferase activity was assayed by the formation of a covalent enzyme-[32P]GMP adduct (EpG) when the protein fractions were incubated with [α-32P]GTP and magnesium. The activity detected in the soluble lysate (Fig. 3 B,lane S) was adsorbed to Ni2+-agarose and eluted in the 100 and 200 mm imidazole fractions in parallel with the recombinant Cgt1p polypeptide (Fig. 3 B). The SDS-PAGE analysis of the nickel-agarose fractions of the full-length and truncated Cgt1p proteins revealed similar extents of purification and the expected increments in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2 B). Mutants CΔ23, CΔ41, and CΔ62 retained guanylyltransferase activity, whereas the CΔ82 protein was unable to form the protein-GMP complex (Fig. 2 C). Thus, there was a clear correlation between the in vivo lethality and the loss of catalytic activity elicited by deletion of the Cgt1p segment from positions 367 to 387. Full-length recombinant Cgt1p was sedimented in a 15–30% glycerol gradient with internal standards catalase, bovine serum albumin, and cytochrome c (Fig.4 A). Note that the catalase and Cgt1p polypeptides migrated identically during SDS-PAGE. The more rapidly sedimenting polypeptide corresponds to catalase, whereas the component sedimenting as a discrete peak between bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c corresponds to Cgt1p. The guanylyltransferase activity profile was coincident with the slower sedimenting Cgt1p protein in fractions 17 to 21 (not shown). Thus, we conclude that Candida guanylyltransferase is a monomeric enzyme. The catalytically active CΔ62 protein (clearly resolved from catalase during SDS-PAGE) also sedimented as a discrete monomeric peak between bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c (Fig. 4 B). The same was true of the CΔ82 mutant (Fig. 4C), which suggests that the loss of catalytic activity accompanying the incremental deletion was not caused by gross misfolding and aggregation of the CΔ82 polypeptide. Further characterization of the guanylyltransferase reaction was performed using the peak glycerol gradient fraction of wild type Cgt1p. Formation of the covalent Cgt1p-[32P]GMP adduct during a 10-min reaction at 37 °C with 5 μm[α32P]GTP was absolutely dependent on a divalent cation cofactor. Either magnesium or manganese at 2.5 mm could satisfy the cofactor requirement, but calcium, cobalt, copper, and zinc could not (data not shown). Activity was proportional to magnesium concentration up to 2.5 mm and reached a plateaued at 2.5–10 mm MgCl2 (not shown). Cgt1p-[32P]GMP formation in the presence of manganese was optimal at 1.25 mm MnCl2 (not shown). The yield of Cgt1p-[32P]GMP increased with GTP concentration up to 2.5 μm GTP and leveled off at 5 μm GTP (not shown). Kinetic analysis showed that Cgt1p-[32P]GMP formation in the presence of 5 μm GTP increased with time up to 2 min and plateaued at 5 min (data not shown). Approximately 9% of the input Cgt1p polypeptide was labeled with [32P]GMP during the in vitro reaction with 5 μmGTP. S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase (Cet1p) and RNA guanylyltransferase (Ceg1p) interact in vivoand in vitro to form a bifunctional mRNA capping enzyme complex. Although it is not known if CaCet1p and Cgt1p exist as a complex in vivo in C. albicans, the findings of Yamada-Okabe et al. (26Yamada-Okabe T. Mio T. Matsui M. Kashima Y. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that CaCet1p interacts with either Cgt1p or Ceg1p in a two-hybrid reporter assay in S. cerevisiae are at least consistent with the existence of a bifunctional complex in Candida. We recently localized the guanylyltransferase binding function of S. cerevisiae Cet1p to a short segment from residues 232 to 265 (30Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This domain is conserved in the C. albicans RNA triphosphatase CaCet1p and is essential for in vivo function when CaCet1p is expressed in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1). The experiment in Fig. 5 shows that the recombinant wild type C. albicans guanylyltransferase Cgt1p bound nearly quantitatively to a biotinylated 34-amino acid synthetic peptide Cet1(232–265) coupled to streptavidin-coated beads. The input Cgt1p was eluted with SDS from the peptide-containing beads along with the smaller streptavidin polypeptide (Fig. 5, lane B). Cgt1p did not bind at all to streptavidin beads alone (30Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The catalytically active truncated proteins CΔ62 also bound to the immobilized Cet1(232–265) peptide (Fig. 5). The instructive finding was that the catalytically inactive CΔ82 protein retained the capacity to recognize the triphosphatase peptide ligand (Fig. 5). We conclude that the binding site for the triphosphatase resides within the N-terminal 367 amino acids of Cgt1p. Further truncation of Cgt1p from the C terminus resulted in extensive proteolysis when the recombinant polypeptide was expressed in bacteria; this problem impeded our efforts to delineate the C-terminal margins of the triphosphatase-binding site on Cgt1p."

Each of these proteins contains three DNA-binding domains (DBD), properties of which appear to be regulated by phosphorylation. High levels of these proteins are characteristic for rapidly dividing cells in embryonic tissues and tumors. On the basis of their occurrence, specific functions for each of these proteins have been postulated. In this study we demonstrate differences in the nature of contacts of these proteins with promoter region of the interferon-β gene. We show that HMGI and HMGY interact with this DNA via three DBDs, whereas HMGI-C and Chironomus HMGI bind to this DNA using only two domains. Phosphorylation of HMGY protein by Cdc2 kinase leads to impairing of contacts between the N-terminally located DBD and a single promoter element. The perturbations in the architecture of the protein·DNA complexes involve changes in the degree of unbending of the intrinsically bent IFNβ promoter.

Our results provide first insights into the molecular basis of functional specificity of proteins of the HMGI/Y family and their regulation by phosphorylation. diverse proteins countering multiple AT-hooks casein kinase 2 DNA-binding domain containing an AT-hook high mobility group HMGI and HMGY proteins that are products of a single gene HMGI protein from the midge Chironomus tentans interferon β gene luminescence resonance energy transfer base pair(s) four-way junction DNA N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The family of high mobility group I/Y chromosomal (HMGI/Y)1 nonhistone proteins comprises different structurally related proteins found in evolutionary distant organisms, including bacteria, insects, plants, and mammals (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian HMGI, HMGY (HMGI(Y)), and HMGI-C and insect cHMGI belong to the best characterized proteins of this family (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

HMGI/Y play an important role in regulation of transcriptional activity of many genes (3Bustin M. Mol. Cell.

During the last 5 years, the HMGI/Y genes have attracted a lot of interest because they are causally involved in the genesis of benign tumors. Aberrations involving the chromosomal regions 12q15 and 6p21.3 affecting theHMGI-C and HMGI(Y) gene, respectively, have been shown in a variety of benign tumors, e.g. uterine leiomyomas, endometrial polyps, pleomorphic adenomas, pulmonary chondroid hamartomas, and lipomas (8Ashar H.R.

In addition, a re-expression ofHMGI-C and high level expression of HMGI(Y) have been observed in a number of malignant human tumors (15Chiappetta G. Bandiera A. Berlingieri M.T. Visconti R.

The oncogenic potential of HMGI(Y) genes has been confirmed by functional tests including NIH3T3 assay, knock-out technique, and antisense construct transfection (21Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1453-1545Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Fedele M. Berlingieri M.T. Scala S. Chiariotti L. Viglietto G.

Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Despite structural similarities between the three mammalian members of the HMGI/Y family, it appears that each of the proteins have a specific function. In the pygmy phenotype that arises from the inactivation of theHMGI-C gene, the gene expression of the HMGI(Y)gene is not affected, thus indicating that HMGI and HMGY proteins are not able to substitute functionally for HMGI-C protein (23Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Neoplastic transformation of the murine JB6 cells by a phorbol ester is accompanied by synthesis of the HMGY but not HMGI protein, suggesting that HMGI and HMGY have different functions (24Cmarik J.L. Li Y. Ogram S.A. Min H. Reeves R. Colburn N.H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, in MCF-7 cells, posttranslational modifications appear to affect differentially the abilities of the HMGI and HMGY proteins to interact with AT-rich ligands and nucleosomes (25Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite continuously increasing interest in the function(s) of this group of proteins, the nature of the interaction of these proteins with DNA is still not sufficiently understood. The proteins of the HMGI/Y family are 10–11 kDa in size, are highly charged, are rich both in acidic and basic residues, are proline-rich, and contain only few residues with bulky hydrophobic side chains. This unusual amino acid composition inhibits folding of the polypeptide backbone of these proteins into any defined secondary structure. Common for HMGI/Y proteins is the presence of three putative DNA-binding domains (DBD), so called AT-hooks (26Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR analysis of a complex of a peptide derived from HMGI(Y) bound to a short DNA fragment revealed that the centrally located RGR residues are essentially for binding and responsible for contacts of the protein with the bases and phosphate-sugar backbone (27Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.S. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Alternative approaches, which used deletion and point-mutated proteins, revealed that two or three DBDs of the protein bind to DNA in a cooperative way (28Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Application of the protein-footprinting method for mapping of protein regions interacting with DNA (31Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9643-9650Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) allowed more detailed characterization of the binding of HMGI(Y) proteins to DNA (32Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A combination of this method with other biochemical approaches has recently brought insights into the organization of the complex of the HMGI-C protein with a promoter region of the interferon-β (IFNβ) gene (33Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). That work revealed, that the first and the second AT-hook of the HMGI-C protein interact with PRDII and NRDI elements of the promoter (33Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase of HMGI-C perturbs organization of the protein·DNA complex. In this work we have extended our studies for other three members of the HMGI/Y family: the HMGI and HMGY as well as the insect cHMGI protein. We have found that the proteins differ in their affinities for binding to the IFNβ promoter, stabilities of the complex, and the number of protein-DNA contacts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the HMGY protein by Cdc2 kinase weakens contacts of the first AT-hook to the PRDIII-1 element of IFNβ promoter. We show that phosphorylation of the HMGY protein attenuates the unbending activity on the IFNβ promoter. Our data support the experimental evidence that various members of the HMGI/Y family have distinct functions. The coding region of the human HMGY, HMGI, HMGI-C, and cHMGI proteins were cloned into the expression vector pET3a, and the proteins were overexpressed, extracted, and purified as described previously (34Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wiśniewski J.R. Heβler K. Claus P. Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For Cdc2 kinase, 50 μg of the recombinant HMGY protein were phosphorylated at 30 °C with 10 units of recombinant human Cdc2 kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 5 h in the presence of 4 mm ATP in 8 μl of Cdc2 kinase buffer containing: 50 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, pH 7.5. For casein kinase 2 (CK2), 50 μg of purified mammalian HMG protein or Cdc2-phosphorylated HMGY were phosphorylated at 37 °C with 500 units of recombinant human CK2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 5 min in the presence of 200 μm ATP in 50 μl of CK2 buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. Phosphorylation of cHMGI was extended for 2.5 h. For 32P-end-labeling, 100–150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The identity and phosphorylation extent of the isolated proteins were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight spectroscopy. The synthetic linear poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) DNA was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The approximate average length of this DNA was 5000 bp. The 34-bp fragment of the promoter of the IFNβ gene containing the PRDIII-1, PRDII, and NRDI elements was prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides (32Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Four-way junction DNA (4H DNA) was prepared according to Bianchi (36Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For DNA footprinting and mobility shift experiments, the oligonucleotides were32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (34Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wiśniewski J.R. Heβler K. Claus P. Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified proteins were incubated with less than 1 nm of labeled DNA in 180 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 8% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, at 20 °C for 10 min. The DNA and DNA·protein complexes were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. 10,000–15,000 cpm 5′-labeled IFNβ-DNA (30 nm) was partially digested with hydroxyl radicals in a 10-μl reaction volume in presence or absence of 30 nm HMG protein in 180 mm NaCl, 20 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 20 min as described previously (33Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated on 18% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 7 m urea/TBE. The gels were scanned and the data analyzed as described previously (33Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 5′-labeled IFNβ-DNA was methylated or ethylated with dimethyl sulfate (37Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (38Wissmann A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), respectively. ∼100 nm modified DNA was incubated with 0.3 μm protein, and the protein-DNA complexes were separated from unbound DNA by gel electrophoresis. The DNAs were eluted from the gels and cleaved at methylated purines or ethylated phosphates with 10% piperidine or 0.14 m NaOH, respectively. Finally, equal amounts of radioactivity (∼5000 cpm) of the cleavage products were analyzed on sequencing gels. G+A standard was generated according to Maxam and Gilbert (39Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (8985) Google Scholar). For data analyses, gels were scanned and gel loading efficiencies were corrected. Intensities of the bands were measured for bound and unbound fraction using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and EXCEL (Microsoft). The extent of interference of modification at single site was defined as a ratio of the intensities of bound to free DNA. 10 pmol of the radioactively end-labeled protein (10,000–20,000 cpm) were digested in presence or absence of DNA in a total volume of 10 μl of 180 mm NaCl and 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 30 min. The chemical digestions were started by sequential addition of 1 μl each of the following freshly prepared solutions: (i) 20 mm EDTA and 10 mm(NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2, (ii) 0.2 m sodium ascorbate, and (iii) 0.375% (v/v) H2O2. Reactions were stopped after 30 min by addition of 3.3 μl of 4-fold SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 16% glycerol, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The reaction products were separated on 16.5% polyacrylamide gels using the Tricine-SDS buffer system (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar) and analyzed as described previously (32Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorimages of the full lane widths were scanned and the intensities were plottedversus mobility (ImageQuant software). The intensity plots were aligned to correct distortions between different lanes using ALIGN software. The aligned intensity plots were imported into Excel (Microsoft), and gel-loading efficiencies and the extent of cleavages were normalized. The electrophoretic mobilities were transformed into amino acid residue positions, and mean values for each positions were calculated. Finally, each amino acid residue position was compared in a difference plot: Δnorm =(I without DNA −I with DNA)/I without DNA, where Δnorm is the normalized difference,I without DNA is mean value of the corrected PhosphorImager intensity of single residue position measured in the absence of DNA, and I with DNA is the mean value of corrected PhosphorImager intensity of the same position measured in the presence of DNA. Due to ambiguity of the assignment and poor resolution, the peptides at the front of the gel and those of near full-length protein, respectively, were excluded from the analysis. Size markers were obtained by limited digestions of 10 pmol of end-labeled HMG protein by trypsin, thermolysin, proteinase Arg-C, proteinase Glu-C, proteinase Asp-N, or chymotrypsin in a 10-μl reaction volume. Cleavage in the presence of 10 ng of trypsin, thermolysin, or chymotrypsin was carried out in 180 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 0, 20, or 20 °C, respectively. The reactions with trypsin were stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.14 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. The cleavage with proteinases Glu-C and Asp-N was carried out in the presence of 50 ng of enzyme in 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 180 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Digestion of the protein in the presence of 20 ng of Arg-C was performed in 90 mm Tris/HCl containing 8.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, at 20 °C. Finally, the reactions were stopped by addition of 4-fold SDS sample buffer with 20 mmEDTA. The 34-bp IFNβ DNA fragment derivative with the amino-dT residues (Glen Research, Sterling, VA) incorporated into base pair 7 (bottom strand) and base pair 28 (top strand) was prepared by automated oligonucleotide synthesis. The bottom and top strands were labeled with donor and acceptor fluorochrome and were purified as described previously (42Heyduk E. Heyduk T. SPIE Proc. 1998; 3256: 218-222Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The luminescent donor used was (Eu3+)DTPA-AMCA (43Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3315-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fluorescent acceptor was Cy5 (45Mujumdar R.B. Ernst L.A. Mujumdar S.R. Lewis C.J. Waggoner A.S. Bioconjugate Chem. 1993; 4: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Upon hybridization of donor- and acceptor-labeled strands, a 34-bp DNA duplex was obtained with the probes in the major groove of DNA (42Heyduk E. Heyduk T. SPIE Proc. 1998; 3256: 218-222Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), on the opposite face of DNA with respect to protein-DNA interface, and separated by two turns of DNA helix. Luminescence lifetime measurements were performed on a laboratory-built two-channel spectrofluorometer with a pulsed nitrogen laser (LN300, Laser Photonics, Orlando, FL) as an excitation source (43Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Donor emission was observed at 617 nm, whereas acceptor emission was observed at 670 nm. The details of the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) measurements and the advantages of using europium chelates for energy transfer measurements have been discussed previously (43Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 47Selvin P.R.

Only sensitized acceptor decays were analyzed since these decays contain information pertaining to energy transfer in the absence of any contamination with the signal of the donor not engaged in energy transfer (42Heyduk E. Heyduk T. SPIE Proc. 1998; 3256: 218-222Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 43Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J.

I=Saiexp(−t/ti)Equation 1 I is the measured intensity at time tafter the excitation pulse, and ai andti are the amplitude and the lifetime of theith decay component, respectively. The decay curves were fitted to Equation 1 by a nonlinear regression using SCIENTIST (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). All decays could be fitted to the two exponential decay equation. About 1–2% of the total donor signal (the amplitudes of donors corresponding to observed lifetimes and amplitudes in sensitized acceptor decays were calculated as described elsewhere 2T. Heyduk, manuscript in preparation. decayed with a short lifetime (∼100 μs), whereas remaining 98–99% of the signal decayed with a lifetime in the 400–550-μs range. The latter lifetime was used for energy transfer calculations. The energy transfer (E) between europium chelate and CY5 was calculated as described previously (50Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Claus P.

The R 0 was calculated assuming a completely randomized orientations of donor and acceptor. This assumption is particularly valid in the case of long-lived europium chelate donors (47Selvin P.R.

Studies in which properties of the all three mammalian HMGI/Y proteins have been compared are rare. Maher and Nathans (29Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were the first who simultaneously analyzed binding properties of HMGI, HMGY and HMGI-C. However, the authors focused their work on the role of the length and the spacing of AT-tracts of the DNA ligand for tight binding revealing differences between individual proteins in binding to various DNA fragments. Using the IFNβ promoter DNA fragment, we have extended their work. We compared binding properties of the three human HMGI/Y proteins and the insect cHMGI protein (Fig.1). The proteins differ in their affinities for the studied DNA fragment (Fig. 1 B). The interaction of the HMGI protein was found to be ∼5 and ∼8 times stronger in comparison to HMGY and HMGI-C, respectively (Fig. 1,B and C; Table I). The strong binding of Chironomus protein to this promoter may suggest that function(s) of cHMGI are similar to that of HMGI and HMGY in mammals (Fig. 1, B and C; Table I).Table IProperties of binding of the HMGI/Y proteins to the IFNβ fragmentProtein“Equilibrium” dissociation constant,K d“Kinetic” dissociation constant,k dHalf-lifetime of the complexnms −1 × 10 −5hHMGI7.8 ± 0.418 ± 1.81.5HMGY35 ± 1.54.4 ± 1.96.3HMGY[PCK2]107 ± 15ND 1-aND, not determined.HMGY[PCdc2PCK2]330 ± 154.1 ± 1.36.8HMGI-C60 ± 3.07.1 ± 0.23.9cHMGI17 ± 1.116 ± 2.01.71-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab During migration through the gel, the protein·DNA complex is under nonequilibrium conditions and dissociates continuously (Fig.1 D). Analysis of the process allows obtaining information on the stability of the complex, e.g. its susceptibility to dissociation in response to changing physiological conditions. Quantification of the amounts of the labeled DNA in the complex after various times of electrophoresis (Fig. 1 D) allowed determination of kinetic dissociation constant (kd ) for each protein (Fig. 1, E andF; Table I). The HMGY protein has the lowestkd value, whereas the HMGI protein exhibits the highest one (Table I). These values correspond to half-life times of the complex of 6.3 and 1.5 h, respectively. For the HMGI-C·INFβ complex, an intermediate value of 3.9 h was determined. The complex containing cHMGI dissociated as rapidly as that one of the HMGI protein (Fig. 1, D–F). Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting experiments with HMGI, HMGY, HMGI-C, and cHMGI proteins were performed to identify regions of the proteins involved in contacts with the fragment of the promoter of the IFNβ gene. Phosphorylation with CK2 kinase of the sites located in the C-terminal region of each protein was used for the end-labeling of the proteins (Fig. 1 A). This phosphorylation reflects a constitutive modification found in native forms of these proteins (53Ferranti P. Malorni A. Marino G. Pucci P. Goodwin G.H. Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. J. Biol.

The free and DNA-bound proteins were digested with hydroxyl radicals, and the digestion products were separated by electrophoresis.

S., Kim, A. Y., Quillen, J. M., Sayers, E., Yang, X. J., and Miles, E. W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29936–29944). Comparison with the wild-type enzyme showed that the βTrp170 side chain occludes the tunnel connecting the α- and β-active sites, explaining the accumulation of the intermediate indole during a single enzyme turnover. To prevent a steric clash between βLeu169 and βGly135, located in the β-sheet of the COMM (communication) domain (βGly102-βGly189), the latter reorganizes. The changed COMM domain conformation results in a loss of the hydrogen bonding networks between the α- and β-active sites, explaining the poor activation of the α-reaction upon formation of the aminoacrylate complex at the β-active site. The 100-fold reduced affinity for serine seems to result from a movement of βAsp305 away from the β-active site so that it cannot interact with the hydroxyl group of a pyridoxal phosphate-bound serine. The proposed structural dissection of the effects of each single mutation in the βA169L/βC170W mutant would explain the very different kinetics of this mutant and βC170F.

In the α-subunit indole-glycerol-phosphate (IGP) is cleaved to indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (α-reaction; for reviews see Refs. 1Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Miles E.W. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 207-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 3Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-172PubMed Google Scholar). At the β-active site, the second substrate l-serine binds to and is then activated by a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor to form a highly reactive aminoacrylate intermediate, which reacts with indole to form the product l-tryptophan (β-reaction). The failure to detect indole even in rapid chemical quench experiments (4Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the existence of a ∼25 Å-long tunnel that connects the α- and β-active sites (5Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strongly suggests that indole is transferred through this tunnel from the active site in the α-subunit to the one in the β-subunit. This process, the direct transfer of an intermediate or metabolite between two sequential enzymes without free diffusion through the solvent, is known as substrate channeling. Channeling is thought to play an important role in metabolite regulation and cellular modulation of enzymatic activities (1Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the case of tryptophan synthase, it prevents loss of the intermediate indole through the cell membranes.An important requirement for enzymes exhibiting substrate channeling is the tight regulation of the two coupled reactions so that they remain in phase. In tryptophan synthase, synchronization is achieved first by the influence of the α-site ligand on the affinity for serine and the distribution of the intermediates formed at the β-active site upon binding and subsequent reaction of serine and the PLP cofactor (8Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (for review see Ref. 2Miles E.W. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 207-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, the IGP cleavage rate is increased ∼150-fold upon formation of the aminoacrylate at the β-active site (4Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indole does not accumulate in the tunnel or at the β-active site, as the transfer of indole through the tunnel is fast (>1000 s−1) and the reaction with the aminoacrylate is largely irreversible. This kinetic model for efficient channeling predicts that obstruction or occlusion of the tunnel should lead to an accumulation of indole such that it may be detected in single-turnover rapid quench experiments. To test this hypothesis, βCys170, which lines the tunnel, was mutated to phenylalanine or tryptophan (9Ruvinov S.B. Yang X.J. Parris K.D. Banik U. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Sackett D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6357-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Anderson K.S. Kim A.Y. Quillen J.M. Sayers E. Yang X.J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The latter mutant also contained the substitution βA169L, which introduces a restriction enzyme site for convenient verification of the mutation. The low resolution crystal structure of the double mutant shows that the introduced tryptophan, βTrp170, obstructs the tunnel (11Schlichting I. Yang X.J. Miles E.W. Kim A.Y. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the kinetic model, indole can indeed be detected in the two βCys170 mutants by single-turnover chemical quench-flow experiments (10Anderson K.S. Kim A.Y. Quillen J.M. Sayers E. Yang X.J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rate constant for channeling, which is >1000 s−1for wild-type TRPS, is 100 s−1 for βC170F and 0.2 s−1 for βA169L/βC170W (Table I). It is intriguing that this difference is related to the size of the obstructing residue at position β170. In contrast, it was rather unexpected to find that the activation of the α-reaction by the aminoacrylate is the same in the wild-type and the βC170F mutant, whereas it is reduced 100-fold in the βA169L/βC170W mutant (Table I). This observation was interpreted as an impairment of the α ↔ β subunit communication. It was speculated that the activation of IGP cleavage at the α-site upon formation of the aminoacrylate complex at the β-active site is prevented by the presence of the indole ring of βTrp170, which may mimic an indole intermediate in the tunnel (10Anderson K.S.

Open table in a new tab Recently, we deduced a structural model for the allosteric α ↔ β subunit communication (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate (or substrate analog) binding to the α-active site induces an ordering of the catalytically important loops αL2 and αL6 and a concerted rearrangement of both gating residues βTyr279 and βPhe280 (9Ruvinov S.B. Yang X.J. Parris K.D. Banik U. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Sackett D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6357-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Rhee S. Parris K.D.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16469-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), resulting in tunnel blockage and thus preventing untimely passage of indole. The ordering of a rigid but movable domain (βGly102–βGly189) is concomitant. We named it the “COMM domain” because it is central to the α ↔ β-active site communication. Rhee et al. (15Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) introduced the domain βGly93–βGly189 as the “mobile region.” This COMM domain interacts with residues of α-subunit loops αL2 and αL6, β-subunit residues including βAsp305, which is involved in binding of the metal ion, and active site residues βGlu109 and βGln114. Changes on either active site disrupt the respective interactions with the COMM domain, which results in a rigid body movement of the COMM domain, thereby changing the interactions at the other active site and thus transmitting the signal.We decided to revisit the βA169L/βC170W mutant to see whether our model provides the structural basis for the changed kinetic properties of the mutant. Our previous study of the βA169L/βC170W mutant was hampered by the low resolution (3.2 Å) of the structure determined using x-rays from a rotating anode. Therefore, we redetermined the structure of the mutant complexed with the noncleavable IGP analogue 5-fluoro-indole propanol phosphate (F-IPP) to 2.25 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation. The comparison of the kinetic properties of the single mutant βC170F and the double mutant βA169L/βC170W, together with the comparison of the structures of the latter and the wild-type enzyme, suggests the reason for the impaired inter-subunit communication being the βA169L mutation, whereas the βC170W replacement seems to be responsible for the modified channeling characteristics.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe βA169L/βC170W mutant of TRPS was purified (9Ruvinov S.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously. Diffraction data were collected of a crystal mounted in a capillary and kept at 4 °C at beam-line X12C at the National Synchrotron Light Source using a MAR Research image plate detector. The data were integrated and scaled with the HKL suite of programs (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). Refinement to 2.5 Å resolution was started with CNS 0.9a (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

The coordinates of the wild-type TRPSIPP complex (PDB code 1Q0P) were used as a starting model, omitting the coordinates of loops αL2 and αL6, IPP, the cofactor PLP, and all water molecules. The mutated residues were modeled as alanines to avoid model bias. The final model was built by cyclic rounds of manual model building with the program“O” (19Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and Maximum Likelihood refinement with the program REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) using all reflections from 20 to 2.25 Å. Water molecules were incorporated by ARP (21Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the automatic cut-off option. All waters were checked manually and removed if displaying unusual H-bonding geometry. Apart from residues at the C termini of both polypeptide chains, the only part of the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex that remains too disordered to be built into electron density is the C-terminal part of loop αL6 (αArg188-αPro192). As shown in Fig. 1 A, two regions in the β-subunit show disproportionately high B-factors (>2ς × <B> = 72 Å2, mean value <B> = 36 Å2): the first residues (βAla136-βSer143) of helix βH5 and the residues (βHis160-βAls164) preceding helix βH6 (secondary structure definition according to Ref. 12Schneider T.R.

Because both amino acid stretches belong to the COMM domain and may have structural and/or communicative functions, we retained these coordinates in the final model, although the final Sigma A-weighted 2 mFo − DFc (20Murshudov G.N.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe structure of the double mutant βA169L/βC170W is of high quality as indicated by the low R-factors and the good stereochemistry (see Table II). The side chain conformations of the mutated amino acids are very well defined by the electron density (Fig. 2 A). The mutant has the same secondary and tertiary structure as the wild-type enzyme, and the overall topology is similar to the one assigned by Schneider et al. (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that is observed in all TRPS structures. F-IPP binds (not shown) in a depression on the surface of the α-subunit and is held in place by several hydrogen bonds to the phosphate at the one end and hydrophobic interactions with the indole moiety at the other end, similar to the wild-type enzyme (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following, we compare the structures of the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex and the wild-type IPP complex (TRPSIPP, Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1Q0P) (14Weyand M. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16469-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reason is that the latter was determined to a much higher resolution than the TRPSF-IPP complex (PDB code 1A50) (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and a comparison of both complexes shows high structural similarity; the superposition of 564 Cα pairs, excluding the COMM domain residues, gives a r.m.s. deviation of 0.36 Å for Cα atoms and 0.13 Å for the 17 common α-ligand atoms, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The low r.m.s. deviation value for the common α-ligand atoms indicates a high similarity of the α-ligand binding site and also for the enzyme, excluding the COMM domain; this shows that the additional fluorine atom in F-IPP compared with IPP has no influence on the TRPS structure. In particular, it does not change the COMM domain conformation (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I.

Because they have been observed in positions that result in an open (5Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

Miles E.W. Kim A.Y. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the βTrp170 side chain points into the tunnel, thereby blocking it. In addition, because the bulky side chain of βC170W would clash with the βPhe280 side chain, the latter rotates by about 110° in χ1, and the backbone Φ/Ψ torsion angles change from Φ/ΨWT = 63.5°/23.2 to Φ/Ψmut = 55.4°/36.8°. The new side chain conformation of βPhe280 induces a χ1rotation of about 18° for βTyr279 (see Fig. 2); leading to a number of new interactions of its hydroxyl group. Of note is the hydrogen bond (2.6 Å) to the oxygen atom Oδ1 of asparagine βAsn171, which further forms a hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) to aspartate αAsp56Oδ2. This latter interaction is also found in wild-type TRPS structures (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Weyand M. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16469-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but the interaction mediated by the asparagine βAsn171 between the side chain of a gating residue and a loop αLeu2 residue is seen only in the βA169L/βC170W mutant structure. In addition, the new conformation of the βTyr279 side chain results in an unfavorable contact between its hydroxyl group and the Cβ carbon atom of aspartate αAsp56 (2.7 Å). These interactions may influence the communication properties of the βA169L/βC170W mutant, because αAsp56 and βAsn171 are involved in the inter-subunit communication pathway (12Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).The main effect of the βC170W mutation on the gating residues βTyr279 and βPhe280 is a loss of rotational freedom. In particular, phenylalanine βPhe280 is trapped in a hydrophobic pocket built of side chains from αLeu58,βTrp170, βLeu174, βTyr279, βMet282, βMet286, βPhe306, and βPhe307. Although the conformations of βTyr279 and βPhe280correspond to an open gate in the βA169L/βC170WF-IPPcomplex, the tunnel is occluded by the indolyl side chain of βTrp170.Several COMM domain regions have significantly different conformations in the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex compared with the wild type (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). The changes are caused primarily by the introduction of leucine βLeu169, because its side chain would be too close to the adjacent amide nitrogen atom of βGly135 (distance 1.6 Å) and the Cα of βMet134 (distance 2.5 Å) located at the end of strand βS4. Their movement prevents this backbone clash and results in a domino effect-like rearrangement of the COMM domain; because strand βS4 is one of the middle β-strands of the four-stranded parallel COMM domain β-sheet and forms hydrogen bonds to residues of both neighboring strands βS3 and βS5, these strands and the N-terminal part of β-strand βS6 also move. The shift of all four COMM domain β-strands is conveyed by the movement of helix βH5 and loops βL3 and βL5. The maximum Cα atom shift of ∼3.5 Å is found at lysine βLys137. It is noteworthy that the catalytically important glutamate βGlu109 (4Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brzovic P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) moves away from the β-active site with its carboxylate carbon atom shifting by ∼2.1 Å.A further consequence of the changed COMM domain conformation in the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex is found in the hydrogen bonding network involving aspartate βAsp305, which is positioned near the sodium binding site (13Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and involved in the β-elimination reaction yielding the external aldimine (15Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the side chain of aspartate βAsp305 points toward the β-active site (“swing in” position (13Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) in both the TRPSIPP (14Weyand M. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16469-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the βA169L/βC170WF-IPPcomplex, there are significant differences. In the wild type, the distance between the carboxylate oxygen Oδ2of βAsp305 and the amide nitrogen of βGly111 is 3.4 Å, and the βAsp305carboxylate is linked via one or two water molecules to the COMM domain residues βAsp138, βGln142, and βThr165, respectively. This network is broken in the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex because the respective COMM domain residues are shifted from the core of the β-subunit due to the introduction of the leucine βLeu169 as described above (distance between Oδ2 of βAsp305 and the amide of βGly111 is 6.1 Å). This results in a loss of all water molecules involved in the hydrogen bonding network between βAsp305 and the COMM domain. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the nonobservation of the bridging water molecules is due to the lower resolution of the diffraction data, careful analysis of the finalmFo − DFc electron density map at a very low cut-off shows no indication for bound water molecules in this region. In contrast, the final 2 mFo − DFc map shows clear backbone and side chain conformations for βAsp305 with Φ/Ψ torsion angles of −91.2°/16.5° compared with −90.8°/−6.2° in the TRPSIPP structure, indicating a small but significant conformational change because of the missing water contacts. Despite the changed conformation of βAsp305, the βA169L/βC170WF-IPP complex contains a sodium ion. This fact can be attributed to the altered side chain conformation of the gating residues, because the side chain conformation of βPhe280 stabilizes the metal binding loop through hydrophobic interactions with the side chain rings of βPhe306 and proline βPro307.Based on the structure of the βA169L/βC170LF-IPPcomplex presented here, one can discuss the kinetic properties of both βCys170 mutants (see Table I) (4Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8020-8033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Anderson K.S. Kim A.Y. Quillen J.M. Sayers E. Yang X.J. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

Both should have a more or less blocked tunnel, because the side chain of residue β170 points into the tunnel. A manually built βC170F model (figure not"
