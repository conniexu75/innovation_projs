https://openalex.org/W2094366129,"One reason for the poor immunogenicity of many tumors may be that they cannot provide signals for CD28-mediated costimulation necessary to fully activate T cells. It has recently become apparent that CTLA-4, a second counterreceptor for the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here, in vivo administration of antibodies to CTLA-4 resulted in the rejection of tumors, including preestablished tumors. Furthermore, this rejection resulted in immunity to a secondary exposure to tumor cells. These results suggest that blockade of the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 can allow for, and potentiate, effective immune responses against tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2158155007,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive, degenerative disease that involves the central and peripheral nervous systems and the heart. A gene, X25, was identified in the critical region for the FRDA locus on chromosome 9q13. The gene encodes a 210-amino acid protein, frataxin, that has homologs in distant species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast. A few FRDA patients were found to have point mutations in X25, but the majority were homozygous for an unstable GAA trinucleotide expansion in the first X25 intron."

https://openalex.org/W2001907809,"Single linear DNA molecules were bound at multiple sites at one extremity to a treated glass cover slip and at the other to a magnetic bead. The DNA was therefore torsionally constrained. A magnetic field was used to rotate the beads and thus to coil and pull the DNA. The stretching force was determined by analysis of the Brownian fluctuations of the bead. Here, the elastic behavior of individual λ DNA molecules over- and underwound by up to 500 turns was studied. A sharp transition was discovered from a low to a high extension state at a force of ∼0.45 piconewtons for underwound molecules and at a force of ∼3 piconewtons for overwound ones. These transitions, probably reflecting the formation of alternative structures in stretched coiled DNA molecules, might be relevant for DNA transcription and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2043409652,"Controlling expression of IPT, a gene encoding isopentenyltransferase (the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cytokinin biosynthesis), with a senescence-specific promoter results in the suppression of leaf senescence. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing this chimeric gene do not exhibit the developmental abnormalities usually associated with IPT expression because the system is autoregulatory. Because sufficient cytokinin is produced to retard senescence, the activity of the senescence-specific promoter is attenulated. Senescence-retarded leaves exhibit a prolonged, photosythetically active life-span. This result demonstrates that endogenously produced cytokinin can regulate senescence and provides a system to specifically manipulate the senescence program."
https://openalex.org/W2000775105,"The correlated activity of rat hippocampal pyramidal cells during sleep reflects the activity of those cells during earlier spatial exploration. Now the patterns of activity during sleep have also been found to reflect the order in which the cells fired during spatial exploration. This relation was reliably stronger for sleep after the behavioral session than before it; thus, the activity during sleep reflects changes produced by experience. This memory for temporal order of neuronal firing could be produced by an interaction between the temporal integration properties of long-term potentiation and the phase shifting of spike activity with respect to the hippocampal theta rhythm."

https://openalex.org/W1980123375,"Cell cycle phase transitions in eukaryotic cells are driven by regulation of the activity of protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). A broad spectrum of Cdk-inhibitory activity associated with a 28-kilodalton protein (p28lck1) was induced in cells treated with the drug lovastatin or upon density-mediated growth arrest and was periodic in the cell cycle, with peak activity in G1. The p28lck1 protein was shown to be identical to p27Kip1, and the periodic or induced inhibitory activity resulted from a periodic accumulation of the protein. Variations in the amount of p27 protein occurred, whereas the abundance of the p27 messenger RNA remained unchanged. In every instance investigated, the posttranscriptional alteration of p27 protein levels was achieved in part by a mechanism of translational control, although in density-arrested fibroblasts and thymidine-arrested HeLa cells the half-life of the protein was also changed."

https://openalex.org/W2040154374,"The centrosome plays a vital role in mitotic fidelity, ensuring establishment of bipolar spindles and balanced chromosome segregation. Centrosome duplication occurs only once during the cell cycle and is therefore highly regulated. Here, it is shown that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the p53 tumor suppressor protein, multiple copies of functionally competent centrosomes are generated during a single cell cycle. In contrast, MEFs prepared from normal mice or mice deficient in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product do not display these abnormalities. The abnormally amplified centrosomes profoundly affect mitotic fidelity, resulting in unequal segregation of chromosomes. These observations implicate p53 in the regulation of centrosome duplication and suggest one possible mechanism by which the loss of p53 may cause genetic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2071415293,"For some time it has been thought that antigenic challenge in neonatal life is a tolerogenic rather than immunogenic event. Reexamination of the classic neonatal tolerance experiments of Billingham, Brent, and Medawar showed that tolerance is not an intrinsic property of the newborn immune system, but that the nature of the antigen-presenting cell determines whether the outcome is neonatal tolerance or immunization."

https://openalex.org/W2027729283,"The neonatal period has been thought of as a window in ontogeny, during which the developing immune system is particularly susceptible to tolerization. In the present study, the classic system for induction of neonatal tolerance to protein antigens was reexamined in mice. The presumably tolerogenic protocol was found to trigger a vigorous T helper cell type 2 (TH2) immune response. Thus, neonatal ""tolerization"" induces immune deviation, not tolerance in the immunological sense. Neonates are not immune privileged but generate TH2 or TH1 responses, depending on the mode of immunization."

https://openalex.org/W2033017137,"The transition metal ion copper(II) has a critical role in chronic neurologic diseases. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease or a synthetic peptide representing its copper-binding site reduced bound copper(II) to copper(I). This copper ion-mediated redox reaction led to disulfide bond formation in APP, which indicated that free sulfhydryl groups of APP were involved. Neither superoxide nor hydrogen peroxide had an effect on the kinetics of copper(II) reduction. The reduction of copper(II) to copper(I) by APP involves an electron-transfer reaction and could enhance the production of hydroxyl radicals, which could then attack nearby sites. Thus, copper-mediated toxicity may contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1971604012,"Haplotypes consisting of alleles at a short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) and an Alu deletion polymorphism at the CD4 locus on chromosome 12 were analyzed in more than 1600 individuals sampled from 42 geographically dispersed populations (13 African, 2 Middle Eastern, 7 European, 9 Asian, 3 Pacific, and 8 Amerindian). Sub-Saharan African populations had more haplotypes and exhibited more variability in frequencies of haplotypes than the Northeast African or non-African populations. The Alu deletion was nearly always associated with a single STRP allele in non-African and Northeast African populations but was associated with a wide range of STRP alleles in the sub-Saharan African populations. This global pattern of haplotype variation and linkage disequilibrium suggests a common and recent African origin for all non-African human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2071366179,"A number of pathophysiologically relevant genes, including platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (PDGF-B), are induced in the vasculature after acute mechanical injury. In rat aorta, the activated expression of these genes was preceded by a marked increase in the amount of the early-growth-response gene product Egr-1 at the endothelial wound edge. Egr-1 interacts with a novel element in the proximal PDGF-B promoter, as well as with consensus elements in the promoters of other genes induced by endothelial injury. This interaction is crucial for injury-induced PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression. Sp1, whose binding site in the PDGF-B promoter overlaps that of Egr-1, occupies this element in unstimulated cells and is displaced by increasing amounts of Egr-1. These findings implicate Egr-1 in the up-regulated expression of PDGF-B and other potent mediators in mechanically injured arterial endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021722828,"Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is an autosomal recessive inherited form of epilepsy, previously linked to human chromosome 21q22.3. The gene encoding cystatin B was shown to be localized to this region, and levels of messenger RNA encoded by this gene were found to be decreased in cells from affected individuals. Two mutations, a 3' splice site mutation and a stop codon mutation, were identified in the gene encoding cystatin B in EPM1 patients but were not present in unaffected individuals. These results provide evidence that mutations in the gene encoding cystatin B are responsible for the primary defect in patients with EPM1."

https://openalex.org/W2112441679,"A key step in dioxygen evolution during photosynthesis is the oxidative generation of the O-O bond from water by a manganese cluster consisting of M2(mu-O)2 units (where M is manganese). The reverse reaction, reductive cleavage of the dioxygen O-O bond, is performed at a variety of dicopper and di-iron active sites in enzymes that catalyze important organic oxidations. Both processes can be envisioned to involve the interconversion of dimetal-dioxygen adducts, M2(O2), and isomers having M2(mu-O)2 cores. The viability of this notion has been demonstrated by the identification of an equilibrium between synthetic complexes having [Cu2(mu-eta2:eta2-O2)]2+ and [Cu2(mu-O)2]2+ cores through kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies."

https://openalex.org/W2005174604,"Two genes, period (per) and timeless (tim), are required for production of circadian rhythms in Drosophila. The proteins encoded by these genes (PER and TIM) physically interact, and the timing of their association and nuclear localization is believed to promote cycles of per and tim transcription through an autoregulatory feedback loop. Here it is shown that TIM protein may also couple this molecular pacemaker to the environment, because TIM is rapidly degraded after exposure to light. TIM accumulated rhythmically in nuclei of eyes and in pacemaker cells of the brain. The phase of these rhythms was differentially advanced or delayed by light pulses delivered at different times of day, corresponding with phase shifts induced in the behavioral rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2084147684,"The susceptibility of neonates to virus-induced disease is thought to reflect, in part, the immaturity of their immune systems. However, inoculation of newborn mice with low doses of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus induced a protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. The inability of neonates to develop a CTL response to high doses of virus was not the result of immunological immaturity but correlated with the induction of a nonprotective type 2 cytokine response. Thus, the initial viral dose is critical in the development of protective immunity in newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2090696823,"Genetically encoded libraries of peptides and oligonucleotides are well suited for the identification of ligands for many macromolecules. A major drawback of these techniques is that the resultant ligands are subject to degradation by naturally occurring enzymes. Here, a method is described that uses a biologically encoded library for the identification of D-peptide ligands, which should be resistant to proteolytic degradation. In this approach, a protein is synthesized in the D-amino acid configuration and used to select peptides from a phage display library expressing random L-amino acid peptides. For reasons of symmetry, the mirror images of these phage-displayed peptides interact with the target protein of the natural handedness. The value of this approach was demonstrated by the identification of a cyclic D-peptide that interacts with the Src homology 3 domain of c- SRC. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that the binding site for this D-peptide partially overlaps the site for the physiological ligands of this domain."

https://openalex.org/W2016808064,"Using mathematical models that combine population genetic and epidemiological processes, we resolve the paradox that many important pathogens appear to persist as discrete strains despite the constant exchange of genetic material. We show that dominant polymorphic determinants (that is, those that elicit the most effective immune responses) will be organized into nonoverlapping combinations as a result of selection by the host immune system, thereby defining a set of discrete independently transmitted strains. By analysing 222 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, we show that two highly polymorphic epitopes of the outer membrane protein PorA exist in nonoverlapping combinations as predicted by this general framework. The model indicates that dominant polymorphic determinants will be in linkage disequilibrium, despite frequent genetic exchange, even though they may be encoded by several unlinked genes. This suggests that the detection of nonrandom associations between epitope regions can be employed as a novel strategem for identifying dominant polymorphic antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1993955938,"Circadian clocks can be reset by light stimulation. To investigate the mechanism of this phase shifting, the effects of light pulses on the protein and messenger RNA products of the Drosophila clock gene period (per) were measured. Photic stimuli perturbed the timing of the PER protein and messenger RNA cycles in a manner consistent with the direction and magnitude of the phase shift. In addition, the recently identified clock protein TIM (for timeless) interacted with PER in vivo, and this association was rapidly decreased by light. This disruption of the PER-TIM complex in the cytoplasm was accompanied by a delay in PER phosphorylation and nuclear entry and disruption in the nucleus by an advance in PER phosphorylation and disappearance. These results suggest a mechanism for how a unidirectional environmental signal elicits a bidirectional clock response."

https://openalex.org/W2050502168,"A conserved sequence element in a minor class of eukaryotic pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) introns was previously proposed to base pair with a complementary sequence in the U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in a manner analogous to the pairing of US snRNA with the branch site sequence of the major class of introns. Here, mutations generated in this conserved sequence element block the splicing of a member of this minor intron class in vivo. The block was relieved by coexpression of a U12 snRNA containing compensatory mutations that restore the proposed base pairing interaction. These results show that this minor class of pre-mRNA introns is a distinct class existing alongside the major class of introns in animal genomes, and these results also establish an in vivo function for U12 snRNA."

The majority of a set of eIF-5A mutants did not support growth of yeast cells having an inactivated genomic copy of eIF-5A, indicating that the introduced mutation eliminated eIF-5A activity. Two nonfunctional mutants, eIF-5AM13 and eIF-5AM14, retained their binding capacity for the HIV-1 Rev response element:Rev complex. Both mutants were constitutively expressed in human T cells. When these T cells were infected with replication-competent HIV-1, virus replication was inhibited. The eIF-5AM13 and eIF5AM14 proteins blocked Rev trans-activation and Rev-mediated nuclear export."

Loss of CFTR-mediated chloride ion conductance from the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells is a primary physiological lesion in cystic fibrosis. CFTR has also been suggested to function as an ATP channel, although the size of the ATP anion is much larger than the estimated size of the CFTR pore. ATP was not conducted through CFTR in intact organs, polarized human lung cell lines, stably transfected mammalian cell lines, or planar lipid bilayers reconstituted with CFTR protein. These findings suggest that ATP permeation through the CFTR is unlikely to contribute to the normal function of CFTR or to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis."

Single and double BODIPY dye primers were characterized in commercially available DNA sequencers and showed uniform electrophoretic mobilities and high fluorescence intensities. The improved physical properties of BODIPY dye primers were demonstrated by direct base-calling from the unprocessed fluorescent signals and improved heterozygote analyses of mixed-base populations. The high sensitivity of BODIPY dye primers requires at least 33 percent less reagent consumed per reaction than conventional dye primers, which should affect the costs of large genome-sequencing efforts."

Deoxyglucose uptake demonstrated that the topology of the cortical whisker representation is nevertheless preserved. Anterograde tracers revealed a lack of spatial segregation of thalamic afferents into individual barrel territories, and single-cell recordings demonstrated a lack of temporal discrimination of center from surround information. Thus, structural segregation of thalamic inputs is not essential to generate topological order in the somatosensory cortex, but it is required for discrete spatiotemporal relay of sensory information to the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1982037319,"Cell cycle progression in cycling Xenopus egg extracts is accompanied by fluctuations in the concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and in the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The concentration of cAMP and the activity of PKA decrease at the onset of mitosis and increase at the transition between mitosis and interphase. Blocking the activation of PKA at metaphase prevented the transition into interphase; the activity of M phase-promoting factor (MPF; the cyclin B-p34cdc2 complex) remained high, and mitotic cyclins were not degraded. The arrest in mitosis was reversed by the reactivation of PKA. The inhibition of protein synthesis prevented the accumulation of cyclin and the oscillations of MPF, PKA, and cAMP. Addition of recombinant nondegradable cyclin B activated p34cdc2 and PKA and induced the degradation of full-length cyclin B. Addition of cyclin A activated p34cdc2 but not PKA, nor did it induce the degradation of full-length cyclin B. These findings suggest that cyclin degradation and exit from mitosis require MPF-dependent activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway."

Kinetic screens revealed that eight 2′-hydroxyl groups were likely to be critical for activity of D5. Through two separate methods, including competitive inhibition and direct kinetic analysis, effects on binding and chemistry were distinguished. Depending on their function, important 2′-hydroxyl groups lie on opposite faces of the molecule, defining distinct loci for molecular recognition and catalysis by D5."

https://openalex.org/W1997282374,"Glutamic acid-203 of the alpha subunit of transducin (αT) resides within a domain that undergoes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-induced conformational change that is essential for effector recognition. Changing the glutamic acid to an alanine in bovine αT yielded an alpha subunit (αTE203A) that was fully dependent on rhodopsin for GTP-guanosine diphosphate (GDP) exchange and showed GTP hydrolytic activity similar to that measured for wild-type αT. However, unlike the wild-type protein, the GDP-bound form of αTE203A was constitutively active toward the effector of transducin, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase. Thus, the αTE203A mutant represents a short-circuited protein switch that no longer requires GTP for the activation of the effector target phosphodiesterase."

In this issue, we explore how current political and economic trends may threaten recent advances made by women and underrepresented minorities in the scientific work force, including African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians.)☆Tight budgets are expected to hit women and minorities hardest, in part because diversity programs may be left out in the cold, as reported by Ann Gibbons. But even if budgets were ample, such efforts face major legal challenges from recent rulings on affirmative action. Berkeley-based reporter Marcia Barinaga untangles the legal threads and their implications for scientists.Such trends play out in different ways in different disciplines, and we zero in on two fields at opposite ends of the diversity spectrum. In computer science, diversity has actually dropped recently, and Virginia Morell explores subtle cultural factors that may help explain why.
