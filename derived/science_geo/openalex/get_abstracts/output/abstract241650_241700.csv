https://openalex.org/W2126531317,"Unlike most synthetic materials, biological materials often stiffen as they are strained. This property, critical for the physiological function of tissues such as blood vessels, lung parenchyma and blood clots, has been documented since the nineteenth century, but the molecular structures and design principles responsible for it are unknown. Storm et al. now show that a much simpler theory can account for strain stiffening in a wide range of biopolymer gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins. According to this theory, systems of semiflexible chains such as filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked meshwork invariably stiffen at low strains without the need for a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffnesses. The mechanical properties of soft biological tissues are essential to their physiological function and cannot easily be duplicated by synthetic materials. Unlike simple polymer gels, many biological materials—including blood vessels1, mesentery tissue2, lung parenchyma3, cornea4 and blood clots5—stiffen as they are strained, thereby preventing large deformations that could threaten tissue integrity. The molecular structures and design principles responsible for this nonlinear elasticity are unknown. Here we report a molecular theory that accounts for strain-stiffening in a range of molecularly distinct gels formed from cytoskeletal and extracellular proteins and that reveals universal stress–strain relations at low to intermediate strains. The input to this theory is the force–extension curve for individual semi-flexible filaments and the assumptions that biological networks composed of these filaments are homogeneous, isotropic, and that they strain uniformly. This theory shows that systems of filamentous proteins arranged in an open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen at low strains without requiring a specific architecture or multiple elements with different intrinsic stiffness."

St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The major β-secretasein neurons is an aspartyl protease termed BACE-1, which cleaves APP within theluminal domain, generating the N terminus of Aβ(2Vassar R. J. Mol.Neurosci. 2004; 23: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Aβis generated by intramembranous cleavage of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) byγ-secretase, a multiprotein complex made of four essential components,presenilin (PS) 1 (or PS2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and APH-1(3Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin.Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mutations inPSEN1 and PSEN2, encoding multipass membrane proteins PS1and PS2, respectively, co-segregate with the majority of cases of autosomaldominant familial early-onset AD(4Tanzi R.E. Bertram L. Neuron. 2001; 32: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Familial AD-linked PS1 andPS2 variants elevate the production of highly fibrillogenic Aβ42 peptides(1Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). A role for PS1 in Notchfunction was first discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans screens andinvolves intramembranous cleavage of the Notch receptor, analogous to APPprocessing (5Levitan D. Greenwald I.

Nicastrin is a type Imembrane protein independently identified as a novel component of theGLP-1/Notch signaling pathway in C. elegans early embryos and in thebiochemical characterization of proteins that interacted with PS1(7Goutte C.

Multitransmembrane proteinAPH-1 and the two-transmembrane protein PEN-2 were also identified in C.elegans screens as genes essential for Notch signaling(9Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev.

A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The four components ofthe γ-secretase interact early during biogenesis and cooperatively exitthe ER. Nicastrin then undergoes complex glycosylation, and PS1 undergoesendoproteolysis to generate N- and C-terminal derivatives to generate thefunctional γ-secretase(3Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin.Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence from the transition state analog inhibitors show thatγ-secretase is a transmembrane aspartyl protease, and two Asp residuesessential for γ-secretase activity have been localized to thetransmembrane domains 6 and 7 of PS1(11Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast to thecomplex nature of the functional γ-secretase assembly, intramembranouscleavage by γ-secretase shows poor sequence specificity and does notappear to involve strict rules for substrate recognition. However, efficientcleavage by γ-secretase requires the removal of the extracellular domainby juxtamembrane proteolysis, leaving membrane-bound CTFs(12Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol.Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Consequently, severaltype I membrane proteins that undergo ectodomain shedding, mediated by a setof metalloproteases termed “α-secretases,” are alsosubstrates for intramembranous cleavage by the γ-secretase. To date,known γ-secretase substrates include APP homologs, Notch1 and homologs,Notch ligands Jagged2 and Delta, ErbB4, CD44, low density lipoproteinreceptor-related protein, N- and E-cadherins, nectin-1α,deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), p75neurotrophin receptor, syndecan 3, etc. Exactly how such diverse sets ofmolecules residing in multiple subcellular sites are recognized by theγ-secretase is not well understood. Similarly, with the exception ofNotch signaling, there is only limited information available on the functionalconsequence downstream of intramembranous cleavage of severalγ-secretase substrates. We reported recently on the cholesterol-dependent association of each ofthe γ-secretase components with lipid rafts in post-Golgi and endosomemembranes enriched in syntaxin 6, syntaxin 13, and VAMP4(13Vetrivel K.S.

Lipid rafts are cellularmembrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids(14Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). These specializeddetergent-insoluble microdomains (DIM) contribute to trafficking of proteinsand lipids in the secretory and endocytic pathways by regulating vesiclesorting and formation (15Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. CellBiol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Inaddition, lipid rafts serve as versatile platforms wherein certain plasmamembrane receptors and kinases regulate signal transduction(14Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). There is growingevidence to suggest that amyloidogenic processing by secretases may also becompartmentalized in lipid rafts by targeting BACE-1, γ-secretase, andAPP to DIMs (13Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H.

Furthermore, the role of lipid rafts inintramembranous cleavage of other γ-secretase substrates has not beeninvestigated. In this study we investigated the distribution of select γ-secretasesubstrates in cholesterol-rich raft domains isolated by sucrose densitygradient fractionation of detergent-insoluble membranes. We report that themajority of APP CTFs and active γ-secretase resides in lipid rafts incultured cells and adult mouse brain. On the other hand, CTFs of Notch1,Jagged2, and DCC are predominantly found in non-raft membrane domains. Whileaddressing this apparent discrepancy, we found that PS1, APP, and otherγ-secretase substrates, including DCC and N-cadherin, localize tonon-raft membranes in developing embryonic brain. We propose that spatialsegregation of γ-secretase within cholesterol- and sphingolipid-richordered lipid domains limits access to certain γ-secretase substrates inthe adult.

Association of γ-Secretase Components and APP CTFs inLubrol-resistant Lipid Rafts in the Adult Brain—Previous studieshave suggested that processing of APP to the amyloid-β peptide occurspredominantly in lipid rafts and that BACE-1 is the rate-limiting enzyme inthis process.

The above results suggest that a small fraction of full-lengthAPP partitions into lipid rafts, whereas APP CTFs preferentially associatewith lipid raft microdomains in the adult mouse brain. APP CTFs Accumulate in Lipid Rafts in Cells Lacking PS1/PS2Expression—Although the presence of γ-secretase componentsand APP CTFs in DIMs indicates that lipid raft microdomains are likely thesites of γ-secretase processing of APP CTFs, it was important todetermine whether the lack of γ-secretase processing promoted APP CTFsto accumulate in Lubrol WX-resistant microdomains, thus validating ourprediction. To this end, we examined raft association of endogenous APP CTFsin mouse fibroblasts with targeted deletions in PSEN1 andPSEN2 (PS1-/-/PS2-/-).Components of the γ-secretase complex cooperatively mature and exit theER (3Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin.Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When one of the corecomponents of the γ-secretase complex is not expressed in a given cell,the others remain highly unstable and/or fail to exit the ER. InPS1-/-/PS2-/- cells, nicastrin existsonly as core glycosylated immature polypeptide, whereas the steady-statelevels of PEN-2 are markedly diminished. More importantly, the subunits thatstill remain in PS1-/-/PS2-/- cellsreside exclusively in detergent-soluble non-raft membranes(13Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C.

Raft fractionation of wtfibroblasts showed the presence of endogenous APP CTFs both in the raft andnon-raft fractions (Fig. 2).Examination of PS1-/-/PS2-/- cellsrevealed striking accumulation of endogenous APP CTFs in lipid raft fractionsas compared with non-raft fractions (Fig.2). Similarly, in PS1-/- and NCT-/-cells stably transfected with APPswe, APP CTFs markedly accumulate in lipidraft fractions (data not shown). These findings suggest that APP α- andβ-CTFs preferentially accumulate in lipid raft microdomains of membranesin cells lacking functional γ-secretase activity. APP CTFs Accumulate in Lubrol-resistant Lipid Rafts in PS1 D385ACells—To verify independently the above findings, we examinedmembrane microdomain localization of APP CTFs in stable N2a cell linesco-expressing human APPswe and human wt PS1 or the dominant-negative PS1 D385Amutant. Unlike wt PS1, D385A variant fails to be endoproteolytically processedbut forms stable complexes with nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2(40Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T.

As described previously, APP CTFs accumulate in D385A cellsdue to the absence of γ-secretase activity(40Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). As predicted from thePS1-/-/PS2-/- findings describedabove, the majority of APP CTFs in D385A cells partitioned into lipid raftfractions 4 and 5 (Fig. 4).Similarly, the majority of CTFs derived from endogenous wt APP in stableHEK293 cells expressing PS1 D385A also accumulated in lipid raft fractions,whereas less than 10% of full-length mature glycosylated APP partitioned intolipid raft microdomains (data not shown). Together, these results demonstratethat APP CTFs accumulate to a greater extent in Lubrol-resistant lipid raftmicrodomains in cells expressing the catalytically inactive PS1 D385A mutant.Most interestingly, we also observed the raft accumulation of a small fractionof mature full-length APP in PS1 D385A cells, indicating the potential effectsof dominant-negative PS1 expression on selective turnover or processing ofraft-associated full-length APP.Fig. 4APP CTFs associate with DIM in cholesterol-sensitive manner andco-reside with syntaxin 6 and PS1.

We have shown that the formation of ceramide via activation of the acid sphingomyelinase transforms rafts into ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. These platforms are required for infection of mammalian cells with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Neisseriae gonorrhoeae. In the present study we determined whether the acid sphingomyelinase, ceramide, and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms are also involved in the infection of human cells with pathogenic rhinoviruses. We demonstrate that infection of human epithelial cells with several rhinovirus strains triggers a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase correlating with microtubules- and microfilament-mediated translocation of the enzyme from an intracellular compartment onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane.

The classic fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane suggests a random distribution of lipids and proteins in the cell membrane (1Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). This view was challenged by many recent studies indicating that sphingolipids and cholesterol spontaneously separate from other glycophospholipids in the cell membrane to form distinct microdomains (2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). (Glyco)sphingolipids bind to each other via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between their headgroups and the saturated fatty acid side chains, respectively. Void spaces between the bulky glycosphingolipids seem to be filled with cholesterol via tight interactions of the sterol-ring system with the sphingosine moiety of the sphingolipids and hydrogen bonds between the C3-hydroxyl groups with the hydrophilic headgroups of sphingomyelin. These interactions result in a lateral stabilization and facilitate the formation of distinct membrane domains that were named “rafts” (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar), because they float in the “ocean” of the other phospholipids.

Ceramide-enriched membrane platforms serve to re-organize signaling molecules in the cell, in particular to trap and cluster receptor molecules.

P. aeruginosa, N. gonorrhoeae, and S. aureus trigger the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms and employ these platforms for invasion, induction of apoptosis, and regulation of the cellular cytokine response (15Grassmé H.

These studies indicated the central role of ceramide-enriched membrane domains for the infection of mammalian cells with at least some pathogenic bacteria. However, the function of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for cellular infections with viral pathogens is unknown. Here, we investigated one of the most common viral infections, i.e. infections with human rhinoviruses. Rhinoviruses are small, positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the picornavirus family, which infect human respiratory epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. In vitro experiments demonstrated that one group of rhinoviruses, named the major group, binds to ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) to infect cells (26Greve J.M. Davis G. Meyer A.M. Forte C.P. Yost S.C. Marlor C.W. Kamarck M.E. McClelland A. Cell. 1989; 56: 839-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), whereas a second group, the minor group, seems to infect epithelial cells via LDL 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; MEM, minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAG, diacylglycerol. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; MEM, minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAG, diacylglycerol. receptors (27Hofer F.

It is unknown whether these receptors participate in vivo, i.e. in the nasal tissue, in the infection with rhinoviruses. Recent studies showed that cholesterol-enriched membrane domains are involved in cellular infections with rhinoviruses, because the infection of human cells was inhibited by pre-treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (28Snyers L. Zwickl H. Blaas D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5360-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which interferes with the cholesterol metabolism and destroys small sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched membrane rafts (29Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These data suggest an important function of distinct membrane domains for the infection of human cells with rhinovirus. Here, we investigated the role of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for rhinoviral infections. We demonstrate that major and minor group rhinoviruses induce an activation and translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane. The translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase is mediated by microtubules and microfilaments. The activity of the acid sphingomyelinase results in a reorganization of small membrane rafts and the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. Inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase by the drugs amitriptyline and imipramine or genetic deficiency of the enzyme prevented the generation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms upon infection and, most important, blocked cellular uptake of rhinoviruses. These studies indicate a central role of acid sphingomyelinase-generated ceramide in the infection of human epithelial cells with rhinoviruses. Cells and Viruses—Chang, HeLa epithelial cells, WI-38 fibroblasts, and acid sphingomyelinase-deficient or normal control fibroblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Chang cells) or MEM (all other cells) supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μm non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all purchased from Invitrogen). Human rhinovirus types 2, 14, and 16 (RV2, RV14, and RV16) were from ATCC and propagated by infection of HeLa cells with a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 (1 virus/100 cells) in MEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 20 mm MgCl2. Cells were infected for 1 h at 37 °C and further cultured in standard medium for 3–4 days at 33 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g to pellet cellular debris, virus-containing supernatants were collected, stored at –80 °C, and served as viral stocks. Supernatants from non-infected cells served as controls in the infection experiments described below. Infections and Inhibitors—Cells were infected by addition of RV2, RV14, or RV16 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 viruses/cell (10:1) in a medium consisting of MEM, 2% FCS, and 20 mm MgCl2. If the experiments involved incubations longer than 120 min, we replaced the infection medium with fresh MEM/10% FCS as above at that time. Infection of epithelial cells with rhinoviruses was quantified employing classic plaque-forming assays or determining the ratio of dead and live cells 48 h after infection with rhinoviruses. The latter was performed by flow cytometry analysis after trypsinization of the cells and staining with FITC-Annexin V to detect dead cells. Inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase in infected cells was achieved by a 20-min preincubation of the cells with 25 μm amitriptyline or 30 μm imipramine, respectively, in MEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine prior to viral infection. To identify mechanisms of acid sphingomyelinase-translocation we inhibited microtubules by pretreatment with nocodazole (20 μm), microfilaments by cytochalasin B (5 μm) and caspases by Z-VAD-fmk (1 μm) for 20 min prior to infection. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips overnight, washed in MEM, 2% FCS, and 20 mm MgCl2 and infected with RV2, RV14, or RV16 for the indicated time as above. Cells were washed in PBS, 5 mm each MgCl2 and CaCl2 and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4 at room temperature for at least 10 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and blocked by a 15-min incubation in PBS supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20. Cells were washed again in PBS and stained consecutively for 45 min each at room temperature with polyclonal goat anti-acid sphingomyelinase antibodies (diluted 1:100 in PBS and 5% FCS; kindly provided by Dr. K. Sandhoff, University of Bonn, Germany) (4Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. J. Biol.

The primary antibodies were visualized by staining with FITC- and Cy3-coupled secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution in PBS, 5% FCS). The cells were washed three times in PBS supplemented with 0.025% Tween 20 between each staining step. Cells were finally washed three times in PBS, mounted in Mowiol and analyzed by using a Leica DMIRE 2 confocal laser scanning microscope. Acid Sphingomyelinase Activity—To determine the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase, cells were infected as above or left un-infected. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm bacitracine, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% Triton X-100. The samples were immediately sonicated three times 10 s each, nuclei were removed by 5 min of centrifugation at 600 × g, and the supernatants were supplemented with the same volume of a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin. Acid sphingomyelinase was immunoprecipitated for 60 min employing a goat anti-sphingomyelinase antibody. Immunocomplexes were immobilized on protein A/G-agarose, washed three times in 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin and three times in assay buffer consisting of 250 mm sodium acetate, 1.3 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The substrate, [14C]sphingomyelin, was dried and resuspended in assay buffer, then micelles were formed by 10-min bath sonication and an aliquot was added to the acid sphingomyelinase immunoprecipitates. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 800 μl of CHCl3: CH3OH and 250 μl of H2O. Phases were separated, and the release of [14C]choline chloride into the aqueous phase by the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase was determined by liquid scintillation counting of an aliquot of the upper phase. Ceramide Measurement by the DAG Kinase Assay—Cells were infected as above, extracted in CHCl3:CH3OH:1 n HCl (100:100:1), the lower phase was collected, dried, and subjected to alkaline hydrolysis of diacylglycerol in 0.1 n methanolic KOH at 37 °C for 60 min. Samples were re-extracted, the lower phase dried, and 20 μl of a detergent solution consisting of 7.5% (w/v) n-octylglucopyranoside, 5 mm cardiolipin in 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were added to the samples. Samples were sonicated for 10 min in a bath sonicator, and 50 μl of assay buffer consisting of 0.1 m imidazole/HCl (pH 6.6), 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and 2 m EGTA, 2.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 10 μl of diluted DAG kinase (dilution buffer: 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 6.6), 0.01 m imidazole/HCl) were added. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature, and the samples were extracted in 1 ml of CHCl3: CH3OH:1 n HCl (100:100:1), 170 μl of buffered saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and 30 μl of a 100 mm EDTA solution. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged, and the lower phase was collected, dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1). Lipids were separated on Silica G-60 TLC plates with CHCl3:CH3OH:CH3COOH (65:15:5), and the plates were dried and exposed. Ceramide spots were identified by comigration with a C16-ceramide standard and removed from the plate, and incorporation of 32P into ceramide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Comparison with a standard curve using C16-ceramide permitted the determination of ceramide amounts. Sphingomyelin Consumption—Cells were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi of [3H]choline chloride to label cellular sphingomyelin. Cells were washed three times and infected as above. Infection was terminated by addition of 120 μl of 0.22 n HCl and 2.7 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1, v/v). The samples were then supplemented with 0.9 ml of chloroform and 0.9 ml of 1 m KCl and extracted, and the organic phase was dried, resuspended in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v), and separated on Silica G-60 TLC plates. The TLC plates were developed with CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O: CH3COOH (50:30:8:4, v/v) and dried, and sphingomyelin was identified in iodine vapor by comigration with an authentic standard. The spots were removed from the plates and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Rhinoviruses Activate the Acid Sphingomyelinase and Induce the Formation of Ceramide-enriched Membrane Platforms—To gain insight into the mechanisms of the infection of mammalian cells with rhinoviruses, we tested whether alterations of the plasma membrane are associated with the infection. To this end we measured the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase upon infection, which has been previously shown by us to be a key enzyme in the infection of mammalian cells with at least some pathogenic bacteria (13Grassmé H.

Infection with different rhinovirus strains, i.e. RV2, RV14, and RV16 induced a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase in human epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). Activation of the acid sphingomyelinase by rhinoviruses resulted in a concomitant release of ceramide in human epithelial cells determined by the DAG kinase assay (Fig. 1B). The release of ceramide correlated with a consumption of sphingomyelin upon infection (Fig. 1C). Some pathogenic bacteria (13Grassmé H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F.

We, therefore, investigated whether viruses employ a similar mechanism to infect cells and defined the topology of ceramide triggered in the cell membrane upon rhinoviral infection of human epithelial cells. The results demonstrate that RV2, RV14, and RV16 very rapidly triggered the formation of large ceramide-enriched membrane platforms in human epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). Ceramide-enriched membrane platforms localized in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane as indicated by confocal microscopy studies in intact cells (Fig. 2A). A quantitative analysis reveals that formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms rapidly occurs within 5 min after infection, peaks at 15–20 min, and declines thereafter (Fig. 2B). Simultaneous staining of the cells with anti-ceramide and anti-acid sphingomyelinase antibodies demonstrated that the acid sphingomyelinase very rapidly translocated from an intracellular compartment onto the cell surface and clustered in ceramide-enriched membrane platforms after infection with RV2, RV14, or RV16 (Fig. 2C). Control studies indicated that supernatants from non-infected producer cells did not induce the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (not shown).Fig. 2Rhinoviral infections induce the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. A, RV2, RV14, and RV16 induce the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms on human epithelial cells. Cells were infected for 5 min, fixed, stained with monoclonal Cy3-coupled anti-ceramide-antibodies, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The results indicate the formation of large ceramide-enriched membrane platforms upon rhinoviral infection. The studies are representative for each five independent experiments. B, a quantitative analysis of the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms upon infection of Chang epithelial cells with RV2, RV14, or RV16, respectively, indicates a rapid formation of these platforms. Formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms peaks 15 min after rhinoviral infection and declines thereafter. To quantify the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane domains, cells were infected as indicated, fixed, and stained with Cy3-anti-ceramide antibodies. The number of cells displaying a ceramide-enriched membrane platform was determined by counting at least 300 cells/sample on a confocal microscope. The results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent studies. C, confocal microscopy studies indicate that infection of HeLa epithelial cells with RV2, RV14, or RV16 induces a translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the cell surface and the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. Surface acid sphingomyelinase localizes within ceramide-enriched membrane platforms as indicated by the overlays (Cy3 plus FITC). Non-infected cells display only marginal amounts of ceramide or acid sphingomyelinase on the cell surface. Cells were infected for 10 min with RV2, RV14, or RV16, fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-ceramide and FITC-coupled anti-acid sphingomyelinase antibodies. The samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy and are representative for at least 300 cells analyzed in three independent infection experiments. Similar results were obtained with Chang epithelial cells. D, translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the cell surface upon rhinoviral infection is prevented by blocking microtubules or microfilaments by preincubation of cells with nocodazole (20 μm) or cytochalasin B (5 μm). Translocation was determined by staining of the cells with FITC-anti-acid sphingomyelinase antibodies and microscopy analysis of the percentage of cells that were positive for surface acid sphingomyelinase 15 min after infection with the indicated strains. Displayed are mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments analyzing at least 300 cells each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies (4Grassmé H. Jekle A.

Jendrossek V. Bock J. Riehle A. Gulbins E. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) revealed that the acid sphingomyelinase translocates from an intracellular compartment onto the outer leaflet of the cell membrane upon stimulation via CD95 or CD40. Furthermore, electron microscopy images indicated that the acid sphingomyelinase localizes to intracellular vesicles prior to stimulation (23Grassmé H. Schwarz H. Gulbins E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1016-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) suggesting that a fusion of those vesicles with the cell membrane mediates the surface exposure of the enzyme. We, therefore, investigated whether cytoskeleton elements that may mediate the fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane are involved in the translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase. The results (Fig. 2D) reveal that inhibition of microtubules by nocodazole and microfilaments by cytochalasin B prevented translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the cell surface indicating that a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is required for acid sphingomyelinase surface exposure. Furthermore, previous studies from us (30Grassmé H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) suggested that caspases are also involved in the translocation and activation of the acid sphingomyelinase upon stimulation of death receptors. We, therefore, tested whether a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, altered the translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the cell membrane upon rhinoviral infection. The data, however, indicate that Z-VAD-fmk did not affect the translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of the Acid Sphingomyelinase Prevents the Formation of Ceramide-enriched Membrane Platforms upon Rhinoviral Infection—To confirm that the acid sphingomyelinase releases ceramide upon infection with RV2, RV14 or RV16, we treated human epithelial cells with pharmacological inhibitors of the acid sphingomyelinase, i.e. imipramine or amitriptyline (31Kolzer M. Werth N. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated a reduction of the basal acid sphingomyelinase activity by 70 ± 11% by imipramine and 75 ± 8% by amitriptyline, respectively (Fig. 3A). Next, we infected Chang epithelial cells that were pre-treated with imipramine or amitriptyline with RV2, RV14, or RV16 and determined the release of ceramide as well as the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms. The results indicate that inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase prevented the release of ceramide as determined by the DAG-kinase assay (Fig. 3B) and the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (Fig. 3C). Very similar data were obtained upon infection of human acid sphingomyelinase-deficient or wild type control fibroblasts. Infection of normal fibroblasts resulted in formation of ceramide (Fig. 3D) and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms (not shown), events that were absent in acid sphingomyelinase-deficient cells (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that RV2, RV14, and RV16 induce the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms via an activation of the acid sphingomyelinase. Genetic Deficiency or Pharmacological Inhibition of the Acid Sphingomyelinase Blocks Uptake of Rhinoviruses by Human Epithelial Cells—To determine the significance of the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for the infection of human cells with rhinoviruses, we employed cells genetically deficient for the acid sphingomyelinase or blocked the enzyme in human Chang epithelial cells by incubation with imipramine or amitriptyline. The infection of the cells with RV2, RV14, and RV16 was determined by measuring the cytopathic effect of the viruses. The results reveal that inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase by pre-treatment of epithelial cells with amitriptyline or imipramine almost completely prevented the infection of human epithelial cells with rhinoviruses (Fig. 4, A and B). The pharmacological studies were confirmed by infection of acid sphingomyelinase-deficient and wild type control fibroblasts with RV2, RV14, and RV16 (Fig. 4B). These experiments demonstrated an almost complete inhibition of rhinoviral infection of cells that were genetically deficient for the acid sphingomyelinase, while wild type fibroblasts were rapidly infected with rhinoviruses. The genetic and pharmacological data demonstrate the significance of the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide for the uptake of rhinoviruses by human epithelial cells. Controls indicate that the treatment of the virus stocks with imipramine or amitriptyline did not inhibit the infection excluding any effect of the drugs on the virus per se (not shown). The present manuscript indicates a central role of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for the infection of mammalian cells with rhinoviruses. Ceramide-enriched membrane platforms are generated by the activity of the acid sphingomyelinase that translocates onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane and thereby releases ceramide after infection. Ceramide-enriched membrane platforms are required for uptake of epithelial cells with rhinoviruses as indicated in experiments employing pharmacological inhibitors of the acid sphingomyelinase or cells genetically deficient for the acid sphingomyelinase. At present the exact function of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms during the internalization of viruses is unknown. In analogy to previous data for CD95 (4Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36778-36787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), ceramide-enriched membrane platforms may serve to cluster receptors of rhinoviruses, in particular ICAM-1 for RV14 and RV16 and members of the LDL receptor family, i.e. LDLR, VLDLR, and LRP, for RV2, respectively. However, future studies are required to define whether ICAM- or LDL-receptor molecules cluster upon infection with rhinoviruses and whether their clustering is involved in uptake of rhinoviruses. Second, the formation of membrane platforms may recruit intracellular signaling molecules to the entry site of the virus. The assembly of intracellular signaling molecules with a virus-binding receptor within a distinct domain of the cell membrane may permit the receptor to transmit the signal into the cell that finally mediates internalization of the virus. Third, ceramide-enriched membrane platforms may serve the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and may function as anchor for actin filaments. In this context it is interesting to note that ceramide was recently implied to serve as a binding site for actin filaments that mediate the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes (32Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Whether similar mechanisms apply for the internalization of rhinoviruses is presently unknown. Our studies are in accordance with previous studies of Jan et al. (17Jan J.T. Chatterjee S. Griffin D.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6425-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) demonstrating a rapid activation of the acid sphingomyelinase and a concomitant release of ceramide upon infection of neuroblastoma cells with Sindbis virus. Activation of the acid sphingomyelinase was linked by the authors to internalization of the virus and/or fusion of endosomal membranes. A function of distinct membrane domains in rhinoviral infection is supported by the recent findings that rhinoviral infections are prevented by treatment of cells with β-cyclodextrin (28Snyers L. Zwickl H. Blaas D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5360-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) leading to the destruction of membrane rafts. Destruction of rafts has been previously shown to prevent the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms upon CD95 stimulation (4Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A. Schwarz H. Berger J. Sandhoff K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20589-20596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) suggesting that the integrity of rafts is required for an efficient release of ceramide by surface acid sphingomyelinase. Our data confirm previous observations showing a translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane upon stimulation (4Grassmé H. Jekle A. Riehle A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36778-36787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase involves microtubules and microfilaments consistent with previous findings in CD95-stimulated lymphocytes that showed a nocodazole and cytochalasin D-sensitive translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase (30Grassmé H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, rhinoviruses do not employ caspases for translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase, which have been shown to be involved in the translocation of the acid sphingomyelinase by CD95 (30Grassmé H. Cremesti A. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5457-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a primary stimulus triggers the fusion of vesicles that contain the acid sphingomyelinase with the cell membrane. This fusion is controlled and mediated by microtubules and microfilaments that are re-organized via different pathways upon receptor activation or rhinoviral infection. Mobilization and fusion of acid sphingomyelinase-containing vesicles results in the exposure of intra-vesicular acid sphingomyelinase onto the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane, which also contains most of the sphingomyelin present in the cell membrane. The molecular mechanisms resulting in stimulation of the enzymatic activity of the acid sphingomyelinase are also poorly characterized. Previously, oxygen radicals were implied in the activation of the enzyme (33Scheel-Toellner D. Wang K. Craddock R. Webb P.R. McGettrick H.M. Assi L.K. Parkes N. Clough L.E. Gulbins E. Salmon M.

However, experiments employing Tiron, a chemical mimetic of superoxide dismutase removing (O2−·) from the intracellular and extracellular environment, and dithiothreitol did not show an inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase activation upon infection or of the viral uptake into Chang cells. This suggests that rhinoviruses do not activate the acid sphingomyelinase by a redox mechanism. Imipramine and amitriptyline have been previously shown by several authors to inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase (13Grassmé H. Gulbins E. Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Lang F.

Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Sandhoff and colleagues demonstrated that these drugs interfere with the binding of the acid sphingomyelinase with the lipid bilayer (31Kolzer M. Werth N. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The cationic moiety of imipramine and amitriptyline competes with the acid sphingomyelinase for the binding site on the membrane and, thus, displaces the enzyme from the membrane (31Kolzer M. Werth N. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The release of the acid sphingomyelinase from the membrane into the vesicular space results in proteolytic degradation of the enzyme in intracellular vesicles and reduction of the cellular acid sphingomyelinase-activity. The present data identify a novel mechanism of viral infection of human cells. This study reveals the central role of the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms for infection of human epithelial cells with rhinoviruses. Inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase prevents the uptake of rhinoviruses. This suggests the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide-enriched membrane platforms as novel targets to prevent and treat rhinovirus infections and, thus, the common cold. Furthermore, the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms might be a general mechanism involved in uptake of many viruses and a novel target to treat other viral infections. We thank S.

The nature of the cognate ligands of ALK in vertebrate is still a matter of debate. We produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the extracellular domain of the human receptor. Two major species of ALK (220 and 140 kDa) were identified in transfected cells, and the use of our mAbs established that the 140-kDa species results from a cleavage of the 220-kDa form. Two mAbs, in the nm range, induced the differentiation of PC12 cells transiently transfected with ALK. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing ALK, these two mAbs strongly activated the receptor and subsequently the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We further showed for the first time that activation of ALK also resulted in a specific activation of STAT3. In contrast, other mAbs presented the characteristics of blocking antibodies. Finally, in these cell systems, a mitogenic form of pleiotrophin, a proposed ligand of ALK, failed to activate this receptor. Thus, in the absence of clearly established ligand(s) in vertebrates, the availability of mAbs allowing the activation or the inhibition of the receptor will be essential for a better understanding of the biological roles of ALK.

Generally, after ligand binding, RTK dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and initiates signal transduction cascades that subsequently lead to cellular responses (for review, see Ref. 1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was originally identified as a RTK that acquires transforming capability when truncated and fused in the t(2;5) chromosomal rearrangement associated with the non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2Morris S.W.

This translocation produces a fusion gene that encodes a soluble chimeric transforming protein comprising the N-terminal portion of the phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM) linked to the cytoplasmic portion of ALK. It has been demonstrated that the NPM portion is responsible for the dimerization of the fusion protein leading to the constitutive activation of the kinase and to the transforming activity. Phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, STATs, and Src appear to be important downstream targets of NPM-ALK which contribute to its mitogenic and antiapoptotic activities (3Bai R.Y.

J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 330-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), all leading to the expression of fusion proteins exhibiting a constitutive activation of the kinase. Human, mouse, and Drosophila cDNAs encoding full-length ALK have been characterized (9Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P.

The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that ALK is a novel RTK having an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase activity. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs and is most closely related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase receptor. In situ hybridization analysis performed in rodents showed that alk mRNA is essentially and transiently expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems such as the thalamus, mid-brain, olfactory bulb, and peripheral ganglia and that it localizes mostly in neuronal cells (9Morris S.W.

Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The neonatal brain showed the highest expression, suggesting a possible involvement of ALK in the development of the nervous system, and a recent report indicates that Caenorhabditis elegans ALK may play a role in presynaptic differentiation of the worm neuromuscular junctions (12Liao E.H. Hung W. Abrams B. Zhen M. Nature. 2004; 430: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because ALK expression is maintained, albeit at a lower level, in the adult brain, it might play an important role in both the normal development and function of the nervous system. In this context, we previously established a construct coding for a chimeric protein, named Fc.ALK, in which the extracellular domain of ALK was replaced by the mouse IgG Fc domain. The Fc domain induced the dimerization of the chimera leading to the constitutive activation of the kinase activity. Expression of Fc.ALK chimera in PC12 cells induced their differentiation (13Souttou B. Brunet-de Carvalho N. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9526-9531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Analysis of the transduction pathways involved in this differentiation pointed out the essential role of the MAP kinase cascade. Pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine are developmentally regulated proteins forming a family of heparin-binding molecules with putative functions during cell growth and differentiation. PTN and midkine have been proposed as potential ligands of ALK (14Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein jelly belly (Jeb) has been identified as the ligand of Drosophila ALK (20Englund C. Loren C.E. Grabbe C. Varshney G.K. Deleuil F. Hallberg B. Palmer R.H. Nature. 2003; 425: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Lee H.H. Norris A. Weiss J.B. Frasch M. Nature. 2003; 425: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and Jeb is distinct from the Drosophila homologs of PTN and midkine, Miple 1 and 2 (21Lee H.H. Norris A. Weiss J.B. Frasch M. Nature. 2003; 425: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, no obvious vertebrate homolog has been identified for Jeb in the sequence databases. In the absence of clearly established cognate ligand(s) for the ALK receptor, the availability of ligand substitutes allowing the activation of the receptor can be essential for a better understanding of its biological roles. In the case of the RTKs that are activated after dimerization upon ligand binding, monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of membrane-bound receptors can mimic the effect of the ligand. Thus, they have been largely used to study the mechanisms of receptor activation (22Ashman L.K. Buhring H.J. Aylett G.W. Broudy V.C. Muller C. J. Cell.

Fujimoto J. Kotani M. Sakuraba H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the characterization of a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the human receptor. Two major species of ALK (220 and 140 kDa) were identified in transfected cells, and the use of our mAbs established that the 140-kDa species results from a cleavage of the 220-kDa form, leading to the release of an 80-kDa fragment into the culture medium. Two mAbs, in the nm range, strongly activate the receptor and downstream signaling pathways. In contrast, other mAbs present the characteristics of antagonist antibodies. Finally, in our cell systems, a mitogenic form of PTN failed to activate ALK. Reagents and Antibodies—Rabbit anti-insulin receptor phosphospecific (pY/pY1162/1163) was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Rabbit anti-STAT3, rabbit anti-ERK1/2, and mouse anti-phospho-STAT5 (clone 8-5-2) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-TrkA phosphospecific (pY674/pY675), rabbit anti-phospho-STAT1 (Y701), rabbit anti-STAT1, and rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 (Y705) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-STAT5 (clone 89) and mouse anti-ALK (clone ALK1) were from BD Biosciences. Mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (clone from MAP kinase-YT) was from Sigma. Rat anti-HA (clone 3F10) was from Roche Applied Science. Human PTN synthesized by stably transfected SW13 cells was produced as described previously (29Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Commercial human PTN expressed in Sf1 insect cells was obtained from Sigma. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis indicated that both PTNs essentially corresponded to the full-length molecule of 18-kDa apparent molecular mass. Production of Anti-ALK Antibodies—The entire extracellular domain of human ALK linked to a His tag (RECA.His) was used previously to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies (30Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Rouet V. Vigny M. Kerros M.E. Caruelle D. Raulais D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which were purified further and named REAB. Mice were immunized with the purified recombinant protein RECA.His. Immunization of mice, cell fusion, and screening of the hybridoma supernatants by a specific enzyme immunoassay using RECA.His either as immunogen or biotin-labeled as tracer were performed as described previously (31Grassi J. Frobert Y. Pradelles P. Chercuitte F. Gruaz D. Dayer J.M. Poubelle P.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 123: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The positive supernatants were analyzed further by immunocytochemistry on HEK 293 cells expressing human ALK protein. mAbs were purified from ascites fluids after precipitation with caprylic acid (32Russo C. Callegaro L. Lanza E. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). F(ab′)2 fragments were obtained from the purified mAb 48 by treatment with pepsin in acidic medium. We then obtained Fab′ fragments by reduction of F(ab′)2 in the presence of 10 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethylamine. Biotinylation of the Fab′ fragment was performed as described previously (33Selo I. Negroni L. Creminon C. Grassi J. Wal J.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purity of the different prepared fragments was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Plasmid Constructions—The full-length human ALK cDNA as well as a construct coding for a kinase-defective form in which the invariant lysine residue located in the ATP-binding portion of the catalytic domain was changed to arginine were inserted previously in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (13Souttou B. Brunet-de Carvalho N. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9526-9531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To generate stably transfected HEK cells, we used the dicistronic pCBC vector engineered to allow the coordinated expression of a protein and the pac gene which confer puromycin resistance to mammalian cells (a kind gift of Dr. W. Dirks, Germany). We generated constructs allowing the expression of both the wild type and the kinase-defective form of the receptor linked to an HA tag at its C-terminal end by directed mutagenesis. The proteins coded by these constructs were named, respectively, ALK.H for the active receptor and dALK.H for the dead mutant. Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Stably transfected cells were cultured continuously in the same medium complemented by 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Cells plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 were cultured for 2 days, serum-deprived for 12–16 h, and then treated or not with mAbs or PTN directly added in the medium. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (34Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by T. Galli, INSERM U536, Paris, France) were grown in complete medium, which is RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in atmosphere containing 7.5% CO2. Cells were cultured in flasks or plastic dishes coated with rat tail collagen (1 μg/cm2) (Roche Applied Science). Cell Transfections—PC12 cells were transfected using the EasyJect Plus electroporation system as recommended by the manufacturer (Equibio, Ashford, UK). Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended at 6.25 × 106 cells/ml of complete medium supplemented with 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Electroporation was performed in a final volume of 0.8 ml of cell suspension using 30 μg of plasmids with one shock at 1,350 microfarads and 850 volts. Cells were transferred immediately to fresh culture medium and cultivated for 1 day before serum starvation. Before treatment with mAbs, cells were cultured in a low serum medium (1% horse serum) for 16 h and then treated or not with the different mAbs for 2 days. HEK 293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) of 3 μg DNA vectors adjusted to 14 μg/10-cm Petri dish with pBluescript carrier DNA. Two days after transfection, cells were selected for their puromycin resistance, allowing the selection of stable cells expressing either the ALK.H or the dALK.H protein. Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Transfected PC12 cells treated or not with mAbs for 2 days were fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldhehyde and 30 mm sucrose and washed three times with PBS before being permeabilized in 0.5% PBS and Triton X-100 for 5 min and washed with 0.1 m PBS and glycine for 15 min. After 1 h of blocking in PBS containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated in the same buffer with rat anti-HA (3F10, 0.5 μg/ml) to visualize ALK.H-expressing cells. Then cells were washed five times with PBS before and after incubation with anti-rat IgG TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody selected for their minimal cross-reaction with mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Then cells were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 supplemented with Hoechst 33258 nucleic acid stain (0.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) to visualize nuclei. Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Leica microscope (Roche Applied Science) equipped with a MicroMax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop software. The Metamorph software was used (Roper Scientific) for quantification; 100 transfected cells were counted, and cells bearing neurites longer than twice the diameter of the cell body were scored as differentiated. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—Cells washed rapidly with cold PBS buffer (containing 5 mm sodium fluoride and 100 mm sodium orthovanadate) were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm NaPi buffer, pH 7.8, 60 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor Complete, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Cell extracts were denatured in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Analysis were performed either under nonreducing conditions or after reduction of the disulfide bridges by the reducing agent provided by Invitrogen. Membranes were blocked and incubated with antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers. Primary antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or anti-rat selected for its minimal cross-reaction with mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Bound proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Bioscience). Alternatively, primary antibodies were detected using IRDye 800- or Alexa Fluor 688-conjugated second antibodies (Rockland). Binding of the fluorescent antibodies was visualized and quantified using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR biosciences). To understand further the biological activities of endogenous ALK we developed a panel of mAbs directed against the entire extracellular domain of human ALK. The nature of the IgG types of the different mAbs is listed Table I.Table IProperties of anti-ALK mAbsDetection of ALK proteins by ImmunoblottingmAbIsotypeIn cell extractsIn conditioned mediumWorking dilutionEffect on ALK phosphorylation220 kDa140 kDa80 kDa7IgG1+-+d0.6 ± 0.210IgG1+-+c0.9 ± 0.214IgG1+-+b2.9 ± 0.2*58IgG2a+-+b2.4 ± 0.1*11IgG1++-d0.4 ± 0.213IgG1++-d0.9 ± 0.215IgG2b++-d1.6 ± 0.330IgG1++-c0.6 ± 0.146IgG2b++-c5.9 ± 0.448IgG2a++-a4.3 ± 0.349IgG1++-b0.8 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Molecular Characterization of the ALK Receptor—To analyze the properties of the mAbs we established (see “Experimental Procedures”) HEK 293 cells stably expressing human ALK linked to an HA tag at the C terminus. The stably transfected cells, named 293/ALK.H, were lysed, and cell extracts were first separated, after denaturation, in NuPAGE electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by Western blotting. We first used rabbit polyclonal antibodies (named REAB) directed against the entire extracellular domain of human ALK (30Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Rouet V. Vigny M. Kerros M.E. Caruelle D. Raulais D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In 293/ALK.H cell extract these antibodies showed two major species of ALK, 220 and 140 kDa (Fig. 1A). The same species had been reported previously in rat and mouse brain (9Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 10Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and in NIH-3T3 stably transfected with the mouse receptor (19Motegi A. Fujimoto J. Kotani M. Sakuraba H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the intracellular domain of ALK.H (an anti-HA tag and ALK1 anti-human NPM-ALK (36Pulford K. Lamant L. Morris S.W. Butler L.H. Wood K.M. Stroud D. Delsol G. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) revealed the two same forms (Fig. 1A). The presence of the HA tag in these two forms indicates that they both contain the C terminus and that they differ in their extracellular domains. The existence of these two forms in cells transfected with the ALK construct also indicated that they did not correspond to splicing products but that the lower molecular mass form could arise from a proteolytic cleavage of the full-length receptor. Interestingly, some mAbs reacted with the two bands of 220 and 140 kDa, whereas others recognized only the higher molecular mass (Fig. 1A and Table I). This result showed that the corresponding epitopes were located differently on the ALK molecule. Because the 140-kDa form likely resulted from a cleavage of the 220-kDa form, we hypothesized that resulting proteolytic product(s) could be released in the conditioned medium of the 293/ALK.H cells and should bear the epitopes of the mAbs reacting only with the 220-kDa form. To address this question, conditioned medium of 293/ALK.H cells cultured overnight in serum-free medium was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis with the different mAbs (Fig. 1B and Table I). A major band of about 80 kDa was clearly recognized by the mAbs which only reacted with the 220-kDa form of ALK. Thus, the 140-kDa species resulted from a proteolytic cleavage at a specific site of the 220-kDa form (Fig. 1C). The parental HEK 293 cells do not express a detectable amount of endogenous ALK receptor as revealed by the different antibodies (Fig. 1A). The immunoreactivity of the different mAbs, analyzed by Western blotting, varied greatly among the different mAbs (Table I). However, these differences probably resulted from modifications of their corresponding epitopes caused by the SDS-PAGE and the Western blotting procedures. Immunocytochemical experiments or binding on living cells analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter did not reveal any major differences in their affinities for the native receptor expressed on the cell surface (not shown). The extracellular domain of ALK contains 26 cysteine residues that could form intrachain disulfide bridges. Thus, reduction of such disulfide bridges could modify the binding of the different mAbs. Therefore, 293/ALK.H cell extracts were also analyzed, after denaturation, by Western blotting under reducing conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In these conditions, with the noticeable exception of mAbs 7 and 10, the immunoreactivity of all the other mAbs was either reduced greatly or totally inhibited (not shown). This finding indicates that the corresponding epitopes involved intrachain disulfide bridges that are likely essential for the conformational structure of the ALK extracellular domain. In good agreement with a previous report (10Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), treatment with tunicamycin of the 293/ALK.H cells reduced the apparent molecular mass to about 170 kDa, thus confirming that the 140-kDa species does not correspond to a precursor of the full-length 220-kDa form. In addition, deglycosylation did not impair the binding of the different mAbs, indicating that the corresponding epitopes did not involve N-linked glycans (not shown). mAbs 46 and 48 Induced Neurite Extension of ALK-expressing PC12 Cells—We demonstrated previously that a constitutive dimerized and active form of ALK tyrosine kinase domain induced the neuron-like differentiation of PC12 cells (13Souttou B. Brunet-de Carvalho N. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9526-9531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We reasoned that activation of the wild type ALK receptor expressed in PC12 cells should also lead to their differentiation. We therefore investigated whether some of our mAbs could induce the differentiation of the PC12 cells transiently transfected with the wild type receptor ALK.H construct. There was no discernible difference between cells transfected with the kinase-defective form of the receptor, dALK.H, and nontransfected cells. Only few of them, less than 5%, extended short and thin neurites, and whatever the mAbs used no differentiation process was observed (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, cells transfected with the construct coding for the wild type ALK.H receptor exhibited a low but significant level of basal differentiation of about 15%. This spontaneous differentiation likely resulted from the spontaneous dimerization of the receptor and the subsequent basal activation of its tyrosine kinase activity caused by the overexpression of the construct in some transfected cells (see below). In a first approach, PC12 cells expressing the wild type receptor were treated with increasing concentrations of the different mAbs ranging from 1 to 60 nm (not shown). This preliminary experiment led us to analyze quantitatively the effect of increasing concentrations of five selected mAbs, all reacting with the two forms of the receptor, on the differentiation of the transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 2B). When treated with mAbs 46 and 48 the percentage of transfected cells extending neurites was greatly increased, reaching a maximum of about 50% at a concentration of 6 nm (∼1 μg/ml). mAb 15 also enhanced the neurite extension of the transfected cells but to a much smaller extend. At the highest concentration of this mAb (60 nm) only 30% of the transfected cells extended neurites. mAb 13 displayed no disc"

The mechanisms determining their turnover have not been established. We found that in differentiating K562 erythroleukemia cells both c-FLIP isoforms were inducibly degraded by the proteasome, but c-FLIPS was more prone to ubiquitylation and had a considerably shorter half-life. Analysis of the c-FLIPS-specific ubiquitylation revealed two lysines, 192 and 195, C-terminal to the death effector domains, as principal ubiquitin acceptors in c-FLIPS but not in c-FLIPL. Furthermore the c-FLIPS-specific tail of 19 amino acids, adjacent to the two target lysines, was demonstrated to be the key element determining the isoform-specific instability of c-FLIPS. Molecular modeling in combination with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the C-terminal tail is required for correct positioning and subsequent ubiquitylation of the target lysines. Because the antiapoptotic operation of c-FLIPS was not affected by the tail deletion, the antiapoptotic activity and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of c-FLIPS are functionally and structurally independent processes. The presence of a small destabilizing sequence in c-FLIPS constitutes an important determinant of c-FLIPS/c-FLIPL ratios by allowing differential degradation of c-FLIP isoforms.

Death receptors are cell surface receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, the most well known members of which are tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, the CD95/Fas receptor, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) 1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; DED, death effector domain; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; DR, death receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; FLICE, FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; FLIP, FLICE-inhibitory protein; c-FLIP, cellular FLIP; FLIPl, long splice form of FLIP; FLIPS, short splice form of FLIP; TRAIL-R, TRAIL receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; PEA-15, phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes, 15 kDa; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. receptors DR4/TRAIL-R1 and DR5/TRAIL-R2 (for a review, see Ref. 1Özören N. El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Upon ligand-mediated oligomerization of CD95/Fas or TRAIL receptors, the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) attaches to the death receptor via homophilic death domain interactions. The death effector domain (DED) of FADD is in turn linked to the apoptotic machinery due to its affinity for the initiator caspases, procaspase-8 and procaspase-10. The close proximity of procaspase-8 molecules results in dimerization of the procaspases, the assembly of which forms an enzymatically active site (2Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S.

Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity induces serial cleavages converting the zymogen into p10 and p18 fragments, forming the proteolytically active caspase-8 heterotetramer. In responsive cells, activated caspase-8 is then able to activate effector caspases thereby initiating apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 4Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). In addition to the initiator caspases, the DED in FADD also interacts with the apoptosis modulator cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP; Ref. 5Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar), which exists as two splice variants, the long splice form of FLIP (FLIPL) and the short splice form of FLIP (FLIPS). Together with the activated death receptor, FADD, and caspase-8 and -10, the FLIP proteins form the core of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC; Ref. 6Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), which also contains a number of other proteins, many of which seem to be involved in modulating death receptor signals (for a review, see Ref. 1Özören N. El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The DISC assembly with pro- and antiapoptotic proteins allows for control of death receptor signaling through a number of different routes. Consequently in addition to apoptosis, stimulation of the receptors may also lead to cell survival and proliferation. Modulation of the apoptotic pathway at the level of the activated receptor is required in situations when the extrinsic, but not the intrinsic, apoptosis pathway needs to be inhibited or when localized initiator caspase activity is required for specialized signaling functions. For example, caspase-8 activity is necessary for normal T cell development (7Chun H.J. Zheng L. Ahmad M. Wang J. Speirs C.K. Siegel R.M. Dale J.K. Puck J. Davis J. Hall C.G. Skoda-Smith S.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and is probably acquired through complex regulation of anti- and proapoptotic proteins in the DISC. In addition, some malignant cells are able to convert death receptor stimulation into proliferative signals (9Holmström T.H. Tran S.E. Johnson V.L. Ahn N.G. Chow S.C. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Tran S.E. Holmström T.H. Ahonen M. Kähäri V.M. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, active regulation of the DISC proteins, both transcriptional and post-translational, determines the outcome of death receptor stimulation. c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS have been characterized as specific inhibitors of death receptor-mediated apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 11Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). c-FLIPL is homologous to caspase-8, consisting of two tandemly repeated DEDs and a catalytically inactive caspase-like domain. Although c-FLIPS shares most of its sequence with c-FLIPL, it is considerably shorter, comprising only the two DEDs followed by a short C-terminal sequence and an isoform-specific C-terminal tail of 19 amino acids, the role of which is still unknown (for a review, see Ref. 11Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Both c-FLIP isoforms act as inhibitors of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis through binding to DED in FADD (12Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the well documented antiapoptotic activity of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, recent reports have provided evidence for isoform-specific regulatory functions. For example, c-FLIPL is capable of inducing the first cleavage of caspase-8 and itself, thereby leading to membrane-restricted caspase-8 activation, whereas c-FLIPS completely prevents procaspase-8 cleavage (12Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H.

Grutter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45162-45171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-FLIPL, but not c-FLIPS, interacts with TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) and induces activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (16Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, although first considered to be similar inhibitor proteins, the c-FLIP isoforms have now been established as DISC molecules with distinct and even opposite functions. During development and differentiation it is of great importance for cells to be able to regulate their apoptotic sensitivity. The ability of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS to modulate caspase-8 activity makes them highly adaptable regulators of death receptor signaling. Consequently disturbances in c-FLIP expression have been implicated in certain malignancies. For example, high levels of c-FLIP have been found in some cancer cells, including melanoma and colonic adenocarcinoma (5Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L.

Pathol. 2001; 194: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and an elevated expression of c-FLIP has been shown to result in the escape of tumors from immune surveillance (19Djerbi M.

J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). c-FLIP expression is carefully regulated at different levels. The transcriptional regulation is linked to a number of growth- and survival-promoting signaling pathways, including NF-κB (21Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 22Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1513-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition to gene expression, it has been recently reported that the turnover of c-FLIP is actively regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation (26Kim Y. Suh N. Sporn M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22320-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 27Perez D. White E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2651-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying this regulation or whether there could be differences in isoform stability. In this study, we show that although both c-FLIP isoforms can be degraded via a common inducible pathway, they display clearly distinct half-lives. Our mutational analyses showed that the principal ubiquitin acceptor lysines are different in c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS and that the unique C terminus of c-FLIPS possesses a destabilizing function. In addition, molecular modeling of the C-terminal segment of c-FLIPS revealed structural features compatible with its preferred ubiquitylation. Although c-FLIPS lacking the C terminus was equally efficient in suppressing TRAIL-induced apoptosis as the wild type protein, the antiapoptotic activity and the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of c-FLIPS are functionally and structurally separated, and ubiquitylation is not associated with the antiapoptotic function of c-FLIPS but only required for regulating the turnover of the protein. The isoform-specific regulation and turnover of the c-FLIP isoforms add a new dimension to the regulatory mechanisms of the respective c-FLIP isoforms with broad ramifications into understanding the biological functions of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS. Cell Culture and Treatments—Human K562 erythroleukemia cells and WM35 melanoma cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 2 mm l-glutamine. For WM35 cells, the medium was supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin. K562 cells stably overexpressing c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL isoforms (2G11 and 1E5, respectively; Ref. 12Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml, Calbiochem). HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and 2 mm l-glutamine. The proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (Calbiochem) was used at 200 nm for 14 h. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Sigma) was used at either 5 or 50 μm concentration for the indicated time periods. For K562 cells, hemin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 30 or 40 μm. For WM35 cells, cisplatin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 7 μg/ml. Apoptosis was induced by adding 100 ng/ml FLAG-tagged TRAIL (Alexis) together with 2 μg/ml cross-linking M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with PBS. Cells were lysed either in the Laemmli SDS sample buffer or in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Resulting Triton X-100 lysis buffer lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and the protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Each lysate containing 30-50 μg of protein was loaded and resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran nitrocellulose, Schleicher & Schuell) by using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed using antibodies against c-FLIP (NF6 FLIP antibody, kindly provided by Peter Krammer, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; also available from Alexis) and Hsc70 (SPA-815, StressGen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Southern Biotechnology. The bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid Constructs—The FLAG-tagged c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS were a kind gift from Dr. Jürg Tschopp (Institute of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL point mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The FLAG-tagged c-FLIPS deletion mutant was constructed by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites in-frame with the N-terminal FLAG tag in pCR3-Met-Flag. The HA-tagged ubiquitin was a kind gift from Dr. Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). Transient Transfections and Stable Cell Lines—For transfections, 5×106 K562 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and 20 or 30 μg of plasmid DNA was added. The expression levels of the mutants were titrated to be comparable because expression levels were noticed to affect ubiquitylation. Cells were subjected to a single electric pulse (220 V, 975 microfarads), in 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes (BTX) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator followed by dilution to 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24-36 h prior to the experimental treatments. The stable neomycin-resistant c-FLIPS Δ203-221 cell lines were selected by G418 (500 μg/ml, Calbiochem) for 2 weeks, the resistant pool was serially diluted on a 96-well plate in the presence of G418, and the single cell clones were upscaled and screened for c-FLIP expression by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of ubiquitylated c-FLIP, the cell pellet from transiently transfected cells was resuspended in 75 μl of boiling 1% SDS in PBS, and the resulting lysate was heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The lysates were suspended 1:10 in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. DNA was sheared by sonication, and the particulate material was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Samples were taken from the cleared lysates for input control. The lysates were further diluted 1:1 with 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody and 15 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose under rotation for 2 h. After incubation, the Sepharose beads were washed four times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were run on an 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran nitrocellulose, Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblotted with anti-FLIP antibody. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis of Cellular Caspase-3 Activity—After the treatments, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and the caspase-3 activity was analyzed with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis kit 1 (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TRAIL-R Immunoprecipitation and DISC Analysis—To stimulate TRAIL receptors, 4 × 107 K562 cells/sample were pelleted (500 × g for 7 min) and resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed RPMI 1640 medium. Thereafter 1 μg of FLAG-tagged TRAIL (Alexis) and 2 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody (Sigma) were added to the cell suspension. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. After washing, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford assay, and an equal amount of protein from each sample was precleared with 50 μl of Sepharose CL-4B for 2 h at 4 °C. A total of 2.5 μg of monoclonal anti-DR5 and 2.5 μg of monoclonal anti-DR4 (Alexis) were added to samples and immunoprecipitated with 15 μl of protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and finally boiled for 3 min. The immunoprecipitated samples and corresponding cell lysates were analyzed by 11% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-DR5 (Alexis), anti-FADD (BD Transduction Laboratories), caspase-8 (C15 caspase-8 antibody, a kind gift from P. Krammer, German Cancer Research Center; also available from Alexis), and anti-FLIP (Dave-2, Alexis) as described above. Molecular Modeling of c-FLIPS—All models were built using the Modeler computer program (salilab.org/modeler/modeler.html). The sequence of c-FLIPS contains two conservative DEDs between Ser2 (numbering according to Ref. 5Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar) and Val79 and between Tyr93 and Gln176. A model structure for the second DED in c-FLIPS (DED2) was built by using the NMR structural data for phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes, 15 kDa (PEA-15; Protein Data Bank code 1n3k; Ref. 28Hill J.M.

Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The loop between the DED2 and the c-FLIPS C-terminal segment has been taken as seen in the structure of PEA-15, the only currently known representative structure covering this region (28Hill J.M. Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. Ginsberg M.H. Werner M.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6494-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Surface construction and lipophilic potential calculations were done using SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Fig. 8 was produced with MolScript v2.1 (37Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 945-949Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D v2.4b (38Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Both c-FLIP Isoforms Are Degraded via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—The antiapoptotic functions of the c-FLIP isoforms are tightly associated with their expression levels, and down-regulation of c-FLIP is an important mechanism to sensitize cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 11Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that both c-FLIP isoforms are down-regulated in K562 cells undergoing hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, which sensitizes the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (12Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to examine whether the inducible c-FLIP down-regulation is due to proteasome-mediated degradation. For this purpose, we incubated differentiating K562 cells with the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin, which efficiently prevented hemin-induced down-regulation of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS (Fig. 1A). This suggested that the down-regulation of c-FLIP isoforms would be due to degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Because the 26 S proteasome acts on proteins destined to be degraded by polyubiquitin conjugation, we investigated whether c-FLIP isoforms are inducibly ubiquitylated upon hemin treatment. K562 cell lines 1E5 and 2G11 (12Hietakangas V. Poukkula M. Heiskanen K.M. Karvinen J.T. Sistonen L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1278-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), expressing ectopic FLAG-tagged c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL, respectively, were treated with hemin and epoxomicin. The hemin treatment did not result in down-regulation of the ectopically expressed c-FLIP in the tested cell lines, indicating that the degradation machinery might be saturated. Hemin treatment, however, caused a prominent smear above the FLAG-FLIPS band that was further enhanced by epoxomicin, whereas in FLAG-FLIPL-expressing cells, a prominent slower migrating smear was induced only by treating the cells with both hemin and epoxomicin (Fig. 1B). To verify that the high molecular weight smear indeed represented hemin-induced polyubiquitin conjugation, we transiently coexpressed HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged c-FLIP. The transfected cells were treated with 30 μm hemin for 16 h, and ubiquitin conjugates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibodies. Western blotting with c-FLIP-specific antibodies revealed the ubiquitylation of c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL, which was further enhanced by hemin-mediated differentiation (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, these results show that both c-FLIP isoforms are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process that can be activated through a common signal. c-FLIPS Has a Markedly Shorter Half-life than c-FLIPL—Although both c-FLIP isoforms were inducibly ubiquitylated upon hemin treatment, the ubiquitylation of c-FLIPS appeared to be more prominent (Fig. 1B). To study whether the degradation of the c-FLIP isoforms is differentially regulated, we compared the half-lives of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS by treating K562 cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for the indicated time periods. Despite the similarity of the isoforms, c-FLIPS appeared to have a markedly shorter half-life than c-FLIPL, which does not totally disappear even after 24 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2A). This result was verified by a quantitation of c-FLIP protein levels, which showed that the half-life of c-FLIPS is ∼40 min, whereas the half-life of c-FLIPL is almost 2 h (Fig. 2B). This differential stability of the c-FLIP isoforms is not limited only to K562 cells as a similar difference in the half-lives could be observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2, C and D). To test whether the different half-lives of the c-FLIP isoforms could contribute to changes in their stoichiometry also in other physiologically relevant cellular backgrounds, we studied WM35 melanoma cells, which have been shown earlier to become sensitized to TRAIL upon cisplatin treatment by specific down-regulation of c-FLIPS (39Song J.H. Song D.K. Herlyn M. Petruk K.C. Hao C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4255-4266PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the earlier study (39Song J.H. Song D.K. Herlyn M. Petruk K.C. Hao C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 4255-4266PubMed Google Scholar), cisplatin treatment down-regulated c-FLIPS more efficiently than c-FLIPL (Fig. 2E). Notably this down-regulation could be completely prevented by the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin (Fig. 2E), indicating that proteasomal degradation is needed for the specific down-regulation of c-FLIPS. Moreover cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that also in WM35 melanoma cells c-FLIPS is significantly less stable than c-FLIPL (Fig. 2, F and G). Taken together, these findings imply that the stability of c-FLIP isoforms is regulated in an isoform-specific manner and that the differential stability can contribute to an altered stoichiometry between the isoforms.

We have shown here that this heterodimer ubiquitinates a hyperphosphorylated form of Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Two major phosphorylation sites have been identified in the Rpb1 carboxyl terminal domain, serine 2 (Ser-2) or serine 5 (Ser-5) of the YSPTSPS heptapeptide repeat. Only the Ser-5 hyperphosphorylated form is ubiquitinated by BRCA1/BARD1. Overexpression of BRCA1 in cells stimulated the DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. Similar to the in vitro reaction, the stimulation of Rpb1 ubiquitination by BRCA1 in cells occurred only on those molecules hyperphosphorylated on Ser-5 of the heptapeptide repeat. In vitro, the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 (amino acids 501–1863) was dispensable for the ubiquitination of hyperphosphorylated Rpb1. In cells, however, efficient Rpb1 ubiquitination required the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1, suggesting that interactions mediated by this region were essential in the complex milieu of the nucleus. These results link the BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of the polymerase with DNA damage. The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor BRCA1, when associated with BARD1, is an ubiquitin ligase.

These results link the BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of the polymerase with DNA damage. BRCA1, the breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor protein, has been found to regulate a number of processes central to the normal function of the cell, including transcription, chromatin dynamics, homologous recombination, and other forms of DNA damage repair (1Venkitaraman A.R.

Med. 2002; 8: 571-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because BRCA1 has been found associated with a wide range of proteins involved in these processes, it may function as a scaffold, organizing effector proteins in a context-dependent manner. However, when BRCA1 is associated with the BARD1 protein, it is also an enzyme, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (3Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol.

The realization that BRCA1 is an enzyme establishes the necessity of identifying its substrates in order to understand how the ubiquitination activity impacts these processes in the cell. BRCA1 and BARD1 are associated with the messenger RNA-synthesizing polymerase in a complex known as the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol) 1The abbreviations used are: holo-pol, RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; BRCA1, breast cancer gene 1; BARD1, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1; CTD, Rpb1 carboxyl-terminal domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; Rpb1, RNA polymerase II subunit 1; Ser2*p, phosphorylated serine 2 of YSPTSPS; Ser5*p, phosphorylated serine 5 of YSPTSPS; HEK, human embryonic kidney; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin.

One function for BRCA1 in this holo-pol complex appears to be as a coactivator of transcription, because it has been shown that BRCA1 stimulates the activation signal of p53, NF-κB, and others (8Houvras Y.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Previously, we modeled that the BRCA1 and BARD1 in the holo-pol complex may ubiquitinate the transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) when it encounters DNA damage, and we also suggested that this ubiquitination event would stimulate the repair process (14Starita L.M. Parvin J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5952-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rpb1 is the largest subunit of RNAPII, and its carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) is highly conserved, consisting of multiple repeats (27 in budding yeast, 52 in humans) of the heptapeptide YSPTSPS. Serines 2 (Ser-2) and 5 (Ser-5) of multiple repeats are phosphorylated co-transcriptionally, Ser5*p pre-dominating at the promoter and Ser2*p in the coding sequence (16Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 17Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage Rpb1 is also ubiquitinated, an event associated with changes in concentration of both the hypophosphorylated and the hyperphosphorylated Rpb1 (18Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the Rsp5 E3 ligase ubiquitinates Rpb1 independent of its phosphorylation state (19Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes the ubiquitin ligase(s) that mediate this modification of RNAPII are unknown, and it is possible that multiple factors mediate the reaction. Because BRCA1 and BARD1 are associated with RNAPII in the holo-pol complex (6Chiba N. Parvin J.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4222-4228PubMed Google Scholar), BRCA1 is a reasonable candidate for the RNAPII ubiquitin ligase. In addition, after DNA damage BRCA1 and BARD1 also associate with the polyadenylation cleavage factor CstF (21Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), known to interact with RNAPII via Rpb1 hyperphosphorylated on Ser-2 (Ser2*p) of the YSPTSPS heptapeptide repeats (22Bentley D. Nature. 1998; 395: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These results led us to speculate that a substrate for BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination could be the Ser2*p form of Rpb1. In these experiments we tested whether BRCA1 in association with BARD1 could ubiquitinate RNAPII. We found that hyperphosphorylated RNAPII serves as a substrate for the BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination activity, and we found that overexpression of BRCA1 in cells stimulates the DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of hyperphosphorylated RNAPII. Strikingly, the ubiquitination reaction, when tested both in vitro and in vivo, was enhanced not by Ser2*p of the heptapeptide repeat but rather by Ser5*p. These results thus identify a substrate for ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 that is correlated with the cellular response to DNA damage. Protein Purification—The expression and purification of BRCA1 and BARD1 from baculovirus-infected insect cells has been described, along with a description of the purification of the ubiquitination factors E1 and UbcH5c E2 (24Starita L.M.

The core RNAPII was purified from calf thymus using an established protocol (25Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The budding yeast Rpb1 CTD was expressed as a hexahistidine and GST fusion (26Chao D.M. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography using standard techniques. Ubiquitin was obtained from a commercial vendor (Sigma). The yeast Kin28, Ctk1, and Srb10 kinases were each expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as HA-tagged fusion proteins. Active kinases were purified by immunoprecipitation using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody specific for the HA tag (27Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7005-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human TFIIH was purified from HEK-293 cells as described (29Mondal N. Parvin J.D. Nature. 2001; 413: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In brief, ∼1012 cells were collected over a period of several months, and a whole cell extract was prepared for each. The whole cell extracts were bound to a Biorex70 matrix at 0.15 m KOAc in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol), washed at 0.3 m KOAc, 0.6 m KOAc, and the peak was collected at 1.5 m KOAc. At each column step, TFIIH-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting using antibodies specific to the 89-kDa ERCC-3 subunit of TFIIH. The 1.5 m KOAc peak fraction was dialyzed to 0.1 m KCl in buffer A, bound to a DEAE fast flow matrix, and the protein peak at 0.3 m KCl was collected and dialyzed to 0.1 m KCl. The protein was bound to a 2-ml BioScale-Q column (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and protein was eluted in a gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl. TFIIH-containing fractions were subjected to gel filtration using a Superdex-200 (HR16/60; Amersham Biosciences) column in 0.3 m KCl in buffer A. The TFIIH migrated at a volume consistent with a 700-kDa complex, and samples were dialyzed in 0.1 m KCl in buffer A. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Purified RNAPII (10 ng) or 300 ng of GST·CTD/reaction were phosphorylated using purified human TFIIH or 12CA5 resin-bound HA-Ctk1, HA-Srb10, or HA-Kin28 kinase complexes using the following reaction conditions: 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 32P-labeled RNAPII was then added to ubiquitination reactions that contained 100 ng of FLAG-BRCA1/BARD1 (25 nm) or truncations of BRCA1 co-purified with BARD1 (24Starita L.M. Machida Y. Sankaran S. Elias J.E. Griffin K. Schlegel B.P. Gygi S.P. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8457-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), 100 ng of His6-E1 ubiquitin ligase (40 nm), 1.5 μg of His6-UbcH5c (4 μm), and 2 μg of ubiquitin (12 μm) in the following reaction conditions: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Plasmid Construction—pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292)-C61G was constructed as follows. The plasmid pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) has been described previously (30Chiba N. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38549-38554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A fragment containing the mutation C61G was amplified from an adenovirus shuttle vector that expresses full-length HA-BRCA1-C61G (31You F. Chiba N. Ishioka C. Parvin J.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5792-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PCR from this template used the primers 5′-ACCCCAAGCTTACCATGGCC-3′ that contains the HindIII site and 5′-TCTGTTATGTTGGCTCCTTG-3′ that is located in 3′-side of the EcoRI site of BRCA1. The PCR product was subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292). pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) was constructed as follows. A fragment was PCR amplified from the template pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1 using the mutagenic primer 5′-GCCCTTCACCAACAGGCCCACAGATC-3′ and a downstream, vector-encoded primer 5′-TGACACTATAGAATAGGGCC-3′. The PCR product was used as a megaprimer with 5′-GGAAACAAAATGTTCTGCTAGCTTG-3′ to amplify a fragment encoding BRCA1 amino acids 1293–1863 containing the M1775R substitution. The second PCR product was subcloned into the NheI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292), thus replacing the wild-type sequence. pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292, Δ1527–1863) was constructed as follows. The fragment containing HA-BRCA1 sequences up to residue 1526 was generated by digestion of pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292) with HindIII and SacI and then inserted into the HindIII and EcoRV sites of the vector backbone for pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292). pCMV-Myc-ubiquitin was constructed as follows. Ubiquitin was amplified from cDNA of HeLa cells as a template using the primers 5′-GCCGAATTCGGATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTAACCACCTCTCAGACGCAGG-3′ that contain 5′-EcoRI site and 3′-XhoI site. The PCR product was then subcloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). All constructs were verified by DNA sequence. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—HEK-293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin and transfected with expression vector to express HA-BRCA1, HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292), HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292)-C61G, HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292)-M1775R, and HA-BRCA1(Δ775–1292, Δ1527–1863). Two days post-transfection, cells were exposed to 20 J/m2 of ultraviolet light and incubated with 50 μm MG132 (Sigma) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone for 2 h. Cell lysates were prepared in 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitation, 2.5 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11; Covance), 3 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; Covance), or 7 μl of monoclonal antibody H14 and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each lysate. Mixtures were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation, the supernatant was removed, and protein beads were washed three times using 0.4 μl of wash buffer. For Western blot analysis, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 5 or 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted using the monoclonal antibodies H14 or H5 (Covance), which recognize the Rpb1 CTD phosphorylated on Ser-5 or Ser-2, respectively, the anti-HA antibody HA.11, or the anti-Myc antibody 9E10. BRCA1/BARD1 Ubiquitinate Hyperphosphorylated RNAPII in Vitro—BRCA1, in association with its heterodimeric partner BARD1, comprise an E3 ubiquitin ligase (3Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Because BRCA1 and BARD1 associate with RNAPII (5Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Krum S.A. Miranda G.A. Lin C. Lane T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52012-52020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Schlegel B.P. Green V.J. Ladias J.A. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RNAPII may be ubiquitinated by BRCA1/BARD1 in response to DNA damage, facilitating the repair of this damage in actively transcribed genes (14Starita L.M. Parvin J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5952-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we utilized purified RNAPII core enzyme that had been phosphorylated in vitro by TFIIH as a substrate in ubiquitination reactions. Purified RNAPII exists in two forms, the IIA form, in which the Rpb1 CTD has a low level of phosphorylation, and the IIO form, in which this domain is hyperphosphorylated and has significantly shifted migration on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of this RNAPII preparation by TFIIH results in the labeling of both of these forms of Rpb1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). This labeled RNAPII was tested in ubiquitination reactions that contained purified E1, E2 UbcH5c, E3 BRCA1/BARD1, and ubiquitin. In the complete reaction, the RNAPIIO band disappeared and a slower migrating diffuse band was observed. Under these conditions, the hypophosphorylated RNAPIIA was not modified (Fig. 1A, lane 3). These results suggest that the hyperphosphorylated RNAPII is a substrate for the BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin ligase. The appearance of the slowly migrating RNAPIIO band was dependent upon the inclusion of each ubiquitination factor. Single omission of the substrate, E1, E2, E3, or ubiquitin failed to produce the slowly migrating RNAPIIO band (Fig. 1B). The appearance of the slowly migrating RNAPIIO band was thus consistent with modification by ubiquitination because only when all ubiquitination factors were included in reactions did this species appear (lane 1). We tested whether the full 12-subunit RNAPII complex was required for ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 or whether the phosphorylated CTD would suffice. The experiment of Fig. 1B was repeated using only the Rpb1 CTD fused to GST. This substrate was phosphorylated by purified TFIIH and [γ-32P]ATP. When labeled GST·CTD was incubated with the complete reaction containing E1, E2 UbcH5c, ubiquitin and BRCA1/BARD1, the GST·CTD protein had markedly slowed migration. In this portion of the gel (>85 kDa), the resolution was imperfect, and we interpret the diffuse band with slowed migration to be consistent with the multiple additions of 8-kDa ubiquitin moieties (Fig. 1C, lane 1). The CTD of this substrate protein had no lysines to be modified by ubiquitination. We suggest that the CTD recruits the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase for the ubiquitination of a separate domain of the polypeptide. These results indicate that both the 12-subunit RNAPII complex and the GST·CTD were substrates for the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. The CTD used in these experiments was from the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, and contained 26 copies of the YSPTSPS heptapeptide. The CTD is co-transcriptionally phosphorylated in vivo on both Ser-2 and Ser-5. RNAPII containing unphosphorylated Rpb1 is preferentially recruited to preinitiation complexes but is phosphorylated during the transition from initiation to elongation. A Ser5*p form of the Rpb1 CTD predominates at the promoter, with Ser2*p CTD more prevalent in the coding sequence. TFIIH kinase activity is directed primarily at Ser-5 (23Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), with human Cdk7 and its homolog Kin28 in S. cerevisiae acting as the kinase in each case. The S. cerevisiae kinases Ctk1 and Srb10 have highest phosphorylation activity directed at Ser-2 (28Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7005-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When the CTD is expressed and purified from bacteria, it is unphosphorylated, whereas RNAPII purified from eukaryotic cells is phosphorylated to different degrees on both serine positions. To test which phosphorylation event is required for ubiquitination, it was necessary to use the CTD purified from bacteria. Incubation of the CTD with each specific kinase results in differently phosphorylated products: predominantly Ser5*p when Kin28 is the kinase or Ser2*p when Ctk1 or Srb10 is used (28Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7005-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We tested whether the ubiquitination activity of BRCA1/BARD1 was directed specifically at the Rpb1 CTD containing either Ser5*p or Ser2*p. In Fig. 2A, the GST·CTD was labeled by phosphorylation with Kin28, Ctk1, or Srb10 prior to incubation in the ubiquitination reaction. Ser5*p GST·CTD was multiply ubiquitinated in the presence of BRCA1/BARD1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2), but Ser2*p GST·CTD ubiquitination could not be detected (lanes 4 and 6). This result suggested that the ubiquitination of the CTD by BRCA1/BARD1 was specific for substrates containing Ser5*p. The specificity of the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase in this reaction was striking. If the heterodimer was simply binding to and ubiquitinating a long polypeptide with multiple negative charges, as in the hyperphosphorylated CTD, then we would expect little or no preference for either the Ser2*p or Ser5*p forms. Instead, the ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1 was specific for the Ser5*p CTD. In binding experiments using the purified BRCA1/BARD1 and purified RNAPII, we found that the BRCA1 bound to RNAPII independent of phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, right panel). This result was not surprising because it is known that BRCA1 binds to Rpb2 and Rpb12 of RNAPII (32Schlegel B.P. Green V.J. Ladias J.A. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when comparing the effectiveness of the purification of RNAPII on a BRCA1/BARD1 affinity matrix, the recovery of the Ser5*p-RNAPII was more complete than was observed for the hypophosphorylated form (Fig. 2B, left panel). Thus, binding alone did not specify the ubiquitination substrate, but Ser5-specific phosphorylation enhanced both the level of binding and of ubiquitination by BRCA1/BARD1. Note that the Ser5*p form of the CTD is observed at the promoter, whereas the Ser2*p is associated with transcription elongation (17Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S.

Thus, the Ser5*p-specific modification of RNAPIIO by BRCA1/BARD1 is not consistent with targeting the elongating polymerase for ubiquitination. BRCA1 Truncated from the Carboxyl Terminus Ubiquitinated Phosphorylated RNAPII in Vitro—The carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 (amino acids 1650–1863) associates with RNAPII via interactions with Rpb2, Rpb12, and phospho-Rpb1 subunits (7Krum S.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the carboxyl terminus is required to mediate ubiquitination of RNAPII in vitro, we purified carboxyl-terminal truncations of BRCA1 in heterodimeric complex with full-length BARD1 (24Starita L.M. Machida Y. Sankaran S. Elias J.E. Griffin K. Schlegel B.P. Gygi S.P. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8457-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition to full-length FLAG-tagged BRCA1 (1–1863), FLAG-tagged BRCA1(1–1852), BRCA1(1–1527), BRCA1(1–1000), and BRCA1 (1–500) were coexpressed with untagged BARD1 and purified. A ΔN-BRCA1 construct (301–1863) lacking the amino-terminal RING domain was also purified, as was a full-length BRCA1 lacking BARD1. These constructs were balanced for BRCA1 content (Fig. 3A) and tested for activity in ubiquitination assays as before. In assays using RNAPII as the substrate, ubiquitination was specific for the hyperphosphorylated Rpb1. Similar specificity was observed for all constructs tested with the exception of BRCA1 alone and the ΔN construct, which had no detectable activity. Thus, BARD1 and the BRCA1 RING domain were each required for ubiquitination of RNAPII (Fig. 3B). The absence of activity seen with BRCA1 lacking BARD1 is consistent with previously published results. BARD1 is required for a high level of ubiquitination activity of BRCA1, and the isolated RING domains of each protein have been shown to have low levels of ubiquitination activity in vitro (3Hashizume R.

However, the ubiquitination activity of BRCA1 is significantly potentiated by its interaction with BARD1 (3Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 4Xia Y. Pao G.M. Chen H.W. Verma I.M. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The ΔN construct lacks a RING domain and was thus expected to lack ubiquitination activity. All of the active truncations of BRCA1 specifically ubiquitinated the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAPII, whereas the hypophosphorylated form was relatively unmodified (Fig. 3B). We had previously hypothesized that the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 mediates the specificity of its association with RNAPII because this domain of BRCA1 activates transcription (36Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 37Haile D.T. Parvin J.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and because it binds to two RNAPII subunits (32Schlegel B.P. Green V.J. Ladias J.A. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient ubiquitination of RNAPII, however, was observed even when the ubiquitin ligase was a BRCA1 truncation that lacked the carboxyl terminus, suggesting that the function of the BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal transcription activation domain is unrelated to its ubiquitination of phosphorylated RNAPII by BRCA1. The RNAPII ubiquitination assay yields a qualitative result, indicating that hyperphosphorylated Rpb1 is a substrate for the ubiquitination activity of BRCA1/BARD1. We repeated the experiment using TFIIH-phosphorylated CTD (Ser5*p) as a substrate, and we found that there were no differences in the degree of ubiquitination obtained with the BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal truncations (Fig. 3C). Under these more sensitive conditions, weak ubiquitination was evident when BRCA1 lacking BARD1 was included in reactions (Fig. 3C, lane 3), whereas the ΔN construct had no ubiquitination activity (Fig. 3C, lane 8). Therefore, in vitro, the carboxyl terminus of BRCA1 is not required for ubiquitination of hyperphosphorylated RNAPII or Ser5*p-phosphorylated CTD. BRCA1 Ubiquitinated Phosphorylated RNAPII in Vivo—We next asked whether BRCA1 could ubiquitinate hyperphosphorylated RNAPII in vivo. We transfected HEK-293T cells with plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged BRCA1 and Myc epitopetagged ubiquitin. Transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibody specific to the Myc epitope, thus purifying ubiquitinated proteins, and then immunoblots were probed using antibodies specific to RNAPII. The immunoblot was stained with the monoclonal antibody H14, which specifically binds to RNAPII phosphorylated on Ser-5 of the heptapeptide repeat in the CTD (18Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J.

The lysate (input) contained a phosphorylated RNAPII large subunit that migrated at a position consistent with 240 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Background levels of ubiquitinated phospho-RNAPII were dete"

This compound is a representative molecule of a new class of 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) derivatives (non-GSH peptidomimetic compounds) that have been designed both to give strong GST inhibition and to accumulate in tumor cells avoiding the extrusion mechanisms mediated by the multidrug resistance protein pumps. We have recently shown that submicromolar amounts of NBDHEX trigger apoptosis in several human tumor cell lines through the dissociation of the JNK·GSTP1-1 complex (Turella, P., Cerella, C., Filomeni, G., Bullo, A., De Maria, F., Ghibelli, L., Ciriolo, M.

Results reported in the present study indicated that NBDHEX behaves like a suicide inhibitor for GSTs. It bound to the H-site and was conjugated with GSH forming a σ complex at the C-4 of the benzoxadiazole ring. This complex was tightly stabilized in the active site of GSTP1-1 and GSTM2-2, whereas in GSTA1-1 the release of the 6-mercapto-1-hexanol from the σ complex was the favored event.

The design or discovery of efficient compounds that may bind to these enzymes modulating their biological activity has become one of the primary aims in cancer research because GST isoenzymes such as GSTP1-1 are overexpressed in many cancer cell lines (8Tew K.D. Monks A. Barone L. Rosser D. Akerman G. Montali J.A. Wheatley J.B. Schmidt D.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 149-159PubMed Google Scholar) and induce drug resistance by inactivating many chemotherapeutic compounds via GSH conjugation (9Schultz M. Dutta S. Tew K.D. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 26: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GSTP1-1 displays an additional antiapoptotic activity based on a protein-protein interaction with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a key enzyme in the apoptotic cascade (10Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Many efforts have been made in the last years to find tight inhibitors of these enzymes to reduce their protective role in vivo (9Schultz M. Dutta S. Tew K.D. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 26: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ethacrynic acid, an inhibitor that lacks class specificity for GSTs, represented a first attempt in this direction; however, its scarce affinity and the deleterious side effects have discouraged its use in clinical practice (9Schultz M. Dutta S. Tew K.D. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 26: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the strong specificity of the transferase G-site for GSH and GSH derivatives, a few GSH peptidomimetic compounds have been designed recently. For example, γ-glutamyl-S-(benzyl)-cysteinyl-R(-)-phenylglycine diethyl ester (TER199) acts as proinhibitor for GSTs. It rapidly enters the cells and is activated by the intracellular esterases. In the active form, it selectively inhibits GSTP1-1, enhancing the effect of alkylating drugs in various cancer cell lines that overexpress this isoenzyme (11Morgan A.S. Ciaccio P.J. Tew K.D. Kauvar L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1996; 37: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This specific compound is under investigation for possible use in human therapy, but other GSH derivatives that are good inhibitors of GSTs may not be so efficient in cancer cells. In fact many GSH derivatives are actively extruded from the cell by specific export pumps, such as the multidrug resistance protein, thus avoiding their intracellular accumulation (12Muller M. Meijer C. Zaman G.J. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Mulder N.H. de Vries E.G. Jansen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13033-13037Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 13Zaman G.J. Cnubben N.H. van Bladeren P.J. Evers R. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance protein activity represents a crucial problem for GST inhibition as the estimated concentration of GSTP1-1 in cancer cells may reach 0.05 × 10-3 m, and an equivalent or higher concentration of inhibitor must accumulate in the cell to modulate efficiently the GST activity. To overcome this problem, we have tried to design new molecules that bind efficiently to GSTs but are not GSH derivatives and display suitable lipophilic properties to be able to cross the cell membrane. Besides the G-site, which specifically recognizes GSH and its derivatives, a second binding subsite is present in all GSTs that is able to interact with a lot of different hydrophobic co-substrates. This subsite, termed H-site, is a hydrophobic cavity, located near the G-site, that displays different topography and substrate specificity in GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1. As GSTs evolved to bind many different hydrophobic toxic species, the H-site normally displays moderate affinity for these compounds, i.e. Km values in the millimolar range. A few years ago, we found that 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-Cl) is an unusual co-substrate for GSTs showing a Km value in the micromolar range (14Caccuri A.M. Ascenzi P. Antonini G.

We therefore started from this evidence to design specific derivatives of NBD-Cl that are the object of the present study. We have recently shown that very low levels of NBD thioethers can induce tumor cell death through dissociation of the JNK·GSTP1-1 complex (15Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The NBD derivatives represent an interesting class of GST inhibitors as they interact with the H-site with KD values in the micromolar range for GSTA1-1 and GSTP1-1 and in the nanomolar range for GSTM2-2. A detailed investigation of the binding mechanism of a representative molecule revealed that GSTs promote the formation in the active site of a σ complex between the inhibitor and GSH. Thus, these NBD derivatives act as suicide inhibitors and may represent a new type of potent antitumor agents. Materials—GSH, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), NBD-Cl, 6-mercapto-1-hexanol, 4-mercapto-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoimidazole, 3-mercapto-1-propionic acid, 6-amino-1-hexanol, 3-bromopyruvate, RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, sulforhodamine B, and Hoechst 33342 were from Sigma. BCA protein assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. Synthesis and Characterization of the NBD Derivatives—NBD-Cl (1 mmol) and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (2 mmol) were incubated for 6 h in 20 ml of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of ethanol and 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a closed vessel at 25 °C. The pH was continuously monitored and kept neutral by suitable addition of 1 m KOH. At the end of the reaction, the excess of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol was removed with 1.5 mmol of 3-bromopyruvate. The reaction product, 6-(NBD-4-ylthio-)hexanol (NBDHEX), is a dark yellow insoluble compound that was collected by filtration and washed twice with 15 ml of cold distilled water. The final product was 98% pure via HPLC analysis. The UV-visible spectrum was characterized by a maximum absorption peak at 432 nm (ϵ = 15,000 m-1 cm-1), and the fluorescence spectrum showed a maximum emission peak at 525 nm. The 1H-NMR spectrum of NBDHEX was recorded on a Varian VxR 300 MHz instrument (δ expressed in ppm). The assignment was: (CDCl3) δ = 1.3-1.9 (m, 8H, CH2), 3.2 (m, 2H, S-CH2), 3.65 (m, 2H, CH2OH), 7.1 (1H, d, ArH), and 8.4 (1H, d, ArH). The mass spectrum of NBDHEX was obtained under electrospray conditions using an LCQ (Finnigan, San Josè, CA) instrument. m/z was 298 (M + H)+. Starting from 4-mercapto-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoimidazole, 3-mercapto-1-propionic acid, 6-amino-1-hexanol, and GSH a similar procedure was used for the synthesis of 4-(NBD-4-ylthio)butanol (compound 2), 2-(NBD-4-ylthio)imidazole (compound 3), 3-(NBD-4-ylthio)propionic acid (compound 4), 6-(NBD-4-ylamino)hexanol (compound 5), and (NBD-4-ylthio)-glutathione (GS-NBD). These products gave mass spectra with molecular ions corresponding to the theoretical values, and they were 95-98% pure as determined via HPLC analysis. Cell Culture and Treatments—K562 (human myeloid leukemia), HepG2 (human hepatic carcinoma), and GLC4 (human small cell lung carcinoma) cell lines, kindly provided by Prof. M. Cianfriglia (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. NBDHEX stock solution (50 mm) was prepared in Me2SO. Just before use, the stock solution was diluted to the appropriate concentration in RPMI 1640 cell medium with a final Me2SO concentration not exceeding 0.05-0.1%. In all experiments control samples were exposed to the same Me2SO concentrations; 0.05-0.1% Me2SO had no cytotoxic effects. An evaluation of cell viability at different drug concentrations was determined by the sulforhodamine B assay (16Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8874) Google Scholar). The cells were placed in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of medium. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to NBDHEX at the required concentration and allowed to incubate for 48 h. After incubation, the cell growth was evaluated by an in situ cell fixation procedure followed by a coloring procedure with sulforhodamine B. The dose-response profiles obtained gave the LC50 value for NBDHEX (the concentration used to obtain 50% cell mortality). The extent of apoptosis induced by NBDHEX was determined in GLC4, HepG2, and K562 cell lines after 24-h treatment with 10 × 10-6 m NBDHEX. Apoptosis was detected with a fluorescence microscope by analyzing the nuclear fragmentation after staining with the DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342. GST Purification—GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (17Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent. GST Activity—GST activity was assayed at 25 °C as reported previously (18Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 1 × 10-3 m GSH, 1 × 10-3 m CDNB, and 0.1 × 10-3 m EDTA in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (where the product of reaction absorbs ϵ = 9,600 m-1 cm-1) within 10 s from addition of the substrates. One unit of GST is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of product/min at 25 °C. Inhibition of GSTs by NBD derivatives was studied using 44 × 10-9 m GSTA1-1 or GSTP1-1 or 10 × 10-9 m GSTM2-2. The IC50 (inhibitor concentration that inhibits 50% of enzymatic activity) values were determined in the presence of various amounts of the selected NBD derivative. The inhibition mechanism with NBDHEX was determined from double reciprocal plots of the enzyme activity at different GSH and CDNB concentrations and in the presence of different amounts of inhibitor. Binding of NBDHEX to GSTs—The affinities of NBDHEX for human GSTs were determined in the absence or presence of 1 × 10-3 m GSH. In a typical experiment, the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (excitation at 295 nm and emission at 340 nm) was measured in a single photon counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax, S. A. Instruments, Paris, France) at 25 °C after the addition of variable amounts of NBDHEX to 4 × 10-6 m GSTs in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Fluorescence data were corrected both for dilution and for inner filter effects and fitted to Equation 1, which yields the KD value for the NBDHEX bound to GSTs, ΔF=ΔFmax/(1+KD/[NBDHEX]nH) (Eq. 1) where ΔF is the protein fluorescence change observed in the presence of a given amount of NBDHEX, and ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence change observed at saturating NBDHEX concentration; nH is the Hill coefficient. Spectrophotometric and Fluorometric Analysis—The reaction between NBDHEX and GSH was followed in the absence of GSTs by recording at 25 °C the spectrum of NBDHEX (50 × 10-6 m) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence of different concentrations of GSH (from 5 × 10-3 to 80 × 10-3 m). The dissociation constant of the NBDHEX·GSH complex was calculated from the absorbance change (ΔA) at 432 nm following the addition of GSH. The experimental data were fitted to Equation 1 where ΔF and ΔFmax are replaced by ΔA and ΔAmax. Reversibility of the reaction was observed after acidification of the above mixtures with 1 m HCl. Moreover the UV-visible spectrum of NBDHEX (50 × 10-6 m) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 × 10-3 m GSH was recorded at 25 °C before and after the addition of stoichiometric amounts of either GSTP1-1 or GSTM2-2, and the reversibility of the reaction was observed by recording UV-visible spectrum of this mixture after 5-min incubation with 7 m urea. With GSTA1-1, the UV-visible spectrum of NBDHEX (20 × 10-6 m) was recorded both at 8 and at 25 °C in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of the enzyme in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 × 10-3 m GSH. The fluorescence spectrum of 10 × 10-6 m NBDHEX (excitation at 430 nm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 × 10-3 m GSH was recorded at 25 °C before and after the addition of 20 × 10-6 m GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, or GSTP1-1. Stopped Flow Experiments—Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics kinetic spectrometer stopped flow instrument (dead time = 1 ms) equipped with a 1-cm light path observation chamber. In the absence of GSTs, variable amounts of GSH (from 200 × 10-3 to 15 × 10-3 m) were rapidly mixed with an identical volume of NBDHEX (0.1 × 10-3 m) dissolved in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (25 °C). Experiments in the presence of GSTs were performed by rapidly mixing the selected GST (about 20 × 10-6 m in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 2 × 10-3 m GSH) with an identical volume of NBDHEX (from 40 × 10-6 to 2 × 10-6 m) dissolved in the same buffer (4 °C). 1000 data points were collected on a logarithmic time base (from 1 ms to 10 s). Time-dependent spectra were reconstructed from single wavelength observations (between 490 and 310 nm) by repetitively changing the wavelength following different reagent mixing steps; a 10-nm increment step and 6-nm bandwidth were utilized. Optical deconvolution of time-dependent spectra sets was performed by means of the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA) running on an Intel Pentium-based personal computer by using singular value decomposition (SVD) in combination with curve fitting algorithms. The matrix of time-dependent spectra (A) is decomposed by SVD into the product of three matrices, A = U × S × VT where the U columns are the basis spectra, and their time dependence is represented by the V columns. The diagonal values of the S matrix yield the relative occupancies of the basis spectra in the data set. If a data set is composed of more than one optical transition, deconvolution of the optical components (provided they have different time courses) can be achieved by simultaneously fitting the chosen V column subset to the kinetic scheme. Such best fits of the experimental data to kinetic scheme, performed using the program GEPASI 3.30 (19Mendes P. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mendes P.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), were carried out by means of numerical integration, at variable steps, of the ordinary differential equations according to the selected kinetic scheme. The resulting matrix of the time dependences of the molar fraction of the intermediate species can be used to reconstruct (from the experimental matrix of time-dependent spectra) the spectra of the fully populated intermediate species (22Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 23Hendler R.W. Shrager R.I. J. Biochem. Biophys.

Docking Simulations—Docking simulations were performed with the program Autodock 3.0.5 (25Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar). For each isoenzyme, the ligand was removed from the Protein Data Bank structure file (Protein Data Bank codes 1k3l, 1hnc, and 6gss for GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1, respectively), polar hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, and Kollman united atom charges (26Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4884) Google Scholar) were assigned. Docking studies of the σ complex were performed with a flexible ligand, but the internal degrees of freedom of the GSH moiety were held fixed to the values obtained from the crystallographic conformation. Charges were added by the Gasteiger-Marsili method (27Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3603) Google Scholar). Grids of molecular interactions were calculated in a cubic box: size, 25.125 Å; grid spacing, 0.375; centered on the oxygen atom of the tyrosine side chain participating in GSH activation (Tyr-9, Tyr-6, and Tyr-7 in the GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1, respectively). Docking was performed 100 times using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm with random starting position and conformation, a population size of 50, standard parameters (25Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9209) Google Scholar), and a maximum of 250,000 energy evaluations and 27,000 generations. The 100 final docked conformations were ranked according to their binding free energy and clustered using a tolerance of 3-Å root mean square deviation. The MOLMOL program (28Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) was used for graphical interpretation and representation of results. Inhibition of GSTs by NBD Derivatives—The NBD derivatives listed in Table I were synthesized as reported under “Experimental Procedures” and tested as possible inhibitors for GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1, representative enzymes of human Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes, respectively. All the NBD thioether derivatives (compounds 1-4) were strong inhibitors of GSTs showing IC50 values in the nanomolar range for GSTM2-2 and in the micromolar range for GSTP1-1 and GSTA1-1 (Table I). Interestingly the presence of the thioether bond seems to be an essential requirement for tight binding. In fact, all GSTs displayed much lower affinities for 6-(NBD-4-ylamino)hexanol (compound 5), which is a structural analogue of NBDHEX but with the sulfur atom replaced by an amino group (Table I).Table IActivity trials on purified GSTs Open table in a new tab Among all these compounds, NBDHEX showed the lowest IC50 value toward GSTP1-1, the isoenzyme overexpressed in most cancer cell lines (8Tew K.D. Monks A. Barone L. Rosser D. Akerman G. Montali J.A. Wheatley J.B. Schmidt D.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 149-159PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule was therefore utilized to detail the interaction of these compounds with human GSTs. The inhibition mechanism of NBDHEX was studied with GSTP1-1 and GSTA1-1 by varying either GSH or CDNB concentration. An accurate analysis with GSTM2-2 was not possible due to its very high affinity toward NBDHEX. With GSTP1-1 and GSTA1-1 NBDHEX behaved like a competitive inhibitor in respect to CDNB indicating that this compound binds to the same hydrophobic pocket of the active site (H-site). In respect to GSH NBDHEX gave a mixed type inhibition, suggesting that NBDHEX interacts with the H-site of GSTs but that the adjacent G-site (which binds GSH) is also involved (data not shown). Effect of NBDHEX on Tumor Cell Lines—The cytotoxic effect of NBDHEX was tested on leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. The LC50 values obtained after 48-h treatment were 1.4 ± 0.2 × 10-6, 1.5 ± 0.1 × 10-6, and 2.9 ± 0.3 × 10-6 m for GLC4, K562, and HepG2 cell lines, respectively (see Fig. 1, A-C). Evidence of apoptosis induction by NBDHEX was obtained by morphological analysis after nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342. Treatment of GLC4, HepG2, and K562 cells with NBDHEX induced chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in small rounded bodies (Fig. 1, D, F, and G), which represent the final steps of apoptosis (29Dini L. Coppola S. Ruzittu M.T. Ghibelli L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly the LC50 values for these cell lines were of the same order of magnitude as the IC50 value found for GSTP1-1 (0.8 × 10-6 m), which is overexpressed in these specific cells as well as in most tumor cell lines. Isothermic Binding of NBDHEX to GSTs—The binding of NBDHEX to GSTP1-1, GSTA1-1, and GSTM2-2 was studied by following the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein. Binding to GSTP1-1 in the presence of 1 × 10-3 m GSH (Fig. 2A) followed an almost hyperbolic behavior (Hill coefficient nH = 0.9) with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.9 × 10-6 m, which is close to the IC50 value obtained kinetically and reported in Table I. In the absence of GSH (Fig. 2, panel B), the affinity of NBDHEX toward GSTP1-1 strongly decreased (KD = 86 × 10-6 m), and the binding displayed strong positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient nH = 1.7). Binding of NBDHEX to GSTA1-1 in the presence of 1 × 10-3 m GSH (Fig. 2C) followed a similar hyperbolic behavior with an apparent dissociation constant of 5.3 × 10-6 m. This value was about 5-fold lower than the IC50 value obtained kinetically (see Table I). In the absence of GSH (Fig. 2D), the dissociation constant increased (KD = 66 × 10-6 m), and a clear cooperative behavior was observed with an apparent Hill coefficient of 1.6. In the presence of 1 × 10-3 m GSH, GSTM2-2 showed so strong an affinity toward NBDHEX that was not possible to calculate the dissociation constant by using fluorescence binding experiments. An indication of the affinity between GSTM2-2 and the NBDHEX (IC50 ≤ 10 × 10-9 m) was obtained by following the inhibition of GST activity with both the enzyme and the inhibitor in the nanomolar range (Fig. 2E, and Table I). In the absence of GSH, the affinity of GSTM2-2 for NBDHEX decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude, and fluorescence binding experiments gave a KD value of 9 × 10-6 m. Spectrophotometric and Fluorometric Analysis at Equilibrium—The interaction of NBDHEX with GSTs was accomplished by remarkable spectral changes. When NBDHEX was incubated at 25 °C in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of GSTP1-1 and 1 × 10-3 m GSH, the UV-visible spectrum of NBDHEX centered at 432 nm completely disappeared, and a new absorption band appeared at 348 nm (Fig. 3, panel A). No spectral changes were observed in the absence of enzyme or when GSH was omitted or replaced by 1 × 10-3 m S-methylglutathione (data not shown). Addition of urea (7 m) to the solution (after reaction of NBDHEX with enzyme and GSH) completely abolished the peak at 348 nm restoring the original NBDHEX spectrum. This indicates a reversible interaction between NBDHEX and GSH that is only possible in a folded active site. A similar behavior was observed for GSTM2-2 except that the new peak was centered at 353 nm and displayed a higher absorbance (Fig. 3, panel B). These new optical species probably represent a σ complex intermediate between NBDHEX and GSH stabilized in the active site of GSTP1-1 and GSTM2-2. In fact, it is well known that nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions proceed through a σ complex intermediate (30Graminski G.F. Zhang P.H. Sesay M.A. Ammon H.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6252-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Bico P. Chen C.Y. Jones M. Erhardt J. Dirr H. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 887-892PubMed Google Scholar) and that σ complexes of NBD have absorption bands between 300 and 400 nm (32Crampton M.R. Pearce L.M. Rabbitt L.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2002; 2: 257-261Crossref Google Scholar, 33Crampton M.R. Lunn R.E. Lucas D. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 3438-3443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A different type of interaction was found in the presence of GSTA1-1. In this case, the NBDHEX spectrum at 432 nm did not disappears but was only shifted at 419 nm (Fig. 4A). Addition of urea (7 m) did not restore the original spectrum of NBDHEX.Fig. 4Spectrophotometric analysis of the reaction between NBDHEX and GSTA1-1. The UV-visible spectrum of NBDHEX (20 × 10-6 m) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 1 × 10-3 m GSH was recorded at 25 °C in the absence (panel A, solid line) and in the presence (panel A, dashed line) of stoichiometric amounts of GSTA1-1. Spectra of NBDHEX were also recorded at 8 °C (panel B, solid line) and at different times (2-30 min) after the addition of stoichiometric amounts GSTA1-1 (panel B, dashed lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

Resident proteins recycle from the ERGIC back to the ERin COPI-coated vesicles. Many transmembrane cargo proteins, such as theSNAREs, bind to Sec24p in the COPII coat through ER exit motifs in theircytoplasmic tails. The transport mechanism for the exit of soluble cargoproteins from the ER has been explained by two distinct models. Secretion ofcertain abundant proteins is consistent with a bulk flow model in which cargomoves by default and requires no export signals(2Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J.

In contrast, thereceptor-mediated export model envisions selective packaging of secretedproteins into budding vesicles with the help of membrane-anchored cargoreceptors that interact with COPII coat proteins and is supported by recentobservations of sorting in ER-derived transport vesicles(4Kuehn M.J.

MCFD2 isa soluble EF-hand-containing protein that is retained in the ER through acalcium-dependent interaction with LMAN1(12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Mcvey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The involvement of LMAN1and MCFD2 in F5F8D suggests that they function as a cargo receptor for theER-to-Golgi transport of FV and FVIII. Both LMAN1 and MCFD2 are essential forthis transport receptor function as mutations in either LMAN1 or MCFD2 resultin indistinguishable clinical manifestations. All LMAN1 mutations identifiedto date are predicted to result in complete loss of protein function. However,two missense mutations were identified within the second MCFD2 EF-hand domain.These mutations disrupt LMAN1-MCFD2 interaction(12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Mcvey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), underscoring theimportance of this interaction for the cargo receptor function. LMAN1/MCFD2-dependent secretion of FV and FVIII provides a unique system tostudy receptor-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport in higher eukaryotes. FV andFVIII are large homologous proteins that share a similar domain structure(A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2). The B domains of FV and FVIII share no sequence identitybut are both heavily glycosylated and encoded by single large exons(19Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Blood. 1988; 71: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the B domainof FVIII results in a 20-fold increase in the levels of mRNA and the primarytranslation product. However, B-domain-deleted FVIII (BDD-FVIII) is poorlysecreted, due to either reduced folding or inefficient ER-to-Golgi transport(20Pipe S.W. Semin. Thromb.Hemostasis. 2004; 30: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FVIII with a shortB-domain sequence containing five putative N-glycosylation sites cansecrete as efficiently as full-length FVIII(21Miao H.Z. Sirachainan N. Palmer L. Kucab P. Cunningham M.A. Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Blood. 2004; 103: 3412-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, in cellsoverexpressing an ER exit-deficient LMAN1, secretion of FV and FVIII isimpaired, whereas secretion of B-domain-deleted FV and FVIII is unaffected(22Moussalli M. Pipe S.W.

We now further examine the interaction of LMAN1 and MCFD2 and the role ofthis complex in the ER-to-Golgi transport of FVIII. Our results demonstrated acalcium-dependent interaction of FVIII, but not a B domain-deleted form ofFVIII, with endogenous LMAN1 and MCFD2. The interaction of MCFD2 with FVIIIwas independent of the binding of MCFD2 to LMAN1 or the glycosylation state ofFVIII. In contrast, the interaction of LMAN1 with FVIII, although alsoindependent of FVIII glycosylation, appeared to require LMAN1-MCFD2 complexformation.

Equal amounts of celllysate (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducingconditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with amonoclonal antibody against LMAN1 (G1/93). N-terminal Protein Sequencing—Lysates of COS1 cellstransfected with myc-tagged MCFD2 were immunoprecipitated with rabbitanti-MCFD2 IgG conjugated on Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates wereseparated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranein 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11. Protein bands were visualizedby staining with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid, 2% ethanol and thenexcised. Peptide sequencing was performed by the Protein Structure Facility atthe University of Michigan. MCFD2 and LMAN1 Have Similar Half-lives and Form a Stable 1:1Stoichiometric Complex—To measure the half-life of LMAN1 and MCFD2,COS1 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine andchased with excess unlabeled methionine. Equal amounts of cell lysates wereimmunoprecipitated with either anti-LMAN1 or anti-MCFD2 antibodies.Intensities of LMAN1 and MCFD2 bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager.Both proteins have long but similar half-lives (∼26 h)(Fig. 1a), consistentwith previous studies that suggested a long half-life for LMAN1(25Schweizer A. Fransen J.A.M. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H-P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To approximate conditions for steady state, we performed a 30-h labeling ofCOS1 cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Cell lysates weresequentially immunodepleted with a rabbit anti-MCFD2 antibody followed byimmunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-LMAN1 antibody or viceversa (Fig. 1b).Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of LMAN1 and MCFD2 is evident using eitherantibody. Nearly all LMAN1 and MCFD2 appear to be located in these stablecomplexes, as demonstrated by sequential immunodepletions. Similar resultswere observed in HeLa and 293T cells (data not shown). The ratio of labelingintensities for the LMAN1 and MCFD2 bands as determined by PhosphorImageranalysis was ∼2.6:1. Mature LMAN1 contains 9 methionines and 4 cysteines,whereas mature MCFD2 contains 5 methionines. Taken together with theapparently similar half-lives for both proteins by pulse-chase analysis(Fig. 1a), theseresults suggest that LMAN1 and MCFD2 are associated in a 1:1stoichiometry. MCFD2 Is Not Required for Oligomerization of LMAN1— LMAN1 isknown to exist in the cell as both disulfide-linked homodimers anddisulfide-linked homohexamers(15Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We prepared cell lysatesfrom lymphoblasts derived from normal controls and patients with MCFD2-nullmutations. Western blotting for LMAN1 in cell lysates electrophoresed underdenaturing, but non-reducing conditions revealed no significant difference indimer and hexamer formation between normal and MCFD2-deficient lymphoblasts(Fig. 2). These resultsdemonstrate that MCFD2 binds to LMAN1 non-covalently and that it is notrequired for normal LMAN1 oligomerization. FVIII Interacts with the LMAN1-MCFD2 Complex—Although FVIIIwas previously reported to co-immunoprecipitate with overexpressed LMAN1(26Cunningham M.A. Pipe S.W. Zhang B. Hauri H-P. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Thromb.Haemost. 2003; 1: 2360-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we were unable todemonstrate a consistent interaction of FVIII with endogenous LMAN1 or MCFD2by direct immunoprecipitation. We therefore performed chemical cross-linkingin live cells. COS1 cells were transfected with wild-type FVIII and labeledwith [35S]methionine/cysteine at 26 h after transfection. Cellswere then incubated with the membrane-permeable, thio-cleavable cross-linker,DSP. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against MCFD2,LMAN1, and FVIII, as well as negative control antibodies (anti-mycand anti-TRAPα (27Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), acomponent of the ER translocon that forms a tight complex with TRAPβ).Anti-FVIII antibody detected the 280-kDa FVIII primary translation product incell extracts. Immunoprecipitation of the same amount of cell extracts witheither anti-LMAN1 or anti-MCFD2 antibodies precipitated both LMAN1 and MCFD2.A low level of FVIII (<1%) was seen in immunoprecipitations in the absenceof DSP treatment. However, the intensity of the FVIII band increased markedlyin immunoprecipitations with both the anti-MCFD2 and the anti-LMAN1 antibodiesfollowing DSP treatment, with no increase evident with control antibodies(Fig. 3A). We observed5–20% of the total FVIII to be cross-linked to LMAN1 or MCFD2 underthese conditions. These results indicate a specific interaction between FVIIIand the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex. B-domain-deleted FVIII Interacts Poorly with the LMAN1-MCFD2Complex—COS1 cells were transiently transfected with FVIII orBDD-FVIII, metabolically labeled, and then incubated with or without DSP. Celllysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against LMAN1 and MCFD2, aswell as control antibodies. Again, increased co-IP of FVIII with LMAN1 andMCFD2 was observed following DSP treatment(Fig. 4A). Incontrast, very little BDD-FVIII co-immunoprecipitated with LMAN1 or MCFD2following DSP treatment. We next examined Chinese hamster ovary cells stablyexpressing FVIII or BDD-FVIII using a polyclonal antibody against the rathomolog of LMAN1. Again, treatment with DSP significantly enhanced the co-IPof LMAN1 with FVIII but not BDD-FVIII (Fig.4B). These results suggest that the BDD-FVIII does notbind or has markedly reduced binding affinity to the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex. MCFD2 Can Bind FVIII Independent of LMAN1—COS1 cells wereco-transfected with FVIII and a myc-tagged MCFD2 carrying the D129Emutation (MCFD2D129E), which abolishes binding to LMAN1(12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Mcvey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells were treated withDSP and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. As expected, MCFD2D129Edid not co-immunoprecipitate with LMAN1(Fig. 5, lanes 9, 11,13, and 15). Overexpression of MCFD2 increased the amount ofFVIII that co-immunoprecipitated with MCFD2 in the absence of DSP(Fig. 5, lanes 2 and10) but did not increase co-IP of FVIII with LMAN1(Fig. 5, lanes 3 and11). However, DSP treatment significantly increased the amount ofFVIII that was pulled down by both anti-LMAN1 and anti-MCFD2 antibodies(Fig. 5, lanes 6, 7,14, and 15). Anti-myc antibody, which reacts with themyc-tagged MCFD2, pulled down FVIII in cells transfected withwild-type MCFD2, as well as cells transfected with MCFD2D129E(Fig. 5, lanes 5 and13). These results suggest that MCFD2 can bind to FVIII independentof LMAN1. Overexpressed MCFD2 Is Secreted—In the conditioned medium ofCOS1 cells transfected with MCFD2, immunoprecipitation with anti-MCFD2detected a protein with the apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa (Figs.5, lane 17, and6). Immunoprecipitation of celllysates with anti-MCFD2 antibody also detected a small amount of the same28-kDa band in addition to the endogenous MCFD2 (16 kDa) and the 18-kDaspecies of myc-tagged MCFD2 (Figs.5 and6). The 28-kDa species failedto co-immunoprecipitate with LMAN1 (Fig.5, lanes 3 and 7). We treated theimmunoprecipitates with either N-glycosidase F orO-glycanase (Fig. 6).No mobility shift was observed with N-glycosidase F treatment,whereas upon O-glycanase treatment, the 28-kDa MCFD2 band is lostfrom the cell lysate, and MCFD2 in the conditioned medium is converted into 10intermediates between the 28-kDa species and the 18-kDa species. Since matureMCFD2 contains 10 serine and threonine residues, these results could beconsistent with O-glycosylation of all available sites in secretedMCFD2. Alternatively, the intermediate bands may represent incompletedigestion products. The 28-kDa species detected in cell lysates is most likelythe O-glycosylated form of MCFD2 in the Golgi that is in the processof being secreted. Both the endogenous MCFD2 and the myc-tagged MCFD2appear larger on the SDS gel than the predicted molecular masses of the matureproteins (14 and 16 kDa). We performed N-terminal amino acid sequencing ofimmunoprecipitated MCFD2 and myc-tagged MCFD2. The results indicatethat the signal peptide of MCFD2 was cleaved at the predicted site, betweenamino acid residues 26 and 27. The slower migration on the SDS gel is likelydue to the amino acid composition of MCFD2. Cross-linking of FVIII to the LMAN1-MCFD2 Complex Is Inhibited byCalcium Depletion but Not Affected by the Glycosylation State ofFVIII—Calcium concentration in the ER lumen is known to besignificantly higher than that in the cytosol(28Pezzati R. Bossi M. Podini P. Meldolesi J. Grohovaz F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LMAN1 and MCDF2interaction is abolished in the presence of a calcium chelator(12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Mcvey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine thecontributions of Ca2+ in the interaction of FVIII with LMAN1 andMCFD2, FVIII-transfected COS1 cells were treated with thapsigargin, a potentCa2+-ATPase inhibitor that depletes Ca2+ in the ER lumen(29Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol.Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize potentialcomplications associated with the ER stress response, cells were treated for 3h or less before major pathways of the unfolded protein response are fullyactivated. After cross-linking with DSP, cells were lysed in the presence ofEGTA to prevent reassociation of LMAN1 with MCFD2. Thapsigargin treatmentdisrupted the LMAN1-MCFD2 interaction in the cell, as evidenced by the reducedlevel of co-IP (Fig. 7,lanes 13–14), as well as reduced amounts of intracellularMCFD2, along with the appearance of the higher molecular weight,O-glycosylated secretion intermediate(Fig. 7, lane 13). Theco-IP of FVIII with MCFD2 was nearly abolished(Fig. 7, lane 13),likely due to the low level of MCFD2 in the ER caused by Ca2+depletion. The co-IP of FVIII with LMAN1 was also markedly reduced(Fig. 7, lanes 14),despite the normal level of LMAN1, suggesting that Ca2+ and/orMCFD2 binding is required for LMAN1 to interact with FVIII. Dissociation ofFVIII from LMAN1 observed upon thapsigargin treatment is not likely anonspecific result of ER stress. Lysis of DSP-treated cells in EGTA-containingbuffer alone had no effect on the amount of FVIII cross-linked to LMAN1 orMCFD2 (data not shown). To study whether carbohydrate structures on FVIII are important for theinteraction of FVIII with LMAN1-MCFD2, we treated cells for 3 h withtunicamycin (Tm), which blocks the first step in core oligosaccharide assemblyand thus inhibits the synthesis of all N-linked structure. Asexpected, unglycosylated FVIII, as well as TRAPα and TRAPβ from theTm-treated cells, migrated faster than normal(Fig. 7, lanes16–19). Tm treatment had no significant effect on the amount ofFVIII that cross-linked to LMAN1 or MCFD2(Fig. 7, lanes17–18). Co-IP of FVIII was not detected with the control antibodyanti-TRAPα or in cells treated with Tm alone (data not shown),indicating that Tm did not result in random aggregation of FVIII. Treatmentwith castanospermine or deoxymannojirimycin, which specifically inhibittrimming of N-linked oligosaccharide structures, also had nosignificant effect on the amount of FVIII that cross-linked with LMAN1 orMCFD2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the interaction of FVIIIwith LMAN1 and MCFD2 is not dependent on the glycosylation state of FVIII. The identification of LMAN1 mutations in F5F8D provided the first directevidence for a cargo-specific sorting receptor in the ER of higher eukaryotes(11Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H-P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The identification ofthe soluble protein MCFD2 as another essential component of this pathway(12Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. Mcvey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) distinguishes thismammalian cargo receptor from those identified in yeast. Association of asoluble protein with a transmembrane protein may represent a general featureof transport receptors in higher eukaryotes. The data presented heredemonstrate a specific interaction between both MCFD2 and LMAN1 and the FVIIIcargo. Our cross-linking data suggested that interactions between theLMAN1-MCFD2 complex and its cargo proteins may be of low affinity or transientin nature. Detection of interactions between LMAN1 with procathepsin Z(30Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar,31Appenzeller-Herzog C. Nyfeler B. Burkhard P. Santamaria I. Lopez-Otin C. Hauri H-P. Mol. Biol.Cell. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar) and between Emp24p andErv29p and their cargo is also dependent upon chemical cross-linking(8Muniz M. Nuoffer C. Hauri H-P. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,9Belden W.J. Barlowe C. Science. 2001; 294: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking has been elegantlydissected in yeast. Both Emp24p and Erv29p have homologs in higher eukaryotes.Emp24p is a member of the p24 family of proteins that have homologs in plantsand mammals. p24 proteins fall into four subfamilies (α, β,γ, δ) that exhibit different tissue distribution patterns and canform heteromeric complexes. Deletion of all p24 proteins in yeast producesonly a mild secretory defect in a limited number of proteins(7Springer S. Chen E. Duden R. Marzioch M. Rowley A. Hamamoto S. Merchant S. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4034-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, specificp24 genes may have diverse functions in other organisms(32Denzel A. Otto F. Girod A. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Rosewell I. Bergeron J.J.M. Solari R.C.E. Owen M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 55-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Carney G.E. Taylor B.J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, clear LMAN1 orthologs exist in invertebrates prior tothe appearance of blood coagulation system components(35Davidson C.J. Tuddenham E.G. Mcvey J.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), including FV and FVIII,suggesting that this transport pathway may be required for a much broaderarray of protein cargo. Mutations in the Drosophila LMAN1 homolog,rhea, cause a late embryonic recessive lethal phenotype, resultingfrom somatic wing and muscle developmental defects(36Martin-Bermudo M.D. Brown N.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Prout M. Damania Z. Soong J. Fristrom D. Fristrom J.W. Genetics. 1997; 146: 275-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disrupting the functionof Rhea may cause a secretion defect or a mislocalization of a crucialcargo. We observed a quantitative association of LMAN1 and MCFD2 in COS1 cells(Fig. 1b), raising thepossibility that synthesis of LMAN1 and MCFD2 may be coordinated. However, itremains possible that the ratio of LMAN1/MCFD2 may vary among different cellor tissue types. Interestingly, a recent report presented in vitroevidence that the rat ortholog of MCFD2 may function extracellularly as a stemcell-derived neuronal survival factor(38Toda H. Tsuji M. Nakano I. Kobuke K. Hayashi T. Kasahara H. Takahashi J. Mizoguchi A. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Hashimoto N. Palmer T.D. Honjo T. Tashiro K. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35491-35500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This would require MCFD2to be expressed in excess to LMAN1 and thus secreted in neuronal stem cells.We have shown that overexpressed MCFD2 is secreted in an extensivelyO-glycosylated form (Fig.6). Although F5F8D patients with MCFD2 deficiency do not exhibitobvious neurological symptoms, a partially redundant role of MCFD2 in neuronaldevelopment cannot be excluded. The receptor-mediated transport model requires sorting signals to bepresent on the cargo that are recognized by their receptors. A recent studysuggested that three hydrophobic residues on pro-α-factor may mediateits interaction with Erv29p(10Otte S. Barlowe C. Nat. CellBiol. 2004; 6: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our results demonstratedthat the interaction of FVIII with both LMAN1 and MCFD2 requires the B domainbut appears to be independent of its glycosylation(Fig. 7), suggesting that thelectin activity of LMAN1 is not the primary sorting signal for cargo receptorbinding. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a non-nativeinteraction as a result of incomplete folding of the unglycosylated FVIII.These data were consistent with the observation that in MCFD2-deficientpatients, normal level of LMAN1 alone cannot support the efficient secretionof FV and FVIII. A crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain ofp58, the rat homolog of LMAN1(39Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; : 15979-15984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggested potentialprotein-binding sites in addition to the carbohydrate-binding site. However,our data did not exclude the contribution of carbohydrate binding in furtherstabilizing the receptor-cargo interaction. Targeting of procathepsin Zappears to require both an oligosaccharide chain and a surface-exposed peptideβ-hairpin loop (31Appenzeller-Herzog C. Nyfeler B. Burkhard P. Santamaria I. Lopez-Otin C. Hauri H-P. Mol. Biol.Cell. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). TheFVIII B domain contains 970 amino acid residues. Further studies are requiredto pinpoint elements within the B domain that are important for cargo receptorbinding. Secretion of BDD-FVIII is only moderately increased despite a 40-foldincrease in mRNA level as compared with the full-length FVIII(20Pipe S.W. Semin. Thromb.Hemostasis. 2004; 30: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous experimentsusing a cell line overexpressing an ER exit-deficient LMAN1 observed asecretion defect only for intact FV and FVIII, not the correspondingB-domain-deleted molecules, consistent with an interaction between the Bdomains and LMAN1 (22Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Hauri H-P. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.Chem. 1999; 274: 32539-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).However, a subsequent study suggested that both FVIII and BDD-FVIII canco-immunoprecipitate with LMAN1(26Cunningham M.A. Pipe S.W. Zhang B. Hauri H-P. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Thromb.Haemost. 2003; 1: 2360-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and reported a decreasein FVIII co-IP with a mutant LMAN1 that is deficient in carbohydraterecognition. In the latter experiments, ER exit-deficient LMAN1 wasoverexpressed, which could explain the discrepancy with our experiments.Although we readily observed co-IP of FVIII with antibodies against LMAN1 andMCFD2, only faint or no LMAN1 and MCFD2 bands were detected with anti-FVIII(faint LMAN1 bands in Fig. 3,last lane; Fig. 5,lanes 8 and 16; Fig.7, lane 10). The poor detection of LMAN1/MCFD2 withanti-FVIII antibody probably resulted from the much longer half-lives of MCFD2and LMAN1 (∼26 h, Fig. 1)as compared with FVIII (∼2 h). With the relatively short labeling time of45 min, the specific radioactivity of FVIII should be much greater than thatof LMAN1 or MCFD2, likely accounting for the difference in detectionsensitivity. A similar phenomenon has been previously observed for co-IP ofFVIII with two long-lived ER chaperones, calreticulin and calnexin(40Pipe S.W. Morris J.A. Shah J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8537-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). LMAN1 has been shown to bind Ca2+(41Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Lindqvist Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MCFD2 contains EF-handdomain that presumably also bind Ca2+. We showed that the luminalCa2+ concentration is critical for the interaction of LMAN1 andMCFD2, as well as the cargo binding activity of this complex. In addition,binding of MCFD2 to FVIII appeared to be independent of its interaction withLMAN1 (Fig. 5). Binding ofFVIII to LMAN1 appeared to require Ca2+ orCa2+-dependent LMAN1-MCFD2 complex formation(Fig. 7). Taken together, ourdata supported a model in which MCFD2 functions at the point of cargo loadingduring the ER-to-Golgi transport of FV and FVIII. Ca2+-MCFD2 couldfunction as the initial contact that specifically captures correctly folded FVand FVIII in the ER lumen. The FV/FVIII-MCFD2-LMAN1 ternary complex could thenbe further stabilized by interactions between LMAN1 and the oligosaccharidesand/or amino acid side chains of FVIII. This cargo-containing complex is thenpackaged into COPII-coated vesicles for budding. An intriguing implication ofthis model is that the primary cause of F5F8D is defective MCFD2, and failureto retain MCFD2 in the ER is the mechanism by which LMAN1 mutations causeF5F8D. The continued secretion of FV and FVIII at reduced levels in F5F8Dpatients could be due to residual MCFD2 or LMAN1 transport function in theabsence of the other component, with a complete block of FV and FVIIIsecretion requiring deficiency of both proteins. Alternatively, a secondtransport pathway such as bulk flow or an alternative cargo receptor could beresponsible for the background level of FV/FVIII secretion observed inF5F8D. We thank Drs. Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley) andHans-Peter Hauri (University of Basel) for critical reading of the manuscript.We thank T.

One of thekey pathological hallmarks of AD is the deposition of the 39–43-aminoacid amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the form of both diffuse(thioflavine-S/Congo red-negative) and fibrillar (thioflavine-S/Congored-positive) plaques. An abundance of data suggests that conversion ofAβ from soluble to insoluble forms is an early event in the pathogenesisof AD. The Aβ peptide is generated from cleavage of the larger amyloidprecursor protein (APP) with the predominant species beingAβ40 and,to a lesser extent, Aβ42(1Selkoe D.J. J. Clin.Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although accounting for<1% of all cases, early-onset, autosomal-dominant forms of AD have beenidentified that share the common feature of an overall increase in Aβlevels or a relative elevation in the more fibrillogenic Aβ42throughout life, ultimately resulting in early Aβ deposition and plaqueformation. Identification of these familial AD cases has led to the generationof several APP transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many aspects ofAβ deposition and associated pathology(2Hock Jr., B.J.

In 1993, the ϵ4 allele of apoE was found to be a genetic risk factorfor the most common form of AD (late-onset AD) as well as for cerebral amyloidangiopathy, whereas the ϵ2 allele was shown to be protective(3Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7342) Google Scholar). Abundant data suggest thatapoE is linked to AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to its ability to actas an Aβ chaperone (4Wisniewski T. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Neurobiol.

By acting as an Aβ-binding molecule, apoEinfluences the amount of Aβ deposition and the conformation in whichAβ aggregates, as well as Aβ clearance and toxicity in vivo(5Bales K.R. Verina T.

Thus, understanding thecellular events and receptors that regulate apoE levels in brain may giveimportant insights into AD pathogenesis. ApoE is expressed at high levels in the liver and the central nervoussystem (CNS), where it is present in lipoprotein particles. Furthermore, apoEin the CNS is derived from within the CNS and not the plasma(11Linton M.F. Gish R. Hubl S.T. Butler E. Esquivel C. Bry W.I. Boyles J.K. Wardell M.R. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, in the CNS,apoE-containing lipoproteins differ from those found in the periphery in boththe amount of sialation and, perhaps more importantly, the type of lipoproteinparticle it associates with(12Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In the plasma, apoE isin both very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and a subset of high densitylipoproteins that also contain other apoproteins. In contrast, CNS apoE is inhigh density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins that are secreted primarily byastrocytes and, when released by cells, contain apoE as their soleapolipoprotein constituent(12Pitas R.E.

Despite this information,whether specific apoE receptors regulate the level of apoE in the brain ormediate apoE-dependent clearance of apoE-binding proteins is unknown. Nearly20 years ago, Brown and Goldstein(14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar) elucidated the role ofthe low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in receptor-mediated endocytosisof lipoproteins in plasma, including apoE. Subsequently, other members of theLDLR family have been identified. Many are expressed in brain, and they havebeen shown in vitro to bind and endocytose lipid-rich lipoproteinsthat contain apoE (15Beffert U. Stolt P.C. Herz J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 403-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Todetermine whether LDLR family members influence the level of CNS apoE andAβ metabolism, an AD mouse model was recently bred to mice lacking the39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP)(16Van Uden E. Mallory M. Veinbergs I. Alford M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9298-9304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in Aβaggregation and deposition was found in these mice. RAP is an endoplasmicreticulum chaperone protein known to influence the folding and level of allLDLR family members, and in this study, levels of both LDLR-related protein(LRP) and LDLR were examined and found to be reduced in the brain of micelacking RAP (16Van Uden E. Mallory M. Veinbergs I. Alford M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9298-9304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Additionally, overexpression of a functional LRP mini-receptor in the PDAPPmodel led to an increase in the levels of soluble Aβ at advanced stagesof deposition, but with no detectable change in Aβ deposition measuredhistologically (17Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus,whether other LDLR family members are responsible for brain apoE metabolismand whether they play a role in regulating Aβ levels in vivoremains unclear. Herein, we investigate the role of LDLR in regulation ofCNS-derived apoE as well as on brain Aβ levels in a mouse model ofAD. ApoE Labeling and in Vitro Assays—The immunoaffinitypurification of astrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoprotein particles hasbeen described previously(18DeMattos R.B. Brendza R.P. Heuser J.E. Kierson M. Cirrito J.R. Fryer J. Sullivan P.M. Fagan A.M. Han X. Holtzman D.M. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For apoE degradationstudies, astrocyte-secreted apoE3-containing lipoprotein particles werelabeled with 125I using an IODO-GEN kit (Pierce). Chinese hamsterovary cells that lack endogenous LRP (LRP-null) were used to stably expressLDLR, an LRP mini-receptor, apoER2, and the VLDL receptor(19Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Degradation of125I-labeled apoE3 was measured as radioactivity soluble in 20%trichloroacetic acid in the cell culture supernatant as previously described(19Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 1 μmunlabeled RAP was used to determine specificity, a concentration that inhibitsall LDLR family members. For apoE endocytosis assays, apoE lipoproteinparticles were labeled with the fluorescent hydrocarbon probe DiI aspreviously described (20Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells or mouse embryonic fibroblast cellslacking LDLR, LRP, or both receptors were used for the DiI studies(21Reblin T.

DiI-labeled apoE wasapplied for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4%paraformaldehyde. Animal and Tissue Preparation—For analysis of tissue andplasma cholesterol and CSF apoE, 3-month-old Ldlr+/+ andLdlr-/- mice, both on an identical C57BL/6J background,were used (23Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin.Investig. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). For analysisof human apoE isoforms, Ldlr-/- mice were first bred towild-type SJL mice to generate Ldlr+/- mice on a mixedC57BL/6J × SJL background. These mice were then bred to humanAPOE-expressing mice(24Sullivan P.M. Mezdour H. Aratani Y. Knouff C. Najib J. Reddick R.L. Quarfordt S.H. Maeda N. J. Biol.

For Aβ analysis,we utilized the PDAPP mice that overexpress human APP751 with afamilial AD mutation at position 717 (APPV717F) under control ofthe neuron-specific platelet-derived growth factor promoter(25Games D.

We crossedPDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/- mice withLdlr+/- mice to generate PDAPP+/-,Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-,Ldlr-/- mice (littermates) on the same mixed geneticbackground as described previously(7Holtzman D.M. Bales K.R. Tenkova T. Fagan A.M. Parsadanian M. Sartorius L.J. Mackey B. Olney J. McKeel D. Wozniak D. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (150mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and perfused transcardially with 0.1 m PBScontaining heparin (3 units/ml), pH 7.4. One hemibrain was immersion-fixed inPBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. After fixation, thebrain was cryoprotected in PBS containing 30% sucrose at 4 °C. Brainregions from the other hemisphere were dissected and frozen on powdered dryice before analysis. Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) wereused where indicated. For PBS-soluble Aβ analysis, tissue was firstDounce homogenized in ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors and immediatelyspun for 5 min at 20,000 × g. For carbonate-soluble Aβanalysis, the PBS-insoluble pellet was then homogenized in ice-cold 100mm carbonate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 11.5, with proteaseinhibitors and immediately spun for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Forcarbonate-insoluble Aβ analysis, the carbonate-insoluble pellet was lysedfor 3 h with rotation in 5 m guanidine, 50 mm Tris withprotease inhibitors. All experimental protocols were approved by the animalstudies committee at Washington University. Biochemical and Histological Analysis—Aβ40and Aβ42 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayas described previously (26DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Cummins D.J. Dodart J.C. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S.

Bales K.R. Tenkova T. Fagan A.M. Parsadanian M. Sartorius L.J. Mackey B. Olney J. McKeel D. Wozniak D. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

ApoE was measured incortical tissue that was Dounce homogenized briefly in PBS with proteaseinhibitors and spun immediately at 20,000 × g for 5 min. MurineapoE was quantified using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay withpooled C57BL/6J plasma serving as a standard for apoE set at 68 μg/ml(27Lusis A.J. Taylor B.A. Quon D. Zollman S. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7594-7604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a sensitivity of<5 ng/ml. Human apoE was quantified using the same enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay protocol, except that the standard used was purified apoEisolated from human β-VLDL (BioDesign, Sako, ME). The 96-well microtiterplates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml monoclonal anti-apoEantibody WUE4 (28Krul E.S. Tikkanen M.J. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1309-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All washeswere performed 8 times/well with PBS in a standard microplate washer. Plateswere washed and blocked with 1% dry milk in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C.Plates were washed, and samples and standards were loaded in 0.5% bovine serumalbumin in PBS-0.025% Tween 20 containing protease inhibitors and incubatedfor 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-apoEantiserum (Calbiochem) at 1:500 dilution in 0.5% bovine serum albumin inPBS-0.025% Tween 20 for 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed, andhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-goat antibody at 1:5000 dilution(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was incubated for 90 min at roomtemperature. Plates were washed, tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma) wasadded, and absorbance was monitored at 650 nm. The Amplex Red kit (MolecularProbes, Eugene, OR) was used to measure total cholesterol content. Western Blotting—Tissue samples were homogenized inradioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50mm Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholicacid, 0.1% SDS, pH 8) with protease inhibitors, passed 10 times through a33-gauge needle, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rotation.Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g. Protein content in the supernatant was quantified using the BCAkit (Pierce), and protein (30 μg/lane) was run on SDS-PAGE gels andtransferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting using standard techniques.To detect full-length APP and C-terminal fragments of APP, the blot was probedwith CT15 (a generous gift from Dr. Ed Koo, University of California, SanDiego, CA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 15amino acids of APP (29Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Todetect LRP, blots were probed with rabbit anti-LRP antibody(17Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Images were capturedusing the Kodak ImageStation 440CF, and densitometric analysis of bands wasperformed using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co., NewHaven, CT). Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.E.and were analyzed using PRISM version 4.00 software (GraphPad, San Diego,CA). To begin to determine whether one of the two major apoE receptors in thebrain, LDLR or LRP, could regulate apoE levels in brain, we purifiedastrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles as describedpreviously (18DeMattos R.B. Brendza R.P. Heuser J.E. Kierson M. Cirrito J.R. Fryer J. Sullivan P.M. Fagan A.M. Han X. Holtzman D.M. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and determinedtheir ability to be endocytosed by mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived fromwild-type, Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/-, ordouble-knock-out Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/- mouseembryos (21Reblin T. Niemeier A. Meyer N. Willnow T.E. Kronenberg F. Dieplinger H. Greten H. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2103-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DiI-labeled apoElipoprotein particles were readily taken up into endocytic vesicles inwild-type and Lrp-/- cells(Fig. 1A). Thispunctate pattern of staining is typical of receptor-mediated endocytosis andrepresents an endosomal/lysosomal distribution of endocytosed ligands.However, cells from Ldlr-/- or double-knock-outLdlr-/-, Lrp-/- cells showed noappreciable endocytosis of astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoproteinparticles (Fig. 1A).To further clarify the role of other LDLR family members in mediating thereceptor-mediated endocytosis of astrocyte-derived apoE, we used Chinesehamster ovary cells that lack endogenous LRP and are stably transfected withthe LDLR, LRP mini-receptors, apoER2, and the VLDL receptor to analyzepotential uptake and degradation of apoE-containing lipoprotein particles(19Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These cells expressingthe different LDLR family members have been shown previously to bind andendocytose control ligands(19Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These receptors are themain candidate apoE receptors expressed in the brain(15Beffert U. Stolt P.C. Herz J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 403-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Application of125I-labeled, astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoproteinparticles to cells overexpressing LDLR resulted in a large increase inRAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of apoE(Fig. 1B). However,cells overexpressing other LDLR family members or vector alone did not resultin appreciable uptake and degradation of astrocyte-derived apoE(Fig. 1B). To determine the potential role of LDLR in brain apoE metabolism invivo, we used a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure thelevel of murine apoE in the extracellular space of the brain (such as the CSF)of both wild-type (Ldlr+/+) and LDLR knock-out(Ldlr-/-) mice. Because apoE is secreted into the brainextracellular space, we expected that if a receptor such as LDLR involved inits endocytosis was absent, extracellular levels would be elevated. Forexample, apoE is elevated severalfold in the plasma ofLdlr-/- mice(23Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin.Investig. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) as well as in humans withfamilial hypercholesterolemia resulting from reduced LDLR expression and/orfunction (30Gibson J.C. Goldberg R.B. Rubinstein A. Ginsberg H.N. Brown W.V. Baker S. Joffe B.I. Seftel H.C. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Kajinami K. Mabuchi H. Koizumi J. Takeda R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1992; 211: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We found thatLdlr-/- mice had a 53% increase in CSF levels of apoErelative to Ldlr+/+ mice(Fig. 2A).Furthermore, we found that apoE levels in cortical tissue homogenized in PBS(as a reflection of extracellular pools of apoE) were significantly increasedby 57% in Ldlr-/- mice compared withLdlr+/+ mice (Fig.2B). Together, both the in vitro and invivo data suggest that the LDLR plays an important role as an apoEreceptor that mediates the uptake, degradation, and level of apoE in thebrain. Because Ldlr-/- mice have elevated extracellular levelsof apoE in the brain and because apoE acts as an Aβ chaperone for bothsoluble and insoluble Aβ, we wanted to determine the effect of LDLR onthe deposition of Aβ in vivo. To determine whether LDLR has adirect effect on Aβ aggregation and deposition in vivo, we usedthe PDAPP mouse model of AD to generate PDAPP+/-,Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-,Ldlr-/- mice (littermates). PDAPP mice express the humanAPP transgene containing a familial AD mutation at amino acid 717 andoverproduce Aβ (particularly Aβ42). In the hippocampus ofthese mice, the amount of soluble and insoluble Aβ increases in anage-dependent manner beginning between 6 and 9 months of age, when plaquesbegin to deposit (25Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Guido T. Hagopian S. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Lee M. Leibowitz P. Lieberburg I. Little S. Masliah E.

Neurobiol.Dis. 2002; 9: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We first examined thelevels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in youngPDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-,Ldlr-/- mice at 3 months of age, well before thedeposition of Aβ begins. PBS-soluble levels of Aβ40 andAβ42 in the hippocampus were not significantly differentbetween the two genotypes (Fig.3A). Carbonate-soluble levels of Aβ40 andAβ42 in the hippocampus were also not significantly differentbetween the two genotypes (Fig.3B). We next examined PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ andPDAPP+/-, Ldlr-/- mice at 10 months of age todetermine the effect of the LDLR on Aβ deposition. The area of thehippocampus covered by Aβ immunoreactive deposits in tissue sections was31% higher in 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice comparedwith PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice(Fig. 4A), but thisincrease was not statistically significant. Similar results were found forthioflavine-S-positive fibrillar deposits, and comparable results were foundin the cortex (data not shown). A biochemical analysis of carbonate-solubleAβ levels in the hippocampus revealed slight but nonsignificant increasesin both Aβ40 (17%) and Aβ42 (53%) of10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP,Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.4B). Carbonate-insoluble Aβ levels in thehippocampus also revealed slight but nonsignificant increases in bothAβ40 (51%) and Aβ42 (10%) of 10-month-oldPDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP,Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.4C). Whereas Ldlr-/- mice have anincrease in plasma cholesterol of ∼79% compared with wild-type(Ldlr+/+) mice (Fig.5A), there were no differences in either brain or CSFcholesterol (Fig. 5, B andC). There was also no evidence that the processing of APP(Fig. 5D) or thelevels of total APP protein (data not shown) were different between thegenotypes. Additionally, hippocampal LRP levels were not altered in theabsence of LDLR (data not shown). Thus, although the level of murine apoE iselevated by about 50% in the extracellular CNS pools inLdlr-/- mice, these data suggest that this degree ofchange in the level of apoE is not sufficiently increased to significantlyaffect Aβ levels at young ages or the early stages of Aβ depositionin PDAPP transgenic mice.Fig. 5LDLR influences levels of plasma cholesterol but has no effect onhippocampal and CSF cholesterol or APP processing. A, the levelof total plasma cholesterol was 69.2 ± 4.63 mg/dl inLdlr+/+ mice (n = 6) as compared with 124± 8.82 mg/dl in Ldlr-/- mice (n = 6)(***, p < 0.001, unpaired two-tailed t test).Level of total cholesterol in the hippocampus (B), CSF (C),and APP processing as assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting ofα-C-terminal fragment (α-CTF; D) was notsignificantly different between the genotypes (n =5–7/group).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the possibility that the LDLR may differentially regulate thelevel of human apoE isoforms in the CNS compared with murine apoE, we bredhuman APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 targeted replacement mice(knock-in) onto an Ldlr-/- mouse background. To confirmprevious findings noted from these mice(33Knouff C. Briand O. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Altenburg M. Maeda N. Biochim. Biophys.Acta. 2004; 1684: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we assessed plasmacholesterol and apoE and found that both were significantly elevated in theabsence of LDLR in all genotypes (data not shown). To determine the extent towhich LDLR regulates human apoE levels in the extracellular space of the CNS,we measured apoE levels in the CSF. We found that levels of both human apoE3and human apoE4 in the CSF were significantly higher by 210% and 380%,respectively, in the absence of the LDLR(Fig. 6A). The levelof human apoE2 in the CSF was not significantly altered by the presence orabsence of the LDLR (Fig.6A), as was expected, because the human apoE2 isoformexhibits <2% binding to the LDLR(34Schneider W.J. Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Utermann G. Weber W. Havel R.J. Kotite L. Kane J.P. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Clin.Investig. 1981; 68: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, it isinteresting to note that the level of human apoE2 is substantially higher thanthat of apoE3 or apoE4 in the CSF (Fig.6A). Despite the increase in human apoE levels in theabsence of LDLR, there was no significant increase in the level of braincholesterol in these mice (Fig.6B). In the present study, we found that the LDLR, but not other LDLR familymembers, was able to efficiently bind, endocytose, and degradeastrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoprotein particles and thatLdlr-/- mice have ∼50% higher levels of apoE in CSFand extracellular pools of brain tissue. However, when the PDAPP mouse modelof AD was bred onto an Ldlr-/- background, there was not asignificant increase in the levels of Aβ40 andAβ42 at young ages before deposition of Aβ begins.Additionally, there was not a significant increase in Aβ depositiondefined by immunohistochemical and biochemical measures between 10-month-oldPDAPP, Ldlr-/- and PDAPP, Ldlr+/+mice. Interestingly, using human APOE knock-in mice, we found thatthe increase in the level of apoE3 and apoE4 (but not apoE2) on anLdlr-/- background was much greater than that for murineapoE on this same Ldlr-/- background. Our in vitro data indicate that LDLR family members including LRP,VLDL receptor, and apoER2 are not able to appreciably internalize and degradeastrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoproteins. Previous work has clearlydemonstrated that these LDLR family members are able to efficiently bind andendocytose apoE reconstituted in large, cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particlestermed β-VLDL (35Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar).However, these β-VLDL particles differ from astrocyte-secreted apoE inlipid composition, the presence of other apoproteins, and the amount ofsialation (12Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Theapolipoprotein lipidation state does alter receptor binding characteristics.For example, our previous studies have shown that recombinant apoE in theabsence of lipid prefers binding to LRP over the LDLR(22Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M. LaDu M.J. Yu L. Han X. Gross R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is not a form ofapoE that has been shown to be present under physiological conditions.Together, these results indicate that the lipid content and form of apoElipoprotein particles can alter their receptor binding specificity. They alsodemonstrate that the LDLR is an important apoE receptor that regulates humanand murine apoE endocytosis and levels in the brain. Although the results ofthis study do not rule out that other LDLR family members contribute in someway to the level of apoE in the brain, they clearly show that LDLR plays animportant role in brain apoE metabolism. Recent studies have shown that increasing or decreasing cellularcholesterol can influence cellular Aβ secretion(36Wolozin B. Neuron. 2004; 41: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). AlthoughLdlr-/- mice have elevated plasma cholesterol levels, wefound that the level of brain cholesterol is unaffected in these mice as hasbeen previously reported (37Quan G. Xie C. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 146: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).The exact mechanism by which apoE affects AD pathogenesis is unclear. However,a large body of evidence suggests that one mechanism by which it influencesthe age of onset of AD is by acting as a chaperone for both soluble andinsoluble Aβ, thereby influencing Aβ clearance and fibrillogenesis(3Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7342) Google Scholar,5Bales K.R.

Neurobiol.Dis. 2002; 9: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our current resultssuggest that although the LDLR regulates extracellular levels of apoE in thebrain, a 50% increase in the level of murine apoE over endogenous levels isnot sufficient to alter Aβ levels at young ages or the early stages ofAβ deposition in PDAPP mice at 10 months of age. This may represent aceiling effect of the level of murine apoE or indicate that a larger increasein the level of murine apoE may be necessary to effect a change in Aβlevels in this model. Alternatively, other pathways of apoE-mediated clearanceof Aβ play a much larger role in the metabolism of Aβ such as LRP orbulk flow along interstitial fluid drainage pathways. Unfortunately,Lrp-/- mice die in early embryonic stages, and thus theeffect of endogenous LRP on brain apoE levels is difficult to assess as shownin this study. Additionally, the LDLR may play a role in Aβ depositiononly at later stages of deposition, as was found for LRP in PDAPP mice(17Zerbinatti C.V. Wozniak D.F. Cirrito J. Cam J.A. Osaka H. Bales K.R. Zhuo M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is also possible thatthe LDLR may differentially regulate human apoE isoforms in the CNS to agreater extent than murine apoE and therefore influence Aβ levels anddeposition. It is interesting that independent of the effect of the LDLR, thelevel of apoE in the CSF of human APOE2 mice is significantly higherthan that in APOE3 or APOE4 mice. This suggests that inhumans, LDLR may play a more important role in regulating CNS apoE levels andAD pathogenesis. Studies of human CSF have reported no significant differencesin the level of human apoE between individuals expressing APOE3 orAPOE4 alleles, but the level of CSF apoE in APOE2/2homozygous individuals has not been assessed, to our knowledge. Given thatAPOE2 has been associated with a decreased risk for developing AD, anintriguing possibility is that the absolute level of apoE present in the brainof these individuals could account for the decrease in risk. Human and murineapoE differ by ∼25% at the amino acid level, and human apoE isoforms andmurine apoE isolated from VLDL have been shown to differentially bind the LDLR(33Knouff C. Briand O. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Altenburg M. Maeda N. Biochim. Biophys.Acta. 2004; 1684: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using the PDAPP mousemodel, previous studies from our group have shown that expression of humanapoE isoforms under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic proteinpromoter results in a significant delay in deposition compared with miceexpressing endogenous murine apoE(7Holtzman D.M. Bales K.R. Tenkova T. Fagan A.M. Parsadanian M. Sartorius L.J. Mackey B. Olney J. McKeel D. Wozniak D. Paul S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurobiol.Dis. 2002; 9: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). More recently, the samehuman apoE knock-in mice used in this study were crossed to PDAPP mice, andboth a delay in Aβ deposition and an isoform-dependent effect on Aβdeposition (E4 > E3 ≥ E2) were found(38Bales K.R. Dodart J.C. DeLong C.A. Wu X. Schmechel D.E. Sullivan P.M. Paul S.M. Soc.Neurosci. Abstr. 2002; : 883.6Google Scholar). Additionally, we haverecently replicated this result in the APPsw mouse model of AD utilizing thesame APOE3 and APOE4 knock-in mice used in this study(39Fryer J.D. Simmons K. Parsadanian M. Bales K.R. Paul S.M. Sullivan P.M. Holtzman D.M. J.Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2803-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Clearly, human apoEisoforms affect Aβ metabolism and deposition differently than murineapoE, but whether this is due to altered clearance and/or structure of Aβin vivo remains to be determined. Determining the role of LDLR orother receptors or clearance pathways in the brain that are also involved inregulating apoE levels is central to understanding how apoE influences Aβmetabolism and AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000435338,"In green fluorescent protein (GFP), chromophore biosynthesis is initiated by a spontaneous main-chain condensation reaction. Nucleophilic addition of the Gly67 amide nitrogen to the Ser65 carbonyl carbon is catalyzed by the protein fold and leads to a heterocyclic intermediate. To investigate this mechanism, we substituted the highly conserved residues Arg96 and Glu222 in enhanced GFP (EGFP). In the R96M variant, the rate of chromophore formation is greatly reduced (time constant = 7.5 × 103 h, pH 7) and exhibits pH dependence. In the E222Q variant, the rate is also attenuated at physiological pH (32 h, pH 7) but is accelerated severalfold beyond that of EGFP at pH 9–10. In contrast, EGFP maturation is pH-independent and proceeds with a time constant of 1 h (pH 7–10). Mass spectrometric results for R96M and E222Q indicate accumulation of the pre-cyclization state, consistent with rate-limiting backbone condensation. The pH-rate profile implies that the Glu222 carboxylate titrates with an apparent pKa of 6.5 in R96M and that the Gly67 amide nitrogen titrates with an apparent pKaa of 9.2 in E222Q. These data suggest a model for GFP chromophore synthesis in which the carboxylate of Glu222 plays the role of a general base, facilitating proton abstraction from the Gly67 amide nitrogen or the Tyr66 α-carbon. Arg96 fulfills the role of an electrophile by lowering the respective pK values and stabilizing the α-enolate. Modulating the base strength of the proton-abstracting group may aid in the design of fast-maturing GFPs with improved characteristics for real-time monitoring of cellular events.

The various colors originate from a fluorescent entity generated in the interior of the protein by the spontaneous covalent modification of three amino acid residues that are part of the polypeptide chain of the protein. Chromophore formation follows protein folding and is initiated by a main-chain condensation reaction, generating a five-membered heterocycle from the backbone atoms of the original polypeptide chain (Ser65, Tyr66, and Gly67 in wild-type GFP) (Scheme 1) (8Cubitt A.B.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1960-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have confirmed that peptide cyclization is the first chemical step in chromophore formation, as originally proposed (8Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), and is responsible for triggering a series of downstream processing events that include air oxidation. Among all of the GFP-like proteins (7Verkhusha V. Lukyanov K.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), GFP itself comprises the simplest system with the least number of chemical steps leading to the mature chromophore, and the mechanism has generally been written as a cyclization-dehydration-oxidation reaction (Scheme 1, Mechanism A) (8Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structure of Y66L (12Rosenow M.A. Huffman H.A. Phail M.E. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4464-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we have recently proposed a modified mechanism consisting of the sequence cyclization-oxidation-dehydration (Scheme 1, Mechanism B), in accord with oxidative stabilization of the cyclic tetrahedral intermediate. It is possible that both pathways A and B occur in GFP maturation and that the relative rates of the individual steps are altered by the mutant forms. In many GFP variants, the optical properties of the mature chromophore are pH-dependent. Absorbance around 400 nm excites the neutral chromophore, and absorbance around 480 nm excites the chromophore anion in which the phenolic end is deprotonated (Scheme 1) (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4882) Google Scholar). At physiological pH, enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP (GFP-F64L/S65T) (13Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar) is brighter than wild-type GFP due to a predominantly anionic chromophore, similar to GFP-S65T in which the chromophore titrates with a pKa of 6.0 (14Elsliger M.-A. Wachter R.M. Hanson G.T. Kallio K. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).The kinetics of de novo chromophore formation has been determined by monitoring the rate of fluorescence acquisition. The GFP-S65T maturation process, inclusive of protein folding and the ensuing chemical steps, has been shown to proceed in vitro with a time constant of 122 min (15Reid B.G. Flynn G.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6786-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this experiment, maturation was induced by rapid dilution of urea-solubilized inclusion bodies at room temperature. De novo protein folding was monitored independently by a trypsin resistance assay and was estimated to proceed with a time constant of 14 min (t½ ∼10 min).In a different type of experiment, Escherichia coli cultures expressing GFP were grown anaerobically and the protein was allowed to mature for 3 days in the absence of oxygen. Upon admission of air to the cells, the time course of subsequent acquisition of green fluorescence gave a time constant of 120 min for wild-type GFP and 27 min for GFP-S65T (9Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 16Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with air oxidation as the rate-determining step in the overall maturation process (Scheme 1) (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4882) Google Scholar).Two residues in the immediate environment of the GFP chromophore are highly conserved, Arg96 and Glu222 (4Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Proposed functions for these residues range from electrostatic, steric, and catalytic roles to contributions to protein folding and stability (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4882) Google Scholar, 17Branchini B.R. Nemser A.R. Zimmer M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1-6Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Neither Arg96 nor Glu222 is absolutely necessary for chromophore biosynthesis (18Jung G. Wiehler J. Zumbusch A. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1932-1947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, GFP variants reported to exhibit altered spectral properties include the E222G mutant (19Ehrig T. O'Kane D.J. Prendergast F.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the R96C mutant (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4882) Google Scholar). More recently, the substitution of Arg96 with an alanine was shown to result in extremely slow chromophore maturation on the order of 2 months at 30 °C (10Barondeau D.P. Putnam C.D. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond of the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr66 to the guanidinium group of Arg96 appears to aid in the cyclization reaction, and two similar mechanisms for catalysis by Arg96 have been put forth. These mechanisms emphasize polarization of the peptide bond between residues 66 and 67 (10Barondeau D.P. Putnam C.D. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12111-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or suggest a proton transfer from the guanidinium group to the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr66 (20Siegbahn P.E.M. Wirstam M. Zimmer M. Int. J. Quant. Chem. 2001; 81: 169-186Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both processes would increase the nucleophilic reactivity of the amide nitrogen of Gly67 to facilitate addition to the carbonyl carbon of residue 65 (Scheme 1).Here, we investigate the function of the buried and highly conserved residues, Arg96 and Glu222, in chromophore biosynthesis. As our parent clone, we chose EGFP, the enhanced green fluorescent protein originally selected based on its brightness (13Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). Observed rate constants and extracted pKa values for chromophore formation in R96M and E222Q are in accord with a peptide cyclization reaction that partitions through an amide anion or an α-enolate species. Delineating the structural and catalytic requirements for efficient chromophore biosynthesis will be essential in the prediction of similar cross-linking chemistries in unrelated proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Preparation, and Optical Characterization—Amino acid substitutions were introduced into EGFP using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The proteins, N-terminally tagged with a His6 tag in the plasmid pRSETB (Invitrogen), were overexpressed in E. coli strain JM109-DE3 and purified as described previously (1Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). Protein homogeneity was estimated to be 90% by SDS-PAGE. UV-visible absorbance spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer.Chromophore Formation Kinetics of R96M and E222Q—The R96M variant was purified following the standard 2-day procedure, because chromophore formation is not observed during this time. However, the E222Q variant was purified by a rapid 2-h procedure (21Remington S.J. Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D.K. Branchaud B.P. Anderson D.C. Kallio K. Lukyanov K.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to prepare protein primarily in the precursor state at the onset of kinetic experiments. 250-ml E. coli cultures were induced for 2 h, the cells were disrupted with lysozyme, and the protein was purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid at 4 °C. PD-10 Sephadex columns (Amersham Biosciences) were used to buffer-exchange the protein into 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. Purified protein was immediately flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C. The extent of chromophore maturation was determined after base denaturation (see below).The rate of chromophore formation was monitored as a function of pH by determining the increase in visible absorbance with time. Experiments were initiated by 10-fold dilution of the protein into 20 mm buffer (PIPES, HEPES, CHES, or CAPS), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The maturation rate for each variant was monitored at pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0 over a period of 10 h (E222Q, 0.1 mg/ml) or 2 months (R96M, 0.5 mg/ml) at 30 °C by incubation in a temperature-controlled chamber. The increase in absorbance of the chromophore anion (483 nm for E222Q) was plotted as a function of time and computer-fitted to a unimolecular reaction rate equation (Equation 1) using Kaleidagraph™, A=Amax−e(−kt)×Amax (Eq. 1) where A is the change in absorbance, Amax is the maximum absorbance for complete maturation, k = kobs = observed rate constant, and t is time. Direct monitoring of R96M chromophore formation via native-state absorbance at 384 nm (neutral state of the chromophore) was not feasible because of slow chromophore formation. Consequently, the percent chromophore was determined at each time point after base denaturation (see below). The extracted pseudo-first-order rate constants were plotted as a function of pH, and the data were computer-fitted to a rate expression for a base-catalyzed reaction with a rapid preliminary equilibrium to form the conjugate base of an ionizable group according to Equation 2, kobs=[k1×Ka]/[10(−pH)+Ka], (Eq. 2) where k1 is the pH-independent rate constant and Ka is the proton dissociation constant.Determination of Percent Chromophore via Base Denaturation—The concentration of purified protein was determined using the Advanced protein assay (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). An aliquot of the protein was then diluted 10-fold into 0.2 m NaOH, and the optical density at 448 nm (chromophore anion absorbance in the denatured state) was determined (22Ward W.W. DeLuca M.A. McElroy W.D. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence. Academic Press, New York1981: 235-242Crossref Google Scholar, 23Wachter R.M. Brett A.K. Heim R. Kallio K. Tsien R.Y. Boxer S.G. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9759-9765Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For EGFP, the extinction coefficient in our preparations was calculated to be ϵ448 = 33,500 (±800, n = 5), somewhat below the literature values of ϵ448 = 44,000 for wild-type GFP (22Ward W.W. DeLuca M.A. McElroy W.D. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence. Academic Press, New York1981: 235-242Crossref Google Scholar) and ϵ425 = 41,000 for a synthetic model compound (24Niwa H. Inouye S.

For each experiment, chromophore concentrations were determined in triplicate and compared with the protein concentration.Maturation Kinetics of EGFP Prepared from Inclusion Bodies—Inclusion bodies of EGFP were prepared and washed as described previously (12Rosenow M.A. Huffman H.A. Phail M.E. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4464-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and then suspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm EDTA, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Aliquots were thawed and centrifuged for 15 min at a relative centrifugal force of 20,800. The pellet was solubilized in 2 ml of urea buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 m urea), and the solution was clarified by centrifugation at a relative centrifugal force of 20,800 for 15 min, loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen), and washed with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, and 20 mm imidazole. Denatured EGFP was subsequently eluted by the addition of 100 mm imidazole to the wash buffer and incubated with 10 mm TCEP (tris-2-carboxyethyl phosphine) for 10 min to allow for the reduction of disulfide bonds. Protein folding was induced by rapid dilution. 45 μl of urea-solubilized EGFP was added to 860 μl of vigorously stirring folding buffer (333 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm EDTA, 1.1 mm TCEP, and 11 mm CHES (pH 9.0)) while maintaining the temperature at 30 °C by a circulating water bath. In some experiments, the pH was adjusted after 10 min by the addition of 200 μl of 500 mm buffer (PIPES (pH 6.0), HEPES (pH 7.0 or 8.0), CHES (pH 9.0), or CAPS (pH 10)). 100-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction at various time points and spin-filtered though a 0.1-μm centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Absorbance scans of the filtrate were collected from 600 to 240 nm, and the change in absorbance at 489 nm (native-state chromophore anion) was fitted to a unimolecular rate (Equation 1).Trypsinolysis and Peptide Purification—Proteolysis of EGFP and its variants was carried out according to the following protocol. 80 μg protein was denatured for 30 s in 200 μl of 6 m urea at 95 °C. The solution was cooled rapidly to 30 °C, and 800 μl of digest buffer containing trypsin was added immediately. Digest buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2. Trypsin (Sigma T-1426, TCPK-treated bovine) was added to the buffer immediately before use in a 1:2 (w:w) trypsin:GFP ratio. The digest was incubated for 3 min at 30 °C, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the sample was incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Waters 600 HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector) on a C18 analytical column (Vydac) using a water/acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide elution was monitored by absorbance at 220, 280, and 380 nm. Collected fractions were lyophilized immediately.MALDI Mass Spectrometry—Lyophilized peptides were resolubilized in 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1-μl peptide solution was mixed with 2 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix dissolved in the same solvent system. 1 μl of this preparation was dried on a stainless steel sample plate for data acquisition. Data were obtained using a Voyager DE STR mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser that produced 337-nm pulses of a 3-ns duration with a repetition rate of 20 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode using delayed extraction and the reflectron mode. Each mass spectrum was the average of at least 100 laser shots. Calibration was performed using CalMix 2 (Applied Biosystems) as an external standard, which consists of a mixture of polypeptides ranging in mass from 1,296 to 3,658 Da. Monoisotopic masses obtained for the calibration peptides were accurate within 0.1 Da over the mass range examined. For every EGFP variant assayed, all of the major 220-nm absorbing HPLC peaks were subjected to MALDI mass spectrometry. Reported masses are those that correlate with theoretically possible tryptic peptides containing residues 65–67 (Table II). The peptide identity was verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.Table IIPrinciple peaks observed in MALDI spectra of tryptic peptides containing residues 65–67Peptide sequenceTheoreticalObservedMass lossaAn observed mass loss of 20 Da is consistent with the peptide bearing a mature chromophore (cyclization, oxidation, and dehydration).

Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe highly conserved residues Arg96 and Glu222 are buried in the interior of the protein in close vicinity to the heterocyclic end of the chromophore. To examine the role of these residues in catalyzing chromophore biosynthesis, we have carried out site-directed mutagenesis to generate the single-substitution variants R96M and E222Q relative to EGFP. Each of these variants exhibits the two characteristic UV-visible absorbance bands associated with the mature GFP chromophore (Fig. 1A). The maximum around 400 nm is attributed to the neutral form of the chromophore, and the maximum around 480 nm is attributed to the anionic form (Scheme 1) (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

The chromophore pKa value in EGFP has been reported to be 6.0 (3Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4882) Google Scholar), whereas the pKa values for E222Q and R96M were estimated from the absorbance scans to be ∼5 and 8. The expression of R96M and E222Q yielded large quantities of highly soluble protein that acquired green color more slowly than the EGFP parent clone, allowing for kinetic measurement of chromophore biogenesis in the folded state of the protein. To a first approximation, the kinetic constants reported for these variants refer to the chemical self-modification steps that follow spontaneously upon attainment of the correct three-dimensional structure (Table I).Fig. 1A, UV-visible absorbance spectra of EGFP variants at pH 7.9.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that yielded protein pools in which only 24–28% population contained the mature chromophore. Aliquots were diluted into appropriate buffers between pH 6 and 10 and incubated at 30 °C. The increase in the 483-nm absorbance band was monitored with time, and the pseudo-first-order time constant τ was extracted from a curve-fit of the data to a first-order rate expression (Equation 1 and Fig. 1B).Each kinetic run was carried out in triplicate using independently prepared protein pools (Table I).

Here, we show that RKIP inhibits MAPK by regulating Raf-1 activation; specifically, RKIP acts subsequent to Raf-1 membrane recruitment, prevents association of Raf-1 and p21-activated kinase (PAK), and blocks phosphorylation of the Raf-1 kinase domain by PAK and Src family kinases. Mutation of the PAK and Src phosphorylation sites on Raf-1 to aspartate, a phosphate mimic, prevented RKIP association with or inhibition of Raf-1 signaling. Interestingly, although RKIP can interact with B-Raf, RKIP depletion had no effect on activation of B-Raf. Because c-Raf-1 and B-Raf are both required for maximal MAPK stimulation by epidermal growth factor in neuronal and epithelial cell lines, we determined whether RKIP significantly affects MAPK signaling. In fact, RKIP depletion increased not only the amplitude but also the sensitivity of MAPK and DNA synthesis to epidermal growth factor stimulation by up to an order of magnitude. These results indicate that selective modulation of c-Raf-1 but not B-Raf activation by RKIP can limit the dynamic range of the MAPK signaling response to growth factors and may play a critical role in growth and development.

The pathway consists of a MAPK kinase kinase that phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the TXY activation domain of MAPK (reviewed in Ref. 1Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). ERKs, the first characterized subfamily of MAPKs, are activated by growth factors and other stimuli via a cascade involving Ras, Raf kinase, and MEK. Activation of MAPK is under exquisite regulatory control, particularly at the level of Raf-1 activation. The N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 interacts with Ras, leading to membrane association, dephosphorylation at negative regulatory sites, conformational changes to expose the kinase domain, and subsequent phosphorylation at activating sites such as Ser338 and Tyr341 (reviewed in Ref. 2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Activation of B-Raf, another isoform of Raf that has been implicated in MAPK signaling, is less complex because a phosphomimetic residue has replaced the equivalent of the Tyr341 phosphorylation site of Raf-1. Recently, several inhibitory proteins have been identified that modulate the Ras/Raf/MAPK signal either directly or through feedback regulation, including Sprouty, Spred, and Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP; also known as phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) (3Sasaki A.

Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). RKIP is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved protein with homologs in Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster that display remarkable degrees of interspecies sequence and structural similarity (reviewed in Ref. 6Trakul N. Rosner M.R. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mammalian RKIP is distinct from other known proteins, and its function has remained largely enigmatic. A role for RKIP in signaling cascades was demonstrated when it was shown that RKIP binds to Raf-1 (7Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). However, RKIP also has a number of other reported functions, including inhibition of other kinases such as GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2) (8Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. Quitterer U. Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and upstream kinase activators of IκB kinase (9Yeung K.C. Rose D.W. Dhillon A.S. Yaros D. Gustafsson M. Chatterjee D. McFerran B. Wyche J. Kolch W. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7207-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recently, RKIP has been identified as a metastasis suppressor gene, and this function correlates with MAPK activity (10Fu Z. Smith P.C. Zhang L. Rubin M.A. Dunn R.L. Yao Z. Keller E.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 878-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Elucidating the mechanism of RKIP action is important both for a complete understanding of Raf regulation and for generating potential therapeutic reagents. Previous studies have suggested that RKIP binds to and acts downstream of Raf-1 by competitive interference with MEK binding to Raf-1 (11Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We previously identified a mechanism for overcoming inhibition of MAPK signaling by RKIP (12Corbit K.C. Trakul N. Eves E.M. Diaz B. Marshall M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13061-13068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C, activated by either phorbol esters or epidermal growth factor (EGF), phosphorylates RKIP at Ser153, and this phosphorylation causes the dissociation of RKIP from Raf-1 and the subsequent activation of the MAPK pathway. The goal of this study was to determine whether RKIP regulates Raf kinase directly. The work reported here identifies a new mechanism by which RKIP regulates MAPK signaling. We demonstrate that RKIP inhibits activation of Raf-1 by blocking phosphorylation of Raf-1 by p21-activated kinase (PAK) and Src family kinases. Furthermore, the regulation by RKIP is shown to be specific to Raf-1 and not B-Raf in at least two cell systems, and both the range and dose response of the MAPK signal and physiological outputs are affected by RKIP. These results reveal a Raf isoform-specific mechanism for modulation of the Raf/MAPK signaling cascade by RKIP. Cell Culture—Immortalized H19-7 cells were generated from embryonic rat hippocampal cells and grown as described previously (13Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). H19-7 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml G418 at 33 °C. Cells were serum-starved overnight at 39 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to treatment. HeLa, 293, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and serum-starved overnight at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to treatment. Stable Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Cell Lines—The following 19-bp regions of RKIP were used for the creation of shRNA retroviral vectors: human 5′-GGTGGCGTCCTTCCGTAAA-3′ and rat 5′-GGTGGAGTCCTTCCGCAAG-3′. Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pQY15 vector, a puromycin-based pMCSV vector containing the H1 RNA promoter. Vectors were then used for transient transfections or transfected into the Phoenix-Ampho packaging cell line for virus production. To make stable cell lines, H19-7, HeLa, 293, and 293T cells were exposed three to five times to virus-containing supernatant, and stable populations were obtained by selection and subsequent maintenance with 2 μg/ml puromycin. RKIP rescue cell lines were made by transducing stable H19-7-shRNA cell lines with retrovirus-containing pCLE-HA-RKIP. To assess RKIP depletion and MAPK activation, cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) or left untreated. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). 25 μg of cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose; and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-phospho-MEK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or anti-RKIP (12Corbit K.C.

Briefly, cells were serum-starved overnight and then either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Raf-1 and B-Raf were immunoprecipitated using anti-Raf-1 and anti-B-Raf polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. Immunoprecipitates were washed, and recombinant MEK, ERK, and myelin basic protein (MBP; Invitrogen) were sequentially added to the kinase reaction. MBP phosphorylation was quantified using a scintillation counter and normalized to the level of Raf-1 or B-Raf immunoprecipitated as assessed by Western blotting with either anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-B-Raf polyclonal antibody. To assess PAK activity, 293T cells were transfected with wild-type Myc-PAK or Myc-PAK-299R, a kinase-dead mutant, in either the presence or absence of transfected RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min or left untreated. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and Myc-PAK was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to a kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. Kinase assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and MBP phosphorylation was quantified by phosphorimaging and normalized to PAK levels by immunoblotting with anti-PAK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Raf Phosphorylation Assay—293T cells were transfected with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Raf-1 with or without constitutively activated PAK (Myc-PAK(T423E), a PAK with a mutation of threonine to glutamic acid at residue 423 in the activation loop) or v-Src along with increasing amounts of hemagglutinin (HA)-RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and then either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. GST-Raf-1 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the purified protein and the whole cell extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-GST (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-phospho-Ser338 Raf-1 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), anti-phospho-Ser259 Raf-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-phospho-Tyr340/Tyr341 Raf-1 (Sigma), anti-Myc, or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibody. Mutant Raf Assays—293T cells were transfected with either rat (control) or human RKIP shRNA along with a Raf kinase domain-estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein (ΔRaf-1-ER) and pBABE-PURO, pcDNA, or HA-RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin-containing medium for 24 h to obtain pure transfected populations. Cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min or with 1 μm estradiol for 1 h. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and 25 μg of whole cell extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. A vector expressing Myc-Raf-1-CAAX (where A is an aliphatic amino acid) (15Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) or Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D) (16Yip-Schneider M.T. Miao W. Lin A. Barnard D.S. Tzivion G. Marshall M.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was transfected into 293T cells along with HA-ERK2 or FLAG-RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose; and probed with anti-HA, anti-phospho-ERK, and RKIP antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation—293T cells were transfected with GST-Raf-1, GST-B-Raf, or Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D) with or without HA-RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and either left untreated or treated with 800 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 15 min. Cells were lysed in TAP lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. GST-Raf-1 and GST-B-Raf were purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D) was purified using anti-Myc antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Profound kit, Pierce). Purified complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose; and probed with anti-GST, anti-Myc, and anti-HA antibodies. 293T cells were also transfected with GST-Raf-1 and Myc-PAK either with or without HA-RKIP. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 min. GST-Raf was purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and purified complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-GST and anti-Myc antibodies. Whole cell extract (25 μg) was also resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-GST, anti-Myc, and anti-HA antibodies to assess the expression levels of the proteins. Reduction of Raf-1 or B-Raf by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)— siRNAs specific to rat or human Raf-1 and B-Raf were obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. and transfected at a concentration of 100 nm using either Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) or Nucleofector reagent V (Amaxa, Inc.), followed by electroporation. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved and then left unstimulated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. 25 μg of cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose; and probed with anti-α-tubulin, anti-Raf-1, anti-B-Raf, and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. α-Tubulin rather than ERK was used as a loading control for immunoblots to avoid background arising from stripping and reprobing the nitrocellulose blots. DNA Synthesis—H19-7 or 293T cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/ml onto polylysine-coated 96-well culture dishes and allowed to adhere and grow for 24 h. The cells were serum-deprived in medium containing 0.2% FBS for 3 days, and a bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation assay kit (Calbiochem) was used to detect DNA synthesis with the following modifications. Cells were treated with EGF (0–100 ng/ml) in serum-deprived medium containing a 1:2000 dilution of the bromodeoxyuridine label for 24 h. Cells were denatured, fixed, and blocked for 24 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The remainder of the protocol was as recommended by the manufacturer. To investigate the physiological role of RKIP, we generated cell lines with reduced levels of endogenous RKIP by RNA interference. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were stably transduced with either a retroviral vector or a species-specific shRNA vector for human or rat RKIP, and cells were stimulated with EGF to confirm that RKIP is an endogenous inhibitor of MAPK. Human RKIP shRNA suppressed RKIP levels to ∼10% of control levels (Fig. 1A), and suppression of RKIP by human RKIP shRNA caused a 2-fold potentiation of ERK activation in response to EGF, similar to previous results using antisense RKIP (7Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 12Corbit K.C.

To determine whether RKIP inhibits Raf-1 activation under physiological conditions, we assayed endogenous Raf-1 activity in EGF-stimulated 293 cells stably expressing a control or human RKIP shRNA vector. Depletion of RKIP in 293 cells by human RKIP shRNA caused a >2-fold increase in the activity of Raf-1 kinase compared with the control (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained for endogenous Raf-1 in other cell lines, including human HeLa cells (Fig. 1C) and rat H19-7 cells, as well as for exogenous Raf-1 (data not shown). These results indicate that RKIP regulates activation of Raf-1 kinase. Activation of Raf-1 is a complicated process involving membrane translocation, dephosphorylation at negative regulatory sites, and subsequent phosphorylation at activating sites in the kinase domain (2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). To address the first step at which RKIP could act, we expressed the Raf-1-CAAX mutant, which is constitutively targeted to the membrane. If RKIP inhibits membrane association, RKIP depletion would have no effect on the activity of Raf-1-CAAX. However, in 293T cells transfected with Myc-Raf-1-CAAX, HA-ERK2, and either a human RKIP shRNA or control vector, HA-ERK2 phosphorylation was still potentiated by RKIP depletion to a level comparable with that observed with wild-type Raf-1 (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that endogenous RKIP regulates Myc-Raf-1-CAAX despite the fact that membrane-associated Myc-Raf-1-CAAX is highly overexpressed and constitutively activated. These results demonstrate that RKIP functions subsequent to Raf-1 membrane association. Previous studies have shown that the Raf kinase domain is phosphorylated at Ser338 by PAK (17King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and at Tyr340 and Tyr341 by Src family kinases (18Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at both Ser338 and Tyr341 is required for Raf-1 activation by growth factors such as EGF (20Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because RKIP binds to subdomains I and II of the Raf-1 kinase domain, a region that includes Ser338, Tyr340, Tyr341 (11Yeung K. Janosch P. McFerran B. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3079-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we determined whether RKIP might prevent Raf-1 activation by sterically blocking accessibility of the serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites to their respective kinases. Initially, rat neuronal H19-7 cells were cotransfected with GST-Raf-1 and a control vector, HA-RKIP, or HA-RKIP(S153V). Similar to endogenous Raf-1, GST-Raf-1 was phosphorylated at Ser338 following EGF treatment, but high expression of either wild-type HA-RKIP or the S153V mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, inhibited this induction (Fig. 2A). Conversely, when 293 cells stably expressing control or human RKIP shRNA were stimulated with EGF, RKIP depletion caused an increase in phosphorylation of endogenous Raf-1 at Ser338 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with exogenously expressed Raf-1; however, Tyr340/Tyr341 phosphorylation could not be detected due to limitations in antibody sensitivity (data not shown). In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser259, which has been reported to negatively regulate Raf activity (2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), was unchanged by RKIP expression. These results indicate that RKIP modulates phosphorylation of endogenous Raf-1 at Ser338 by PAK. To determine whether RKIP binding to Raf-1 directly blocks the ability of PAK to bind and phosphorylate Raf-1, we assessed the effect of RKIP on constitutively activated PAK in the absence of a growth factor stimulus. In serum-starved 293T cells cotransfected with constitutively activated Myc-PAK and GST-Raf-1, Myc-PAK was able to phosphorylate GST-Raf-1 at Ser338; however, expression of HA-RKIP inhibited this phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). To determine whether RKIP affects activation of PAK directly, we examined the kinase activity of Myc-tagged wild-type or kinase-dead PAK transfected into 293T cells in the presence or absence of RKIP. RKIP overexpression had no effect on PAK kinase activity (Fig. 2D). To test the alternative possibility that RKIP prevents PAK association with Raf-1, 293T cells transfected with Myc-PAK and GST-Raf-1 were incubated in the presence or absence of EGF. PAK association with Raf-1 was enhanced by EGF, but high expression of wild-type HA-RKIP or the RKIP(S153V) mutant inhibited PAK binding to Raf-1 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that RKIP blocks PAK association with and subsequent phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338. If RKIP sterically blocks PAK access to Raf-1, then it might similarly block Src because the PAK (Ser338) and Src (Tyr341) phosphorylation sites are proximal. We therefore determined whether RKIP expression blocks Raf phosphorylation by constitutively activated Src in the absence of a growth factor stimulus. In serum-starved 293T cells cotransfected with constitutively activated v-Src and GST-Raf-1, phosphorylation at Tyr341 by Src was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Tyr341 Raf-1 antibody. As observed with PAK phosphorylation at Ser338, expression of HA-RKIP inhibited this phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). If RKIP inhibits Raf signaling by preventing phosphorylation at Ser338, Tyr340, and Tyr341, then Raf-1 that is mutated at these sites to phosphomimetic residues such as aspartate should be resistant to inhibition by RKIP. To test this possibility, 293T cells were cotransfected with Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D), HA-ERK2, and either a human RKIP shRNA or control vector (Fig. 3A). As predicted by this model, depletion of RKIP did not alter MAPK activation. Taken together, these results indicate that RKIP inhibits Raf-1 activation by preventing phosphorylation at critical residues within Raf-1 that are targets of PAK and Src family kinases. Because RKIP association with Raf-1 blocks access of the Ser338/Tyr341 domain to activating kinases, prior phosphorylation at these sites might prevent RKIP binding. To determine whether RKIP stably associates with activated Raf-1, we used the Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D) phosphomimetic mutant, which is constitutively activated in the absence of stimuli. This strategy avoids the problem of RKIP phosphorylation and inactivation. Thus, 293T cells were transfected with Myc-Raf-1(S338D/Y340D/Y341D) and HA-RKIP and then serum-starved or stimulated with TPA. In contrast to unstimulated Raf-1 or B-Raf (Fig. 3D), no HA-RKIP could be detected following immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3B). Thus, mutations that mimic constitutive phosphorylation at the key Ser338 and Tyr340/Tyr341 activation sites lower RKIP affinity for Raf-1. If RKIP does not bind effectively to activated Raf-1, then RKIP depletion should not significantly affect signaling to MAPK downstream of activated Raf. Because RKIP can bind to the kinase domain of Raf, we tested this possibility further using an inducibly activated Raf protein consisting of ΔRaf-1-ER (19Kuo W-L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ΔRaf-1-ER was expressed in human 293T cells stably transfected with either rat (control) or human RKIP shRNA. RKIP depletion did not change ERK phosphorylation by estradiol-stimulated ΔRaf-1-ER, whereas endogenous Raf-1 activation was enhanced in response to EGF in the same cells (Fig. 3C). This lack of response is not due simply to overexpression of ΔRaf-1-ER because overexpressed Raf-1-CAAX was sensitive to RKIP regulation (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with the model that RKIP inhibits Raf-1 activation. Because B-Raf is phosphorylated at Ser445, a site that corresponds to Ser338 in Raf-1 (20Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), we also determined whether RKIP regulates activation of the B-Raf kinase under physiological conditions. Initially, we investigated whether RKIP associates in a complex with B-Raf. Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with HA-RKIP and either GST-Raf-1 or GST-B-Raf and then serum-starved or treated with TPA. Endogenous B-Raf or Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RKIP antibody. The results clearly show that RKIP could bind to B-Raf in cells and was dissociated upon activation of protein kinase C (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the interaction of B-Raf with RKIP appears to be more robust than that of Raf-1 with RKIP. If RKIP binding inhibits B-Raf activation, then RKIP depletion should result in further B-Raf activation by EGF. To address this question, we determined whether there is a change in the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated B-Raf from either wild-type or RKIP-depleted 293T cells stimulated with EGF. Surprisingly, the results show that RKIP depletion had no effect on EGF-stimulated B-Raf kinase activity in conditionally immortalized rat hippocampal H19-7 cells (Fig. 4A). To ensure that this result is not just an artifact of one cell line or species, we performed comparable experiments using the human 293T cell line. As shown in Fig. 4B, EGF-stimulated B-Raf activity was the same independent of RKIP depletion. These results indicate that, in the same cells, RKIP functions as an inhibitor of Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) activation. Because both Raf-1 and B-Raf are general mediators of MAPK cascades, we determined the relative contribution of each of these Raf isoforms to EGF signaling in both human epithelial 293T and rat hippocampal H19-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, transfection of siRNA for rat Raf-1 into H19-7 cells resulted in the selective depletion of Raf-1 and a >60% reduction in the EGF-stimulated MAPK activity of the cells. Similarly, transfection of siRNA for rat B-Raf caused B-Raf depletion and an almost 90% decrease in EGF-stimulated MAPK activity (Fig. 4C). Comparable results were obtained when siRNAs for human B-Raf and Raf-1 were transfected into 293T cells (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). These results indicate that both Raf-1 and B-Raf are required for maximal EGF stimulation of MAPK in these two different cell lines. Because RKIP selectively regulates Raf-1 activation and Raf-1 is a key mediator of the MAPK cascade, we explored more extensively the effect of RKIP on the kinetics of EGF signaling. Signaling pathways can be modulated by regulating the amplitude, duration, and/or sensitivity of the resultant signal. To determine the effect of RKIP, we monitored the effect of"

Here we report the identification and characterization of acetylation of lysine 56 within the core domain of histone H3. In the crystal structure of the nucleosome, lysine 56 contacts DNA. Phenotypic analysis suggests that lysine 56 is critical for histone function and that it modulates formamide resistance, ultraviolet radiation sensitivity, and sensitivity to hydroxyurea. We show that the acetylated form of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56) is present during interphase, metaphase, and S phase.

In eukaryotes, genetic information is packed in a higher order structure of histones and genomic DNA that is called chromatin. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome and consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped about twice around a histone octamer that contain a histone H3/H4 tetramer and two H2A/H2B dimers (1White C.L.

Post-translational modifications of the histone tails are linked to different states of chromatin that regulate processes like transcription, DNA repair, replication, and recombination (3Margueron R.

Metylation status of lysines in the amino-terminal tail, and the histone-fold domain of histone H3 plays an important role in the establishment of the active (and/or silenced) state of chromatin (5Jenuwein T.

In contrast, not much is known about histone core domain modifications and their functions. Recently, acetylation of histone H4 lysine 91 was shown to be important for chromatin assembly (9Ye J.

Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Media—A list of the strains we employed is provided as supplemental Table 1. Plasmid [pHHT2-HIS3] was made by insertion of a 1010-base pair HindIII-SnaBI DNA fragment excised from [pMR366-URA3-HHT2] (13Kruger W. Peterson C.L. Sil A. Coburn C. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2770-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), encompassing the HHT2 open reading frame plus 408 base pairs upstream and 210 base pairs downstream DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis on [pHHT2-HIS3] was confirmed by sequencing the entire gene. Where indicated, compounds were added to the following final concentrations; 0.2% (w/v) 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA; ICN Biochemicals), 100 mm hydroxyurea (HU; Sigma), 0.01% (v/v) methyl methanesulfonate (Acros Organics), 3% (v/v) formamide (Fluka Biochemica), 15 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma). A Stratagene UV Stratalinker was used to score sensitivity to UV irradiation. Antiserum against Acetylated Histone H3 lysine 56 (H3-K56)—A polyclonal H3-K56[Ac] serum was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the RRFQK[Ac]STELLIRKL synthetic peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Histone Purification—Histones were purified according to Edmondson et al. (14Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) except that zymolyase (Seikagaku Corp. catalog no. 120493) was used at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed according to standard procedures (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, Hoboken, NJ2003Google Scholar). Purified histones were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with antibodies either against acetylated histone H3-K56 (1:300 dilution in TBST), diacetyl histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology catalog number 06-599, 1:1000), acetylated histone H3-K18 (Abcam catalog number ab1191, 1:1000), tetra-acetyl histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology catalog number 06-866, 1:1000), dimethyl histone H3-K4 (Abcam catalog number ab7766, 1:1000), trimethyl histone H3-K4 (Abcam catalog number ab8580, 1:1000), or against histone H3 (Abcam catalog number ab1791, 1:1000). Western blots were developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cellular DNA content was determined as described (16Foss E.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 567-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 1 μm sytox green (Molecular Probes) and a BD Biosciences calibur fluorescence activated cell sorter. Purification of Active HAT Fractions—Histone acetyltransferase activity was purified as described previously (17Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods (Orlando). 1998; 15: 315-321Google Scholar). Whole-cell extract that was prepared from a 10-liter yeast culture was loaded onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), eluted with 0.3 m imidazole buffer, and then applied to a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). H3-K56 HAT activity eluted at 200 mm NaCl. Identification of a Novel Histone Modification—Acetylation of H3-K56, a novel core domain histone H3 modification in S. cerevisiae was identified multiple times by mass spectrometry analysis of histone preparations (data not shown). Zhang et al. (18Zhang L. Eugeni E.E. Parthun M.R. Freitas M.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2003; 112: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) did not detect acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 using calf thymus histones, although evidence for methylation of arginine 52 or 53, or of lysine 56, of histone H3 was obtained. Crystal structure analysis of the nucleosome (1White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) revealed that H3-K56 is located on a side of the H3/H4 tetramer facing DNA (Fig. 1A). To characterize this new modification, we raised an antibody against a synthetic peptide carrying acetylated H3-K56. The antibody recognizes a protein band that comigrates with purified histone H3 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). It does not recognize recombinant yeast histone H3 expressed in Escherichia coli (rH3) (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). However, the antiserum does recognize rH3 after an in vitro HAT reaction using active yeast extract (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Phenylalanine at position 54 of histone H3 is not conserved in other species (Fig. 1B), therefore the antiserum is specific for the acetylated form of S. cerevisiae histone H3-K56, and it does not recognize mammalian histone H3 (data not shown). Analysis of the Mutant hht2 Alleles—To further validate that the antibody specifically recognizes acetylated H3-K56, and to gain insight into the possible function(s) of this modification, we constructed budding yeast strains that expressed wild type and mutant alleles of HHT2 from low copy number plasmids as sole source of histone H3. The effect on viability of point mutations at position 56 was assayed in a yeast strain, YN1375, lacking both chromosomal copies of H3. This strain harbored wild type HHT2 on a URA3 plasmid. Hence, medium containing 5-FOA did not permit growth of YN1375 (Fig. 2A). The single amino acid substitutions of histone H3 lysine 56 to alanine (H3-K56A) or to arginine (H3-K56R) borne by the HIS3 plasmid sustained viability of YN1375 on 5-FOA plates, indicating functionality (Fig. 2A). In contrast histone H3 bearing a glutamate at position 56 (H3-K56E) could not support cell proliferation (Fig. 2A). Both H3-K56A and H3-K56R substitutions disrupted the epitope as such that H3-K56 [acetyl] antibody recognition of the mutant H3 histones was abolished (Fig. 2B, panel 2). To exclude the possibility that the level of histone H3 was affected in the mutants we used a commercial antibody that recognizes another epitope within the core domain of histone H3. As shown in Fig. 2B (panel 1), the total amount of histone H3 is similar in all strains. These results indicate that the antiserum we raised is highly specific for acetylated H3-K56. Interplay with Other Histone Modifications—A particular modification that is present on a histone residue may coexists with, or be required for, modifications at other residues (3Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysines that are located at the N-terminal tail of histones H3 and H4 are associated with transcription activation (4Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7627) Google Scholar). We sought to find out whether the acetylation of H3-K56 was a determinant of known histone tail modifications. To this end, we purified histones from strains expressing H3-K56A (YN1392) or H3-K56R (YN1393) as a sole source of histone H3. Global acetylation levels of histone H3 and histone H4 N-terminal tails were not affected in the hht2-K56A and hht2-K56R mutants (Fig. 2B, panels 3–5). The levels of di- and trimetylation of histone H3-K4 were not different either (Fig. 2A, panels 6 and 7). These findings suggest that H3-K56 acetylation is not required for the establishment and/or the maintenance of these epigenetic marks at the genome wide level. We note that this does not exclude the possibility that acetylation of H3-K56 might influence the levels of histone modifications at specific loci. Phenotype Analysis of the hht2-K56A and hht2-K56R Alleles—To better understand the function of H3-K56 acetylation, we performed a phenotypic analysis on the hht2-K56A and hht2-K56R alleles. Single amino acid substitution of a lysine to an arginine (hht2-K56R) is predicted to cause no major changes within the structure of the H3/H4 tetramer. Because of the position of the residue (Fig. 1A); however, we expect to retain ionic interactions between histone H3 and DNA, which would promote a more stable chromatin template. Alanine on the other hand is a smaller amino acid than lysine and is not charged. Therefore substitution to an alanine (hht2-K56A) is expected to weaken the interactions between histone H3 and DNA, thereby destabilizing the nucleosome and creating a more flexible environment for chromatin remodelers and transcription associated regulatory protein complexes. Temperature sensitivity is a common yeast phenotype (19Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the hht2-K56A allele conferred a growth advantage to the cells at 37 °C relative to the HHT2 and the hht2-K56R alleles (Fig. 2C, first row). It has been reported that 30% of formamide-sensitive strains also display temperature sensitivity (19Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We therefore also tested formamide sensitivity. Not much is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin this phenotype, although it likely reflects hydrogen bridge destabilization. The hht2-K56A allele also displayed a growth advantage on YEPD containing 3% formamide (Fig. 2C, second row), whereas yeast strains carrying either the wild type or the hht2-K56R alleles of histone H3 were clearly defective for growth on this medium. This would suggest that suppression of the lethality induced by formamide is not a result of the loss of acetylation at lysine 56 but that it is associated with a structural advantage conferred by the alanine substitution onto the nucleosome. HU is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase; hence exposure to HU causes yeast cells to arrest in S phase of the cell cycle. Growth of both mutant strains was clearly retarded on YEPD + HU relative to the wild type strain, and the effect of the hht2-K56R allele was much more pronounced (Fig. 2C, second row). The same results were obtained when methyl methanesulfonate was used instead of HU (Refs. 16Foss E.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 567-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 19Hampsey M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1099-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar; Fig. 2C, second row). This phenotype implies a possible role of H3-K56 acetylation in DNA replication-coupled repair and/or progression through the S phase of the cell cycle. Sensitivity to UV irradiation indicates defects in DNA damage repair responses. Mutants bearing either hht2-K56A or hht2-K56R alleles of histone H3 showed a significant increase of survival when exposed to 5 joules/m2 of UV irradiation (Fig. 2C, first row). We envisage two explanations for this phenotype; either a lethal DNA damage-induced cell cycle block is circumvented, or the repair pathway is constitutively on in the mutant strains. This could be due to a direct involvement of H3-K56 acetylation in repair process or indirectly via an altered cellular transcription related profile. Cell Cycle Regulation of H3-K56 Acetylation—The fact that the mutant hht2-K56A and hht2-K56R alleles of histone H3 showed DNA damage repair and replication-related phenotypes may be taken to indicate that H3-K56 acetylation takes place at a defined stage of the cell cycle. To examine this possibility, we assayed for the presence of H3-K56 acetylation in G1-, S-, and G2/M phase-arrested S. cerevisiae (Fig. 3A). This revealed that H3-K56 acetylation is present in G1, S-phase, and G2/M (Fig. 3B). Screen for the H3-K56 Acetyltransferase—To identify the HAT responsible for this novel histone modification, we performed a screen with deletion strains of the major putative HATs (supplemental Table 1). There are two classes of HATs: the A-type HATs are located in the nucleus and acetylate nucleosomal histones, and the B-type HATs on the other hand are located in the cytoplasm and acetylate free histones (6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Because H3-K56 is likely to bind DNA (Fig. 1A), we expect that the acetylation occurs on free histone H3. To be accurate, however, we included both classes in our experiments (supplemental Table 2). Esa1p and Ctf7p are essential acetyltransferases (20Skibbens R.V. Laura B. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Eisen A.

For this reason we used strains that express temperature-sensitive alleles of ESA1 and CTF7 (supplemental Tables 1 and 2). The results presented in Fig. 4 show that all the HAT deletion strains and the cells harboring mutant alleles of ESA1 and CTF7 retained the H3-K56 acetylation. This suggests either that an as yet unidentified HAT exists or that multiple HATs can acetylate H3-K56. The identification and genetic characterization of H3-K56 acetylation suggests physiological roles for this histone modification in S. cerevisiae. Reversal of the charge at this position (H3-K56E) is lethal (Fig. 2A). This indicates that lysine 56 plays a pivotal role in chromatin structure. The fact that this residue is acetylated underscores the notion that histone core domain residues have biological functions that extend beyond a simple structural role and contribute to regulate chromatin remodeling (22Xu F.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading cause of death from asingle bacterial pathogen, is restrained from proliferation in most infectedindividuals by the oxidative and nitrosative stress imposed by the immuneresponse (1Nathan C.

The pathogen needs tocompensate the catalase-peroxidase deficiency by alternative peroxidasesystems to remain virulent, and several lines of evidence point to the alkylhydroperoxidase AhpC (MtAhpC) as a key element in fulfilling that role. Thus,enhanced expression of MtAhpC is observed both in INH-resistant KatG-deficientstrains (10Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry III, C.E. Stover C.K.

Furthermore, thesaprophytic Mycobacterium smegmatis, naturally insensitive to INH,shows a dramatic increase of INH susceptibility after insertional inactivationof the ahpC gene(11Wilson M. DeRisi J.

MtAhpC is a member of a large family of peroxidases, the peroxiredoxins,found in most living organisms. Peroxiredoxins are responsible for theantioxidant defense in bacteria, yeast, and trypanosomatids; they participatein balancing hydroperoxide production during photosynthesis in plants andappear to control cytokine-induced peroxide levels that mediate signaltransduction in mammalian cells (see Refs.12Hofmann B.

Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Inmycobacteria, AhpC can not only detoxify hydroperoxides but also affordsprotection to cells against reactive nitrogen intermediates(14Chen L. Xie Q. Nathan C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 795-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,15Master S.S. Springer B. Sander P. Boettger E.C. Deretic V. Timmins G.S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3139-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MtAhpC specificallycatalyzes the conversion of peroxynitrite (OONO-) to nitrite fastenough to avoid the spontaneous decomposition of the former into thedeleterious nitrogen dioxide and hydroxyl radicals(16Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The NADH-dependentperoxidase and peroxynitrite reductase system of M. tuberculosisinvolves MtAhpC as the foremost element of a chain that also includes theMtAhpC-reducing protein, AhpD, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, Lpd, anddihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase, SucB(17Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), although alternativethioredoxin-mediated pathways including MtAhpC have also been reported(18Jaeger T. Budde H. Flohé L. Menge U. Singh M. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.Biophys. 2004; 432: 182-191Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins (EC 1.11.1.15) use redox-active cysteine residues to reducetheir substrates and can be classified into three classes (typical 2-Cys,atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys enzymes) based on the number and the sequencepositions of cysteinyl residues involved in catalysis(13Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). In all three classes,the first step of the peroxidase reaction involves a conserved N-terminalcysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine), which attacks the peroxide/peroxynitritesubstrate and is oxidized to a cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH). Typical 2-Cysperoxiredoxins like MtAhpC are obligate homodimers in which the second(C-terminal) cysteine from one subunit acts as the resolving cysteine toattack the peroxidatic cysteine sulfenic acid located in the other subunit.The ensuing condensation reaction results in the formation of a stableintersubunit disulfide bond, which is then reduced by one of severalcell-specific disulfide oxidoreductases, completing the catalytic cycle. Although MtAhpC is usually considered a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, itdiffers in a number of important features from other members of the family.First, MtAhpC has three (rather than two) cysteine residues directly involvedin catalysis (19Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), theconserved peroxidatic cysteine Cys61, the putative resolvingcysteine Cys174, and a third cysteine, Cys176, whosecatalytic role is unclear (20Chauhan R. Mande S.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 255-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Koshkin A. Knudsen G.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Second, it remained anenigma how MtAhpC is supplied with reduction equivalents because thethioredoxin system that reduces peroxiredoxins in eukaryoticH2O2 metabolism was reported to be inactive as areductant of MtAhpC (19Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), andthere is no homologue in the mycobacterial genome of the AhpF flavoproteinknown to reduce AhpC in Salmonella typhimurium(22Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Instead, MtAhpC isreduced by a novel atypical system involving AhpD(17Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), a thioredoxin-likeprotein that is only found in a restricted number of organisms. Here, we report the 2.4-Å structure of the C176S point mutant ofMtAhpC trapped in an intermediate state of its catalytic cycle. The functionaldimer of MtAhpCC176S has a structure similar to those of other2-Cys peroxiredoxins. However, although the oxidized protein behaves as adimer in solution, it crystallized in an oligomeric (12-mer) form resemblingthe decameric forms observed for other peroxiredoxins(12Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar,13Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). In agreement withavailable mutagenesis data, the structure suggests a model for the peroxidasereaction that can explain the involvement of the three cysteine residues incatalysis. To facilitate the formation of theCys61–Cys174 disulfide bond, the entireα-helix containing the peroxidatic cysteine is seen to undergo arigid-body displacement instead of the partial helical unwinding observed inthe disulfide-bonded forms of other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins(13Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). This unusual movementgenerates a large internal cavity, which encloses the reaction center andmight provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors withpotential therapeutic applications. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR amplification ofthe ahpC gene was performed using primers ahpC-2726FCCCGGTCTCCCATGCCACTGCTAACCATT and ahpC-2727RTTCCCGGCCATGGGAGATCCCGGTT into which a BsaI site or a NcoI site wereintroduced. After digestion of the PCR product with BsaI and NcoI, thefragment was ligated into NcoI-digested pET16b (Novagen), electroporated intoXL2 blue cells, and plated out on ampicillin-containing plates (100 μg/ml).Plasmid DNA was prepared from several colonies using standard methods, andcorrect insertion of the fragment into the vector was controlled bysequencing. Overexpression of MtAhpC was then performed in strain BL21. The ahpC-containing pET16b plasmid was then subjected tomutagenesis using the chameleon kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer'sinstructions to produce a single mutant (C176S) and a double mutant(C174S,C176S) of MtAhpC. To achieve the replacement of selected bases, theprimer SP2, GACTTGGTTGACGCGTCACCAGTCAC, was used together with either theprimer GCGCCAGTTGCTTGCGCACAGCT to produce the single Cys mutant or with theprimer GCCAGTTGCTTGCGCTCAGCTCGTC to produce the double mutant. Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type MtAhpC and themutants MtAhpCC176S and MtAhpCC174S,C176S were producedfollowing a similar protocol. Escherichia coli BL21 cells werecultured in ampicillin-supplemented LB medium, induced at mid-log phase with 1mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grownovernight at 20 °C. The culture was harvested by centrifugation andresuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH7.5, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells weredisrupted in a French press and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for30 min. The supernatant was treated with streptomycin sulfate (w/w ratio of1/1), gently stirred for 45 min at 4 °C, and fractionated with ammoniumsulfate at 50 and 70% saturation. The final precipitate was dissolved,dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and loaded ontoa DEAE column equilibrated with the same buffer. The purified protein waseluted at 0.1 m potassium chloride and concentrated to 16 mg/ml byultrafiltration in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for use incrystallization assays. For MtAhpCC176S, the selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled proteinwas expressed in the non-methionine auxotroph E. coli strainBL21(DE3) following protocols described previously(23Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells werecultured in M9 minimal medium containing glucose (0.4% w/v) and ampicillin(100 mg/liter). Amino acids lysine, threonine, and phenylalanine (100mg/liter), leucine, isoleucine, and valine (50 mg/liter) together with SeMet(50 mg/liter) were added as solids 30 min before induction. AhpC expressionwas induced at mid-log phase with 1 mm isopropyl1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cell growth was continuedovernight at 20 °C. The SeMet-labeled protein was purified following thesame protocol described above for non-labeled proteins, and SeMetincorporation was confirmed by mass spectrometry (not shown). Analytical gel filtration experiments were carried out on a SMART highpressure liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) using aSuperdex-200 column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH7.0, 100 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 2%glycerol. The proteins were eluted under reducing (10 mmdithiothreitol) or non-reducing conditions using a flow rate of 40 μl/minand were monitored at 280 nm. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trialswere performed at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Thebest crystals of MtAhpCC176S (either unlabeled or SeMet-labeledprotein) reached a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm and were obtainedfrom drops made of 2–4 μl of protein solution (16 mg/ml) mixed withan equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodiumcitrate, pH 6.0, 16% ammonium sulfate. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogenin the presence of a cryoprotectant solution (the same mother liquor with 30%glycerol) for data collection. Extensive crystallization assays were alsocarried out with wild-type AhpC and the double mutantAhpCC174S,C176S, but these attempts systematically resulted inmicrocrystals unsuitable for x-ray diffraction studies. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at 110°K using synchrotronradiation (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Formultiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing (MAD), four data sets of theSeMet-labeled protein were collected at 2.5 Å resolution on the ID29beamline at different wavelengths (peak, inflection point, and two remotewavelengths) derived from a scan of the selenium K absorption edge. Usinganother crystal, a separate, highly redundant data set was collected at asingle wavelength corresponding to the largest value for the anomalousdifference f″.

The three selenium sites (one per monomer)were found by Patterson methods and their atomic positions,B-factors, and occupancies refined with the program SHARP(25Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.D. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Despite the low contentof anomalous scatterers (one selenium atom in 195 protein residues),experimental phases could be calculated to 2.6-Å resolution with anoverall figure-of-merit of 0.65 (0.81 after density modification) and resultedin a readily interpretable electron density map. Chain tracing was carried out with the program O(26Jones T.A. Zhou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Most α-helices andall β-sheets were well defined in density, and a total of 137 residues ineach of the three subunits could be independently modeled using the positionsof the anomalous scatterers and large aromatic residues as markers. However,the C-terminal region including the resolving cysteine Cys174, twoprotein loops, and the α-helix containing the peroxidatic cysteineCys61 were poorly defined in the experimental map, and thesituation did not improve significantly after initial refinement cycles withthe program REFMAC (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) fromthe CCP4 package. At this stage, we decided to collect a highly redundant data set fromanother SeMet-labeled crystal at a single wavelength corresponding to thef″ peak (TableI). After SHARP phasing, experimental phases were calculated to2.4-Å resolution with an overall figure-of-merit of 0.50 and 0.81 beforeand after density modification, respectively, and the resulting electrondensity map unambiguously showed a disulfide bridge involving the peroxidaticcysteine from one of the monomers (Fig.1). Crystallographic refinement was carried out against the SADdata set at 2.4-Å resolution using the program REFMAC, alternating withvisual inspection of the electron density maps and model rebuilding with theprogram O. During the final cycles water molecules were introduced using theprogram ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

The quality of theelectron density allowed modeling of amino acid residues 2–170 (of 195)in monomers A and C and amino acid residues 2 to 179 in monomer B. Theα-helix that follows the N-terminal peroxidatic cysteineCys61 is partially disordered in monomers B and C, and in all threemonomers the loop formed by residues 21–31 is largely exposed to solventand poorly defined in the electron density map. The final model displays agood overall stereochemistry. As defined by the program PROCHECK(29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), all non-glycine andnon-proline residues display main-chain dihedral angles that fall within themost favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The crystal packing consists of successive layers of dodecamers in the(x,y) plane centered on the crystallographic 6-fold axis. Two of thethree independent monomers (A and B, at z = 1/3) are associated intoa non-crystallographic dimer, whereas the third monomer (at z = 0)forms a crystallographic dimer. The overall root mean square deviations for168 Cα positions between crystallographically independent monomers are0.38 Å (A and B), 0.59 Å (A–C), and 0.41 Å (B and C).The two non-equivalent dodecamers (at z = 0 and z = 1/3) arerelated to each other by a rotation of 11° around the crystallographicz-axis, which might explain the difficulties encountered indetermining this crystal structure using molecular replacement methods. Solution Studies—The amino acid sequence of MtAhpC containsthree cysteines at positions 61, 174, and 176, all of which are directlyinvolved in catalysis (19Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,20Chauhan R. Mande S.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 255-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine,Cys61, is strictly conserved in all peroxiredoxins and serves asthe peroxidatic cysteine to carry out the initial attack on the peroxidesubstrates, whereas Cys174 was also shown to be crucial forcatalysis and probably acts as the resolving cysteine. For our structuralstudies, we therefore produced wild-type MtAhpC, the single point mutantMtAhpCC176S that might retain the mode of action of 2-Cysperoxiredoxins, and the double mutant MtAhpCC174S,C176S(maintaining only the critical peroxidatic cysteine) as recombinant proteinsin E. coli. SDS-PAGE experiments of these proteins under reducing andnon-reducing conditions revealed the role of disulfide bonds in proteinaggregation (Fig. 2A).In our hands, wild-type MtAhpC appeared as multiple bands in SDS-PAGE undernon-reducing conditions, different from what has been observed by otherauthors (19Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,20Chauhan R. Mande S.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 255-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein migratedprimarily as a dimer under non-reducing conditions, indicating the formationof an intersubunit disulfide bridge (probably between Cys61 andCys174 or Cys176). However, the presence of higheroligomers indicated that the third cysteine is highly reactive and readilyinvolved in nonspecific intermolecular disulfide bonds. On the other hand, thedouble mutant MtAhpCC174S,C176S showed the presence of covalentdimers that disappeared under reducing conditions, implying thatCys61 is involved in nonspecific intermolecular disulfide bridges.Instead, the mutant MtAhpCC176S migrated as a single molecularspecies corresponding to the dimeric form under non-reducing conditions, thusdemonstrating that the protein is fully oxidized under the experimentalconditions used and making this mutant the best candidate for crystallizationstudies. In agreement with the above results, size exclusion chromatography showedsignificant differences between the elution profiles of wild-type MtAhpC andthe single point mutant MtAhpCC176S under non-reducing and reducingconditions. Wild-type MtAhpC behaves as a heterogeneous mixture of oligomersunder non-reducing conditions, whereas in the presence of 10 mmdithiothreitol the elution profile changes into a homogeneous speciescorresponding to a 10- or 12-mer (data not shown). In contrast,MtAhpCC176S elutes as a single oligomeric species under bothreducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig.2B). In its oxidized state, the protein behaves as adimer, which oligomerizes to form a 10- or 12-mer upon the addition of 10mm dithiothreitol. These experiments demonstrate that the reducedstate of the protein is associated with a higher oligomeric form, a hypothesisput forward by Alphey et al.(30Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) from their structuralstudies of the reduced tryparedoxin peroxidase TryP from Crithidiafasciculata and now verified for other members of this family(13Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). The Crystal Structure of MtAhpC—The structure ofMtAhpCC176S in its oxidized state was determined by a MADexperiment at four different wavelengths(Table I) and refined to afinal R-factor of 0.195 (Rfree = 0.236)(Table II). In the crystal,MtAhpCC176S associates to form a ring-shaped 12-mer with an outerdiameter of 140 Å and an inner diameter of 70 Å(Fig. 3A). Formationof a 12-mer was unexpected for two reasons: first, because all peroxiredoxinsstructurally characterized to date as oligomers had revealed a decameric form,and second, because the oxidized protein behaves as a dimer in solution(Fig. 2B). This lastobservation implies that the protein is trapped in an intermediate state ofits catalytic cycle, probably stabilized by crystal contacts, in which thecondensation reaction has taken place but the oligomeric form has not yetdisassembled into the functional dimer. A similar intermediate has beenobserved previously for S. typhimurium AhpC (StAhpC)(31Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), where it was alsoproposed that crystal packing forces help to stabilize the oligomeric form ofthe protein. More puzzling is the observation that MtAhpC consists of a hexamer ofdimers, rather than the expected pentamer of dimers observed in otherhomologues such as TryP (30Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar),StAhpC (31Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A.

Indeed, several lines ofevidence tend to indicate that formation of 10-mers may be a general propertyof 2-Cys peroxiredoxins in which the oligomeric form is associated with thereduce"
https://openalex.org/W2007137936,"The explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) is thought to produce emission from two physical processes: the central engine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internal shocking, and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the external environment produces long-wavelength afterglows. Although observations of afterglows continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the origin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. Only one concurrent visible-light transient has been found and it was associated with emission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared emission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of GRB 041219a (ref. 8). We acquired 21 images during the active phase of the burst, yielding early multi-colour observations. Our analysis of the initial infrared pulse suggests an origin consistent with internal shocks."

Although a human disease has not yet been genetically linked to a mutation in RECQ1, the prominent roles of RecQ helicases in the maintenance of genome stability suggest that RECQ1 helicase is likely to be important in vivo.To acquire a better understanding of RECQ1 cellular and molecular functions, we have investigated its protein interactions. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we have identified several DNA repair factors that are associated with RECQ1 in vivo. Direct physical interaction of these repair factors with RECQ1 was confirmed with purified recombinant proteins. Importantly, RECQ1 stimulates the incision activity of human exonuclease 1 and the mismatch repair recognition complex MSH2/6 stimulates RECQ1 helicase activity. These protein interactions suggest a role of RECQ1 in a pathway involving mismatch repair factors.

These protein interactions suggest a role of RECQ1 in a pathway involving mismatch repair factors. Regulation of genetic recombination, a proposed role for RecQ helicases, is supported by the identified RECQ1 protein interactions and is discussed. Maintenance of the genome requires cells to duplicate, repair, and segregate their DNA precisely for proper transmission of genetic information to take place. A loss of function of gene products critical for maintaining genome integrity leads to genome instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer. A greater understanding of how cells maintain their genome has come from studies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These studies have revealed a variety of mechanisms involving DNA transactions performed by DNA replication, repair, and recombination proteins to preserve genomic integrity. One class of enzymes that have been found to play a pivotal role in the genome preservation is the RecQ family of helicases (for review, see Refs. 1Bachrat C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Khakhar R.R. Cobb J.A. Bjergbaek L. Hickson I.D. Gasser S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 493-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). RecQ helicases play an important role in genome preservation through their roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Of the five human RecQ helicases identified, three are associated with genetic disorders (Werner, Bloom, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes) characterized by an elevated incidence of cancer and premature aging (3Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Two features commonly found in cells in which a RecQ helicase is mutated are abnormal DNA replication and elevated recombination (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). With the exception of RECQL4, which is reported to lack detectable helicase activity (5Yin J. Tae K.Y. Varshavsky A. Wang W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), all of the RecQ helicases characterized to date unwind duplex DNA, translocating in a 3′-5′ direction (for review, see Ref. 1Bachrat C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A great deal of knowledge about the biological function of RecQ helicases has been acquired through studies involving the identification of RecQ protein partners and their functional interactions. Consistent with their roles on a variety of DNA substrates that represent multiple intermediates in DNA processing, RecQ helicases interact with a number of proteins involved in DNA metabolism (for review, see Refs. 3Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 6Cobb J. Bjergbaek L. Gasser S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The network of RecQ protein interactions is likely to be important in pathways that recognize and process DNA structural perturbations that may otherwise lead to chromosomal rearrangements or mutations. A framework for understanding the roles of RecQ helicases in genome stability maintenance has been established by the identification and characterization of their protein interactors. Of the five human RecQ helicases, RECQ1 (also referred to in the literature as RecQL and helicase Q1) is the smallest with a size of 649 residues (7Puranam K.L. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29838-29845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Seki M. Miyazawa H. Tada S. Yanagisawa J. Yamaoka T. Hoshino S. Ozawa K. Eki T. Nogami M. Okumura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4566-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), only slightly larger in size than the founding member of the family, Escherichia coli RecQ. Although no disease has been linked to a mutation in RECQ1, the prominent roles of RecQ helicases in DNA metabolism and maintenance of genomic stability suggest that RECQ1 is likely to have an important biological function. RECQ1 was demonstrated to be a DNA-stimulated ATPase and helicase, capable of unwinding short duplex DNA substrates (9Cui S. Klima R. Ochem A. Arosio D. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1424-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the presence of replication protein A (RPA), 1The abbreviations used are: RPA, replication protein A; EXO-1, exonuclease 1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; nt, nucleotide; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. the enzyme can unwind up to ∼500 bp (10Cui S.

In addition to RPA, RECQ1 is reported to physically interact with topoisomerase IIIα (11Johnson F.B. Lombard D.B. Neff N.F. Mastrangelo M.A. Dewolf W. Ellis N.A. Marciniak R.A. Yin Y. Jaenisch R. Guarente L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1162-1167PubMed Google Scholar) and importin-α homologs (12Seki T. Tada S. Katada T. Enomoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, the functional importance of RECQ1 interactions with topoisomerase IIIα or importin has not been demonstrated. In this work, we sought to identify and characterize RECQ1-interacting partners to gain a better understanding of the physiological role of RECQ1. To accomplish this task, we utilized an antibody against a unique region of the protein to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To explore the functional significance of these interactions, we examined the effects these partners display on the various enzymatic activities of the proteins. These interactions provide new insight into the role of RECQ1 in the maintenance of the genome. Proteins—Recombinant His-tagged RECQ1 protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified to near homogeneity as previously described (10Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

Wilson, submitted for publication. Recombinant MLH1/PMS2 was overexpressed using a baculovirus/insect system and purified as described elsewhere. 3T. M. Wilson, unpublished data. Production of the RECQ1-K119A Mutant—The mutant K119A RECQ1 construct was generated with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The pFastBac-RECQ1 vector containing the wild-type gene was used as the template DNA. The substitution (Lys→ Ala) was verified by dideoxy chain-termination sequencing of both DNA strands. The pFastBac-RECQ1-K119A construct was transformed next into DH10Bac E. coli for transposition of the gene into the baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) according to the Invitrogen protocol. After the transposition, the bacmid DNA was isolated and transfected into Sf9 insect cells with Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) to generate the recombinant baculoviral stock that was then used to infect cells for large-scale expression of the recombinant mutant RECQ1-K119A protein. The mutant RECQ1-K119A protein was purified to near homogeneity, applying the same protocol used for the wild-type protein. Anti-RECQ1 Antibody Production—Custom polyclonal anti-RECQ1 antibody was produced as previously described (10Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A 20 amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 644-662 (GNFQKKAANMLQQSGSKNT) in the C-terminal region of RECQ1 with an N-terminal cysteine conjugated to Sepharose 4B for affinity purification (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein and injected into rabbit. An IgG fraction from the antiserum was purified using the peptide coupled to Sepharose 4B via a cysteine group. Affinity-purified antibody titration was checked by ELISA using free peptide. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing HeLa cells as previously described (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, precleared nuclear extract (1.36 mg protein) was incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-RECQ1 antibody (1:20) in buffer D (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C. The mixture was subsequently incubated with 60 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed three times with buffer D supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and the eluate was resolved on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed for RECQ1 using rabbit anti-RECQ1 polyclonal antibody (1:250), for EXO-1 using rabbit polyclonal antibody against a recombinant EXO-1 nuclease domain fragment characterized previously (1:5000, courtesy of Dr. D. M. Wilson III (NIA, National Institutes of Health)) (14Lee B.I. Wilson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37763-37769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), for MSH2 using mouse anti-MSH2 monoclonal antibody (1:250, BD Biosciences), for MSH6 using mouse anti-MSH6 monoclonal antibody (1: 500, BD Biosciences), and for MLH1 using mouse anti-MLH1 monoclonal antibody (1:250, BD Biosciences). Donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (1: 5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or horse-anti-mouse secondary (1: 2500, Vector Laboratories Inc.) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were subsequently added, and proteins on immunoblots were detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). The detected endogenous proteins (RECQ1, EXO-1, MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1) from co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa nuclear extracts were confirmed by co-migration with the corresponding purified full-length recombinant proteins. ELISA for Detection of Direct RECQ1 Protein Interactions—Purified recombinant RECQ1 was diluted to a concentration of 18 nm in carbonate buffer (0.016 m Na2CO3, 0.034 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.6)) and then added to the appropriate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (50 μl/well), which was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used in the coating step for control reactions. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20, and 3% BSA). The procedure was repeated. Following blockage, the wells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of purified recombinant EXO-1, MLH1-PMS2, or MSH2/6 complex for 1 h at 37 °C. For ethidium bromide (EtBr) treatment, 50 μg/ml EtBr was included in the incubation with EXO-1, MLH1-PMS2, or MSH2/6 during the binding step in the corresponding wells. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were washed three times before the addition of the appropriate primary antibody (the same as used for Western blot detection) against EXO-1, MLH1-PMS2, or MSH2/6 in blocking buffer. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following three washings, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000) was added to the wells and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing five times, any protein bound to the immobilized RECQ1 was detected using o-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma).

ELISA Data Analysis—The fraction of the immobilized RECQ1 bound to the microtiter well that was specifically bound by EXO-1, MLH1-PMS2, or MSH2/6 was determined from the ELISA. A Hill plot was used to analyze the data as described previously (15Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

RECQ1 was mixed with the substrate on ice prior to the addition of EXO-1. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (unless indicated otherwise), terminated with the addition of 10 μl of formamide dye (80% formamide (v/v), 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol), and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. A PhosphorImager was used for detection, and the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) was used for quantitation of the reaction products. The percent incision was calculated as described previously (17Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A.

RECQ1 Helicase Assay—Helicase reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, 80 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 nm DNA substrate, 1 nm RECQ1, and the indicated concentrations of MSH2/6. Reactions were initiated by the addition of RECQ1, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Helicase reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of Stop buffer (35 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol), and subsequently incubated with 75 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 15 min. The products were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software. The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the formula: percent unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the residual substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in controls having no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with mean ± S.D. indicated by error bars. Relatively little is known regarding the cellular pathways of DNA metabolism in which human RECQ1 helicase participates. To gain insight into the molecular functions of RECQ1, we investigated its in vivo protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation studies and in vitro physical and functional interaction assays. Using these complementary approaches, we have identified novel RECQ1 protein interactions with DNA repair factors involved in mismatch correction and DNA recombination. Physical Interaction between RECQ1 and EXO-1—To identify the protein partner candidates of human RECQ1 that exist in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using HeLa nuclear extracts and an antibody raised against a 20-amino acid peptide of a unique sequence in the C-terminal region of RECQ1 (10Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The anti-RECQ1 antibody precipitated RECQ1 (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lane 2) and co-immunoprecipitated EXO-1 (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 2) from normal HeLa nuclear extract. Approximately 12% EXO-1 from the HeLa nuclear extract input (lane 1) was co-immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 using the anti-RECQ1 antibody. Control experiments using normal rabbit IgG incubated in the HeLa nuclear extracts confirmed the specificity of the anti-RECQ1 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Analogous experiments carried out in the presence of EtBr (50 μg/ml) demonstrated that this DNA-intercalating drug does not affect the co-immunoprecipitation of EXO-1 with RECQ1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). These results indicate that RECQ1 and EXO-1 are associated with each other in vivo and that the interaction is not mediated by DNA. To confirm a direct interaction between RECQ1 and EXO-1, we performed ELISA experiments with the purified recombinant proteins. Increasing amounts of EXO-1 were incubated in wells that had been previously coated with RECQ1 (18 nm) (Fig. 1B). After multiple washings, the RECQ1-EXO-1 complex was detected with a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against EXO-1 and a colorimetric assay. The results were used to build binding curves that showed binding saturation of RECQ1-EXO-1 at EXO-1 concentrations of ≥10 nm. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by the absence of color in wells that had been precoated with BSA rather than RECQ1 (data not shown). To determine the affinity of the RECQ1-EXO-1 interaction, ELISA data from specific binding of EXO-1 to RECQ1-coated wells were analyzed according to the Scatchard binding theory using Hill plots as described under “Materials and Methods.” The transformed data were linear, indicating a single site on EXO-1 for binding to RECQ1. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was determined to be 1.37 nm. Analogous experiments performed in the presence of EtBr yielded almost identical binding curves (data not shown), indicating that the RECQ1-EXO-1 interaction is not mediated by DNA. RECQ1 Stimulates EXO-1 Incision Activity on a 1-nt 5′-Flap Substrate—The physical interaction between RECQ1 and EXO-1, as well as the ability of a related human RECQ helicase, WRN (Werner syndrome protein), to stimulate EXO-1 cleavage by a direct protein interaction (18Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Driscoll H.C. Uzdilla L. Wilson T.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23487-23496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggested that RECQ1 might stimulate the incision activities of human EXO-1. To address this possibility, we first examined the ability of RECQ1 to stimulate EXO-1 cleavage of a 1-nt 5′-flap substrate, a common replication intermediate. We examined EXO-1 incision activity at various concentrations of EXO-1, either in the absence or presence of RECQ1 (5 nm). RECQ1 was observed to stimulate the incision activity of EXO-1 at each EXO-1 concentration tested (Fig. 2A). RECQ1 alone did not cleave the substrate (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Quantitation of the data revealed an ∼2-fold stimulation of EXO-1 by RECQ1 at all three concentrations of EXO-1 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether higher concentrations of RECQ1 might increase the stimulation of EXO-1 cleavage, we tested the effect of increasing RECQ1 concentrations on EXO-1 incision of the 1-nt 5′-flap substrate. A concentration of EXO-1 (1.25 nm) that was determined to yield a small level of incision was used (Fig. 2A, lane 5). With increasing concentrations of RECQ1, a significant stimulation of EXO-1 incision activity was observed (Fig. 2, C and D). Quantitation of the 1-nt cleavage product revealed that RECQ1 stimulated EXO-1 cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner. Stimulation of EXO-1 by RECQ1 reached ∼5-fold at the highest RECQ1 concentration (20 nm) tested (Fig. 2D). Stimulation of EXO-1 by RECQ1 on a Nicked Duplex DNA Substrate—It was recently observed that EXO-1 is required in a reconstituted mismatch repair reaction of human nuclear extracts with a DNA substrate where mismatch-provoked incision is directed by a strand break located either 5′ or 3′ to the mismatch (19Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although in vitro data suggest that replication factor C and PCNA can direct EXO-1 nick-directed repair in the reconstituted mismatch repair system (20Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), factors that modulate the efficiency of EXO-1 incision in mismatch repair have not been identified. Therefore, we set out to test the effect of RECQ1 on EXO-1 cleavage activity of a proposed DNA mismatch repair intermediate, a nicked duplex DNA substrate. The nicked duplex substrate that was tested contained a 5′-32P label on the downstream primer of the nicked duplex substrate. To verify its integrity, the nicked duplex substrate, incubated with T4 DNA ligase under conditions suitable for ligation, was found to have ∼95% of its upstream and downstream primers joined (data not shown), providing evidence that the substrate does indeed contain a ligatable nick. We first examined EXO-1 cleavage of the nicked duplex DNA substrate in the presence or absence of a fixed RECQ1 concentration of 5 nm (Fig. 3A). Using a limiting concentration of EXO-1 (1.25 nm), EXO-1 5′-3′ incision was stimulated 4-fold by 5 nm RECQ1, resulting in 13% incision compared with 3% by EXO-1 alone (Fig. 3B). 2.5 nm EXO-1 incised 10% nicked duplex DNA substrate. The addition of RECQ1 increased the amount of substrate incised by EXO-1 to 40%, a 4-fold stimulation. We also tested a nicked duplex with a 3′-end label on the upstream primer and found that EXO-1 in the absence or presence of RECQ1 did not incise the 3′-label under conditions where the 5′-end label of the downstream primer was catalytically removed (data not shown). We next studied EXO-1 cleavage of the nicked duplex DNA substrate as a function of RECQ1 concentration. Using a limited amount of EXO-1 (2.5 nm), RECQ1 stimulated EXO-1 incision of the nicked duplex to yield the 1-nt product in a RECQ1 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). In the control reactions, RECQ1 (20 nm) did not cleave the substrate (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Quantitation of the EXO-1 cleavage in the presence of RECQ1 is shown in Fig. 3D. At 5 nm RECQ1, EXO-1 incision was increased 4-fold. Further increases to 7- and 10-fold were observed at RECQ1 concentrations of 10 and 20 nm RECQ1, respectively. Helicase Activity of RECQ1 Is Not Required for Stimulation of EXO-1 Incision—The helicase activity of RECQ1 may play a role in the functional interaction with EXO-1. To address this possibility, we tested the effects of full-length recombinant RECQ1 protein with a site-directed mutation in the conserved ATP-binding site on EXO-1 incision of the 1-nt flap and nicked duplex DNA substrates. The RECQ1-K119A mutant protein, devoid of helicase activity (Supplemental Fig. 1), was capable of stimulating the EXO-1 incision reaction similar to wild-type RECQ1 on both the 1-nt flap and nicked duplex DNA substrates (Fig. 4). In control reactions, RECQ1-K119A alone did not yield the products (Fig. 4). Thus, DNA unwinding of the substrate is dispensable for the RECQ1-EXO-1 functional interaction. This result is consistent with our observation that RECQ1 stimulates EXO-1 incision of either the 1-nt flap or nicked duplex substrates in the absence of ATP (Figs. 2 and 3). Physical Interaction between RECQ1 and Other DNA Repair Factors—The interaction of RECQ1 with EXO-1 and RPA (10Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggested to us that RECQ1 might interact either sequentially or in a complex with other DNA repair factors. The robust stimulation by RECQ1 of EXO-1 incision of a nicked duplex substrate, a key intermediate in mismatch repair and related processes, suggested that proteins implicated in the mismatch repair pathway might also interact with RECQ1. To address this issue, co-immunoprecipitation experiments from HeLa nuclear extracts were performed using the anti-RECQ1 peptide antibody and the immunoprecipitated proteins were probed with antibodies against selected mismatch repair proteins by Western blot analysis. A mismatch repair protein that was consistently co-immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 was MLH1 (Fig. 5A). Approximately 8% MLH1 from the HeLa nuclear extract input (Fig. 5A, lane 3) was co-immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 using the anti-RECQ1 antibody (lane 1). Control experiments using normal rabbit IgG incubated in the HeLa nuclear extracts confirmed the specificity of the anti-RECQ1 antibody (Fig. 5A, lane 4). Experiments carried out in the presence of EtBr demonstrated that the co-immunoprecipitation of RECQ1 and MLH1 is not mediated by nucleic acids (Fig. 5A, lane 2). To explore the nature and specificity of the putative RECQ1-MLH1 interaction, we conducted ELISAs using the purified recombinant proteins. MutLα, a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2, was added in increasing concentration to wells that had prebound with RECQ1 (18 nm application). After washing, the RECQ1-MutLα complex was detected with a mouse polyclonal antibody raised against MLH1 and a colorimetric assay was used to build binding curves that reached saturation at MutLα concentrations of ∼10 nm (Fig. 5B). Experiments performed in the presence of EtBr yielded similar binding curves (data not shown), indicating that the RECQ1-MLH1 interaction is not DNA-mediated. The specificity of the RECQ1-MLH1 interaction was demonstrated by the absence of color in wells that had been precoated with BSA rather than RECQ1. The transformed data were linear, indicating a single site on the MutLα complex for binding to RECQ1. Specific binding of MutLα to RECQ1-coated wells was analyzed according to the Scatchard binding theory. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was determined to be 3.2 nm when the data were analyzed by Hill plots as described under “Materials and Methods.” Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from HeLa nuclear extracts also revealed that the MSH2 and MSH6 proteins were consistently co-immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 1). Approximately 4% MSH2 and MSH6 were immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 from the nuclear extract with the RECQ1 antibody. A control experiment with normal rabbit IgG incubated with HeLa nuclear extract confirmed the specificity of the anti-RECQ1 antibody (Fig. 6, A and B, lane 4). The presence of EtBr did not negate the ability of MSH2 or MSH6 to be co-immunoprecipitated with RECQ1 (F"

Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing wereperformed by the Keck Foundation Research Biotechnology Resource Laboratory atYale University (New Haven, CT). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarosechromatography for His6-tagged protein purification was from Qiagen(Valencia, CA). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Radprotein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Genomic DNAs were fromATCC (Manassas, VA). The Escherichia coli X2913(λ-, thyA752(del) rph-1) strain(18Michaels M.L. Kim C.W. Matthews D.A. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was from the E.coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University). The preparation of C.sticklandii ProX (12Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) wasreported previously. The plasmids pTech and pCYB1 were described previously(19Ruan B.

E. coli cysS, aspS,asnS, thrS, proS, and alaS were PCR-amplified, and cloned intopET15b. Recombinant aaRSs were purified as described(19Ruan B. Nakano H. Tanaka M. Mills J.A. DeVito J.A. Min B. Low K.B. Battista J.R. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cloning ybaK, thyA, and E. coli proS Genes—Primers weredesigned to PCR-amplify each open reading frame and introduce desiredrestriction sites. The forward primers contained a restriction site and 20nucleotides identical to the start sequence of the 5′-end; the reverseprimers contained a restriction site and 20 nucleotides complementary to thesequence of the 3′-end. PCR-amplified ybaK and thyAopen reading frames from H. influenzae and E. coli DNAs werecloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. The mutant thyA:146CCA wasgenerated by PCR mutagenesis with primers containing the correspondingmutations. After verification of the DNA sequences, the ybaK geneswere subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET15b vector, the EcoRIand BamHI site of pTech vector, and the NdeI and BamHI sites of pCYB1 vector.The E. coli thyA and thyA:146CCA genes were cloned at theNdeI and BamHI site of pCYB1 vector. The E. coli proS gene was clonedat the NdeI and SphI site of pACYCtaq vector. The pACYCtaq vector wasconstructed by ligation of two fragments from pACYC184 (BclI filled, BamHI)and pCYB1 (EcoRV, BamHI) and contains the p15A origin, the cat gene(CmR), and a multiple cloning site downstream of a Tacpromoter. Construction of the YbaK Deletion Strain—The E.coli ΔthyA strain X2913(18Michaels M.L. Kim C.W. Matthews D.A. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was transformed withpKD20 plasmid containing bacteriophage λ red recombinase. An E.coli ΔthyA ΔybaK strain X2914 wasconstructed from strain X2913 using an established method(20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Briefly, the genomic DNAof the E. coli strain EC400 served as the template for PCRamplification of the lox2-kan cassette(21DeVito J.A. Mills J.A. Liu V.G. Agarwal A. Sizemore C.F. Yao Z. Stoughton D.M. Cappiello M.G. Barbosa M.D. Foster L.A. Pompliano D.L. Nat.Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and thelox2-kan deletion cassette was flanked with identical50-bp sequences found in the upstream and downstream regions of theybaK gene. After transforming the deletion cassette into the E.coli strain X2913/pKD20, the ybaK chromosomal deletion strains(X2914) were selected on kanamycin plates. Genomic DNAs of putative deletionmutants were subject to PCR amplification using the primers p1F(5′-atgacacccgcagttaaattac) and p1R (5′-ttaatcgcggcgggcgatatcagc)for the ybaK gene and p2F (5′-ccatcaggcgtatgcttgc) and p2R(5′-cgctggatgtgagtgtttatg) for the deletion region (seeFig. 1A), and theamplified DNA fragments (Fig.1B) were further subjected to nucleotide sequencing. In Vivo Testing for Trans-editing of Cys-tRNAPro—E.coli X2913 and X2914 strains were transformed withpCYB-thyA:146CCA or pCYB-thyA. TheX2914/thyA:146CCA strain was further transformed with thepTech-E. coli ybaK or pACYCtaq-E. coli proS plasmids. Theformation and incorporation of Cys-tRNAPro in protein synthesiswere tested by growth on thymine-deficient medium; overnight cultures of theabove E. coli strains were washed with M56 medium, streaked on Medium56 agar plates (22Low B. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 798-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing19 amino acids (20 μg/ml), 0.5 mm cysteine, 0.008% uracil, 0.5mm IPTG, and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) with or without thymine (20μg/ml), and grown at 37 °C for 1 day. Preparation of His6-tagged YbaK Proteins—ThepET20b-ybaK clones were used to transform E. coli BL21DE3(CodonPlus) cells. Using procedures described previously(19Ruan B. Nakano H. Tanaka M. Mills J.A. DeVito J.A. Min B. Low K.B. Battista J.R. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the recombinant H.influenzae YbaK protein was obtained at a final concentration of 1mm as a single band (>99%) on SDS-PAGE stained with CoomassieBrilliant Blue. E. coli YbaK protein was precipitated at 50μm concentration in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and had>95% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.The enzymes were stored in 40% glycerol buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.2, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol) at -20 °C. E. coli Protein Extract Preparation—E. coli DH5α cells(10 g) harvested from log-phase growth (A600 nm 1.0) weresuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 10mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol),treated with lysozyme 0.2 mg/ml, and sonicated at 4 °C. Aftercentrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant wasdialyzed and applied to Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia). The protein fraction waseluted with buffer A in a gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl. Afterrepeated dialysis and concentration, the E. coli protein extract wasstored in 40% glycerol buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol) at -20 °C. Aminoacylation of the tRNA Preparation—E. coli total tRNAwas extracted from E. coli DH5α cells as described previously(23Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because E. coliaaRS are discriminating enzymes(2Ibba M. Söll D. Annu.Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) with exclusive specificityin aminoacylation (>99%), 20 correctly acylated aa-tRNAs (e.g.Cys-tRNACys) were prepared from unfractionated E. colitRNA; aminoacylation in the presence of the individual 14C-labeledamino acids was performed either by purified aaRSs or in a well dialyzedE. coli cell-free S-100 extract. The 500-μl reaction mixturescontained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 15mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10mm ATP, 20 mg/ml E. coli total tRNA, 1–10 mg/mlE. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, with individual labeled aminoacids (0.5 mm, 100–500 cpm/pmol). Cys-tRNACys,Pro-tRNAPro, Ala-tRNAAla, Thr-tRNAThr,Asp-tRNAAsp, Asn-tRNAAsn, and Lys-tRNALyswere prepared using purified corresponding aaRS, and the other 13aa-tRNAaa were prepared using extensively dialyzed E. coliprotein extracts. Misacylated Cys-tRNAPro was prepared using C.sticklandii ProRS enzyme and Ala-tRNAPro by D.radiodurans ProRS enzyme as described(24Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The charging plateau wasreached within 0.5 h, and each reaction was cooled to 4 °C and mixed with3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, to a final concentration of 0.3m. The mixture was extracted with phenol, pH 4.5, at 4 °C, andthe aqueous phase containing aa-tRNA was collected by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min. The aa-tRNA was further purified by filtrationthrough a G25 column, precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol at -80 °Cfor 1 h, collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 40 min,and dried for storage at -80 °C. Deacylation of Aminoacyl-tRNA—Deacylation of aa-tRNAs wasmeasured by acid-precipitable radioactivity(12Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in 50-μl reactionscontaining cognate or misacylated aa-tRNAs (0.1–1 μm),YbaK or ProX enzymes (0–10 μm), and buffer (50mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. Reactions werecarried out in triplicate at 37 °C. As a positive control to thedeacylation reactions, 0.1 m NaOH was used instead of the enzyme.Also, the deacylated tRNAs were extracted with phenol and recharged with thecorresponding aaRS and radiolabeled amino acid to show that the body of tRNAwas intact. Induced Expression of H. influenzae YbaK in Vivo andCys-tRNACys Analysis—The cultures (500 ml) of E.coli X2913 strain with pCYB-H. influenzae ybaK or empty vectorwere grown at 37 °C in LB medium in the presence of 5 mm IPTG.The growth was measured by the A600 nm of aliquots takenat different time points. The cells were harvested after 5 h of growth, andcellular tRNAs were extracted by acidic phenol, pH 4.5, in 0.3 msodium acetate. The ratio of Cys-tRNACys and tRNACysfrom in vivo samples was determined by Northern blotting as describedpreviously (25Choi H. Gabriel K. Schneider J. Otten S. McClain W.H. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) withmodifications. Briefly, samples were periodate oxidized with 5 mmNaIO4 in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (1 ml), for 1 h at37 °C, and the reaction was quenched with 50 mm glucose for 1.5h at 0 °C. The tRNAs were ethanol precipitated, and β-eliminated with1 m lysine, pH 8.0 (1 ml), for 1 h at 45 °C, followed bydeacylation with 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, for 0.5 h at 37 °C.The in vivo samples, along with the Cys-tRNACys andtRNACys standards, were loaded in triplicate on an 8%polyacrylamide urea DNA sequencing gel, pH 8.3, at 800 V for 3.5 h. The tRNAswere transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane by electroblotting at 24 Vfor 1.5 h with 40 mm Tris acetate and 2 mm EDTA transferbuffer, pH 4.2. The tRNACys was detected by hybridization with a5′-[32P]oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe complementary tonucleotides 1–20 of E. coli tRNACys, visualized byphosphorimaging, and quantified by the ImageQuant response. E. coli YbaK Hydrolyzes Cys-tRNAPro in Vivo—Inin vitro reactions, E. coli ProRS is able to form bothPro-tRNAPro (>99%) and Cys-tRNAPro (<1%)(24Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas H.influenzae YbaK is known to cleave Cys-tRNAPro(13An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, the E.coli thyA missense suppressionsystem 2B. Ruan and D. Söll, unpublished results. would providea facile test for the effect of E. coli ybaK on the in vivolevels of misacylated Cys-tRNAPro. The thyA missensesuppression system uses the thyA:146CCA gene as a reporter, and thegene product is an inactive ThyA protein, because the essential Cys-146 isreplaced by Pro (18Michaels M.L. Kim C.W. Matthews D.A. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However,Cys-tRNAPro enables Cys insertion in response to the 146CCA Procodon; the resulting wild-type ThyA will allow the strain to grow in theabsence of thymine. Therefore, we tested the growth properties of a number ofE. coli ΔthyA strains; strain X2913 (complemented withthyA+ or thyA:146CCA) carries a chromosomalybaK copy, whereas strain X2914 (complemented withthyA:146CCA) contains a ybaK deletion. Each of these strains can grow on minimal medium in the presence of thymine(Fig. 2, left). Asexpected, strain X2913/thyA+ grows in the absence ofthymine (Fig. 2,right), whereas strain X2913/thyA:146CCA does not. However,X2914/thyA: 146CCA is capable of growth in the absence of thymine(Fig. 2, right). Thismissense suppression is abolished by transforming this strain withybaK (Fig. 2,right), as YbaK will hydrolyze Cys-tRNAPro. The presenceof additional E. coli ProRS (expressed from a plasmid) makes strainX2914/thyA:146CCA/pACYCtaq-ECproS grow slower than strainX2914/thyA: 146CCA; presumably, the higher amount ofCys-tRNAPro in the former strain is deleterious to the cell. Allthese data support the notion that E. coli YbaK hydrolyzesCys-tRNAPro in vivo as was observed for H.influenzae YbaK in vitro(13An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Is YbaK a Specific Cys-tRNAPro-editing Enzyme?—Totest the in vitro properties of E. coli YbaK, we comparedthe deacylation of E. coli Cys-tRNAPro,Pro-tRNAPro, and Cys-tRNACys by the E. coli andH. influenzae YbaK proteins. Ybak is an inefficient enzyme. In theoriginal publication (13An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) a5–100-fold excess of the H. influenzae YbaK enzyme over theCys-tRNAPro substrate (0.2 μm) was used. The E.coli and H. influenzae Ybak protein (used in 2-fold excess at 1μm concentration) deacylated 92% of Cys-tRNAPro in 6min (Fig. 3A). At a2-fold excess of the tRNA substrate (0.28 μm) Ybak hydrolyzed40% of Cys-tRNAPro in 30 min (data not shown). Both enzymesdisplayed more general aa-tRNA deacylase properties; in addition todeacylation of Cys-tRNAPro, hydrolysis of Cys-tRNACysoccurred, whereas Pro-tRNAPro was not cleaved(Fig. 3A). Deacylationof Cys-tRNACys was also significant at lower enzyme concentrations.A dose-response time course of Cys-tRNACys deacylation is shown inFig. 3B withenzyme:substrate ratios varying from 0.25 to 12.5. The deacylated tRNA samples(Fig. 3A) could bereacylated with [35S]Cys (data not shown) indicating thatYbaK-catalyzed hydrolysis leaves tRNA intact. The combined data show Ybak tobe a slow deacylase. It should be noted that the Ybak concentration within thecell may also be high, if one considers that the in vivoconcentrations of E. coli tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are inthe micromolar range (26Jakubowski H. Goldman E. J.Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 769-776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YbaK Is a Moderately General Aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase— Thedata above revealed that YbaK may be an aa-tRNA deacylase. To probe itssubstrate specificity, we prepared the complete set of 20 canonical E.coli aa-tRNAs. Each aa-tRNA was then subjected to deacylation by H.influenzae YbaK at 1 μm(Fig. 4A) and 10μm (Fig.4B) concentrations. At the lower concentration YbaKhydrolyzed mainly Cys-tRNACys and weakly Gly-tRNAGly,whereas at the higher concentration Ala-tRNAAla,Ser-tRNASer, Gly-tRNAGly, Pro-tRNAPro,Met-tRNAMet, and Cys-tRNACys were deacylated. The other14 aa-tRNAs were not cleaved. Therefore, YbaK is a moderately general aa-tRNAdeacylase and not restricted to Cys-tRNAPro hydrolysis. Theselection of these aa-tRNAs may reflect the similar sizes and chemicalproperties of the amino acid moiety. As shown in crystal structure of H.influenzae YbaK enzyme, the protein contained a single striking J-shapeddepression with Lys-46 at the crevice edge(15Zhang H. Huang K. Li Z. Banerjei L. Fisher K.E. Grishin N.V. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2000; 40: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This Lys was shown to beessential for YbaK to hydrolyze Cys-tRNAPro(13An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, it remains tobe established whether this mutation defines an active site that is alsoinvolved in the hydrolysis of the YbaK substrates Cys-tRNA, Gly-tRNA,Ala-tRNA, Pro-tRNA, Met-tRNA, and Ser-tRNA. The C. sticklandii ProX Protein Is Also an Aminoacyl-tRNADeacylase—ProX, another ProRS paralog, hydrolyzes misacylatedAla-tRNAPro (12Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Because there is moderate sequence similarity between YbaK and ProX(12Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we reasoned that ProXmay also deacylate correctly charged aa-tRNAs. Indeed, in addition toAla-tRNAPro, ProX (at 1 μm) hydrolyzedAla-tRNAAla and to lesser extent Gly-tRNAGly(Fig. 4C); anexperiment at 10 μm ProX concentration revealed additionalaa-tRNA deacylase activity against Cys-tRNA, Met-tRNA, Ser-tRNA, Pro-tRNA, andLeu-tRNA, whereas the hydrolysis of the remaining 13 aa-tRNAs wasindistinguishable from that of the no-enzyme control (data not shown). Ourexperiments suggest that ProX is an aa-tRNA deacylase that preferentiallyrecognizes Ala, whereas YbaK prefers Cys. H. influenzae YbaK Hydrolyzes Cys-tRNACys inVivo—As shown above, the YbaK protein hydrolyzed, albeit slowly,Cys-tRNACys in vitro. To test whether this property isalso manifested in vivo and affects cell growth by reducing theCys-tRNACys concentration, we expressed H. influenzae ybaKfrom an inducible promoter (pTac) in E. coli strain X2913/H.influenzae ybaK. Compared with the parent strain X2913, IPTG-inducedexpression of H. influenzae ybaK in X2913 inhibited cell growth inminimal medium (Fig.5A), and also reduced the growth in LB medium by 30%(Fig. 5B). Tocorrelate the growth properties with the levels of Cys-tRNACys inthese strains, we harvested cells after 5.5 h of growth in LB medium. Afteracidic phenol extraction the levels of Cys-tRNACys andtRNACys were analyzed by gel-electrophoresis of theperiodate-treated tRNA samples and Northern blotting. Wild-type X2913 cellshad 65% of tRNACys acylated (as Cys-tRNACys); however,H. influenzae ybaK overexpression reduced the level of chargedtRNACys to 35% (Fig.5C). These data suggest that the YbaK protein competeswith EF-Tu for Cys-tRNACys and hydrolyzes Cys-tRNACys.Also, a reduction in the level of charged tRNACys available forprotein synthesis may cause the observed slower growth. General Discussion—The intracellular levels of aa-tRNAs areimportant. They affect the accuracy of translation(27Ibba M. Söll D. GenesDev. 2004; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the rate of proteinsynthesis (28Dittmar K.A. Sorensen M.A. Elf J. Ehrenberg M. Pan T. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and somereactions in intermediary metabolism(29Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1968; 243: 3096-3104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Therefore, aa-tRNA deacylases may be important for cell growth andmetabolism. Several types of aa-tRNA deacylases have been found. For example,d-amino acids may be excluded from proteins byd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes anumber of d-aa-tRNA species and that is essential for cellviability in the presence of d-amino acids(16Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another type of activityis found in vivo and in vitro in the editing reactions ofaaRSs that causes hydrolysis of misacylated tRNA. These reactions may berelated, as a ThrRS-editing domain shares structural similarity withd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylases(32Rigden D.J. RNA (N.Y.). 2004; 10: 1845-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Free-standing small aaRSparalogs (e.g. YbaK and ProX) are capable of trans-editingmisacylated tRNA(11Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).It remains to be established whether these enzymes act alone or in complexwith an aaRS. However, as shown in this study, YbaK and ProX are also more generaldeacylases and cleave a number of correctly charged aa-tRNAs invitro. The lack of tRNA discrimination may be because of their smallersize; YbaK and ProX lack part of the tRNA binding site of ProRS. Therefore,they may interact only with part of the tRNA structure and not be able toefficiently discriminate between tRNAs. As such, these deacylases compete withEF-Tu (33LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) for the aa-tRNAsubstrates and therefore may exert an effect on cell growth or metabolism.Could ybaK and proX play such a general regulatory role? Wehave shown that overexpression of H. influenzae YbaK reduced thelevel of Cys-tRNACys in E. coli, thus the EF-Tu-mediatedprotection of aa-tRNA from hydrolysis is not absolute. Even though our datashowed that E. coli ybaK is not an essential gene under the growthconditions tested, future work with different experimental conditions(e.g. high levels of Cys) may reveal a ybaK deletionphenotype and may uncover additional aa-tRNA deacylases.

https://openalex.org/W2042950613,"Lipid homeostasis is controlled by various nuclear receptors (NRs), including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, δ, and γ), which sense lipid levels and regulate their metabolism. Here we demonstrate that human PPARs have a high basal activity and show ligand-independent coactivator (CoA) association comparable with the NR constitutive androstane receptor. Using PPARγ as an example, we found that four different amino acid groups contribute to the ligand-independent stabilization of helix 12 of the PPAR ligand-binding domain. These are: (i) Lys329 and Glu499, mediating a charge clamp-type stabilization of helix 12 via a CoA bridge; (ii) Glu352, Arg425, and Tyr505, directly stabilizing the helix via salt bridges and hydrogen bonds; (iii) Lys347 and Asp503, interacting with each other as well as contacting the CoA; and (iv) His351, Tyr355, His477, and Tyr501, forming a hydrogen bond network. These amino acids are highly conserved within the PPAR subfamily, suggesting that the same mechanism may apply for all three PPARs. Phylogenetic trees of helix 12 amino acid and nucleotide sequences of all crystallized NRs and all human NRs, respectively, indicated a close relationship of PPARs with constitutive androstane receptor and other constitutive active members of the NR superfamily. Taking together, the ligand-independent tight control of the position of the PPAR helix 12 provides an effective alternative for establishing an interaction with CoA proteins. This leads to high basal activity of PPARs and provides an additional view on PPAR signaling. Lipid homeostasis is controlled by various nuclear receptors (NRs), including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, δ, and γ), which sense lipid levels and regulate their metabolism.

Dysregulation of lipid levels is characteristic of some of the most prevalent medical disorders, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.

Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). NRs form a superfamily of transcription factors (48 human members) and are characterized by their highly conserved DNA-binding domain and structurally conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD) (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Classical endocrine NRs are the receptors for the agonists estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), thyroid hormone, and all-trans-retinoic acid. These receptors all show a very selective ligand binding with Kd values in the order of 1 nm or lower (3Herdick M. Bury Y. Quack M. Uskokovic M. Polly P. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1206-1217PubMed Google Scholar). Adopted orphan NRs, such as PPARs, bind a variety of structurally diverse compounds with a relatively low affinity (Kd in the order of 1 μm) (4Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Native and oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as arachidonic acid derivatives, such as prostaglandins and prostacyclins, selectively bind the PPAR subtypes and stimulate their transcriptional activity (5Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). PPARγ is the best characterized member of the subfamily because of its prominent role in the regulation of differentiation of cell types with active lipid metabolism, such as adipocytes and macrophage foam cells (6Walczak R. Tontonoz P. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The importance of this receptor in lipid homeostasis and energy balance is accentuated by the widespread use of synthetic PPARγ ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, as antidiabetic drugs (8Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The LBDs of most NRs is a characteristic three-layer antiparallel α-helical sandwich formed by 11-13 α-helices. The most C-terminal helix, often called helix 12, serves as a molecular switch by allowing the LBD in its agonistic conformation to interact with coactivator (CoA) proteins, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), and receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3) (9Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the agonist-bound conformation of some of these endocrine NRs compared with the apoRXR structure led to the formulation of the “mousetrap” model (10Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), in which helix 12 should act as a lid to the ligand-binding pocket of the LBD. In general, the conformational flexibility of helix 12 allows a NR to sense the presence of specific ligands, to enhance the selective interaction with CoA and corepressor (CoR) proteins, and ultimately to determine the transcriptional outcome of the NR signaling (11Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apo and holo crystal structures of the LBD of PPARs and other adopted orphan NRs question the mousetrap model because ligand binding to the receptor does not induce any major move of helix 12 (12Nolte R.T. Wisley G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). High basal activity and constitutive activity are rather common for adopted orphan NRs. One example with an exceptionally high constitutive activity is the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) (13Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although the receptor seems to function without a ligand, the imidazothiazole derivative CITCO was shown to be a selective human CAR agonist (14Maglich J.M. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Goodwin B. Billin A.N. Stoltz C.A. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17277-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The stabilization of helix 12 in the active conformation of CAR is mediated by at least four contacts between helix 12 residues and cooperating amino acids in helices 3, 4, and 11 (15Frank C. Molnar F. Matilainen M. Lempiäinen H. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33558-33566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Xu R.X. Lambert M.H. Wisely B.B. Warren E.N. Weinert E.E. Waitt G.M. Williams J.D. Collins J.L. Moore L.B. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 919-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two of these interactions, the glutamate-lysine charge clamp and the ligand-induced interaction between helices 11 and 12, are rather conserved throughout the NR superfamily, whereas the two other contacts seem to be specific for CAR. Other members of the NR superfamily, such as the retinoid orphan receptors (RORs), also show high basal activity in the absence of ligand (17Schräder M. Danielsson C. Wiesenberg I. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19732-19736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recent studies using microarrays have enlarged the list of potential PPAR target genes in man and rodents. In general, primary NR target genes are defined through the presence of particular binding sites, referred to as response elements (REs), in their promoter regions (18Carlberg C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). PPARs, CAR, the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), and several other members of the NR superfamily form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on REs that are composed of a direct repeat (DR) of hexameric binding sites (20Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). PPAR-RXR heterodimers bind optimally to DR1-type REs that are also recognized by RXR homodimers (21Zhang X.-K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Herrmann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), whereas CAR-RXR and VDR-RXR heterodimers prefer DR4- and DR3-type REs, respectively (22Khorasanizadeh S. Rastinejad F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In rodents a large number of significantly inducible PPAR target genes has be identified (23Yamazaki K. Kuromitsu J. Tanaka I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Frederiksen K.S. Wulff E.M. Sauerberg P. Mogensen J.P. Jeppesen L. Fleckner J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 592-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas in human cell lines only a few genes are activated by PPAR ligands more than 2-fold (25Vanden Heuvel J.P. Kreder D. Belda B. Hannon D.B. Nugent C.A. Burns K.A. Taylor M.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 188: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This may indicate that the used cell lines have a dysfunctional PPAR signaling system. Alternatively, the PPARs may show association with CoAs even in absence of ligand leading to high basal expression of many target genes. In this study, we demonstrate that all three PPARs associate ligand-independently with CoA proteins. We also show that the ligand-independent interaction of the PPARs with CoA proteins is caused by intramolecular stabilization of the helix 12 in the active LBD conformation even in the absence of agonist. Using PPARγ as an example, we determined that four different amino acid groups contribute to the stabilization of helix 12. These interactions are conserved within the PPAR subfamily, and this suggests that the same mechanism applies for all three PPARs. Moreover, phylogenetic trees of helix 12 amino acid and nucleotide sequences of all crystallized NRs and all human NRs, respectively, indicated a close relation of PPARs with CAR and other constitutive active members of the NR superfamily. The PPARα agonist WY14643 was kindly provided by Dr. P. Honkakoski (University of Kuopio). 1α,25(OH)2D3, the PPARδ agonist L763483, and the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone were a gift from by Drs. L. Binderup and M. W. Madsen (Leo Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark). The CAR agonist CITCO was obtained from Biomol (Copenhagen, Denmark). 1α,25(OH)2D3 was dissolved in 2-propanol, whereas the other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO); further dilutions were made in Me2SO (for in vitro experiments) or in ethanol and Me2SO (for cell culture experiments).

The point mutants of PPARγ2 were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The helix 12 deletion mutant of PPARγ2 was created by introducing a stop codon at amino acid position 492. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing.

In vitro translated wild type or mutated PPARγ2, PPARα, PPARδ, CAR, VDR, or RXRα proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein batches were quantified by test translations in the presence of [35S]methionine. The specific concentration of the receptor proteins was adjusted to ∼4 ng/μl after taking the individual number of methionine residues/protein into account. Bacterial overexpression of GST-SRC-11597-791, GST-TIF2646-926, GST-RAC3673-1106, or GST alone was obtained from the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Stratagene) containing the respective expression plasmids. Overexpression was stimulated with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C, and the proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were eluted in the presence of glutathione. Gel shift assays were performed with equal amounts (∼10 ng) of appropriate in vitro translated proteins.

Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and visualized on a FLA3000 reader (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) using ScienceLab99 software (Fuji). In vitro translated, 35S-labeled PPARγ2, CAR, and VDR (20 ng) were incubated with Me2SO, 10 μm rosiglitazone, 10 μm CITCO, or 1 μm 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 10 μl. Trypsin (Promega, final concentration 100 ng/μl) was then added, and the mixtures were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The digestion reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of protein gel loading buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue). The full-length and digested proteins were denatured for 3 min at 95 °C, resolved by electrophoresis through 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized on a FLA3000 reader using ScienceLab99 software. MCF-7 human breast cancer or HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were seeded into 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA containing liposomes were formed by incubating 1 μg of an expression vector for wild type or mutant PPARγ2 and 1 μg of reporter plasmid with 10 μg of DOTAP (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100 μl. After dilution with 900 μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 500 μl of 15% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added 4 h after transfection. At this time, NR ligands or solvent was also added. The cells were lysed 16 h after the onset of stimulation using the reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics), and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands).

LRH-1 and ERR3 are known as constitutively active NRs, and apoERR3 was even co-crystallized with a peptide representing the NR interaction domain of the CoA SRC-1 (orange in Fig. 1A). As an indication of the active conformation, which both apo receptors are taking, we measured the distance of the conserved glutamate in helix 12 and its charge clamp partner, a lysine in helix 3, and obtained 19.63 and 19.36 Å for LRH-1 and ERR3, respectively. This distance reflects an optimal position of the two charge residues for effective CoA interaction of the LBD, as found in ligand-activated NRs, such as VDR (41Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we determined also for apoPPARδ and apoPPARγ distances of 19.92 and 19.57 Å, respectively. In the mouse CAR crystal structure with the agonist TCPOBOP (1XLS) (42Suino K. Peng L.

We found similar distances (20.0 and 26.3 Å) between the charge clamp residues in the crystal structure of PPARα with the agonist GW409544 (1K7L) (44Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Plunket K.D.

Taken together, a distance of 18-20 Å between the charge clamp residues seems to be optimal for the active conformation of many NR LBDs. This comparison suggests that even in the absence of ligand PPARδ and PPARγ can be in an active conformation, i.e. they may show ligand-independent association with CoA proteins. Agonist-independent Interaction of the ApoLBD with CoA Peptide—To test whether an agonist-independent interaction of apoPPARγ with CoA peptide (orange in Fig. 1, B and C) is possible, we superimposed its apo structure (1PRG, green) with its holo structure (2PRG, blue). In this comparison only minor movements in the upper part of the LBD (helices 1, 2, 8, and 9) are visible. Moreover, there are only subtle differences between the positions of helices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 for both forms of the PPARγ LBD. The main differences between the apo and holo structure are in the lower part of the LBD including helix 11, whose position is tilted by ∼5° between the two structures, and the region between helices 2 and 3 (Fig. 1B). This observation is in agreement with the crystallographic temperature factors, which are higher in the lower part of the LBD PPARγ structure and lead to less rigid regions of the LBD (12Nolte R.T. Wisley G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). A second region of differences is the coil between helices 11 and 12. Interestingly, in the holoLBD helix 12 is shifted by 1-1.2 Å relative to its position in the apoLBD (Fig. 1B). However, this does not prevent maintenance of the active charge clamp and allows the receptor to remain in the active conformation and to interact with CoA peptide (Fig. 1C). In detail, in the apoLBD Lys329 interacts with the carbonyl group of Thr639 of the CoA, and Glu499 contacts the amido group of the CoA residue Leu633 and the hydroxyl group of Ser630 (green in Fig. 1C). In the holoLBD the amino group of Lys329 makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxides of Thr639 and Leu636 of the CoA and the carboxyl group of Glu499 contacts the amido groups of the CoA residues Leu633 and Leu637 (blue in Fig. 1C). CoA Interaction of the Unliganded and Liganded PPARγ—We have shown previously that the constitutive activity of CAR derives from ligand-independent interactions of this NR with CoAs (15Frank C.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this was also the case for the PPARs, supershift assays were performed using in vitro translated PPAR-RXR heterodimers, bacterially produced NR interaction domains of the p160 CoA family members SRC-1, TIF2, and RAC3 as GST fusion proteins, and a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying the sequence of the human CPTI DR1-type RE (Fig. 2A). To exclude possible effects of RXR homodimers that have been shown to bind DR1-type REs (21Zhang X.-K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Herrmann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), experiments with RXR alone were done to act as a negative control (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-8). All three PPAR subtypes formed effective heterodimers with RXR on the DR1-type RE in a ligand-independent fashion (compare lanes 9, 17, and 25 with lanes 13, 21, and 29). Of the three tested CoAs, RAC3 interacted most efficiently with all three PPAR subtypes irrespective of the presence of subtype-selective agonists (lanes 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32). However, a direct comparison of the three CoAs is difficult because of the imponderable amounts of active protein in the respective fusion protein fraction. A direct comparison of the three PPAR subtypes with the same CoA is easier because equal amounts of in vitro translated proteins were used. The results showed that the interaction of RAC3 with PPARδ was weaker than with PPARα and γ. For comparison, under the rather stringent conditions chosen here only PPARα bound TIF2 (lanes 11 and 15) and PPARδ complexed weakly with SRC-1 (lanes 18 and 22). Because of efficient interaction of RAC3 with all three PPAR subtypes, we concentrated for the remaining experiments of this study on PPARγ2 and RAC3. In supershift assays PPARγ2-RXR, CAR-RXR, and VDR-RXR heterodimers were compared in the absence and presence of their agonists rosiglitazone, CITCO, and 1α,25(OH)2D3, respectively, at graded amounts (0-10 μg) of RAC3 (Fig. 2B). In absence of agonist VDR showed no interaction with the CoA (lanes 26-30), but in the presence of 1α,25(OH)2D3 the receptor bound RAC3 already at the lowest RAC3 concentration (lanes 31-36). In contrast, with CAR already low concentrations of RAC3 induced a supershift in an agonist-independent fashion (lanes 14-18"

Previous studies have established that the SCV transiently interacts with early endosomes but only acquires a subset of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins. However, the complete set of interactions between the SCV and the endocytic machinery has yet to be characterized. In this study, we have shown that four characterized regulators of endocytic recycling were present on the SCV after invasion. Interaction kinetics were different for each of the regulators; ARF6 and Rab4 associated immediately, but their presence was diminished 60 min post-infection, whereas syntaxin13 and Rab11 association peaked at 60 min. Using a dominant negative approach, we determined that Rab11 regulates the recycling of CD44 from the vacuole but had no effect on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I recycling. In contrast, syntaxin13 regulated the recycling of MHC class I but not of CD44. We also determined that maturation of the SCV, measured by the acquisition of lysosomal associated membrane protein-1, slowed when recycling was impaired. These findings suggest that protein movement through the endocytic recycling system is regulated through at least two concurrent pathways and that efficient interaction with these pathways is necessary for maturation of the Salmonella-containing vacuole. We also demonstrate the utility of using Salmonella invasion as a model of endosomal recycling events.

We also demonstrate the utility of using Salmonella invasion as a model of endosomal recycling events. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for disease across species, ranging from gastroenteritis to enteric fever (1Tsolis R.M. Kingsley R.A. Townsend S.M. Ficht T.A. Adams L.G. Baumler A.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 473: 261-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Invasion into the intestinal epithelia of the host is modeled in vitro using epithelial cell cultures, which have provided a wealth of information regarding the pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhimurium (reviewed by Hurley and McCormick) (2Hurley B.P. McCormick B.A. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 562-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Uptake into epithelial cells is directed through the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) 1The abbreviations used are: SPI, Salmonella pathogenicity island; ARF, ADP ribosylation factor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LAMP, lysosomal associated membrane protein; MHC, major histocompatability complex; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; p.i., post-infection; SCV, Salmonella-containing vacuole; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor. 1 type III secretion system, a needle-like device protruding from the bacterial cell wall that delivers bacterial virulence proteins into host cells (3Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The virulence proteins, called effectors, are translocated from the bacteria into the host cytosol where they direct actin rearrangements leading to membrane ruffling, which results in uptake of the bacteria (4Galan J.E. Zhou D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8754-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Once inside, the bacteria reside in a membrane-bound compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and establish a replicative niche. Recently, an active SPI-1 system has been shown to be necessary for the intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella Typhimurium in epithelial cells (5Steele-Mortimer O. Brumell J.H. Knodler L.A. Meresse S. Lopez A. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Early in the infection of epithelial cells (up to ∼15 min), trafficking of the SCV resembles that of model phagosomes (reviewed by Brumell and Grinstein) (6Brumell J.H. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Markers such as the early endosome antigen-1 (7Steele-Mortimer O. Méresse S. Gorvel J-P. Toh B.-H. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and the GTPase Rab5 (8Roberts R.L. Barbieri M.A. Ullrich J. Stahl P.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar) are transiently present on the SCV, indicative of interactions with early endosomes. These are rapidly removed, followed by the acquisition of several late endosome/lysosome markers, including Rab7 (9Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Gorvel J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (10Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, acquisition of lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) is dependent on Rab7 activity (9Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Gorvel J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); yet, despite the presence of active Rab7 on the early SCV (11Harrison R.E. Brumell J.H. Khandani A. Bucci C. Scott C.C. Jiang X. Finlay B.B. Grinstein S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the bacteria avoid or delay fusion with late endosomes/lysosomes that carry LAMP-1. This is shown by the lack of mannose-6-phosphate receptor, cathepsin D, and lysobisphosphatidic acid on the SCV during the first 3 h post-infection (p.i.) (10Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12Brumell J.H. Tang P. Mills S.D. Finlay B.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Understanding the pathways behind these events may lead to an elucidation of the mechanisms Salmonella Typhimurium uses to direct its intracellular fate in host cells. To do this, it is necessary to characterize the interactions of the SCV with the host endocytic system from invasion onward. The ruffling that occurs during Salmonella invasion induces the internalization of plasma membrane to form the SCV as well as other endosomes. These endosomes can be empty or they may contain nearby Salmonella or inert “bystander” particles (13Francis C.L. Ryan T.A. Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4641-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Terebiznik M.R.

Included on the SCV and surrounding endosomes are plasma membrane proteins that have been shown to aggregate at the site of invasion (16Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two such proteins are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, involved in the presentation of peptides to T cells (17Townsend A.R. Gotch F.M. Davey J. Cell. 1985; 42: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), and CD44, the receptor for hyaluronic acid involved in adhesion (18Haynes B.F. Telen M.J. Hale L.P. Denning S.M. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 423-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The presence of these proteins on the surface of the SCV decreases over time (16Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that active recycling is taking place. Endocytic recycling is necessary for phagosomal maturation (19Collins R.F. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Damiani M.T. Pavarotti M. Leiva N. Lindsay A.J. McCaffrey M.W. Colombo M.I. Traffic. 2004; 5: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but its role in SCV maturation remains unclear. Endocytic recycling is a complex process involving multiple compartments and trafficking events (reviewed by Maxfield and McGraw) (21Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Regulation of this process involves many protein families including Rab proteins, small GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking. These proteins modulate four key processes, namely vesicle budding, targeting, docking, and fusion, by recruiting cellular effector proteins to a specific membrane microdomain (reviewed by Zerial and McBride) (22Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Rab4 localizes to early endosomes and regulates early sorting events from there (23Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 24Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. J.

Syntaxins are soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) involved in vesicular tethering and fusion (reviewed by Chen and Scheller) (37Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Syntaxin13 localizes to the perinuclear region and is involved in the fusion events required for recycling (19Collins R.F. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J.

Studies of endocytic recycling compartments have shown that specific cargo is able to move through different kinetic pathways (23Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J.

However, it is often not clear which regulators are specific for which pathway or which cargo. Here we characterized the interaction of recycling proteins with the SCV. Moreover, we demonstrated that recycling from the SCV could occur through at least two independent, concurrent pathways that are influenced separately by syntaxin13 and Rab11. Finally, we showed that active recycling is required for efficient maturation of the SCV. These experiments revealed the utility of using Salmonella Typhimurium as a model for the study of membrane recycling events in mammalian cells. Cell Culture and Bacterial Strains—HeLa (human epithelial cell line) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 without antibiotics. Cultures were used between passage numbers 3–25. Wild type Salmonella Typhimurium SL 1344 (42Hoiseth S.K. Stocker B.A. Nature. 1981; 291: 238-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) was used in this study. Plasmids and Transfection—The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ARF6 construct was generated as described previously (43Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol.

Scidmore M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5855-5870Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). EGFP-Rab11S25N was constructed using QuikChange (Stratagene) using EGFP-Rab11A as a template with the mutagenic 5′ oligonucleotide (5′-GGTGTTGGAAAGAATAATCTCCTGTCTCG-3′) and the mutagenic 3′ oligonucleotide (5′-CGAGACAGGAGATTATTCTTTCCAACACC-3′). Syntaxin13-EGFP and syntaxin13ΔTM were gifts from Dr. William Trimble (University of Toronto and the Division of Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (19Collins R.F. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Gene-Juice transfection reagent (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) was used for transient transfection of cells with plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—Murine monoclonal anti-human CD44 antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab11 antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Murine monoclonal anti-human HLA-ABC antibodies were obtained from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Salmonella Typhimurium O antiserum group B were obtained from Difco (Kansas City, MO). Murine monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Murine monoclonal anti-human FK2 antibodies were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Murine monoclonal anti-human LAMP-1 antibodies (clone H4A3) developed by T. August were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. The secondary antibodies used were Alexa 350-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 350-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG, and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG, all obtained from Molecular Probes (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Bacterial Infection of Cell Cultures—HeLa epithelial cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates 40–45 h before use. Epithelial cells were transfected 16–20 h before use. Late log bacterial cultures were used for infecting HeLa cells and prepared using a method optimized for bacterial invasion (7Steele-Mortimer O. Méresse S. Gorvel J-P. Toh B.-H. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In brief, bacteria were grown for ∼16 h at 37 °C with shaking and then sub-cultured (1:33) in Luria-Bertani broth for 3 h. Bacterial inocula were prepared by pelleting at 10,000 × g for 2 min, directly resuspended, diluted in PBS (pH 7.2), and added to cells at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100:1 at 37 °C for 10 min. After infection, extracellular bacteria were removed by extensive washing with PBS and the addition of growth medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Following 75 min of bacterial infection, the gentamicin concentration was decreased to 10 μg/ml. Cells were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, for 10–15 min at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence—Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized/blocked by treatment with 0.2% saponin (Calbiochem) in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (SS-PBS) for 30–60 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were overlaid on coverslips in SS-PBS for 30 min to 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto 1-mm glass sides using fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Samples were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope (63× objective). Confocal sections were imported into Adobe Photoshop in RGB format and assembled in Adobe Illustrator. A Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope was used to enumerate the association of different proteins with the SCV. The percentage of SCV co-localizing with each host cell protein was calculated as the ratio between bacteria exhibiting the host cell protein and the total number of bacteria. Co-localization was determined visually, with a distinct signal surrounding the bacteria considered positive. This was determined for at least 100 bacteria. The average ± S.D. for at least three experiments is presented. For live cell imaging, HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP-Rab11 and then infected as described above with Salmonella Typhimurium expressing the DsRed protein from the plasmid pIZ1590, generously provided by Dr. Francisco Ramos-Morales (Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain) (46Segura I. Casadesus J. Ramos-Morales F. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2004; 56: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were then mounted on a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope with a heated stage. Images were acquired every 30 s through the duration of the experiment. All images were obtained with cells kept at 37 °C in RPMI media buffered to pH 7.2 with HEPES. For bacterial replication, a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence microscope was used to enumerate the number of bacteria per cell. The number of intracellular bacteria was counted for at least 100 cells. The average ± S.D. for three experiments is presented.

Invasion has been described as being similar to macropinocytosis, because invasion of one bacteria causes a ruffling of the cell surface that drives the endocytosis of other bacteria into separate SCVs, as well as triggering the formation of multiple bacteria-free endosomes (13Francis C.L. Ryan T.A. Jones B.D. Smith S.J. Falkow S. Nature. 1993; 364: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 14Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Infect.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Previous analysis has shown that the receptors MHC class I and CD44 co-localize with the SCV upon the invasion of epithelial cells (16Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a large amount of each receptor is internalized during the invasion process and aggregates on endosomes near the site of bacterial entry (16Garcia-del Portillo F. Pucciarelli M.G. Jefferies W.A. Finlay B.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2005-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is depicted in Fig. 1. HeLa cells were infected with wild type Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344, fixed 30 or 180 min p.i., and immunostained for bacteria and for either MHC class I or CD44. An aggregation of MHC class I proteins was visible at the site of bacterial entry 30 min after infection (Fig. 1B) that was not present in uninfected cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, MHC class I noticeably co-localized with the SCV (Fig. 1B, Enlargement). Immunostaining for CD44 produced a similar result, with aggregation of receptors in the area of bacterial entry (Fig. 1E) and a direct co-localization with the SCV after 30 min (Fig. 1E, Enlargement). In both cases, receptor aggregation on endosomes was greatly reduced or no longer present after 180 min (Fig. 1, C and F), and there was little co-localization with the SCV. This loss of cell surface proteins from the SCV and invasion-induced endosomes suggested active recycling events occur on these compartments. Recruitment of Recycling Regulatory Proteins to the SCV—To address the mechanism by which CD44 and MHC class I are recycled from the SCV, we asked whether known recycling regulators were present on this compartment. EGFP-Rab4 associated transiently with the SCV (Fig. 2, A–C), with maximal association at 10 min p.i. and then diminishing until it was no longer present after 60 min (Fig. 2M). Similarly, ARF6 interacted with the SCV 10 min p.i., but co-localization was greatly reduced after 60 min in cells transfected with ARF6-HA (Fig. 2, D–F, and M). During bacterial invasion, ARF6 was noticeably present on membrane ruffles (data not shown). Other recycling regulators include syntaxin13 and Rab11. To examine the SNARE syntaxin13, cells transiently transfected with syntaxin13-EGFP were infected, fixed, and analyzed microscopically. Prior to invasion, syntaxin13-EGFP was distributed in the perinuclear region and in vesicles throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2G), consistent with previous reports (19Collins R.F. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, cells fixed 30 min p.i. showed that syntaxin13-EGFP clustered around intracellular bacteria (Fig. 2H) with clear co-localization with the SCV (Fig. 2H, inset, and M). After 180 min the aggregation had dispersed (Fig. 2I), and the majority of SCVs no longer co-localized with syntaxin13-EGFP (Fig. 2I, inset, and M). Similarly, Rab11 exhibited perinuclear and vesicular localization in HeLa cells immunostained with a monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2J), consistent with previous reports (23Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 25Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells fixed at 30 min post-invasion displayed an aggregation of Rab11 around the bacteria (Fig, 2K) as well as co-localization with the SCV (Fig. 2K, inset). After 180 min the aggregation was no longer present (Fig. 2L), and co-localization with the SCV had diminished (Fig. 2L, inset). The kinetics of Rab11 co-localization with the SCV showed maximum association (>50%) 60 min p.i. and declined to ∼35% by 180 min p.i. (Fig. 2M). Our data indicate multiple interactions of the SCV with recycling regulators, each having distinct kinetics of dynamic association with the SCV. Both syntaxin13 and Rab11 displayed a rapid recruitment of protein away from the perinuclear region to the area around the SCV (Fig. 2, H and K). Fig. 3 shows still images taken from live imaging of EGFP-Rab11 transfected cells (supplemental movie 1, available in the on-line version of this article). The majority of EGFP-Rab11 was in the perinuclear region 15 min p.i. By 18 min p.i., EGFP-Rab11 began to relocate to the site of bacterial entry. After 30 min the majority of EGFP-Rab11 was aggregated around the bacteria, and this continued up to 60 min. Thus, our findings demonstrate that a massive reorganization of the endosomal system occurs during infection, characterized by localized recruitment of recycling factors to the SCV and surrounding endosomes at the site of bacterial entry. Syntaxin13 and Rab11 Regulate Recycling of Host Cell Surface Proteins from the SCV—Because the presence of syntaxin13 and Rab11 on the SCV coincided with the time of CD44 and MHC class I recycling, we set out to determine whether these recycling factors played a role in the removal of cell surface proteins from the SCV. To test the role of syntaxin13 in receptor recycling, a dominant negative construct (syntaxin13ΔTM, a cytoplasmic portion of which is thought to form a stable complex with endogenous SNAREs, thereby competing off the wild-type SNARE) (19Collins R.F. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with EGFP. Co-transfection with EGFP allows determination of transfected cells when one construct lacks a visualization tag (syntaxin13ΔTM). After invasion, cells were fixed and immunostained for bacteria and for either MHC class I or CD44. Aggregation of MHC class I was present in control cells and in cells expressing syntaxin13ΔTM at 30 min p.i. (Fig. 4, A and B). However, unlike control cells (Fig. 4A), the aggregation of MHC class I proteins in syntaxin13ΔTM-expressing cells continued up to 180 min p.i. (Fig. 4B) in some cells. Thus, a dominant negative form of syntaxin13 leads to an inhibition of recycling, as shown by the continued aggregation of MHC class I proteins. To quantify this inhibition, we took advantage of the large, well defined vacuole created by Salmonella Typhimurium. The presence or absence of MHC class I on the SCV was a clear indicator of recycling from a specific vacuole. Quantification of association showed MHC class I co-localized equally (∼ 70%) with control cells after 30 min, but cells expressing the syntaxin13ΔTM construct had ∼15% more SCVs co-localized with MHC class I at 60 and 120 min (Fig. 6A). Co-localization was the same in control cells and in those expressing syntaxin13ΔTM at 180 min (Fig. 6A). These findings are consistent with the effect of this construct on the aggregation of MHC class I proteins near the SCV. A small change in the recycling rate would be expected to delay the removal of cell surface markers from the large amounts of endosomal membrane near the SCV, and detection of these markers in aggregates would persist. Therefore, syntaxin13 played a"

However, nothing is known about the promoter regions of these genes or the transcription factors that regulate them. We cloned the promoter regions of creb1, creb2, and Ap-uch and identified a canonical cAMP-response element (CRE) in the promoter region of creb1. Variants of the canonical CRE were identified in all three promoters. TATA boxes and C/EBP-binding motifs are also present in the promoter regions of these genes. Promoter immunoprecipitation assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that CREB1 and CREB2 bind to the promoter regions of creb1 and creb2, suggesting that feedback loops modulate the formation of long term memory. In a positive feedback loop, phosphorylated CREB1 might induce its own gene via CREs. In support of this suggestion, treatment with serotonin enhanced binding of CREB1 to its promoter region and increased mRNA levels of creb1. Levels of Ap-uch mRNA also increased in response to serotonin; however, binding of CREB1 or CREB2 to the promoter region of Ap-uch was not detected. The finding that the promoter region of creb2 has a CRE raises the intriguing possibility that its expression is regulated by CREB1 and/or CREB2. CREB2 may repress its own gene, forming a negative feedback loop, and CREB2 up-regulation via CREB1 may limit the activity of the CREB1-mediated positive feedback loop.

Regulation of Ap-uch by CREB1 or CREB2 has not been examined, and the plausibility of the Ap-uch feedback loop has not been assessed.We report the cloning and sequencing of the promoter regions of creb1, creb2, and Ap-uch in Aplysia. We have identified putative CRE sequences, TATA boxes and C/EBP-binding motifs within each promoter region. We showed in a promoter immunoprecipitation assay that CREB1 and CREB2 proteins bind to their own gene promoter regions but not to the Ap-uch promoter region. These findings were confirmed and extended using in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Finally, we report the induction of creb1 and Ap-uch in pleural ganglia following 5-HT treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSAplysia Genome WalkingAplysia genomic DNA was isolated, digested with PvuII and StuI (Promega), and ligated with the GenomeWalker adaptor DNA (Universal GenomeWalker kit, Clontech). The genomic fragments were used as templates for PCR with an adaptor primer (AP1, 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′, or AP2, 5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGT-3′) and a gene-specific primer (see below). The PCR product (<1 kbp) was subjected to electrophoresis, extracted from agarose gel, and subcloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). The cloned fragment was sequenced by the automated DNA sequence analyzer (ABI model 7000) at the DNA Core Facility, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, using M13 universal primers. The following gene-specific primers were used in the genome walks: for creb1, first genomic walk, 65TGCTGCAATCGGAGTGGATAAATTTGC39 (based on Ref. 19Bartsch D. Casadio A. Karl K.A. Serodio P.

The genomic DNA sequences were analyzed for promoter sequence homology to CREB-binding motifs, TATA boxes, and C/EBP-binding motifs using the Transcription Element Search System software (TESS; URL, www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) that surveyed the TRANSFAC eukaryotic data base using default settings. Annotated sequences of the promoter regions of the three genes were obtained using a minimum log likelihood ratio (ta) of 6.0 and a maximum log likelihood deficit (td) of 8.0 (default; combined query option).5′RACEBecause only a portion of the exon I (5′-untranslated region (5′UTR)) is published for Aplysia creb1, we performed 5′RACE by using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) to obtain the remaining portion of the 5′UTR. 5′RACE PCR was performed using the adaptor primer provided in the kit and the gene-specific primer from the first creb1 genome walk. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR 2.1 TOPO TA vector, and the cloned fragment was sequenced as mentioned above. We also performed 5′RACE for creb2 and Ap-uch using the same primers given above for the respective genome walking assays.QRT-PCR Analysis of creb1, creb2, and Ap-uch mRNANaive animals were anesthetized by injection of isotonic MgCl2 equal to one-half of the body weight, and the two pairs of pleural-pedal ganglia were surgically removed. Each pair of ganglia was randomly assigned to either a control or a 5-HT group. Following trimming of the connective tissue sheath in isotonic MgCl2:ASW (1:1 v/v), ganglia in both groups were rinsed with L15:ASW (1:1 v/v) and rested at 18 °C for 1-2 h. Subsequently, groups were treated with five 5-min pulses of either vehicle (L15:ASW) or 50 μm 5-HT with an interpulse interval of 20 min. At the end of the treatment, ganglia were rinsed with L15:ASW, rapidly frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until further processing. The composition of ASW and modified L15 has been published elsewhere (33Phares G.A. Antzoulatos E.G. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8392-8401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang F.

Total RNA was isolated from frozen ganglia by the Trizol method (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. The quantification of the mRNAs was done by QRT-PCR, conducted in the Quantitative Genomics Core Laboratory of the Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, using a 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, CA) and following published procedures (35Wall S.M.

The inserts were then separately cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (which codes for glutathione S-transferase (GST)) at the EcoRI site (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 following standard procedures (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and purified through GST affinity columns. The GST moiety was cleaved from the fusion proteins using thrombin (20 units per ml of PBS, incubated for 30 min at 22 °C) (Amersham Biosciences).Affinity-purified Antibodies against CREB ProteinsThe CREB1 and CREB2 peptides and the antibodies were raised by a commercial vendor (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., South San Francisco, CA).Antibodies for CREB1—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the Ser85-phosphorylated (underlined) and the unphosphorylated versions of the bovine serum albumin-conjugated CREB1 peptide KKRREILTRRPSYRK. Each antibody was purified through affinity columns made with the respective peptide. The phospho-specific CREB1 antibody was further purified through a second affinity column with a nonphosphorylated peptide.Antibodies for CREB2—By using the same approach as for CREB1, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated versions of a CREB2 hybrid peptide constructed to juxtapose the sequences immediately surrounding two putative MAPK phosphorylation sites. The peptide sequence is SPPDSPEQGPSSPET, with phosphate groups chemically added on Ser152 (1st underline) and Ser237 (2nd underline) for the phospho-peptide. Purification of the two CREB2 antibodies was performed following the same procedure as for CREB1 antibodies.Promoter Immunoprecipitation AssayCloned promoters and either recombinant CREB or CNS lysate were used in an assay modified from Guan et al. (17Guan Z. Giustetto M. Lomvardas S. Kim J.H. Miniaci M.C. Schwartz J.H. Thanos D. Kandel E.R. Cell. 2002; 111: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The promoter fragments were isolated from the pCR 2.1 vector by digestion with restriction enzymes and separated by electrophoresis. These cloned fragments included the 5′UTRs of creb2 and Ap-uch; creb1 promoter fragments were constructed with or without the 5′UTR to examine the effect of the canonical CRE within the 5′UTR (Fig. 1A2) on the binding of CREB proteins. Approximately 10 ng of DNA was incubated for 3 h at 22 °C with 5 μg of purified recombinant CREB protein (or 200 μg of protein from total CNS) in 100 μl of PBST (PBS containing 0.05% of Tween 20). At the end of incubation, 5 μl of total CREB1 antibody and 5 μl of phospho-CREB1 antibody (or total CREB2 and phospho-CREB2 antibody) were added together to the reaction mixture, to maximize the immunoprecipitation, and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. In control experiments, 10 μl of preimmune rabbit sera replaced the specific antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry in PBST; 25 μl) was added to the mixture, which was then incubated for at least 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed in PBST to remove any unbound material and was resuspended in 25 μl of PBST. Two μl of this washed material was used for PCR (30 cycles) using gene-specific primers and Adaptor Primer 2 (see Aplysia genome walking section).Protein amounts were estimated by a modified Lowry method (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). Total RNA was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Beckman DU 530 spectrophotometer.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were as described in Weinmann et al. (38Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, pleural-pedal ganglia were isolated and treated with 5 pulses of 5-HT or vehicle, as described above. Immediately after the treatment, the ganglia were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature with rotation to cross-link proteins to DNA. The reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine (final concentration, 0.125 m). Following cell lysis (in 400 μl of lysis buffer: 10 mm HEPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors, nuclei were recovered by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing protease inhibitors, and sonicated six times for 10 s each time on ice to shear the genomic DNA to lengths of 0.3-1.3 kb. The lysates were then diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, pH 8.1). A portion of diluted lysate was kept for input control. Subsequently, the lysate was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by brief centrifugation to pull down the beads. Two μg of anti-tCREB1 (or anti-tCREB2) were added to the supernatant fraction and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. For the negative control, preimmune serum replaced the specific antibody. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed sequentially with low salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), high salt washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), LiCl washing buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). After washing, the immune complexes were eluted by two 15-min incubations with 150 μl of freshly made elution buffer (1% SDS and 50 mm NaHCO3). The two fractions of eluates were combined, and cross-linking was reversed by addition of NaCl (final concentration, 0.3 m) followed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. After treatment with proteinase K for 2 h at 45 °C, DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in H2O, and a small aliquot was analyzed by PCR using primers specific for the various promoter regions containing CREs. The PCR primer sequences (5′ to 3′ direction) were as follows: for creb1, forward primer 1 (fp1), CTATAAATATATCCCTCACGCGTCAGC, and reverse primer 1 (rp1), GAATACGTAGTGGCCACGTCAAAAGTC; fp2, AATGTCTAAAGCCACTAAGCAAGCC, and rp2, CATCAATACAAACTGCTCGAAGTTAG; fp3, TATTCATTAAGTACCGGTACCAAG, and rp3, AATTCTTTCAAGTCCGTGCCACAAC; for creb2, fp, CTAGATCTGTCAGGTGGCCTATCAC, and rp, GAGATTGAGATATTCCCGATTGAAGG; for Ap-uch, fp, GCATTAAAGACTAGACTCTAGACTC, and rp, AGATTCTAGATCTACCGGCAAGTAC.RESULTSThe creb1, creb2, and Ap-uch Promoter Regions Each Contain Variant CRE Sequences, and creb1 Contains a Canonical CRE—We cloned and sequenced 736 bp upstream of exon I using a gene-specific primer in the middle of the published sequence of exon I (19Bartsch D. Casadio A. Karl K.A. Serodio P. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S1; GenBank™ accession number DQ028783). Two rounds of genome walking to obtain the sequence of the creb1 promoter region were followed by 5′RACE analysis to establish the putative TSS. Analysis of the genomic sequence of creb1 upstream of the TSS by the TESS program (see “Materials and Methods”) revealed three variant CREs: TGATGTCA at -79 bp, TGA GTCA at -465 bp, and TGCACGTG at -606 bp. Downstream of the TSS, a canonical CRE, TGACGTCA, was identified at +141 bp as well as a variant CRE, TGACGTGG, at +265 bp in exon I. Variant CREs have asymmetrical or partial sequences that differ from the canonical sequence (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) by single or multiple nucleotide deletions or substitutions (39Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Craig J.C. Schumacher M.A. Mansoor S.E. Farrens D.L. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. J. Biol.

Putative TATA boxes were identified at -190 bp (Figs. 1A and supplemental S1) and at other locations further upstream. Putative C/EBP-binding motifs were identified throughout the promoter region (not shown).By employing the same strategy, we cloned the promoter regions of creb2 and Ap-uch, using primers downstream of the Met initiation codons. The creb2 promoter region has a single variant CRE, TGACGACC, at -331 bp, and a TATA box at -243 bp (Figs. 1B and supplemental S2; GenBank™ acc"
https://openalex.org/W2007616262,"Why is the south polar cap of Mars not at the geographic south pole? Since the early observations of Mars in the nineteenth century, the peculiar offset of the martian south polar perennial cap of frozen carbon dioxide, and the existence of a dark ‘cryptic’ region seen in the adjacent hemisphere have puzzled planetary scientists. A combination of observations and climate modelling now suggests that the offset of the cap and creation of the cryptic region are the result of two very distinct climate regimes generated by atmospheric flow interacting with the southernmost extent of the giant volcano Tharsis, and the large impact basins Argyre and Hellas. The nature of the martian south polar cap has remained enigmatic since the first spacecraft observations1,2,3,4,5,6. In particular, the presence of a perennial carbon dioxide ice cap, the formation of a vast area of black ‘slab ice’ known as the Cryptic region and the asymmetric springtime retreat of the cap have eluded explanation. Here we present observations and climate modelling that indicate the south pole of Mars is characterized by two distinct regional climates that are the result of dynamical forcing by the largest southern impact basins, Argyre and Hellas. The style of surface frost deposition is controlled by these regional climates. In the cold and stormy conditions that exist poleward of 60° S and extend 180° in longitude west from the Mountains of Mitchel (∼ 30° W), surface frost accumulation is dominated by precipitation. In the opposite hemisphere, the polar atmosphere is relatively warm and clear and frost accumulation is dominated by direct vapour deposition. It is the differences in these deposition styles that determine the cap albedo."
https://openalex.org/W1963799259,"5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) is formed via a second catalytic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and strongly inhibits SHMT and other folate-dependent enzymes in vitro. The only enzyme known to metabolize 5-CHO-THF is 5-CHO-THF cycloligase (5-FCL), which catalyzes its conversion to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. Because 5-FCL is mitochondrial in plants and mitochondrial SHMT is central to photorespiration, we examined the impact of an insertional mutation in the Arabidopsis 5-FCL gene (At5g13050) under photorespiratory (30 and 370 μmol of CO2 mol–1) and non-photorespiratory (3200 μmol of CO2 mol–1) conditions. The mutation had only mild visible effects at 370 μmol of CO2 mol–1, reducing growth rate by ∼20% and delaying flowering by 1 week. However, the mutation doubled leaf 5-CHO-THF level under all conditions and, under photorespiratory conditions, quadrupled the pool of 10-formyl-/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates (which could not be distinguished analytically). At 370 μmol of CO2 mol–1, the mitochondrial 5-CHO-THF pool was 8-fold larger in the mutant and contained most of the 5-CHO-THF in the leaf. In contrast, the buildup of 10-formyl-/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates was extramitochondrial. In photorespiratory conditions, leaf glycine levels were up to 46-fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type. Furthermore, when leaves were supplied with 5-CHO-THF, glycine accumulated in both wild type and mutant. These data establish that 5-CHO-THF can inhibit SHMT in vivo and thereby influence glycine pool size. However, the near-normal growth of the mutant shows that even exceptionally high 5-CHO-THF levels do not much affect fluxes through SHMT or any other folate-dependent reaction, i.e. that 5-CHO-THF is well tolerated in plants. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) is formed via a second catalytic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and strongly inhibits SHMT and other folate-dependent enzymes in vitro.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 5-CHO-THF is the most stable natural folate and the most enigmatic, for it is the only one that does not serve as a cofactor in one-carbon metabolism. Instead, 5-CHO-THF is a potent inhibitor of SHMT and most other folate-dependent enzymes in vitro (4Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 374: 773-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This question is particularly pertinent for leaves. Leaf mitochondria have very high levels of SHMT and, during photorespiration, receive a massive influx of glycine (which leads to a matching SHMT-mediated glycine → serine flux) (9Douce R. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Conditions in leaf mitochondria therefore favor 5-CHO-THF formation (Fig. 1). Indeed, 5-CHO-THF can comprise 50% of the folate pool in leaf mitochondria (10Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Pteridines. 2003; 14: 67-76Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which is far more than in mammalian mitochondria (12Horne D.W. Patterson D. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem.

Wagner C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-CHO-THF is reported to make up 14–40% of the folate pool in leaves and other metabolically active plant organs (10Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Cossins E.A. Can. J.

Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also something of an enigma. For one thing, despite the inhibitory effects of its substrate, 5-FCL is not essential in yeast: 5-FCL disruptants had 4-fold more 5-CHO-THF but no other new phenotype (2Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For another, phylogenomic profiling (17von Mering C. Huynen M. Jaeggi D. Schmidt S. Bork P. Snel B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 18Enault F. Suhre K. Poirot O. Abergel C. Claverie J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W336-W339Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) indicates that some bacteria lack 5-FCL even though they have SHMT. Lastly, 5-FCL overexpression in human cells lowered the folate level and raised folate turnover rate, suggesting that 5-FCL may have a second function as a folate-degrading enzyme (19Anguera M.C.

Another intriguing feature of 5-FCL is that its subcellular location differs among eukaryotes. Whereas the enzyme is largely if not solely cytosolic in yeast and mammals (2Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J.

Taken with the key role of mitochondrial SHMT in photorespiration, with the inhibition of SHMT by 5-CHO-THF, and with the presence of 5-CHO-THF in leaf mitochondria, the location of plant 5-FCL implies (i) that this enzyme governs mitochondrial 5-CHO-THF levels and (ii) that, via its effect on 5-CHO-THF levels, 5-FCL could regulate the in vivo activities of SHMT and other folate-linked mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 1). To investigate such regulatory functions for 5-FCL and 5-CHO-THF, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis 5-FCL insertional mutant. This mutant had greatly elevated mitochondrial 5-CHO-THF levels and hyperaccumulated glycine under photorespiratory conditions. However, the mutant grew almost normally in ambient air, indicating that folate-dependent metabolic reactions in plants are substantially tolerant to 5-CHO-THF. Chemical and Reagents—Folates were from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). 10-Formyldihydrofolate was prepared from (6R,6S)-5-CHO-THF as described (22Baggott J.E. Johanning G.L. Branham K.E.

Plants and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown at 22–28 °C in 12-h days (photosynthetic photon flux density 80 μE m–2 s–1) in potting soil irrigated with water. Material was lyophilized to determine dry weight. In experiments at various CO2 levels, plants were grown for 4 weeks in ambient air (∼370 μmol of CO2 mol–1), then either kept in ambient air or transferred to high CO2 (3200 ± 40 μmol mol–1) or low CO2 (30 ± 20 μmol mol–1) conditions for 5 days. CO2 levels were monitored with a Vernier CO2 sensor (Vernier Software and Technology, Beaverton, OR). Arabidopsis Mutant—A 5-FCL mutant (28D07) was identified in the Syngenta T-DNA insertion collection (ecotype Columbia) (23Sessions A. Burke E. Presting G. Aux G. McElver J. Patton D. Dietrich B. Ho P. Bacwaden J. Ko C. Clarke J.D. Cotton D. Bullis D. Snell J. Miguel T. Hutchison D. Kimmerly B. Mitzel T. Katagiri F. Glazebrook J. Law M. Goff S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Segregants, wild type or homozygous for the mutation, were identified by PCR using gene-specific primers located 5′ or 3′ of the T-DNA insertion (5′-CTGAAGTGAGTGGCAACTACA-3′ and 5′-GTCTCACTTCTTCTCTTACCTT-3′, respectively) and the T-DNA-specific primer 5′-GCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATC-3′. DNA was extracted by the “Shorty” protocol available on the website of the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The insertion site was confirmed by sequencing. Gel Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from 0.1-g samples of rosette leaves using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase (DNA-free™ kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA samples were separated by formaldehyde-1.5% agarose gel (25 μg/lane) and blotted to Protran® nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), hybridized for 4 h at 65 °C in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μgml–1 sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C. The 5-FCL probe was a 373-bp NdeI-XhoI fragment of pET28b-At5FCL (4Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42748-42754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) corresponding to the 3′-half of the 5-FCL open reading frame (Fig. 2A). The rRNA probe was a 0.9-kb SmaI fragment of a Zamia pumila clone (24Nairn C.J. Ferl R.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated as described (25Lassner M.W. Peterson P. Yoder J.I. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1989; 7: 116-128Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar) from 2 g of leaves pooled from 20 plants, digested, separated by 0.8% agarose gel (5 μg/lane), and blotted to Protran® membrane. Blots were hybridized as above and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 37 °C. The probe was a 436-bp fragment of the bar gene amplified using the primers 5′-CATCGTCAACCACTACATCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGTCCAGCTGCCAGAAAC-3′ (reverse). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method. Hybridization was detected by autoradiography. Folate Analysis—Folates were extracted from leaf tissue (0.5 g) by Polytron homogenization in 10 ml of 50 mm Na-HEPES, 50 mm CHES, adjusted to pH 7.9 with HCl, containing 2% (w/v) sodium ascorbate, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 1), followed by boiling for 10 min and then centrifuging (13,000 × g, 10 min). The pellet was re-extracted the same way, and the extracts were combined. Mitochondria were extracted once with 5 ml of buffer 1. Extracts were treated with 1 ml (leaves) or 0.5 ml (mitochondria) of dialyzed rat plasma at 37 °C for 2 h to deglutamylate folates. Samples were then boiled for 15 min, centrifuged, filtered, and applied to folate affinity columns prepared as described (26Gregory III, J.F. Toth J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Column volume was reduced to 1 ml for mitochondria. After washing columns with 5 ml (2.5 ml for mitochondria) of 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, plus 1% sodium ascorbate (buffer 2) containing 1 m NaCl, then with 5 ml (2.5 ml for mitochondria) of buffer 2 alone, they were eluted with 5 ml (1 ml for mitochondria) of HPLC mobile phase A (see below) containing 1% ascorbic acid. Eluate samples (400 μl) were analyzed by HPLC (27Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using a Prodigy 5-μm ODS2 column (150 × 3.2 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and a four-channel electrochemical detector (CoulArray Model 5600A, ESA, Chelmsford, MA) with potentials set at 0, 300, 500, and 600 mV. The mobile phase was a binary mixture of 28 mm K2HPO4 and 0.59 mm H3PO4, pH 2.5 (A) and a mixture of 75% (v/v) A and 25% CH3CN (B) with a 55-min nonlinear elution program from 90% A to 100% B at 1 ml min–1. Detector response was calibrated with authentic tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyl-THF (5-CH3-THF), 5,10-CH=THF, 5-CHO-THF, 10-formyldihydrofolate, and folic acid. Amino Acid Analysis—Leaf tissue (∼160 mg) was frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized, weighed, and pulverized. The resulting powder was extracted by shaking with 0.5 ml each of water and CHCl3 and was then stored at –20 °C for 24 h before centrifugation. Ribitol and γ-aminobutyric acid were added as internal standards. For HPLC, 20 μl of the aqueous phase was derivatized with AccQ·Fuor™ reagent (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidylcarbamate; Waters, Milford, MA) in a final volume of 100 μl, and a 20-μl aliquot was analyzed by HPLC-fluorescence according to Waters' recommendations. For GC-MS, aqueous phase aliquots equivalent to 0.625 mg dry weight were dried under N2 and methoximated and trimethylsilylated in pyridine (final volume 50 μl) as described (28Duran A.L. Yang J. Wang L. Sumner L.W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). One μl of the derivatized mixture was injected (pulsed splitless injection, Agilent 6890 series autoinjector, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) onto a 60-m DB-5MS column (J&W Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph and a 5973 series Agilent quadrupole mass spectrometer as described (28Duran A.L. Yang J. Wang L. Sumner L.W. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria and SHMT Assays—Mitochondria were prepared from 15–30 g of leaves from 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants as described (29Yasuno R. Wada H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The pellet containing chloroplasts and mitochondria was suspended in 2 ml of a solution containing 20 mm TES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, applied to a step gradient composed of 2.5 ml of 21%, 5.5 ml of 26%, and 3 ml of 47% (v/v) Percoll, and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 45 min in a swinging bucket rotor. Mitochondria were recovered from the 26–47% Percoll interface, diluted 12-fold in 10 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 m sucrose, and then centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 20 min. This step was repeated twice. The final mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 300 μl of 10 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and stored under N2 at –80 °C until analysis. SHMT was assayed in mitochondrial extracts as described (4Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42748-42754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 5-CHO-THF Feeding—Three wild type and three mutant plants (5 weeks old) were washed free of soil, and their root systems were severed under water, leaving ∼0.5 cm of the main root. The plants were placed in Petri dishes containing 0 or 10 mm 5-CHO-THF in 0.5× Hoagland's nutrient solution and incubated in light (75 μE m–2 s–1) at 22 °C for 24 h. The plants were then washed, frozen in liquid N2, and lyophilized. Samples (100–150 mg) were taken for GC-MS analysis as above. Identification and Characterization of an Arabidopsis 5-FCL Mutant—A potential 5-FCL mutant was identified in the Torrey Mesa Research Institute T-DNA mutant collection (23Sessions A. Burke E. Presting G. Aux G. McElver J. Patton D. Dietrich B. Ho P. Bacwaden J. Ko C. Clarke J.D. Cotton D. Bullis D. Snell J. Miguel T. Hutchison D. Kimmerly B. Mitzel T. Katagiri F. Glazebrook J. Law M. Goff S.A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) via the sequence flanking the insert. Resequencing of this region confirmed the presence of an insert close to the 3′ end of the sixth intron, which is located within the protein-coding part of the gene (Fig. 2A). Plants homozygous for the mutation and their wild type siblings were identified by PCR and subjected to Southern analysis using a T-DNA sequence (a fragment of the bar gene) as probe (Fig. 2B). Only the mutant plants gave hybridizing bands, establishing that the T-DNA is inserted only at the 5-FCL locus. The multiple banding pattern in Fig. 2B indicates that several concatenated T-DNA copies are present at this locus. Northern analysis of leaf RNA showed no detectable 5-FCL transcript in the mutant (Fig. 2C), indicating a knock-out mutation. The homozygous mutants and their wild type siblings were therefore propagated for further work. When grown in soil at ambient levels of CO2 (∼370 μmol of CO2 mol–1), visible differences between mutant plants and their wild type siblings were modest. The growth rate of mutant plants was ∼20% lower (Fig. 2D), and they showed a flowering delay of about 1 week (Fig. 2E). There was no difference in leaf color or form (Fig. 2E). Folate Metabolic Profiling and Its Interpretation—Folates were treated with conjugase to convert them to monoglutamyl form, purified by affinity chromatography (26Gregory III, J.F. Toth J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and then separated by HPLC with electrochemical detection (27Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which was chosen for its selectivity and sensitivity. These procedures do not distinguish between 10-CHO-THF and 5,10-CH=THF, which are interconverted during sample processing and finally both measured as 5,10-CH=THF (27Bagley P.J. Selhub J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). (Efforts were made to preserve 5,10-CH=THF by extraction in maleate buffer (30Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to estimate it as an increase in 5-CH3-THF following NaBH4 reduction (31Horne D.W. Biggs W.T. Wagner C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but this maneuver gave poor results with plant samples.) Other HPLC-based procedures likewise fail to distinguish 10-CHO-THF from 5,10-CH=THF, measuring both as 10-CHO-THF (30Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus currently not feasible to determine the individual amounts of 10-CHO-THF and 5,10-CH=THF present in vivo, but only their sum (henceforth termed 10-CHO-/5,10-CH=THF). Similarly, it should be noted that 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-CH2-THF) dissociates completely to THF during processing so that THF measurements are the sum of THF and 5,10-CH2-THF (henceforth termed THF/5,10-CH2-THF). Folates in Leaves Exposed to Various CO2 Concentrations— Plants grown for 4 weeks in ambient air were transferred for 5 days to air containing 30 or 3200 μmol of CO2 mol–1 or kept in ambient air. The lower CO2 concentration, which is beneath the CO2 compensation point, stimulates photorespiration (and hence the glycine → serine flux rate in mitochondria) whereas the higher one suppresses it (32Marek L.F. Spalding M.H. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CO2 concentration had rather little effect on folate profiles so that the divergences between wild type and mutant leaves were generally similar in all three atmospheres (Fig. 3). As might be expected, 5-CHO-THF levels were higher in the mutant (2.1- to 2.6-fold, significant at p < 0.05). Less expectedly, 10-CHO-/5,10-CH=THF levels were also much higher in mutant leaves exposed to 370 and 30 μmol of CO2 mol–1. Added together, these differences made the total folate content of the mutant significantly higher at the two lower CO2 levels. Mitochondrial Folates—Because mitochondria in photorespiring leaves are expected to be the main site of 5-CHO-THF formation and the only site of its removal by 5-FCL (Fig. 1), we investigated the impact of the 5-FCL mutation on mitochondrial folate levels of plants grown in ambient air. Four separate mitochondrial preparations were made from wild type or mutant plants (Fig. 4). Despite some variability among the preparations, mitochondria from the mutant clearly showed massive 5-CHO-THF accumulation relative to wild type (on average 8-fold, significant at p < 0.01) and a 120% increase in total folate. The mitochondrial 5-CHO-THF content rose from a mean value of 15% of total mitochondrial folate in the wild type to a mean of 72% in the mutant. The mitochondrial contents of 5-CH3-THF and 10-CHO-/5,10-CH=THF did not change significantly in the mutant, nor did that of 10-formyldihydrofolate (which forms readily from 10-CHO-THF in isolated mitochondria, Ref. 33Brookes P.S. Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5633-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that no THF/5,10-CH2-THF was detected in any of the mutant mitochondrial preparations. As THF and 5,10-CH2-THF are the folates needed for glycine → serine conversion (Fig. 1), this emphasizes that the inhibitor: substrate ratio (5-CHO-THF:5,10-CH2-THF) for SHMT is probably very high in leaf mitochondria of the mutant. SHMT Activity in Mitochondria—The intramitochondrial 5-CHO-THF buildup in mutant plants, coupled with their fairly normal growth, led us to measure mitochondrial SHMT activities to check for a possible compensatory increase in the mutant. No such increase was found; SHMT activities in extracts of wild type and mutant mitochondria were 340 ± 32 and 336 ± 41 nmol min–1 mg–1 of protein, respectively (means ± S.E., n = 3). Free Amino Acids in Leaves Exposed to Various CO2 Concentrations—To establish whether the mitochondrial accumulation of 5-CHO-THF inhibits SHMT in vivo, we compared the glycine and serine contents of the leaves of wild type and mutant plants exposed for 5 days to 30, 370, or 3200 μmol of CO2 mol–1 (Fig. 5). As CO2 concentration declined, wild type leaves showed small increases in glycine whereas mutant leaves showed much larger ones, so that the glycine content of mutant leaves was 19-fold higher than the wild type at 370 μmol of CO2 mol–1 and 46-fold higher at 30 μmol mol–1. There was also a small accumulation of serine in the mutant relative to the wild type (1.4-fold at 370 μmol of CO2 mol–1, 1.8-fold at 30 μmol mol–1, both significant at p < 0.01). Besides serine, amino acids such as glutamate and alanine can act as amino donors in the formation of glycine from glyoxylate in the photorespiratory pathway (34Liepman A.H. Olsen L.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The levels of glutamate, alanine, and also aspartate were substantially reduced in the mutant compared with wild type at 30 μmol of CO2 mol–1 (Table I) but not at the other CO2 concentrations (not shown).Table ILevels of alanine, glutamate, and aspartate in leaves exposed to 30 μmol of CO2 mol-1Amino acidAmino acid levelWild typeMutantμmol g-1 dry wtAlanine0.80 ± 0.260.32 ± 0.03Glutamate2.55 ± 0.121.23 ± 0.10aDifferences between mutant and wild type that are significant at p < 0.05.Aspartate1.15 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.04aDifferences between mutant and wild type that are significant at p < 0.05.a Differences between mutant and wild type that are significant at p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Effect of Supplied 5-CHO-THF on Glycine and Serine Content—Because exogenous 5-CHO-THF is taken up by Arabidopsis and enters mitochondria (35Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of feeding 5-CHO-THF via the transpiration stream to illuminated wild type and mutant plants. Leaf glycine and serine levels were measured after 24 h of continuous light (Fig. 6). Consistent with in vivo inhibition of SHMT, 5-CHO-THF feeding raised glycine levels in wild type and mutant plants significantly (p < 0.05). The increase in glycine was larger in the mutant (9.4 versus 2.5 μmol g–1 dry weight). Our data demonstrate that 5-CHO-THF can inhibit the activity of mitochondrial SHMT in vivo and thus provide support for the view that 5-CHO-THF regulates one-carbon metabolism (5Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite its important implications, there is rather little evidence for or against this view, and it remains controversial (8Baggott J.E. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 773-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the most striking aspect of our findings is that 5-FCL ablation and the ensuing 5-CHO-THF buildup in mitochondria had so little impact on plant performance. A priori, this impact seemed likely to be devastating, above all to photorespiring leaves (4Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42748-42754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that plants are surprisingly tolerant of 5-CHO-THF, as presaged by earlier reports of remarkably high levels of this folate in leaf mitochondria (10Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Pteridines. 2003; 14: 67-76Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms could contribute to this tolerance. The first may be the ability of an expanded glycine pool to offset inhibition of SHMT by 5-CHO-THF. Assuming a matrix volume/protein ratio of 1–2 μl mg–1 (36Tobin A. Djerdjour B. Journet E. Neuburger M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 225-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of 5-CHO-THF in leaf mitochondria can be estimated from the data in Fig. 4 to be ∼0.25–0.5 mm in the wild type and ∼2–4 mm in the mutant. Because 5-CHO-THF levels as low as 0.05–0.1 mm significantly reduce mitochondrial SHMT activity in vitro (4Roje S. Janave M.T. Ziemak M.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42748-42754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the levels reached in the wild type would be expected to be inhibitory and those in the mutant even more so. In line with this prediction, the 5-FCL mutant accumulated more glycine than the wild type. The higher glycine level presumably compensated for the lower SHMT activity and drove a near normal flux through the vital glycine → serine reaction of photorespiration because, had it not done so, the 5-FCL mutation would have been lethal in ambient air, as are glycine decarboxylase or mitochondrial SHMT mutations (37Somerville C.R. Ogren W.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Somerville C.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 666-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to rule out the possibility that SHMT activity increased in the 5-FCL mutant. Another facet of tolerance to 5-CHO-THF may be its sequestration in mitochondria. Assuming that the soluble protein content of leaves is ∼10 mg g–1 fresh weight and that mitochondrial protein is ∼4% of the total (39Jabrin S. Ravanel S. Gambonnet B. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it can be estimated from the data of Figs. 3 and 4 that the mitochondria contain ∼50% of the total 5-CHO-THF in wild type leaves and ≥80% in mutant leaves. The basis for intramitochondrial retention of 5-CHO-THF may be that it is polyglutamylated, as are the bulk of mitochondrial folates (40Besson V. Rébeillé F. Neuburger M. Douce R. Cossins E.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and that mitochondrial folate transporters prefer monoglutamates, as do most other folate carriers (41Horne D.W. Holloway R.S. Said H.M. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Keeping much of the 5-CHO-THF inside mitochondria clearly reduces its potential to interfere with cytosolic or plastidial isoforms of folate enzymes. However, this is only a partial solution because plant mitochondria themselves contain various folate-dependent enzymes (42Hanson A.D. Gage D.A. Shachar-Hill Y. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 43Hanson A.D. Gregory III, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that, in other organisms, are sensitive to 5-CHO-THF (44Stover P. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2155-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These include dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase and isoforms of methionyl-tRNA transformylase, 5,10-CH=THF cyclohydrolase, 5,10-methylene-THF dehydrogenase, and the purine synthesis enzyme aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-riboside transformylase. It is therefore hard to escape the conclusion that another mechanism of plant tolerance to 5-CHO-THF is either relative insensitivity of mitochondrial enzymes to this compound or metabolic plasticity in the form of flux redistribution from mitochondrial to extramitochondrial isoforms, where the latter exist. Some support for flux redistribution comes from the accumulation of 10-CHO-/5,10-CH=THF in photorespiring mutant plants. This must have been outside mitochondria as the mitochondrial 10-CHO-/5,10-CH=THF pool did not change. Perhaps the extramitochondrial pool expands because of interference with mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism and then drives compensating fluxes through non-mitochondrial reactions. Although 10-CHO-THF and 5,10-CH=THF could not be distinguished analytically, it seems probable that 10-CHO-THF predominates in vivo because the chemical equilibrium between the two forms lies strongly (∼95%) toward 10-CHO-THF at physiological pH (30Tabor H. Wyngarden L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1830-1846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent insensitivity could be due, in part at least, to the sheer abundance of mitochondrial folate-dependent enzymes: SHMT and glycine decarboxylase alone constitute up to 40% of soluble mitochondrial protein (45Mouillon J.M. Aubert S. Bourguignon J. Gout E. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Plant J. 1999; 20: 197-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At such high abundances, it can be calculated from the data of Fig. 4 that even in mutant mitochondria, containing ∼4 nmol of 5-CHO-THF mg–1 of protein, folate binding sites probably still outnumber 5-CHO-THF molecules. Furthermore, binding of 5-CHO-THF to SHMT and glycine decarboxylase may decrease the inhibition of other folate-dependent enzymes in mitochondria. Because 5-CHO-THF is quite chemically stable and 5-FCL is the only enzyme known to metabolize it, the action of SHMT in a 5-FCL mutant would in the long run be expected to convert much of the cellular folate pool to 5-CHO-THF, especially under photorespiratory conditions. That the total leaf 5-CHO-THF pool increased no more than 2.6-fold (to a maximum of 31% of total folate) suggests that there may be another, unknown, way to metabolize 5-CHO-THF, or in effect to detoxify it, and that this contributes to tolerance. The same may hold true of yeast, where the 5-CHO-THF level increased only 4-fold in a 5-FCL knock-out (2Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and of those bacteria that apparently lack 5-FCL genes (17von Mering C. Huynen M. Jaeggi D. Schmidt S. Bork P. Snel B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 18Enault F. Suhre K. Poirot O. Abergel C. Claverie J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W336-W339Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike the 5-FCL reaction, which salvages 5-CHO-THF as an intact folate, any alternative detoxification route seems likely to entail cleavage of the p-aminobenzoate-glutamate bond or the pteridine-p-aminobenzoate bond (2Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Scott J.M. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. Wiley, New York1984: 307-327Google Scholar). In support of the latter possibility, exploratory work in our laboratory has shown a large (∼15-fold) accumulation of a novel pteridine in the leaves of 5-FCL mutant plants. Finally, we saw no evidence that 5-FCL moonlights as a folate-degrading enzyme in plants, as has been suggested for the mammalian enzyme (19Anguera M.C. Suh J.R. Ghandour H. Nasrallah I.M. Selhub J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29856-29862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although total folate content indeed increased in the 5-FCL mutant, it did so only under photorespiratory conditions, suggesting that the increase was not due to the mutation per se but rather to its metabolic sequelae.

https://openalex.org/W2026771056,"During Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic times, many Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rifts and basin structures in the interior of the European continent underwent several phases of inversion (the process of shortening a previously extensional basin). The main phases occurred during the Late Cretaceous and Middle Palaeocene, and have been previously explained by pulses of compression, mainly from the Alpine orogen. Here we show that the main phases differed both in structural style and cause. The Cretaceous phase was characterized by narrow uplift zones, reverse activation of faults, crustal shortening, and the formation of asymmetric marginal troughs. In contrast, the Middle Palaeocene phase was characterized by dome-like uplift of a wider area with only mild fault movements, and formation of more distal and shallow marginal troughs. A simple flexural model explains how domal, secondary inversion follows inevitably from primary, convergence-related inversion on relaxation of the in-plane tectonic stress. The onset of relaxation inversions was plate-wide and simultaneous, and may have been triggered by stress changes caused by elevation of the North Atlantic lithosphere by the Iceland plume or the drop in the north-south convergence rate between Africa and Europe."

NMDA receptors are thought to be tetrameric complexes mainly composed of NMDA receptor (NR)1 and NR2 subunits. The NR1 subunits are required for the formation of functional NMDA receptor channels, whereas the NR2 subunits modify channel properties. Biochemical and functional studies indicate that subunits making up NMDA receptors are organized into a dimer of dimers, and the N termini of the subunits are major determinants for receptor assembling. Here we used a biophysical approach, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, to analyze the assembly of intact, functional NMDA receptors in living cells. The results showed that NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits could form homodimers when they were expressed alone in HEK293 cells. Subunit homodimers were also found existing in heteromeric NMDA receptors formed between NR1 and NR2 subunits. These findings are consistent with functional NMDA receptors being arranged as a dimer of dimers. In addition, our data indicated that the conformation of NR1 subunit homodimers was affected by the partner NR2 subunits during the formation of heteromeric receptor complexes, which might underlie the mechanism by which NR2 subunits modify NMDA receptor function.

NMDA receptors play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and several types of neurological disorders (1Prybylowski K. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol.

Three gene families, named NR1, NR2, and NR3, encode subunits composing NMDA receptors. The NR1 subunit is encoded by a single gene, which undergoes extensive splicing to yield eight splice variants, NR1–1a and -1b to NR1–4a and -4b. The NR2 subunit exists in four isoforms (NR2A-D) encoded by different but closely related genes (reviewed in Ref. 2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). All of the subunits have a similar membrane topological structure, with three transmembrane domains plus a loop region, an extracellular N terminus, and an intracellular C terminus. Recently, NMDA receptors were thought to be tetrameric channels, for which the relevant evidence comes from the electrophysiological studies of NMDA and AMPA receptors (4Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J.

Several distinct NMDA receptor subtypes have been identified in the central nervous system, differing in channel conductance, kinetic properties, sensitivity to pharmacological agents, and synaptic localization (2Dingledine R.

Despite the increase in our understanding of the functional diversity of NMDA receptors, the cellular processes, mechanism of subunit assembly, and the structure-function relationships of the receptors are still far from being well understood. Biochemical studies indicate that the NR1–1a subunit expressed alone can form homodimers, and the first 380 amino acids in the N terminus are important for the association of NR1–1a with NR2A (26Meddows E.

In addition, cysteine 79 may be involved in the formation of NR1-NR1 homodimers (27Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Data from NMDA receptor tandems suggest that the subunits making up the channel are arranged as a dimer of dimers with an NR1-NR1-NR2-NR2 orientation (28Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on AMPA receptors provide a two-step assembly model in which family-specific subunit dimerizations are initially formed and then these dimers are dimerized again to form tetramers (29Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Madden D.R. Nat. Rev.

In this study, we used a biophysical approach based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to analyze the assembly of intact NMDA receptors directly. In recent years, FRET has been used widely to examine the stoichiometry, assembly, and conformational arrangement of many kinds of receptors and channels (32Zheng J. Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N.

Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). FRET is a sensitive reporter of the proximity of two fluorophores (37Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 38Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar), providing a convenient way to report subunit assembly. More importantly, FRET provides a non-invasive means of monitoring the subunit assembly of functional proteins in living cells. Furthermore, dynamic subunit assembly information can also be derived from FRET data. Our results suggest that the similar subunits are inclined to assemble into homomers before they form functional NMDA receptors with the other types of subunits. These findings indicate that dimerization may be a general principle guiding the assembly of NMDA receptors, as well as AMPA receptors (29Ayalon G. Stern-Bach Y.

Plasmids—The expression vector for cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)- or yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-tagged NR1–1a has been constructed by inserting a CFP or YFP cDNA fragment in-frame with the NR1–1a subunit between the third and fourth codons after the predicted sequence for signal peptide. CFP- or YFP-tagged NR2A and NR2B at the N termini were constructed by replacing the GFP sequence of pGFP-NR2A and pGFP-NR2B (41Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the CFP or YFP fragment of pECFP-N1 or pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). YFP-tagged GluR1 was generated by inserting the YFP cDNA fragment in-frame with the GluR1 subunit between the third and fourth codons. cDNA encoding CFP or YFP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pECFP-N1 or pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). GABAA α1 subunit with a YFP tag at the C terminus (α1-YFP) was generated by replacing the GFP sequence of pGFP-GABAAα1 (provided by Dr. S. Vicini, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D. C.) with the YFP fragment of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) between the HindIII and KpnI sites. The vector pECFP-YFP coding for the CFP-YFP fusion protein was generated by inserting the YFP cDNA obtained from pEYFP-N1 by PCR using the primers 5′-ggagCTCGAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-gCggGTCGACGCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCG-3′ into the SalI and XhoI sites of pECFP-N1 (Clontech), resulting in a GASTVPRARDPPVAT spacer between the fluorescence proteins (Fig. 1). All plasmids were sequenced to ensure correct reading frame, orientation, and sequence. The spectra of CFP and YFP fusion proteins were measured using a Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The spectrum between 480–600 nm was recorded with a wavelength increment of 2 nm and an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine (all from Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator. Exponentially growing cells were dispersed with trypsin (Sigma), seeded at 2 × 105 cells/35 mm dish in 1.5 ml of culture medium, and plated on 12-mm glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). HEK293 cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids (∼3–4 μg/35-mm dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfection mixture was replaced ∼3–5 h later with fresh culture medium. Ketamine (0.5 mm, Sigma) and kynurenic acid (1 mm, Sigma) were added to the medium to protect the cells from NMDA receptor-mediated toxicity. The cells were observed within 2 days after transfection in extracellular medium composed of (in mm): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 5 glucose, 0.01 glycine, and 5 HEPES at pH 7.4 with NaOH. For acceptor photobleaching measurement, HEK293 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min before imaging. Surface immunostaining and electrophysiology were carried out as previously described (41Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to determine surface expression and functional properties of recombinant NMDA receptors in transfected HEK293 cells. Immunocytochemistry —Cultured HEK293 cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min at -20 °C and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4% Triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in primary anti-ER monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with Alexa-546-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were observed using a Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). The primary antibody was used at 1:200, whereas the secondary antibody was used at 1:2000. Preparation of Hippocampal Neurons and Transfection—Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared by previously described techniques (41Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal tissue was harvested from one-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, gently chopped, and digested in 0.28% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 in a 35-mm dish with poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in basal Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 25 mm KCl and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 24 h in vitro, the medium was replaced with a half-and-half mixture of basal Eagle's medium and neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic, and 0.25% glutamine. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced every 3 days. At 4 days in vitro, cytosine arabinofuranoside was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. Lipofectamine 2000 was used in neuronal transfection, but the method was slightly modified. Appropriate plasmids (∼3–4 μg/35-mm dish) with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was added, and after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and the original culture medium was returned. Expression of exogenous DNA was typically detected in 8–10-day in vitro neurons. Detection of FRET Using Three-cube FRET Measurement—The fluorescence imaging workstation consisted of a TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a halogen lamp light source (100 W), Dual-View™ (Optical Insights, LLC, Santa Fe, NM) and a SNAP-HQ-cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). MetaMorph version 5.0 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) was used to control the charge-coupled device camera and for analysis of the cell image data. Three-cube FRET filter cubes were listed as follows (excitation; dichroic; emission; company): YFP (S500/20 nm; Q515lp; S535/30 nm, Chroma); FRET (S430/25 nm; 455dclp; S535/30 nm, Chroma); and CFP (S430/25 nm; 455dclp; S470/30 nm, Chroma). Binning 2 × 2 modes, 200 ms of integration time for HEK293 cells, and 500 ms of integration time for hippocampal neurons were used. Average background signal was determined as the mean fluorescence intensity from a blank area and was subtracted from the raw images before carrying out FRET calculations. FRET ratio (FR) was calculated according to Erickson et al. as Equation 1 (42Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), FR=FADFA=[SFRET(DA)−RD1⋅SCFP(DA)]RA1⋅[SYFP(DA)−RD2⋅SCFP(DA)](Eq. 1) in which FAD represents the total YFP emission with 430/25-nm excitation, and FA represents the direct YFP emission with 500/20-nm excitation. In SCUBE(SPECIMEN), CUBE indicates the filter cube (CFP, YFP, or FRET), and SPECIMEN indicates whether the cell is expressing donor (D, CFP), acceptor (A, YFP), or both (DA). RD1 = (SFRET(D))/(SCFP(D)), RD2 = (SYFP(D))/(SCFP(D)), and RA1 = (SFRET(A))/(SYFP(A)) are predetermined constants that require measurement of the bleed-through of the emission of only CFP- or YFP-tagged molecules into the FRET channel and the emission of only CFP-tagged molecules into the YFP channel. In our system, exciting CFP in cells that only expressed CFP showed no fluorescence signal with the YFP filter set and vice versa (Fig. 2). Thus RD2 was zero, and FR could be calculated as Equation 2. FR=[SFRET(DA)−RD1⋅SCFP(DA)]RA1⋅SYFP(DA)(Eq. 2) Detection of FRET Using Acceptor Photobleaching—Fluorescence signals were collected with a 510 LSM confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using laser excitation at 458 nm (CFP) and 514 nm (YFP) and emission windows of 470–500 nm (CFP; BP470–500; Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) and a 570-nm-long pass filter (YFP; LP530; Chroma). Preceding the emission filters in the light path was a NFT 515-nm dichroic mirror that split the CFP and YFP signals to distinct photomultiplier tubes. All fluorescence data were collected with a 40 × 0.75 numerical aperture objective (Zeiss) and 2× zoom. Photobleaching in selective regions was performed at 514 nm with a mean reduction of YFP emissions to <15% using the software-controlled 510 LSM confocal microscope. Images were acquired before and after photobleaching. Effective FRET efficiency (EEFF) between CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) was quantified with acceptor photobleaching methods (43Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. Mcnally J.G. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using the following Equation 3, EEFF=A1−A0A0⋅100%(Eq. 3) in which A0 and A1 are CFP emission with 458 nm excitation in the photobleached region before and after photobleaching with 514 nm excitation, respectively. Estimation of Physical Distance and Binding Affinity—This method was previously described by Erickson et al. (42Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 44Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fraction of YFP-tagged molecules that are associated with CFP-tagged molecules, Ab, is calculated as Ab = 1/(1 + Kd/[Dfree]), where Kd is the dissociation constant and [Dfree] is the concentration of free donor molecules. Note that FR = 1 + Ab · (FRmax - 1), in which FRmax is the maximal FR value. When ΔFRmax = (FRmax - 1), we can use regression analysis to estimate Ab in individual cells. From each cell, the FRET ratio (FRexp) was experimentally determined. We then computed the predicted Ab value by adjusting two parameters, ΔFRmax and Kd,EFF (effective dissociation constant). Ab was, in turn, used to give a predicted FR. By minimizing the sum of the squared errors (FRexp - FRpredicted)2 using MATLAB software, the two free parameters, ΔFRmax and Kd,EFF, can be determined; and FRmax can be determined when Ab is 1, which, in turn, is used to estimate the distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores. Statistics—All data were presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences were tested using the Student's t test and considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. FRET Reports Co-assembly of Different Subunits within the NMDA Receptor—CFP or YFP was inserted into the N terminus of the full-length NMDA receptor (NR) subunit to form CFP/YFP-NR1–1a, CFP/YFP-NR2A, and CFP/YFP-NR2B (see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 1). Spectral profiles of CFP- and YFP-tagged NR subunits were mostly identical to the reported spectra for the two fluorescent proteins. In addition, electrophysiological studies indicated that CFP- or YFP-tagged NR subunits were able to form functional channels when co-expressing with their partner subunits (data not shown). To measure steady-state FRET, cells transfected with different fusion proteins were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope through CFP, YFP, and FRET filter channels (Fig. 2). The FRET efficiency was quantified as the FR (see “Materials and Methods”) (42Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 44Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To ensure that our recording system could reliably detect FRET, we first carried out some control experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells co-expressing CFP and YFP, which served as a negative control, showed no FRET with FR = 1.08 ± 0.05 (n = 52). On the other hand, cells co-expressing the CFP-YFP concatemer, a positive control for FRET, showed significant increases in FR (FR = 5.05 ± 0.03, n = 71) (Fig. 3A). We next tested the interaction between NR1 and NR2 subunits by FRET. Immunostaining of living cells with anti-GFP antibody showed that fluorophore-fused NR1 and NR2 subunits formed receptors and targeted to the cell membrane, which further implies that they can be assembled as functional receptors. We found that co-expression of CFP-NR1–1a with YFP-NR2B or CFP-NR1–1a with YFP-NR2A produced significant FRET signals, with FR = 3.48 ± 0.20 (n = 30) or 2.17 ± 0.17 (n = 21), respectively (Fig. 3A). Similarly, when YFP-NR1–1a was co-expressed with either CFP-NR2A or CFP-NR2B, significant FRET signals were also observed (data not shown). The result suggested that fluorescent protein-tagged NR subunits are capable of co-assembly just as the untagged subunits. Could the apparent FRET signal come from unordered aggregates in compartments or random encounters between freely diffusing overexpressed channel subunits? To rule out these possibilities, we first co-expressed YFP-GluR1 with either CFP-NR1–1a or CFP-NR2A or CFP-NR2B. NR subunits expressed alone in HEK293 cells do not reach the cell membrane, and for AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, the majority of the homomeric assemblies are preferentially found intracellularly (45Hall R.A. Hansen A. Andersen P.H. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, it is generally accepted that NMDA receptors do not assemble with AMPA receptors (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the transfected HEK293 cells with GluR1 or NR1 were fixed and immunostained by a specific antibody against ER, and it was clearly shown by confocal microscopy that GluR1 and NR1 were co-localized well with the ER marker, respectively. Despite clear co-localization, co-expression of various CFP-tagged NR subunits and YFP-GluR1 did not yield any FRET. The FR values were all close to 1. As a further negative control, we co-expressed NR subunits with GABAA α1 subunits, both of which are incapable of leaving the ER when expressed alone (46Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As expected, co-expressing of CFP-tagged NR subunits with YFP-tagged α1 subunits yielded no FRET signal (FR = 1.01 ± 0.02, n = 32). We conclude from these results that the FRET signal observed between NR1 and NR2 subunits arose from their close proximity within properly formed heteromeric NMDA receptors, rather than from occasional proximity by random encounters between singular channel subunits or from bulk protein aggregates. Acceptor photobleaching is another simple and practical alternative to the three-cube FRET measurement. YFP was selectively bleached using a confocal microscope. Enhanced CFP emission due to disruption of FRET was measured. Using this method, we also found significant FRET between fluorophore-tagged NR1 and NR2 subunits but not CFP-tagged NR subunits and YFP-tagged GluR1 subunits (Fig. 3B). The finding that EEFF (calculated from acceptor photobleaching) correlated well with FR (R2 = 0.94) for each combination provides additional evidence that NR subunits can form heteromers with one another (Fig. 3C). FRET Measurement Reveals Homodimer Formation by NR1, NR2A, and NR2B Subunits—We co-expressed CFP-NR1–1a with YFP-NR1–1a in HEK293 cells. Surface immunostaining showed that the expression of NR1 subunits alone did not result in significant cell surface expression (data not shown), but the cells showed significant FRET signals with FR values of 2.40 ± 0.10 (n = 66) (Fig. 5). Similarly, when co-expressing CFP-NR2A with YFP-NR2A or CFP-NR2B with YFP-NR2B, we also observed FRET signals. The FR values for NR2A and NR2B subunits were 1.58 ± 0.04 (n = 36), and 1.92 ± 0.08 (n = 34), respectively (Fig. 5). The existence of FRET strongly suggests that NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits can form dimers or higher order multimers. Our results thus are consistent with NR subunits forming homodimers in the ER before forming functional tetrameric receptors. Using the blue native PAGE system, McIlhinney and co-workers (26Meddows E. Le Bourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18795-18803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) show that NR1 subunits are able to form homodimers when expressed alone (26Meddows E. Le Bourdelles B.

Our FRET results support such a conclusion. However, our results are not consistent with the findings of McIlhinney and co-workers (26Meddows E. Le Bourdelles B."

In the current study we set out to identify residues in the VFT domain that specifically support amino acid binding and/or amino acid-dependent receptor activation. Herein we describe two mutations of the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) Venus Flytrap domain, T145A and S170T, that specifically impair amino acid sensing, leaving Ca2+ sensing intact, as determined by receptor-dependent activation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells. With respect to the wild-type CaR, T145A and S170T exhibited reduced sensitivity to l-Phe, and T145A also exhibited markedly impaired l/d selectivity. When combined, the double mutant T145A/S170T exhibited normal or near-normal sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ but was resistant to l-Phe at concentrations up to 100 mm. We conclude that T145A/S170T selectively disables l-amino acid sensing and that the Ca2+ and l-amino acid-sensing functions of the CaR can be dissociated.

The extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, Ca2+-sensing receptor; mGlu-1, metabotropic glutamate receptor type-1. is activated by a variety of divalent and polyvalent cations that act as receptor agonists (for review, see Ref. 1Hofer A.M. Brown E.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). These agonists include extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) and, to a lesser extent, Mg2+ ions that have been identified as its principal physiological activators. In addition, recent work indicates that the CaR is activated allosterically by l-amino acids (2Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) which act, at least in part, by increasing the frequency of Ca2+o-activated oscillations in cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ concentration (3Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Miedlich S.U. Gama L. Seuwen K. Wolf R.M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These effects are stereoselective for natural (i.e. l-) isomers of CaR-active amino acids including aromatic amino acids such as Phe, Trp, and His as well as aliphatic and polar amino acids. l-Amino acids interact synergistically with phenylalkylamine type-II calcimimetics (5Zhang Z.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33736-33741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that l-amino acids bind at a site distinct from the phenylalkylamine type-II calcimimetic binding site in the CaR transmembrane domain region (4Miedlich S.U.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This conclusion has recently been confirmed by chimeric receptor analysis showing that the CaR VFT domain, but none of its other domains, is required for l-amino acid sensing (8Mun H.C. Franks A.H. Culverston E.L. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51739-51744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the current work we set out to identify residues of the CaR VFT domain that are specifically required for l-amino acid binding and/or amino-dependent receptor activation. As a starting point we used an alignment of the VFT domains of the human CaR and rat metabotropic glutamate receptor type-1 (mGlu-1), for which high resolution crystal structures are available (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). A previous analysis of this type indicated that mutations of conserved binding domain residues in the CaR VFT domain interfered with Ca2+ and, in some cases, amino acid sensing (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In an effort to distinguish between the requirements of amino acid and Ca2+o sensing, we have now reinvestigated the impact of conservative mutations on CaR residues Ser-147, Ser-170, Tyr-218, and Glu-297, which align to the key mGlu-1 glutamate binding residues Ser-165, Thr-188, Tyr-236, and Asp-318 respectively. In addition, we investigated the impact of site-directed mutagenesis on a closely associated CaR residue Thr-145, which might conceivably fulfill a role similar to that of mGlu-1 residue Ser-164, which contributes to the H-bond network that ligates the α-carboxyl group of the bound glutamate. This analysis led to the identification of two mutations, T145A and S170T, that selectively impaired amino acid sensing by the CaR, leaving sensing of extracellular Ca2+ ions intact. Combining these two mutations had the effect of disabling receptor sensitivity to the CaR-active amino acid l-Phe up to a concentration of 100 mm. These findings support the concept that the CaR l-amino acid binding site lies in its VFT domain and demonstrate that Ca2+ and amino acid sensing can be dissociated. Materials—pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) containing the wild-type human calcium-sensing receptor (cassette version (11Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C.

HEK293 Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen) under standard conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers of 25–35 bases was designed for each mutagenesis with the mutation placed at the middle of the primers (the sequences of the primers are available from authors on request). The template human CaR in pcDNA3.1(+) was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with these primers for 12–16 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the template DNA with DpnI (New England Biolabs) the amplified mutant DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α or XL1-Blue). The incorporation of the desired mutations and absence of other mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). Transient Transfection of Wild-type and Mutant Receptors in HEK293 Cells—Transfection grade DNA was prepared using the High-speed™ Midi Kit (Qiagen, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells reached 90–95% confluence, they were transfected with wild-type or mutant CaR constructs using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen). A given amount of plasmid DNA was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, mixed with diluted Lipofectamine 2000™, and allowed to complex at room temperature for 20 min before being added to HEK293 cells in plates. For fura-2 assays in the microscope format, transfections were performed in 6-well plates using 2–4 μg of DNA per well. For aequorin assays (see “Detection of Changes in Cytoplasmic Free Ca2+ Concentration”), 150 ng of each expression construct was co-transfected with 150 ng of the pcAEQ reporter plasmid in 96-well plates as described previously (12Tan Y.M.

FLAG Tagging of Human CaR Constructs—The human CaR in pcDNA3.1 was FLAG-tagged using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure described above using complementary mutagenic primers that contained the FLAG peptide epitope (YKDDDDK) as an insert. The mutagenic primers were designed to insert the FLAG tag between CaR amino acid residues 371 and 372. This site was selected after Bai et al. (13Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and lies in a loop of the VFT domain that does not contribute significantly to ligand binding or receptor activation (14Reyes-Cruz G. Hu J. Goldsmith P.K. Steinbach P.J. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32145-32151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutagenic primers (with the complementary sequences encoding the FLAG tag underlined) were 5′-GCAAAAGGACCTTTACCTGTGGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGACCTTTCTGAGAGGTCACGAAGAAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACTTTCTTCGTGACCTCTCAGAAAGGTCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGT CCACAGGTAAAGGTCCTTTTGC-3′. Successful insertion of the FLAG epitope into the wild-type CaR was confirmed by DNA sequencing (AGRF, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). The FLAG-tagged wild-type CaR was used as a template for further rounds of site-directed mutagenesis to yield FLAG-tagged constructs of T145A, S170T, and T145A/S170T, which were also confirmed by DNA sequencing. Western Blot Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant CaR Surface Expression in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with a FLAG-tagged CaR construct using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) as described above. Proteins on the surface of intact cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) before lysis with a solution that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (all Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 100 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma). The FLAG-tagged CaR was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunopurified protein samples were then eluted in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated to 65 °C for 30 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel, 6% resolving gel). Equivalence of protein loading was checked using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by Western blotting using a Hoefer TE 70 Series SemiPhor semi-dry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). CaR proteins present on the cell surface (biotin labeled as above) were then detected using an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) followed by ECL Plus Western-blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Films were developed using Eastman Kodak Co. (Cedex, Coburg, VIC) GBX developer and fixer reagents. Stable Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Receptors in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were maintained in 25-cm2 culture flasks and transfected with 8 μg of the wild-type or mutant CaR expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 24 h cells were transferred to 24-well plates and grown for a further 24 h. Selection of stable transformants was then carried out in the presence of 50–100 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) or 100–400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Individual resistant clones were isolated 3 weeks later and screened by aequorin luminescence for activity and subsequently studied by microfluorimetry using fura-2. Detection of Changes in Cytoplasmic Free Ca2+ Concentration—The aequorin luminescence assay used to screen for HEK293 cell clones that stably expressed the wild-type or mutant CaRs was performed as described previously using 96-well plates in a thermostat-controlled Wallac Victor2 multilabel counter at 37 °C (8Mun H.C.

For analysis of amino acid- and Ca2+o-dependent activation of the wild-type or mutant CaRs, changes in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration were determined by microfluorimetry after loading with fura-2 AM. HEK293 cells that had been transfected with the wild type or one of the mutant CaR constructs were cultured on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-well plates for 48 h. They were then loaded with fura-2AM (5 μm, 37 °C) in physiological saline solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 2 h the fura-2-containing solution was removed, and the cells were resuspended in physiological saline solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Fura-2 loaded cells were transferred into a superfusion chamber and placed in the light path of a Nikon Diaphot microscope. The control superfusion solution had the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.4. Excitation at alternating wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), detection of fluorescent light (F; peak 510 nm) and its digitized recording using Acqknowledge software for the Macintosh was performed as described previously (15Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Data for cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration were expressed either as uncorrected excitation ratios (F340/F380) or as cumulative excitation ratio responses (Δ from base line). Curve Fitting and Statistical Analysis—The Ca2+ mobilization data were expressed as concentration-response curves and fitted to the following form of the Hill equation: R = b + (a - b) × Cn/(en + Cn), where R is the receptor response, a is the maximum response, b is the basal response, C is the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm), e is EC50 (the concentration of Ca2+ that induced a half-maximal response), and n is the Hill coefficient. Estimates of the curve-fitting parameters (±S.E.) were obtained using MacCurveFit 1.5 for Macintosh. Other data are routinely expressed as the means ± S.E. (number of experiments). Sensitivity of Wild-type Calcium-sensing Receptor to l-Amino Acids—The wild-type CaR was stably expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cells were loaded with fura-2 and exposed to stepwise increments in Ca2+o concentration in the absence or presence of l-Phe or d-Phe at a concentration of 10 mm. l-Phe stereoselectively enhanced the sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1). In the absence of Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 4.9 ± 0.1 mm (n = 8). In the presence of 10 mm d-Phe, it was 4.6 ± 0.1 mm (n = 3), and in the presence of 10 mm l-Phe it was 3.4 ± 0.1 mm (n = 4). Screen of Conservative Mutations in the CaR Venus Flytrap Domain—The following mGlu-1 ligand binding residues are readily aligned to residues in the CaR (the CaR residue is shown in parentheses): Ser-165 (Ser-147), Thr-188 (Ser-170), Tyr-236 (Tyr-218), Asp-318 (Glu-297) as noted previously (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Adjacent to Ser-147 in the CaR is another potential H-bonding residue, Thr-145, that might promote ligand binding in a similar fashion to mGlu-1 residue Ser-164. Conservative mutations of the CaR residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to generate T145A, S147A, S170A, S170T, Y218F, and E297Q. These mutations were screened for Ca2+o and l-Phe sensitivity in HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with the wild-type or mutant CaRs and loaded with fura-2. The CaR-expressing cells were then exposed to various Ca2+o concentrations to generate Ca2+o concentration-response curves. Curve-fitting analysis was then performed to yield estimates of the EC50 for Ca2+o, maximal response (in the form of a cumulative excitation ratio above baseline), and Hill coefficient (Table I). The following mutations exhibited clearly impaired Ca2+o sensitivity when compared with the wild-type CaR: S147A, S170A, Y218F, and E297Q. Of these, S147A, Y218F, and E297Q clearly retained sensitivity to l-Phe, which substantially restored Ca2+o sensitivity and receptor function. However, as described previously, S170A exhibited marked loss of Ca2+o sensitivity that was not restored by l-Phe (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). T145A, on the other hand, retained normal or near-normal Ca2+o sensitivity but appeared to exhibit impaired sensitivity to l-Phe. A conservative mutation of the critical residue Ser-170 i.e. S170T also appeared to exhibit near-normal sensitivity to Ca2+o but reduced sensitivity to l-Phe (Table I). On the basis of these results it was decided to perform further analysis on two mutants, T145A and S170T, as well as the double mutant T145A/S170T in an effort to identify an l-amino acid-insensitive CaR.Table IThe effect of l-Phe on extracellular Ca2+-dependent responses of the wild-type CaR and various CaR mutants HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type CaR orvarious CaR mutants, and after 48 h the cells were loaded with fura-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells on glass coverslips were then transferred into the superfusion chamber of a fluorescence microscope and exposed to various extracellular Ca2+ concentrations in the absence or presence of 10 mm l-Phe. The data were obtained from four experiments for each construct. They were converted to cumulative excitation ratios (Δ from baseline), and curve-fitting was performed using MacCurveFit 1.5 for Macintosh.Mutant/wild-typeEC50 for Ca2+oMaximal responseHill coefficientControll-Phe 10Controll-PheControll-Phe 10mmWild type3.8 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.20.25 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.013.0 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.4T145A5.9 ± 0.94.8 ± 0.40.24 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.021.9 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.4S147A24.5 ± 3.612.2 ± 0.30.27 ± 0.030.22 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.1S170A24.4 ± 10.320.7 ± 5.00.10 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.010.8 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1S170T3.3 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.20.24 ± 0.010.24 ± 0.012.8 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.3Y218F19.4 ± 4.714.9 ± 2.80.16 ± 0.020.26 ± 0.031.3 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.3E297Q24.3 ± 6.89.8 ± 0.60.33 ± 0.070.26 ± 0.071.9 ± 0.62.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab T145A Exhibits Reduced Sensitivity to l-Phe—The possibility that T145A exhibited selective loss of sensitivity to l-Phe was explored further in HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with either the wild-type CaR or T145A. Two days after transfection, HEK293 cells were loaded with fura-2 and exposed to increments in extracellular Ca2+ concentration in the absence or presence of the CaR-active amino acid l-Phe at a concentration of 1, 3, or 10 mm. Compared with wild type, T145A exhibited reduced sensitivity to l-Phe (Fig. 2, A and B). In the case of the wild-type CaR, the EC50 for Ca2+o fell in a concentration-dependent manner in response to l-Phe. In the absence of l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 3.5 ± 0.1 mm (n = 6). In the presence of l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o fell to 3.4 ± 0.1 mm (n = 6), 3.0 ± 0.1 mm (n = 6), and 2.8 ± 0.1 mm (n = 6) at 1, 3, and 10 mm l-Phe, respectively. For T145A, on the other hand, 1 and 3 mm l-Phe had no effect when compared with control. Thus, in the absence of l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 3.9 ± 0.4 mm (n = 4), and in the presence of 1 mm and 3 mm l-Phe, the EC50 values for Ca2+o were, respectively, 4.0 ± 0.4 mm (n = 4) and 3.9 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4). In the presence of 10 mm l-Phe, however, the EC50 for Ca2+o fell to 3.1 ± 0.4 mm (n = 4). These data support the conclusion that the l-Phe sensitivity of T145A is impaired but not completely disabled. S170T Exhibits Reduced Sensitivity to l-Phe—The possibility that S170T also exhibited selective loss of sensitivity to l-Phe was explored further in HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with S170T and then loaded with fura-2 as described above for T145A. S170T also exhibited reduced sensitivity to l-Phe (Fig. 2, A and C). In the absence of l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 2.6 ± 0.1 mm; in its presence, the EC50 for Ca2+o fell modestly (all n = 4). At a concentration of 1 mm l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 2.5 ± 0.1 mm. At concentrations of 3 and 10 mm l-Phe, the EC50 values for Ca2+o were 2.3 ± 0.2 and 2.2 ± 0.1 mm respectively. These data provide support for the idea that the l-Phe sensitivity of S170T is impaired when compared with wild type. l-Phe Sensitivity of the Double Mutant T145A/S170T Expressed Transiently in HEK293 Cells—The data described above suggested that T145A and S170T exhibit impaired sensitivity to the CaR-active amino acid l-Phe. To further assess the significance of these effects, the double mutant T145A/S170T was synthesized and expressed transiently in HEK293 cells. Up to a concentration of 10 mm, l-Phe had no effect on the EC50 for Ca2+o in HEK293 cells that transiently expressed T145A/S170T (Fig. 2D). In the absence of l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 2.6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4). In the presence of 1, 3, and 10 mm l-Phe, the EC50 values for Ca2+o were, respectively, 2.7 ± 0.1 mm (n = 5), 2.8 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4), and 2.7 ± 0.2 mm (n = 7). These data indicate that the double mutant retains normal or near-normal Ca2+o sensitivity but exhibits markedly reduced sensitivity to l-Phe. Surface Expression of the Wild-type CaR, T145A, S170T, and the Double Mutant T145A/S170T Expressed Transiently in HEK293 Cells—All four constructs in pcDNA3.1 exhibited similar EC50 values for Ca2+o and maximal responses when expressed transiently in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the level of CaR surface expression was similar for all four receptors and that functional differences between the various receptors arose from differences in amino acid binding or signal transmission. However, to exclude the possibility that functional differences might have arisen from differences in surface expression, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 constructs for all four receptors that had been FLAG-tagged between residues Asp-371 and Thr-372. CaR function has been shown previously to be unaffected by insertion of the FLAG peptide epitope (YKDDDDK) in this region (13Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.C. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection in 24-well plates, HEK293 cells were surface-labeled with biotin then solubilized. FLAG-labeled CaR proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody then resolubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The blots were developed using an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and reagents suitable for enhanced chemiluminescence. The level of surface expression was similar for the wild-type CaR and all three mutants, T145A, S170T, and T145A/S170T (Fig. 3). Behavior of T145A, S170T, and T145A/S170T Stably Expressed in HEK293 Cells—A second clone of HEK293 cells that stably expressed the wild-type CaR (distinct from the clone used in the experiments shown in Fig. 1) together with clones of HEK293 cells that stably expressed T145A, S170T, or the double mutant T145A/S170T were examined for their sensitivity and stereoselectivity to l-Phe. T145A exhibited reduced sensitivity to l-Phe when compared with the wild-type CaR (see Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, T145A exhibited reduced l/d selectivity (Fig. 4B). To further investigate a possible loss of l/d selectivity, HEK293 cells that stably expressed either the wild-type CaR or T145A were exposed to stepwise increments in Ca2+o concentration in the absence or presence of the following pairs of aromatic amino acids: l-Phe/d-Phe, l-Trp/d-Trp, and l-His/d-His. In all three cases T145A exhibited loss of l/d selectivity (Table II). A second clone of HEK293 cells that stably expressed T145A were also investigated for loss of l/d selectivity with similar results for all three amino acids when compared with control (not shown).Table IIComparison between the effects of various l- and d-amino acids on the Ca2+o sensitivity of the wild-type CaR or T145A mutant stably expressed in HEK293 cells The data are EC50 values for Ca2+o (in mm) obtained in the absence (control) or presence of various l-or d-amino acids (all 10 mm). HEK293 cells that stably expressed either the wild-type CaR or T145A mutant were plated onto coverslips. After the cells reached confluence, they were loaded with fura-2 and analyzed by microfluorimetry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were exposed to stepwise increments in Ca2+o concentration in the absence or presence of the amino acids shown. The data obtained were converted to cumulative excitation ratios (Δ from base line), and curve-fitting was performed using MacCurveFit 1.5 for Macintosh. No significant differences were observed between the Hill coefficients and maximal responses for the various treatments.TreatmentEC50 for Ca2+oWild typeT145AmmControl4.1 ± 0.2 (6)5.8 ± 0.2 (7)l-Phe2.7 ± 0.1 (6)4.1 ± 0.4 (6)d-Phe4.2 ± 0.1 (6)4.6 ± 0.2 (6)l-Trp3.3 ± 0.4 (3)4.1 ± 0.2 (3)d-Trp4.6 ± 0.1 (3)4.3 ± 0.3 (3)l-His2.8 ± 0.4 (3)4.0 ± 0.3 (3)d-His4.4 ± 0.2 (4)4.2 ± 0.3 (3) Open table in a new tab S170T also exhibited reduced sensitivity to l-Phe, although l/d selectivity was preserved (Fig. 4C). Next, the T145A/S170T double mutant was investigated. These cells retained normal or near-normal sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4D). However, unlike control cells that stably expressed the wild-type CaR (Figs. 1A and 4A), cells that stably expressed the double mutant were completely resistant to l-Phe as well as d-Phe up to 10 mm (Fig. 4). In a separate series of experiments, l-Phe at a concentration of 100 mm had no effect on the Ca2+o sensitivity of T145A/S170T (n = 4; data not shown). In these experiments in the absence of l-Phe the EC50 for Ca2+o was 3.1 ± 0.3 mm.In the presence of 100 mm l-Phe, the EC50 for Ca2+o was 3.4 ± 0.3 mm. The data described in the current work indicate that the mutants T145A and S170T in the CaR VFT domain impair l-amino acid sensing, leaving Ca2+o sensing intact. Furthermore, the double mutant T145A/S170T selectively disabled l-amino acid sensing. The results indicate that these effects arise from a selective disturbance of receptor function. Furthermore, surface expression was similar for all four CaR species that were fully characterized including wild-type, T145A, S170T, and T145A/S170T (Fig. 3), indicating that the disturbance of amino acid sensing did not arise from a change in cell surface expression. Previous analysis of conserved residues in the CaR VFT domain indicated that Ser-170 and possibly two adjacent serines, Ser-169 and Ser-171, play key roles in amino acid sensing (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, dissociating amino acids from Ca2+o sensing was only possible when the S169A/S170A/S171A triple mutant was co-expressed with a C-terminally truncated wild-type receptor, A877Stop, that restored Ca2+o but not amino acid sensing (10Zhang Z.

These findings together with a recent analysis of chimeric CaR/mGlu-1 receptors indicate that the l-amino acid binding site lies in the CaR VFT domain (8Mun H.C. Franks A.H. Culverston E.L. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51739-51744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the current study we decided to re-investigate whether an amino acid-insensitive mutant that retained normal Ca2+o sensing might be synthesized using site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the CaR VFT domain. This analysis led to the identification of T145A and S170T as candidate mutations with the desired properties (Table I, Figs. 2 and 4) and led to the conclusion that Ca2+ and amino acid sensing can be dissociated. Consideration of the crystal structure of the ligand-bound form of the mGlu-1 VFT domain (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) together with the predicted homologies between the human CaR and rat mGlu-1 structures (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggest the hypothesis that the mutants T145A and S170T impair amino acid sensing by interfering with amino acid binding. For example, Thr-145 in the CaR VFT domain may perform a similar function to Ser-164 in the rat mGlu-1 VFT domain. In the mGlu-1 crystal structure, Ser-164 ligates a water molecule that, in turn, ligates one of the α-carboxyl oxygens of the bound glutamate (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). If Thr-145 serves a similar function in the CaR, loss of its side chain (as in T145A) could impair amino acid binding without disturbing amino acid-independent receptor activation i.e. without disturbing Ca2+o sensing. In addition to disturbing amino acid sensing, T145A also interfered with l/d selectivity for CaR-active amino acids (Fig. 4B; Table II). This finding suggests that the side chain of Thr-145 provides one of the three key points of contact required for stereoisomer selectivity, perhaps by imposing a local water structure as in the case of mGlu-1 residue Ser-164 (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Ser-170, on the other hand, aligns to Thr-188 in the rat mGlu-1 VFT domain. In the mGlu-1 crystal structure, Thr-188 supports glutamate binding by providing an H-bond from its side-chain hydroxyl to the α-amino group of the ligated glutamate (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). However, unlike Thr-145, Ser-170 is also required for amino acid-independent CaR activation since S170A exhibited grossly impaired Ca2+o-dependent receptor activation (Table I) as reported previously (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, l-amino acids did not restore Ca2+o-dependent function of S170A (Table I; 10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), providing support for a role of Ser-170 in amino acid binding. For this reason the more conservative mutation S170T, which retains a side-chain hydroxyl, was selected for further analysis. As described above, S170T exhibited normal or near-normal Ca2+o sensing and impaired l-amino acid sensing (Table I, Figs. 2 and 4). However S170T, unlike T145A, did not disturb l/d selectivity. This suggests that S170T has a more modest impact on amino acid binding/sensing and is compensated by the presence of the side-chain hydroxyl of the threonine at residue 170 and/or by neighboring residues such as Ser-169 and Ser-171 as suggested previously (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In combination, the T145A/S170T double mutant selectively disabled l-Phe sensing up to a concentration of 100 mm. Based on the rmGlu-1 structure, it seems plausible that the disabling effect of the double mutant T145A/S170T arose as a result of combining mutations that interfere, respectively, with H-bonding to the α-carboxyl group (T145A) and α-amino group (S170T) of the ligated amino acid. The observed behavior of T145A including loss of amino acid sensing and impaired l/d selectivity appear to be best explained by this hypothesis. S170T, on the other hand may have impaired amino acid sensing by interfering with amino acid binding as discussed above or, alternatively, by facilitating ligand-independent VFT domain closure. The data indicating a left-shift in the Ca2+ concentration response curves for S170T relative to wild-type (Table I, Figs. 2 and 4) provide some support for this alternative interpretation. Until amino acid binding has been measured directly, the basis of the impaired amino acid sensing observed in the cases of S170T (and T145A) will be uncertain. In the current study, as in previous studies (10Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18382-18386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), several mutations of the CaR VFT domain including S147A, S170A, Y218F, and E297Q exhibited impaired Ca2+o-dependent receptor activation when compared with the wild-type CaR (Table I). Based on the proposed mechanism of operation of the mGlu-1 VFT domain (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 17Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the CaR VFT domain is likely to undergo domain closure even in the absence of amino acids. Furthermore, in the presence of amino acids, receptor activation may arise from stabilization of the closed form. The observation that l-Phe restores Ca2+o-dependent receptor activation in the cases of several VFT domain mutants, e.g. S147A, Y218F, and E297Q (Table I), may represent one manifestation of this phenomenon. Thus, defective amino acid-independent domain closure in the cases of these mutants may be restored by a ligated amino acid that recruits additional H-bonds across the lobe I-lobe II interface of the VFT domain. In the current study, as described previously (8Mun H.C. Franks A.H. Culverston E.L. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51739-51744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the magnitude of the amino acid effect on the Ca2+o sensitivity of the wild-type CaR varied according to whether the receptor was expressed stably (Figs. 1 and 4) or transiently (Fig. 2; Table I). The basis of this difference is unclear. The stably expressed CaR may exhibit enhanced amino acid sensitivity with respect to the transiently expressed CaR as a result of differences in surface expression, as described for another family 3 receptor, mGlu-5 (18Nash M.S.

Alternatively, it might arise from differences in CaR-dependent expression of key signaling proteins. The physiological significance of l-amino acid sensing by the CaR is not yet fully elucidated. However, recent work on normal human parathyroid cells indicates that l-amino acids regulate PTH secretion (19Conigrave A.D. Mun H.-C. Delbridge L. Quinn S.J. Wilkinson M. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the CaR may also mediate the effect of high dietary protein intake on urinary calcium excretion (for review, see Ref. 20Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the CaR appears to provide a molecular link between protein and calcium metabolism and may also act more generally as an amino acid sensor in the control of digestion, absorption, appetite, and whole body metabolism (for review, see Ref. 21Conigrave A.D. Franks A.H. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 56: 1072-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Identifying mutations that selectively disable CaR-dependent amino acid sensing offers a possible approach to establishing its full physiological significance e.g. via analysis of tissue-wide function in a knock-in mouse. In conclusion, mutational analysis of conserved binding residues in the CaR VFT domain has led to the identification of two mutants, T145A and S170T, which selectively impair l-amino acid sensing, leaving extracellular Ca2+ sensing intact. Furthermore, the double mutant T145A/S170T selectively disables amino acid sensing. The results indicate that Ca2+ and l-amino acid sensing can be dissociated, and the double mutant may be suitable for further analysis of the physiological significance of amino acid sensing.

The prevalence of obesity in both developed and developing countries issteadily on the rise (1Popkin B.M. Nutr.Rev. 2004; 62: S140-S143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Withthis worldwide health problem comes a new urgency in understanding thefundamentals behind the regulation of triacylglycerol(TG) 1The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; GP, glycerol phosphate;MIDA, mass isotopomer distribution analysis; LC, low carbohydrate; HC, highcarbohydrate; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; PEPCK,phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PPARγ, peroxisomeproliferator-activated γ. synthesis. Onesuch question is the relative contributions from glyceroneogenesis andglycolysis to the synthesis of α-glycerol phosphate (α-GP), thedirect intracellular precursor for TG synthesis. There are three primarysources of α-GP for TG synthesis(Fig. 1): plasma glycerol, viadirect phosphorylation by glycerol kinase (traditionally thought not to bepresent to a significant extent in adipose tissue); glucose, via glycolysis tothe level of triose phosphate; and glyceroneogenesis, which is defined as thesynthesis of α-GP from gluconeogenic precursors (i.e.precursors other than glucose or glycerol)(2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A better understanding ofthe relative contributions of these pathways to TG synthesis under differentconditions could aid our understanding of TG metabolism. Recently, methods have been presented for the in vivo measurementof TG synthesis using heavy water (2H2O)(3Brunengraber D.Z. McCabe B.J. Kasumov T. Alexander J.C. Chandramouli V. Previs S.F. Am. J.Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E917-E925Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We present here theapplication of 2H2O labeling combined with massisotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA), to the discernment of sources ofα-GP. MIDA involves quantifying, by mass spectrometry, the relativeabundances of molecular species of a polymer differing only in mass (massisotopomers), after introduction of a stable isotope-labeled precursor. Thedegree and pattern of incorporation of 2H into C–H bonds ofα-GP is dependent on two factors: the 2H enrichment of bodywater and the number of C–H bonds in α-GP that were derived frombody water. The latter is dependent on the biochemistry of hydrogenincorporation from solvent H2O into glyceroneogenic and glycolyticintermediates (Figs. 1 and2)(5Rognstad R. Clark G. Katz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The maximal theoreticalnumber of hydrogen atoms (n) that can be incorporated fromH2O into C–H bonds is 5 (italicized inFig. 1). Any α-GPgenerated via glyceroneogenesis (i.e. through the tricarboxylic acidcycle and “bottom” portion of the gluconeogenesis pathway, frompyruvate or oxaloacetate) will have all five hydrogens incorporated from bodywater (Figs. 1 and2A,italicized). The α-GP generated via glycolysis from unlabeledglucose, in contrast, has an n of at most 3.5 (i.e. at mostthree and a half hydrogen atoms are incorporated from body water (Figs.1 and2B, bold)).This non-integer value derives from the phosphoglucose isomerase step ofglycolysis, which adds label to C1(Fig. 2B)(6Katz J. Rognstad R. Curr.Top. Cell. Regul. 1976; 10: 237-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This results in a labeledhydrogen on the phosphate carbon of dihydroxyacetate phosphate but notglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Of the two α-GPs generated from one glucose,one will therefore have an n of 3 and one will have an n of4 (average = 3.5). α-GP generated in the liver from unlabeled glycerolvia glycerol kinase could theoretically have an n of 0(Fig. 1). However, it has beenshown previously that there is rapid exchange of α-GP with glycolyticintermediates (e.g. in the triose phosphate pool) in liver(7Patterson B.W. Mittendorfer B. Elias N.

We hypothesized that experimentally observed values of nless than 5 could be explained by contributions from non-glyceroneogenicsources of α-GP (Fig. 1).By this interpretation, the resulting experimentally determined nreflects the mixture of TG-glycerol from glycolysis (glyc3.5),glyceroneogenesis (glyc5), and glycerol kinase (glyc3).The different values of n observed in different tissues, with ahigher n observed in liver compared with adipose tissue, wereconsistent with the known higher activity of glyceroneogenesis in liver(8Kalhan S.C.

If this is, in fact, thephysiological explanation for a measured value of n less than 5, wereasoned that n in TG-glycerol might be informative in its own rightas a parameter of cellular metabolism and glyceroneogenesis. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis. Threeexperimental conditions were imposed. First, the effect of a high fat, lowcarbohydrate (LC) diet on adipose TG n was studied in mice. Reduceddietary glucose input in animals fed a LC diet should result in a lessercontribution to TG-glycerol from uptake and glycolytic metabolism of dietaryglucose (glyc3.5) and a greater contribution from theglyceroneogenic pathway (glyc5), resulting in a higher measuredn. Second, we investigated the effect of fructose infusion on hepaticTG n, sampled from plasma TG-glycerol in rats. Fructose floods thehepatic triose phosphate pool from the glycolytic direction (glyc3)and might result in a lowering of plasma TG-glycerol n. Finally,having established the informative value of TG-glycerol n, weevaluated the effect on glyceroneogenesis of rosiglitazone, a PPARγagonist known to increase adipose TG deposition and alter adipose tissueglycerol metabolism (10Yki-Jarvinen H. N. Engl. J.Med. 2004; 351: 1106-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Therelative importance of rosiglitazone induced increases in PEPCKversus glycerol kinase expression and activity in adipose tissue hasbeen controversial (11Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S.C. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). If anincrease in PEPCK was the predominant mechanism involved inrosiglitazone-induced α-GP synthesis (and hence TG synthesis), themeasured n should increase with increased contribution fromglyc5 (i.e. glyceroneogenesis). In contrast, a significantincrease in glycerol kinase activity would result in a decrease in measuredn (glyc3 or less). We show here that measurement ofn in acylglyceride glycerol can be informative as an index ofglyceroneogenesis, and, ultimately, TG metabolism under differentconditions. All procedures were approved by the University of California, Berkeley,Animal Use Committee. Mice—4-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice (16–18 g; JacksonLaboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. Mice were fed ad libitum ahigh carbohydrate, low fat (HC, 70% carbohydrate, 10% fat) diet or a lowcarbohydrate, high fat diet (LC, 35% carbohydrate, 45% fat) (Research DietsInc., New Brunswick, NJ). An additional group of mice were fed an HC dietcontaining rosiglitazone (6.34 mg/kcal diet), which resulted in a dose of∼3 mcg/kg mouse/day (Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). After 11days on the diet, all animals were given a priming dose of 99.8%2H2O in saline via intraperitoneal injection to achieve∼4.8% 2H2O enrichment in body water (30 μl/gmouse) followed by administration of 8% 2H2O in drinkingwater. Mice (n = 6 per group) were sacrificed after either 15 or 64days on heavy water. Mesenteric, epididymal, retroperitoneal, and inguinaladipose tissue depots were removed, and blood and urine samples wereobtained. In an additional experiment to investigate potential changes in deuteriumenrichment in glucose, mice, as above, were put on the LC diet, HC diet, or HCdiet with rosiglitazone for 2 weeks with 2H2Oadministered as above during the final week (n = 10 per group). Halfthe animals in each group were sacrificed in the morning (7:30–9:30 AM)and half at the end of the day (4:30–6:15 PM), roughly corresponding tothe start of the light and dark cycles (7 AM–7 PM). Animals were adlibitum fed throughout. Blood samples were obtained at the time ofsacrifice. Rats—Sprague-Dawley rats (400–500 g, Charles RiverLaboratories, Wilmington, MA) were purchased with indwelling jugular vein andcarotid artery catheters in place. Rats (n = 4) were fed adlibitum a Purina chow diet. After an overnight fast, animals wereanesthetized with isoflurane and a priming dose of 99.8%[2H2O]saline was given via intraperitoneal injection, asabove. After a minimum of 60 min, to allow for 2H2Oequilibration with body water, two baseline blood samples were collected(times –30 and –15 min). At time 0, fructose was infusedintravenously (16–19 mg/kg/min for 4 h). Blood samples were taken after3 and 4 h of fructose administration. Isolation of Acylglyceride Glycerol from AdiposeTissue—Lipids from adipose tissue were extracted by a modifiedFolch extraction (12Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thelipid fraction was transesterified by incubation with 3 nmethanolic HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) at 55 °C for 60 min. Fatty acid methylesters were separated from glycerol by the Folch technique. The aqueous phasecontaining glycerol was lyophilized, and glycerol was converted to glyceroltriacetate by incubation with acetic anhydride-pyridine (2:1) as describedelsewhere (13Siler S.Q. Neese R.A. Parks E.J. Hellerstein M.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2319-2328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of TG-glycerol from Plasma—Plasma, obtained fromfresh whole blood, was extracted by the Folch technique. TG was isolated byTLC as described previously(14Jung H.R. Turner S.M. Neese R.A. Young S.G. Hellerstein M.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glycerol isolation andderivatization were then performed as described above. Isolation of Glucose from Plasma—Plasma glucose was isolatedusing the method of Van Dijk et al.(15van Dijk T.H. Boer T.S. Havinga R. Stellaard F. Kuipers F. Reijngoud D.J. Anal.Biochem. 2003; 322: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly glucose wasextracted from plasma spotted on filter paper using an ethanol/waterextraction. Glucose was then derivatized to the aldonitrile tetra-acetatederivative as described previously(13Siler S.Q. Neese R.A. Parks E.J. Hellerstein M.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2319-2328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of 2H2O Enrichment in BodyWater—2H2O enrichment in body water (fromplasma or urine) was measured by one of two methods. Briefly, 15–20μl of plasma or urine were reacted in an evacuated GC vial with calciumcarbide to produce acetylene. The acetylene gas was then removed with asyringe and injected into a GC vial containing 10% bromine in carbontetrachloride and incubated at room temperature for 2 h to producetetrabromoethane. Excess bromine was neutralized with 25 μl of 10%cyclohexene, and the sample was suspended in ethyl acetate(16Collins M.L. Eng S. Hoh R. Hellerstein M.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 94: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Alternatively, theacetylene gas was directly measured by a new mass spectrometric method(17Previs S.F. Hazey J.W. Diraison F. Beylot M. David F. Brunengraber H. J. MassSpectrom. 1996; 31: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl ofsample were injected into a closed Exitainer vial containing calcium carbidein a dry helium atmosphere. A small amount (0.5 ml) of the acetylene gasgenerated from the reaction was removed and injected into another closed vialwith a helium atmosphere for direct analysis. The two methods, used withstandard curves, give identicalresults. 2R. Neese, unpublished observations. However, thedirect acetylene method is less time consuming and, thus, became the preferredmethod during the course of this study. GC-MS Analyses—Glycerol triacetate and glucose aldonitrilewere analyzed for isotope enrichment by GC-MS as described previously(13Siler S.Q. Neese R.A. Parks E.J. Hellerstein M.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2319-2328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass isotopomerabundances were analyzed by selected ion monitoring of mass-to-charge ratios(m/z) 159–161(M0-M2) for glycerol and 328–331(M0-M3) for glucose. Tetrabromoethane wasanalyzed for isotope enrichment by GC-MS method as described previously(18Neese R.A. Siler S.Q. Cesar D. Antelo F. Lee D. Misell L. Patel K. Tehrani S. Shah P. Hellerstein M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The isotopic enrichmentof acetylene (m/z 26 and 27) was measured by cycloidal massspectrometry (Monitor Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA). Body 2H2O Enrichment—Isotopicenrichment of body 2H2O was calculated by comparison toa standard curve prepared gravimetrically from natural abundance water and2H2O. [2H]Glycerol Enrichment—Isotope enrichments of[2H]glycerol derived from acylglycerides were calculated bysubtraction of mass isotopomer abundances in unlabeled glycerol standards(19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1146-E1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EM1and EM2 were calculated as a fraction of the sum of massisotopomers M0-M2, as previously described forMIDA calculations (4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). [2H]Glucose Enrichment—Glucose labeled with2H via gluconeogenesis could result in a glycerol n ofgreater than the theoretical glycolytic value of 3.5, thereby resulting in anoverestimation of the contribution of glyceroneogenesis to adipose TG.Therefore we measured 2H glucose enrichments at two different timesof the day for each dietary group. 2H label was calculated using amodification of Lee et al.(20Lee W.N. Bergner E.A. Guo Z.K. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as shown inEquation 1,Net[2H]glucose enrichment=∑i=0nEMini(Eq. 1) where EMi represents the excess fraction of single-,double-, or triple-labeled glucose molecules present andni represents the number of labeled hydrogens on each ofthe M1–M3 molecular species(i.e. 1, 2, and 3). Similar net [2H]glucose enrichmentwould indicate a similar contribution of gluconeogenic glucose to circulatingglucose. Any changes observed would therefore be unrelated to changes inglucose enrichment. MIDA Calculations of n andA∞1—MIDA is a technique basedon combinatorial analysis of the labeling patterns present in polymers(4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J.

TheEM2 to EM1 ratio (R) is oneembodiment of this labeling pattern. R is dependent on two factors:the proportion (p) of labeled hydrogen atoms present in tissue water(i.e. the enrichment of 2H2O in tissue water)and the possible number of C–H bonds in glycerol that are derived fromthis tissue water (n). If one assumes that the 2H isotopicenrichment (p) of hydrogen in each actively incorporated C–H ofα-GP is equal to the 2H enrichment of body water and that2H2O enrichment is constant during the labeling period,n can be calculated from the measured p in body water andthe measured R (4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,19Hellerstein M.K.

Using calculation algorithms based on combinatorial probabilities aspreviously described (4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1146-E1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a “lookup”table can be generated, describing R over a given range of values ofp for discrete values of n (n = 3, n = 4,n = 5) (e.g. TableI). By using the value of p from measured body waterenrichment, the expected R across the range of values for nis compared with the measured value of R (based on the lookup table,e.g. p = 4.00% yields R = 0.121 for n = 3,R = 0.143 for n = 4, R = 0.166 for n = 5).Because physiologic samples contain a mixture of glyc3.5 andglyc5 (see below), we treat n as a non-integral value forthis modeling. A linear regression equation is then generated, reflecting therelationship between R and n at the experimentallydetermined p (the latter based on measured 2H2Oenrichment). The value for n is then calculated from the measuredR (e.g. if p = 4.00%, the equation is n =43.86R–2.29, so for R = 0.152, n = 4.38)(Fig. 3).Table ISample lookup table illustrating relationship between R, p, andnpR n = 3 (glyc3)R n = 4 (glyc4)R n = 5 (glyc5)%4.000.1210.1430.1664.100.1220.1450.1684.200.1230.1470.1714.300.1240.1490.1734.400.1250.1500.1764.500.1260.1520.178 Open table in a new tab Once n is established, one can calculateA∞1or the theoretical asymptotic valuefor fully labeled TG-glycerol. Accurate determination of this asymptotic orplateau value requires knowledge of n and is necessary for thedetermination of fractional synthesis (f) using the precursor productor rise-to-plateau approach(19Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1146-E1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inEquation 2,f=EM1/A1∞(Eq. 2) where EM1 represents the isotopic enrichment of the mass+1 labeled species of glycerol (i.e. the measured abundance in excessof natural abundance) and A∞1 representsthe asymptotic or plateau value possible for the isotopic enrichment of themass +1 species of glycerol, calculated from p and a non-integervalue of n. Relative Contribution of Glyceroneogenesis to AcylglycerideGlycerol— The term “n” is a probabilityparameter; therefore, we also calculated a measure with more physiologicalmeaning, by translating n into a relative contribution fromglyceroneogenesis to acylglyceride glycerol (a percentage). Assuming nocontribution from glycerol kinase, n can be assumed to come from onlytwo sources (glyc5 and glyc3.5). Thus n = 5x +3.5(1–x), and in Equation3, solving for x.x(% glyceroneogenesis)=(n−3.5)1.5×100(Eq. 3) Because glucose 2H-labeled via gluconeogenesis can contribute toglyc5, this percentage represents a maximum possiblecontribution. Statistical Analyses—A one-way analysis of variance withplanned pair-wise comparisons was used with p < 0.05 as thecriterion for significance for comparison of adipose n. Glucoseenrichment was analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis ofvariance (p < 0.05 criteria) followed by Mann-Whitney pair-wisecomparisons. An independent group Student's t test and anonparametric Mann-Whitney test with p < 0.05 as the criterion forsignificance was used for the fructose infusion comparison. Effect of LC Diet—After 26 days on the diet (15 days on2H2O), n was significantly higher in the LCgroup compared with the HC group in retroperitoneal and inguinal adiposedepots (Fig. 4A), andthere was a nonsignificant trend in the same direction in mesenteric andepididymal adipose depots. By 75 days on the diet (64 days on2H2O), n was significantly higher in alladipose depots in the LC group (Fig.4B). At that point, the body water enrichments were 4.46%± 0.11% in the LC group and 4.63% ± 0.05% in the HC group (notsignificantly different). R in the LC group ranged from 0.149 to0.162 and in the HC group from 0.146 to 0.152. From these measured values, then in the LC group ranged from 3.92 to 4.40 and in the HC group from3.68 to 3.86. The relative maximal contributions from glyceroneogenesis ineach fat pad after 75 days on the diet are presented inTable II showing an increasewith an LC diet from 17 to 50%. There were no significant differences inn between any adipose depots within either group at either timepoint.Table IIRelative maximal contribution from glyceroneogenesis to adiposeTG-glycerolFat PadsDietsHCLCRosiglitazone%%%M16 ± 445 ± 747 ± 4E20 ± 750 ± 1063 ± 6R12 ± 544 ± 749 ± 4I21 ± 760 ± 855 ± 4Average17 ± 350 ± 453 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Effect of Rosiglitazone—The addition of rosiglitazone to anHC diet significantly increased n in the epididymal and inguinaladipose depots after 26 days of the diet and 15 days of2H2O (Fig.5A). A similar, nonsignificant trend was seen in theother adipose depots. By 75 days of diet, n was significantly higherin all adipose depots in the rosiglitazone group(Fig. 5B). Body waterenrichments were 4.67% ± 0.15% in the rosiglitazone group and 4.63%± 0.05% in the untreated HC group (not significantly different).R in the rosiglitazone group ranged from 0.153 to 0.168. From thesemeasured values, the n in the rosiglitazone group ranged from 3.90 to4.44 compared with an n ranging from 3.68 to 3.86 in the control HCgroup. This corresponds to an increase in relative, maximal contribution fromglyceroneogenesis after 75 days of rosiglitazone treatment, from 17 to 53%(Table II). There were nosignificant differences in n between any adipose depots within eithergroup at either time point. Effect of Fructose Infusion—Body water enrichment for rats 5h after an intraperitoneal bolus of 2H2O was 4.67± 0.21%. In the fasting state, prior to fructose infusion, values ofn from plasma TG-glycerol were 4.51 ± 0.20 at –30 minand 4.41 ± .15 at –15 min, reflecting a stable n(Fig. 6) and an averagerelative contribution of glyceroneogenesis of 66%. After 3 h of fructoseinfusion, n in plasma TG-glycerol dropped significantly to 3.84± 0.08 (p < 0.01). After 4 h of infusion, nremained significantly suppressed from baseline at 4.01 ± 0.08,corresponding to a relative contribution from glyceroneogenesis of 34%. Plasma Glucose Enrichment—2H enrichments forglucose were determined in both the morning and evening. Results from themorning and evening groups were pooled resulting in 10 measures for eachdiet/treatment group. The LC group resulted in the highest net[2H]glucose enrichment (3.2 ± 0.5), which was significantly(p = 0.004) higher than the rosiglitazone treatment group (2.3± 0.6) and minimally significantly higher (p = 0.03) than theHC group (2.6 ± 0.6). Therefore increased glucose enrichment fromincreased gluconeogenesis on a low carbohydrate diet could contribute to theincreased n seen with the LC diet. The decrease in glucose enrichmentwith rosiglitazone treatment suggests all the increase in n is causedby increased glyceroneogenesis, and in fact its contribution if anything wouldbe underestimated in this group. In the present study, the physiological basis and the informational valueof n in TG-glycerol was explored. The experimentally determinedvalues of n under normal conditions in adipose TG-glycerol(3.7–3.9) and during a fast in liver TG-glycerol (4.4–4.5) werecomparable to previously measured values (3.8–4.0 and 4.6–4.8,respectively) (4Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am.J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These valuesindicate that under normal conditions, with a standard HC chow diet, themajority (83%) of TG-glycerol present in adipose tissue is derived fromglycolytic metabolism of unlabeled glucose (i.e. glyc3.5).In contrast, in a fasted liver, the majority of acylglyceride glycerol (66%)is derived from glyceroneogenesis (i.e. glyc5). Theseresults are consistent with the traditional view that glucose is the majorprecursor for the adipose tissue TG-glycerol used for storage of TG and thatglyceroneogenesis is the predominant source in the fasted liver. The findingthat n in adipose tissue TG-glycerol (3.7–3.9) is relativelyclose to the theoretical value from glycolysis of unlabeled, dietary glucose(up to 3.5) is also consistent with the notion that most TG deposition inadipose tissue occurs in the fed state, when unlabeled glucose is present, asopposed to the fasted state, when blood glucose contains a higher proportionof gluconeogenically derived, labeled glucose. What had been less well recognized is the role that glyceroneogenesis mayplay in adipose tissue TG synthesis under altered physiologic states or"

Plasmids expressing FLAG-JNK3, FLAG-β-arrestin 2,GFP-β-arrestin 2, and HA-ASK1 were a kind gift from Alan Whitmarsh(University of Manchester, UK), and the HA-AT1aR construct was a kind giftfrom Stephane LaPorte (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Cell Culture—293T and COS-7 cells were maintained inDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.293T and COS-7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen)according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pull-downs, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblots—293T cellswere washed once with ice-cold buffered saline then lysed in buffer containing50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 5mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).After 10 min of incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 14000× g for 15 min. Supernatants were subject to pull-down orimmunoprecipitation, as described below. Samples were separated by 10%SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL,Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were subjected to immunoblotting withanti-Xpress (Invitrogen), anti-M3/6 polyclonal (also used to detect GST),anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal (Sigma), or anti-HA High Affinity (Roche) antibodiesand horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako). Blots weredeveloped using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitationor pull-down experiments, extracts were made as described above and incubatedwith either glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for GST-containingconstructs or with anti-FLAG M2 antibody with protein G-Sepharose beads(Sigma) for 3 h. Beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer andresuspended in an appropriate amount of gel loading buffer (finalconcentration 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 4% glycerol). For experiments to determine JNKphosphorylation, COS-7 cells were lysed directly into gel-loading buffer andblots probed with anti-phospho-JNK (Promega), anti-HA High Affinity, anti-FLAGM2, or anti-Xpress antibodies. Immunostaining—COS-7 cells were transfected on glasscoverslips. The cells were incubated with 1 μm angiotensin II(Sigma) for the indicated times. The cells were then washed withphosphate-buffered saline solution, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma),and lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. Indirectimmunofluorescence was performed by incubation with the MKP7 polyclonalantiserum in 1% bovine serum albumin/0.5% goat serumalbumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C.

Selective Binding of MKP7 to β-Arrestin 2—Werecently reported that the DSPs, MKP7, and M3/6 bind the JNK scaffold proteinsJIP-1 and JIP-2 (1Willoughby E.A. Perkins G.R. Collins M.K. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Asβ-arrestin 2 has been identified as a scaffold protein for JNK3, theneuronal isoform of JNK (23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Biol.Chem. 2001; 276: 27770-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we asked whether any DSPscould bind β-arrestin 2. We co-expressed GST-tagged β-arrestin 2with Xpress-tagged members of the DSP family and examined β-arrestin 2precipitates for presence of the phosphatases using the anti-Xpress tagantibody. Under these conditions, MKP7 bound β-arrestin 2(Fig. 1A, toppanel, lane 2), whereas none of the other DSPs, including the highlyrelated M3/6, was detected in the β-arrestin 2 precipitates(Fig. 1A, bottompanel, lane 2, and Fig.1B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). We next performed co-precipitation analysis of MKP7 deletion mutants withβ-arrestin 2 (Fig. 1, C andD). This identified a deletion mutant containing aminoacids 1–394 that did not bind β-arrestin 2, whereas a mutantcontaining amino acids 1–443 did(Fig. 1D, lanes6 and 8). The sequence between amino acids 394 and 443 is alsocritical for MKP7 binding to JIP-1. The equivalent region of M3/6 is verysimilar to that of MKP7, which suggests either that β-arrestin 2 (unlikeJIP-1) discriminates between the two sequences or that M3/6 binding is notdetected within the sensitivity of our assay. The MKP7 C-terminal fragmentresidues 360–665 were sufficient for binding both JIP-1 andβ-arrestin 2, whereas residues 1–394 of MKP7 did not bind(Fig. 1E, comparelanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). As shown inFig. 1F,MKP7-(1–394), which cannot bind β-arrestin 2, can still bind JNK3(lane 3). Thus MKP7 binding to β-arrestin 2 is dependent onresidues within its C-terminal region. This region is sufficient for theinteraction, demonstrating that the interaction is independent of JNK3 bindingto MKP7. The Regions of β-Arrestin 2 That Interact withMKP7—We then performed co-precipitation analysis of β-arrestin2 deletion constructs with MKP7. MKP7 bound weakly to the N-terminal region(1–164) and full-length β-arrestin 2(Fig. 2B, (ii),lanes 5 and 7); however, MKP7 bound more strongly to a fragmentof amino acids (165–410) of β-arrestin 2(Fig. 2B, (i),lanes 2 and 3). To map the strong interaction site, furtherβ-arrestin 2 constructs were analyzed. Residues between 195 and 202,previously identified as the JNK binding domain, were critical for strongbinding (Fig. 2C,lanes 2 and 4, and Fig.2D, lanes 4 and 6). To assess the roleof JNK in this interaction, we examined the interaction between aβ-arrestin 2 central fragment and the MKP7 C terminus, which does notbind JNK3. Amino acids 165–239 of β-arrestin 2 bound the MKP7residues 360–665 (Fig.2E, compare lane 5); this demonstrates aninteraction between the MKP7 C terminus and the central JNK binding domainregion of β-arrestin 2 that is independent of JNK3. The C terminus ofMKP7 therefore interacts most strongly with a region between amino acids 195and 202 of β-arrestin 2. Removal of the N-terminal region (1–164)of β-arrestin 2 increases MKP7 binding. It is possible that theN-terminal region may regulate MKP7 binding in the intact protein; for examplea conformational change in β-arrestin 2 that displaces the N-terminalregion might further expose the strong binding region between amino acids 195and 202. MKP7 Dephosphorylates JNK Associated with β-Arrestin2—β-Arrestin 2 binds JNK3 and its upstream kinases, ASK1 andindirectly MKK4, and enhances JNK3 phosphorylation(23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Miller W.E. McDonald P.H. Cai S.F. Field M.E. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.Chem. 2001; 276: 27770-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore assessedwhether MKP7 could dephosphorylate β-arrestin 2-bound JNK, as wepreviously described for JIP-1-bound JNK(1Willoughby E.A. Perkins G.R. Collins M.K. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We overexpressed JNK3 withβ-arrestin 2 and the MAP3K ASK1 in COS-7 cells and observed enhancementof JNK activation as reported previously(23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)(Fig. 3A, lanes2 and 3). The addition of MKP7 inhibited the JNK3 activationstimulated by β-arrestin 2, whereas MKP7 did not affect phosphorylatedJNK in the absence of scaffold (Fig.3A, compare lanes 2 and 4; andlanes 3 and 5). This activity of MKP7 was dependent on itsphosphatase activity, as a catalytically inactive mutant(1Willoughby E.A. Perkins G.R. Collins M.K. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) did not affect JNK3activation (Fig. 3B,lanes 3 and 5). These data show that MKP7 can inactivate thepool of JNK3 bound to β-arrestin 2. Angiotensin II ligation to the AT1aR stimulates JNK3 phosphorylation in thepresence of β-arrestin 2(23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We co-expressed JNK3,β-arrestin 2, and AT1aR in COS-7 cells and showed that angiotensin IIstimulated phosphorylation of JNK3 at 15 and 30 min, with the signaldisappearing after 60 min (Fig.3C, lanes 3 and 4), similar topreviously published data (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar).In the absence of β-arrestin 2 and addition of MKP7, stimulation of JNK3phosphorylation remains the same as above(Fig. 3C, lanes8 and 9). However, when MKP7 was expressed along withβ-arrestin 2, JNK3 phosphorylation was equivalent at 15 min afterangiotensin II stimulation but completely abrogated 30 min after stimulation(Fig. 3C, lanes3 and 4; and 13 and 14). This data indicatesMKP7 utilizes the interaction with β-arrestin 2 to specificallydephosphorylate JNK3, thus allowing a more transient JNK3 phosphorylationunder AT1aR activation. MKP7 Interacts with β-Arrestin 2 in Resting Cells but IsReleased after AT1aR Stimulation—To explain the initial equivalentJNK3 activation seen in the presence of MKP7, followed by its rapidinactivation, we postulated that MKP7 interaction with β-arrestin 2 mightbe regulated by AT1aR stimulation. To detect MKP7 location, we used apreviously described polyclonal antiserum(1Willoughby E.A. Perkins G.R. Collins M.K. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that detects a cytoplasmicprotein in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.4A). We used leptomycin B to inhibit the nuclear exportof MKP7 (10Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,11Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and demonstrated resultingnuclear fluorescence accumulation to confirm the specificity of this staining(data not shown). We then co-expressed MKP7 with components of the AT1aRsignaling system and β-arrestin 2.Fig. 4A showsoverexpressed GFP-β-arrestin 2 (green) and MKP7 (red)were both present in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Angiotensin II ligationto AT1aR has been reported to cause internalization of JNK3 bound toβ-arrestin 2 on endocytic vesicles(23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 4A shows thatβ-arrestin 2 (green) moved to the plasma membrane 5 min afteragonist activation of the AT1aR, whereas MKP7 remains cytoplasmic. After 15min, green vesicles containing β-arrestin 2 (but not MKP7) hadformed, but after 30 min, the vesicles appeared yellow, indicatingthe recruitment of MKP7. After 60 min, yellow endosomal structureshad begun clustering at the perinuclear region of the cell. These experimentssuggest that MKP7 is released from β-arrestin 2 after activation of theAT1aR and is then re-recruited after ∼30 min to β-arrestin 2 presenton endocytic vesicles. To confirm this dynamic interaction between β-arrestin 2 and MKP7, weexamined MKP7 binding to β-arrestin 2 after AT1aR stimulation. For theseexperiments, we used 293T cells to express sufficient protein for detectionafter immunoprecipitation rather than the COS-7 cells in which we measuredsubcellular localization and JNK3 dephosphorylation. In the absence of JNK3,the binding of MKP7 to β-arrestin 2 changed relatively little afterangiotensin II stimulation (Fig.4B, lanes 3–7). However with the additionof JNK3, MKP7 binding to β-arrestin was lost rapidly after angiotensin IIstimulation, returning to the initial level after 60 min(Fig. 4B, lanes9–13). The level of JNK3 binding to β-arrestin 2 remained thesame throughout the time course, as previously described(23McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).Together, these data demonstrate that activation of the AT1aR causes rapiddissociation of MKP7 from β-arrestin 2. This dissociation is dependent onthe presence of JNK3 and is reversed 30–60 min after AT1aR stimulation.Because JNK3 is required for MKP7 dissociation from β-arrestin 2triggered by angiotensin II, we asked whether JNK3 activation per seis sufficient to cause MKP7 dissociation. To do this, we used overexpressedASK1 as a JNK3 activator. Fig.4C shows that ASK1 causes a significant decrease in theamount of MKP7 bound to β-arrestin 2, suggesting that it is thestimulation of JNK3 phosphorylation that leads to MKP7 dissociation fromβ-arrestin 2. β-arrestins were first described as adaptor proteins involved in thedesensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors. After GPCRactivation, the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor becomes phosphorylated by Gprotein-coupled receptor kinases, leading to β-arrestin recruitment.β-arrestin then blocks further G protein interaction and bind proteinsrequired for the internalization of GPCRs, such as clathrin(26Goodman Jr., O.B.

We have shown that the dual specificity phosphatase MKP7 bindsβ-arrestin 2, using residues 394–443 of MKP7 previously identifiedas the JIP binding domain (1Willoughby E.A. Perkins G.R. Collins M.K. Whitmarsh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10731-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The interaction of this region of MKP7 with these two diverse scaffoldproteins suggests that it may function as a general scaffold-binding domain.The interaction between MKP7 and β-arrestin 2 is dynamic, meaning theydissociate after β-arrestin 2 is recruited to the AT1aR by angiotensinstimulation. Recent data have indicated β-arrestin 2, upon activation bybinding to the phosphorylated C terminus of GPCRs, undergoes a conformationalchange (46Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Nobles K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55744-55753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thisconformational change could be involved in the triggering of JNK3 activation.We have shown that the presence of JNK3 on the scaffold is necessary for MKP7dissociation and also that ASK1 overexpression leads to MKP7 dissociation. Wetherefore propose that activation of JNK3 triggers MKP7 dissociation fromβ-arrestin 2. After 30–60 min, depending on the cell system, MKP7reassociates with β-arrestin 2 to specifically dephosphorylate JNK3. Thiscycle of MKP7 dissociation from and reassociation with β-arrestin 2explains how a signal can be transmitted through a scaffold protein thatapparently binds both activating and inhibitory components. By binding intothis complex, under these circumstances, MKP7 may play a role in regulatingJNK in the cytoplasm. These studies have been performed in cells overexpressing the signalingcomponents; however, endogenous interaction between β-arrestin 2 and JNK3has been seen in brain lysates(23McDonald P.H.

https://openalex.org/W2026418788,"Mammalian skeletal myogenesis results in the differentiation of myoblasts to mature syncytial myotubes, a process regulated by an intricate genetic network of at least three protein families: muscle regulatory factors, E proteins, and Id proteins. MyoD, a key muscle regulatory factor, and its negative regulator Id1 have both been shown to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Using C2C12 cells and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we showed that MyoD and Id1 co-localize within the nucleus in proliferating myoblasts. In mature myotubes, in contrast, they reside in distinctive subcellular compartments, with MyoD within the nucleus and Id1 exclusively in the cytoplasm. Cellular abundance of Id1 was markedly diminished from the very onset of muscle differentiation, whereas MyoD abundance was reduced to a much lesser extent and only at the later stages of differentiation. These reductions in MyoD and Id1 protein levels seem to result from a change in the rate of protein synthesis rather than the rate of degradation. In vivo protein stability studies revealed that the rates of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated MyoD and Id1 degradation are independent of myogenic differentiation state. Id1 and MyoD were both rapidly degraded, each with a t½ ≃ 1 h in myoblasts and in myotubes. Furthermore, relative protein synthesis rates for MyoD and Id1 were significantly diminished during myoblast to myotube differentiation. These results provide insight as to the interaction between MyoD and Id1 in the process of muscle differentiation and have implications for the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation and protein synthesis in muscle differentiation and metabolism under abnormal and pathological conditions.

Skeletal muscle differentiation is characterized by the terminal withdrawal of the myoblast from the cell cycle, activation of muscle-specific gene expression, and cell fusion into multinucleated myotubes. These events are coordinated by a family of four muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and Mrf4, termed the muscle regulatory factors (1Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R.

Mice lacking myogenin appropriately specify the skeletal muscle lineage but fail to terminally differentiate. Mrf4 is required for the maintenance of the differentiated myotubes. Although the specification of the myogenic lineage requires myoD and myf5, as double knock-out of both genes yields mice with no skeletal muscle (5Braun T. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), MyoD is also required for healthy self-renewing proliferation of the adult skeletal muscle satellite cells (6Megeney L.A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Muscle regulatory factors form heterodimers with ubiquitous E proteins and activate myogenic differentiation through their subsequent binding to specific sequences, termed E boxes, in the promoter regulatory regions of muscle-restricted target genes (4Pownall M.E. Gustafsson M.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 747-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activities of muscle regulatory factors are negatively regulated by a family of inhibitors of DNA-binding (Id) proteins. The four Id proteins (Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4) are helix-loop-helix proteins that contain no basic region and thus do not bind DNA. However, they are able to dimerize with one another and with MyoD or E proteins, albeit with different affinities (9Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Benezra R. Rafii S. Lyden D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8334-8341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Langlands K. Yin X. Anand G. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19785-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Id1 is most active in terms of MyoD binding. The binding affinity of Id1 for the E proteins is considerably higher than its affinity for MyoD. Sequestering the ubiquitous E proteins allows Id1 to control the transcriptional activity of muscle-specific MyoD. In cultured myoblasts, Id1 over-expression via a “dominant-negative” effect inhibits the transactivation by MyoD, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of proteins participating in muscle differentiation and consequently the fusion of myoblasts to myotubes (12Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). MyoD and Id1 have both been shown to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (13Floyd Z.E.

Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway involves the activation of ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, followed by transfer of ubiquitin to E2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. E2 shuttles the ubiquitin to the substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase, E3, which then delivers the ubiquitin to the protein substrate to be degraded. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system is recognized as a versatile and efficient mechanism for the control of gene expression. The level of expression of MyoD and Id1 are vitally important during muscle differentiation. Both mRNA and protein levels of Id1 are down-regulated upon initiation of differentiation (20Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). MyoD mRNA levels change only slightly during differentiation (21Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), yet the level of MyoD protein is decreased in reserve cells during muscle differentiation (22Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reducing the level of MyoD protein by its destabilization has been shown to be associated with the inhibition of myogenic differentiation under abnormal or pathophysiological conditions. For example, accelerated MyoD degradation resulting from hypoxia blocked the accumulation of early myogenic differentiation markers such as myogenin, p21, and pRb and prevented both permanent cell cycle withdraw and terminal differentiation (23Di Carlo A. De Mori R. Martelli F. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Germani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, tumor necrosis factor α inhibits myogenic differentiation through destabilizing MyoD protein in a NF-κB-dependent manner, interferes with skeletal muscle regeneration, and may contribute to muscle wasting (24Acharyya S.

FASEB. J. 2004; 18: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Studies in a cell culture model that has a phenotype similar to that observed in myoblast cultures derived from myotonic dystrophy 1 patient muscle suggest that C2C12 myogenic differentiation is disrupted by mutant myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 3′-untranslated region transcripts via posttranscriptional reduction of MyoD protein levels (27Amack J.D. Reagan S.R. Mahadevan M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previous studies in vitro or in non-muscle cells also show that MyoD degradation is regulated by phosphorylation, DNA binding, and protein-protein interactions (19Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MyoD is required for its rapid degradation. The specific DNA sequence to which MyoD binds can inhibit MyoD degradation. Id1, which inhibits the binding of MyoD complexes to DNA, abrogates the effect of DNA on the stabilization of MyoD. Furthermore, protein degradation studies following co-transfection of MyoD and Id1 to HeLa cells have shown that MyoD is able to modulate both the localization and the degradation of Id1 (15Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, how the morphological and biological changes involved in myogenic differentiation affect the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of MyoD and Id1 in muscle cells and how their degradation and interaction contribute to their cellular abundance and thus regulate differentiation. Mouse C2C12 myoblast cells are a well characterized myogenic cell line. In the presence of mitogen-rich serum, they proliferate as an undifferentiated population expressing MyoD and Myf5. Terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells may be induced by serum deprivation, which initiates a series of chronologically ordered events with expression of myogenin as the earliest event detected. Thereafter, cells permanently withdraw from the cell cycle, contractile proteins such as myosin begin to accumulate, and cell fusion then takes place resulting in the formation of myotubes. Using C2C12 cells as our model, we show here that MyoD and Id1 co-localize within the nucleus in proliferating myoblasts. In mature myotubes, in contrast, they reside in distinctive subcellular compartments, with MyoD within the nucleus and Id1 exclusively in the cytoplasm. Both MyoD and Id1 are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway during the differentiation of myoblast to myotube. Furthermore, the rate of their degradation appears to be unaffected by the differentiation state, whereas a reduction of MyoD and Id1 synthesis rate was observed during myogenic differentiation. Plasmids and Construction of Id1-HA—Wild type MyoD in pCIneo and Id1 in pcDNA3 have been described previously (15Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Id1 with a 1× HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GM, growth medium; DM, differentiation medium; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CHX, cycloheximide; RT, reverse transcription; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. tag at the C terminus was constructed by the insertion of the HA tag into pcDNA3 harboring wild type Id1 encoding DNA. PCR primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. DNA sequencing using Big Dye version 3.1 (ABI Biosystems) was used to confirm all sequences. Cell Culture—The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were routinely propagated in growth medium (GM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Myogenic differentiation was induced by changing the growth medium to differentiation medium (DM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin when cells reached confluence. Cells were then maintained in differentiation medium for 6 days with medium being changed every 24 h. Transient transfections of C2C12 myoblasts were performed using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunofluorescence—C2C12 cells on glass coverslips were first washed with PBSc, a phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBSa, Fisher) supplemented with 100 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm MgCl2, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched in 0.1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0), and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Subcellular localization of MyoD, Id1, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain in C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes was then determined by indirect immunofluorescence using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-MyoD (C-20), anti-Id1 (C-20), anti-myogenin (M-225), and anti-myosin heavy chain (H-300), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chains) (Molecular Probes) after blocking the cells in PBSc containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% TW-80. Cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were taken with a Zeiss AxioCam digital camera. Blocking control experiments for the detection of MyoD and Id1 were performed by preincubating the probing primary antibody with the corresponding peptides (MyoD (C-20)P and Id1 (C-20)P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that were initially used to generate the antibodies. For double immunofluorescence of MyoD and Id1, a mouse monoclonal anti-MyoD (Novocastra) coupled with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 (C-20) coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) are used as probes. Cells were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview 500, Olympus) with a 60× oil immersion objective lens. Protein Expression Level during Myogenic Differentiation—C2C12 cells were washed with PBSa twice on ice and harvested at different stages of myogenic differentiation (day -1, 70-80% confluent C2C12 myoblasts in GM; day 0, 100% confluent C2C12 cells and the time point for switching the medium to DM; day 1 to day 6, C2C12 cells cultured in DM for 1 to 6 days). All of the cells were lysed for at least 30 min in PBSa containing 5% Igepal, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The collected cells were then sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration of each freshly prepared cell lysate was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). After mixing with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics). Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-MyoD (C-20), anti-Id1 (Z-8), anti-myogenin (M-225), and anti-myosin heavy chain (H-300), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Blocking control experiments for MyoD Western blot were performed by preincubating the probing primary antibody with peptide (MyoD (C-20)P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before applying to the membrane. Determination of Protein Degradation Half-life—C2C12 cells were incubated with cycloheximide (CHX, 100 μg/ml, Sigma) to inhibit further protein synthesis. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal, 20 μm, International Peptides) was added along with CHX when necessary. Following incubation for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h, cells were harvested and lysed, and cell lysates were collected as described above. After treatment with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), equal volumes of each sample were loaded in each lane for gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed in the same fashion as described above. A rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Upstate) was used for the detection of Id1-HA protein. Desired protein bands from the Western blottings were quantitated using the EDAS system (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the data were graphed using the EXCEL graphing program (Microsoft). Protein degradation rate is expressed as half-life (t½), the time for degradation of 50% of the protein. Each of the half-life data reported was evaluated by three to six independent determinations and is expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparison of Protein Synthesis Rate—C2C12 cells were incubated with MG132 (20 μm). Following incubation for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, cells were harvested and lysed, and cell lysates were collected as described above. After treatment with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), equal volumes of each sample were loaded in each lane for gel electrophoresis. Western blottings were performed in the same fashion as described above. The pixels for each band were measured and normalized so that the number of pixels at t = 0 was 1. The pixels of each band were plotted versus time. Protein synthesis rates were compared based on the initial slope from plots of data from 0 to 4 h. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA samples from C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes were obtained using RNAzol reagents (Tel-Test, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed for Id1, MyoD, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase using ProSTAR Ultra HF RT-PCR system (Stratagene). The Id1 primers are as follows: 5′-TGGACGAGCAGCAGGTGAACG-3′ and 5′-GCACTGATCTCGCCGTTCAGG-3′ (with a product of 243 bp). The MyoD primers are: 5′-GACAGGACAGGACAGGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACCGCAGTAGAGAAGTGT-3′ (with a product of 358 bp). To study MyoD and Id1 degradation during muscle differentiation, we chose the murine C2C12 myoblast cells as our model (12Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Liu C.J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By shifting confluent C2C12 cells from mitogen-rich growth medium to 2% horse serum containing differentiation medium, we were able to observe the expected morphological changes of C2C12 myogenic differentiation, namely cell alignment and fusion into multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1A). By day 1 in DM, C2C12 cells were compact and aligned, but there was no obvious cell fusion. By day 2 in DM, about 5% of cells were fused to form scattered, small multinucleated cells. During the next 2 days, the cell fusion rate was rapid. By day 4 in DM, about 50% of cells completed fusion, and a large number of tubular syncytial cells were observed with various numbers of nuclei mostly arranged in linear arrays. These myotubes further expanded by incorporating additional neighboring mononucleated cells and via fusion with nearby myotubes and increased in size. By day 6 in DM, fused cells accounted for up to 70% of the cells, whereas a subpopulation of cells remained undifferentiated as reserve cells (22Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed morphology transition from myoblasts to myotubes was also confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of myosin heavy chain, a major muscle contractile protein, coupled with DAPI nuclear staining. As a marker for mature muscle cells, myosin heavy chain was detected only in myotubes with multi-DAPI-positive nuclei inside single cells (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have shown that MyoD subcellular localization markedly influences its degradation rate and that the degradation of Id1 can be modulated by MyoD (14Lingbeck J.M. Trausch-Azar J.S.

To determine the locus of MyoD and Id1 degradation during differentiation and the possible interaction between this pair, we first set out to determine the localization of MyoD and Id1 in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 1B). By indirect immunofluorescent examination, MyoD was localized to the cell nucleus in mononucleated myoblasts as well as in multinucleated myotubes. In myoblasts, Id1 was observed to be predominantly co-localized to the nucleus with MyoD, with low level cytoplasmic staining, suggesting that they interact in vivo. In contrast, MyoD and Id1 appeared to reside in distinctive subcellular compartments in myotubes, with MyoD within the nucleus and Id1 exclusively in the cytoplasm. Preincubation of the probing antibody with its corresponding peptide completely abolished the observed immunofluorescent signals for MyoD and Id1 in our blocking control experiments (data not shown), demonstrating that the localization of both proteins in myoblasts and myotubes is not the result of nonspecific binding. We then determined MyoD and Id1 protein abundance during the time course of differentiation via immunoblot. Cellular abundance of Id1 is markedly diminished from the very onset of muscle differentiation, whereas MyoD abundance is reduced to a much lesser extent and only at the later stages of differentiation (Fig. 2). After only 2 days in differentiation medium, the Id1 protein level had already decreased to less than 20% of that found in proliferating myoblasts. During this same period of differentiation, the MyoD protein level remained about the same, if not somewhat increased. By day 6 in differentiation medium Id1 protein was reduced 10-fold, whereas MyoD protein was reduced less than 3-fold. Overall, the relative ratio between MyoD and Id1 increased as the cells committed to differentiation. The abundance of the myogenic regulatory factor myogenin and the contractile protein myosin heavy chain were also determined in the same cell lysates (Fig. 2). Myogenin, which promotes terminal differentiation, became detectable the first day in differentiation medium after cells reached confluence. We also observed progressive accumulation of myosin heavy chain from day 1 onward. These observations verified that our model exhibited the biological characteristics of muscle differentiation in a chronologically appropriate manner. To determine how ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation contributes to the regulation of MyoD and Id1 abundance during muscle differentiation, we first compared their protein degradation half-lives in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. As shown in Fig. 3, MyoD was rapidly degraded in both cases with the same half-life (t½ ≃ 0.9 h). Incubation of cells with MG132, a potent and selective inhibitor of the proteasome, markedly slowed the rate of MyoD degradation (t½ ≥ 10 h). For Id1, rapid degradation was also seen both in myoblasts and in myotubes (t½ ≃ 0.8 h). The presence of MG132 greatly stabilized Id1 (t½ > 10 h). All of these results suggested that both MyoD and Id1 are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway during muscle differentiation and that the degradation rate is unchanged in myoblasts and in myotubes regardless of the morphological and biological changes. Herein, notably only the hyperphosphorylated MyoD species (i.e. the top, slower migrating, bands) in Fig. 3A was used to calculate the half-life. This practice is somewhat different from that used in previous reports in which both of the MyoD bands, although not well separated in many cases, are used for the calculation of MyoD degradation. We believe that this method best serves our purpose because MyoD degradation requires its prior phosphorylation (28Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and because the hypophosphorylated band appears to be much more stable. Although no change was observed in the degradation rate of MyoD or Id1 in myoblasts (day -1) and myotubes (day 6), the possibility remains that MyoD or Id1 could be degraded at a different rate at a specific stage between the onset of muscle differentiation and its completion. We thus determined MyoD and Id1 degradation rates at various time points throughout C2C12 differentiation. As seen in Fig. 4, MyoD, as well as Id1, was degraded at about the same rate during differentiation from proliferating, mononucleated myoblasts to mature syncytial muscle cells. These results suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated MyoD and Id1 degradation is independent of the muscle differentiation state. Studies in HeLa cells following co-transfection of MyoD and Id1 have suggested that MyoD can modulate the rate of Id1 degradation (15Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have shown that MyoD and Id1 co-localize in the nucleus of myoblasts (Fig. 1B), suggesting that there is possible interaction between the pair. To determine whether the relative abundance of MyoD or Id1 influences the degradation rate, we over-expressed MyoD or Id1 in myoblasts by transient transfection. Following the transient transfection of MyoD or Id1 to myoblasts, each was rapidly degraded (t½ ≃ 0.9 h for MyoD and t½ ≃ 0.8 h for Id1) at the same rate as was observed for endogenous MyoD or Id1 in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 5). Furthermore, incubation with MG132 greatly stabilized the degradation of the protein in each case. An HA tag was attached to the C terminus of the Id1 protein to allow discrimination from the endogenous protein. Western blots using both anti-Id1 and anti-HA antibodies yielded identical half-lives. Because no obvious alteration in protein stability was seen for MyoD or Id1 during myogenic differentiation, we compared their protein synthesis rates in myoblasts and myotubes. We took advantage of MG132, the proteasome inhibitor, and determined the rate of MyoD and Id1 accumulation. Under the experimental conditions in which MyoD and Id1 protein degradation was abolished, the relative rate of MyoD and Id1 protein accumulation correlated with the relative rates of protein synthesis in vivo. As seen in Fig. 6, within2hof incubation in MG132, the rate of accumulation of both Id1 and MyoD was substantially slower in myotubes than in myoblasts, suggesting that the rate of Id1 (∼4-fold) and MyoD (∼3.5-fold) protein synthesis is more rapid in myoblasts than in myotubes. To determine whether the down-regulation of the protein synthesis rates is a general phenomenon of myogenic differentiation, similar studies were also performed on a variety of other proteins. For several, we observed no decrease in protein synthes"

A yeast two-hybrid screen resulted in identification offilamin C (FLN-C) as one of its targets. Knockdown of RasGAP or FLN-C, orsevering their interaction, resulted in down-regulation of the RNA polymeraseII kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7). This appeared to be provoked bythe release of cdk7 mRNA from RasGAP SH3 domain-binding protein, G3BP, and itssubsequent degradation. In parallel, myocyte growth was also inhibited. On theother hand, overexpression of RasGAP induced a Cdk7- and FLN-C-dependentgrowth. Thus, we propose that the physical interaction between RasGAP andFLN-C facilitates an interaction between G3BP and cdk7 mRNA. This results instabilization of cdk7 mRNA, an increase in its protein, which is required forcell growth.

This results instabilization of cdk7 mRNA, an increase in its protein, which is required forcell growth. Cell growth or hypertrophy is defined as an increase in cell size and mass.Some organs, such as the heart, grow after birth by a process of cellularhypertrophy, whereas others expand by multiplication of cells, but even thencell growth is a prerequisite to division. The mechanism of growth involves anincrease in the synthesis of total cellular protein and other macromolecules.Many studies have focused on identifying the signaling pathways that result inthis effect. One main pathway is the phosphatidylinositol3-kinase-Akt-target of rapamycin (TOR) thatresults in phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and initiation factor4E-binding protein (4E-BP), which enhances ribosome biosynthesis (reviewed inRef. 1Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Another potentialpathway that is coupled to proliferation includes Cyclin D1 and Cdk4(2Datar S.A. Jacobs H.W. de la Cruz A.F. Lehner C.F. Edgar B.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4543-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is notyet fully understood. It should be remembered, however, that mRNA is anecessary template for protein synthesis, and, thus, its own synthesis is aprerequisite for this process. But studies pertaining to pathways thatregulate total mRNA synthesis are limited. Our previous data implicate RasGAPin a pathway that appears to regulate both mRNA and protein synthesis.Overexpression ofRasGAP 1The abbreviations used are: RasGAP, Ras GTPase-activating protein; Cdk7,cyclin-dependent kinase 7; Cdk9, cyclin-dependent kinase 9; FLN-C, filamin C;nGAP, N-terminal domain of RasGAP (amino acids 1–666); shRNA, shorthairpin RNA; ΔFLN, deletion mutant of FLN-C (repeats 15–17); G3BP,Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein; m.o.i., multiplicityof infection; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nickend labeling; ET-1, endothelin-1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CTD, C-terminaldomain. or a mutantlacking the GTPase activating domain results in enhanced global mRNA andprotein synthesis that is accompanied by up-regulation of Cdk7 and hypo- andhyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II(3Abdellatif M.

The present study attemptsto identify other members of this pathway. RasGAP through it catalytic domain interacts with Ras-GTP(4Adari H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Der C.J. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 240: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), enhancing its GTPaseactivity (5Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) and resulting inits inactivation. On the other hand, the N-terminal two-thirds of RasGAP(nGAP) consist of multiple domains, including hydrophobic SH3-binding,Src-homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3), and pleckstrin homology domains. In thepresence of apoptotic insults, the C-terminal catalytic domain is cleaved off.The remainder of the molecule (nGAP) confers protection to the cells fromapoptosis (6Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol.Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We subsequentlydiscovered that RasGAP interacts with and activates Akt(7Yue Y. Lypowy J. Hedhli N. Abdellatif M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12883-12889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear thatRasGAP has a myriad of functions that are independent of its catalytic domainand its negative regulatory effect on Ras. Effectors of RasGAP remain largely unknown, although they could potentiallybe ascribed to any of the known partners of RasGAP. For example, in additionto its recruitment to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor(8Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas p190 is also aRho-GTPase-activating protein(14Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). RasGAP binds G3BPthrough its SH3 sequence (15Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).This protein has an endoribonuclease activity and thus implicates RasGAP inthe regulation of RNA stability(16Gallouzi I.E.

RasGAP also binds theSrc-related family of kinases, including Src, Hck, Fyn, and Lck, through itsN-terminal proline-rich region, serving as a substrate for these kinases(17Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It binds Rab5 andstimulates its activity (18Liu K.

Itbinds annexin VI through its C2, Ca2+-dependent, lipid-bindingdomain (20Davis A.J. Butt J.T. Walker J.H. Moss S.E. Gawler D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24333-24336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the significanceof which is still unknown. Interestingly, RasGAP also associates with thetranscriptional suppressor of cytokinesignaling (SOCS-3)(21Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which is a negativeregulator of STAT-3, also a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy(22Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M.

SOCS-3 blocks thefunction of RasGAP through interacting with its SH2 domain, thus, prolongingthe activity of Ras, but a reciprocal relationship is unknown. Filamin, on the other hand, is mainly a structural protein that belongs toan extended family of actin-binding proteins. Filamin-A and -B are ubiquitous,whereas filamin-C (FLN-C) is a muscle-restricted isoform. These three forms offilamin have 24 repeats, ∼96 amino acids each. Both FLN-A and FLN-B have ahinge between repeats 15 and 16, whereas all three isoforms have a hingebetween repeats 23 and 24. FLN-C also has an additional 81 amino acids inrepeat 20 (23Thompson T.G. Chan Y.M. Hack A.A. Brosius M. Rajala M. Lidov H.G. McNally E.M. Watkins S. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). All three havea highly conserved N-terminal actin-binding domain and a C-terminaldimerization domain. The main known function of filamin is to cross-link actinfilaments. This is achieved by the binding of a filamin dimer to two actinfilaments through its N-terminal actin-binding domain, leading to theformation of a hinge between the two filaments. It has been reported that theangle between the two filaments is inversely proportional to the concentrationof filamin (24Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat.Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). But, as the list of signaling molecules and receptors that bind to theC-terminal region of filamin has been growing, it is now becoming clear thatfilamin is not merely a cytoskeletal support protein, but a bridge betweencell signaling and architecture. For example, the C-terminal half of filamin Aseems to be a docking site for many intracellular signaling molecules andmembrane receptors. It binds RalA, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 between amino acids2554 and 2647 (25Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), Trio, aRho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, between amino acids 2354 and 2647,which is necessary for Rho guanine nucleotide-exchange factor-induced membraneruffling (26Bellanger J.M. Astier C. Sardet C. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Debant A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It binds SEK-1between amino acids 2282 and 2554, an association necessary for activation ofthe kinase in response to tumor necrosis factor-α(27Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J.

Interestingly, tumornecrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 also binds to filamin betweenamino acids 1644 and 2118(28Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The latter suggests thatrecruitment of molecules to the C-terminal region of filamin may facilitatetheir functional communication. FLN-C also binds some transmembrane proteinssuch as sarcoglycan (23Thompson T.G. Chan Y.M. Hack A.A. Brosius M. Rajala M. Lidov H.G. McNally E.M. Watkins S. Kunkel L.M. J.

Todetermine the functional significance of this interaction we used RNAinterference to knockdown each protein independently. Our results show thatthe two phenotypes have common features. Those include reduction in Cdk7 andribosomal S6 proteins and failure to develop hypertrophy. Competing peptidesdisrupting the interaction between RasGAP and filamin had similar effects. Inaddition, RasGAP-induced growth was inhibited in the absence of Cdk7 orfilamin. In an attempt to determine the underlying mechanism for theseeffects, we discovered that the RasGAP-binding protein, G3BP, interacts withcdk7 and influences its stabilization in a filamin-dependent manner.Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between RasGAP and filamin isnecessary for regulating Cdk7 and S6 ribosomal levels and cell growth. Inaddition, although neither protein seemed essential for cell survival, theirknockdown proves that they do enhance resistance to apoptotic insults. cDNA Library Construction and Screening Using the Yeast Two-hybridSystem—Messenger RNA from 1- to 2-day-old neonatal rat hearts wasextracted using Qiagen's Oligotex mRNA isolation kit. The mRNA was reversetranscribed and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGAD10 vector, upstream ofthe activation domain of GAL4. Methods and ingredients used were as providedwith the Yeast Two-hybrid Library Construction Kit from BD Biosciences. Thelibrary consisted of ∼2 × 106 independent clones, withcDNA inserts that ranged in size from 0.5 to 4 kb. nGAP (amino acids 1–666 of RasGAP) was subcloned downstream of, andin-frame with, GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pAS2.1 vector. This constructwas transfected into the yeast strain Y190 (MATa, ura3–52,his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3,112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2,LYS2::GAL1UAS-HISTATA-HIS3,URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-LacZ), using BDBiosciences Plasmid Transfection Kit. This was followed by transfection of thelibrary cDNA and plating of the transformants on tryptophan-, leucine-, andhistidine-deficient plates plus 3-aminotriazol, for selection of positiveinteractions between the “bait” and its targets.Histidine-positive clones were also tested for Lacz expression, usinga colorimetric filter assay, as described in the BD Biosciences handbookYeast Two-hybrid Matchmaker Manual. The library cDNA plasmid wasisolated then reintroduced into the yeast with the bait or control constructsto reconfirm the interaction before sequencing the insert. Generation of Filamin-C-specific Antibody—Anaffinity-purified, rabbit polyclonal, FLN-C-specific antibody was custom madeby ProSci Inc. The peptide sequence (LATEEPVVPVEPMESM) used for immunizationfalls within the RasGAP-binding domain that was isolated by the yeasttwo-hybrid screen and corresponds to amino acids 1733–1748 of humanfilamin (accession number CAB46442) and 1827–1841 of rat FLN-C(accession number XP_342654, expect for the first amino acid). This epitopebears no significant homology to FLN-A or -B, because a hinge region, which islacking in FLN-C, disrupts the corresponding sequence in these isoforms. Theantibody detects a single band of ∼280 kDa in the heart and skeletalmuscles and was displaced by the immunizing peptide. Culturing Cardiac Myocyte and Adenovirus Infection—Cardiacmyocytes were prepared as previously described(32Abdellatif M. Mcllelan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15423-15426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts wereisolated from 1- to 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After dissociation thecells were subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation followed bydifferential pre-plating to enrich for cardiac myocytes and depletenonmyocytes. Cells were then plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle'smedium/Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum, at a density of 0.5–1× 105 cells/cm2. Twenty-four hours after plating,serum was removed, and the cells were infected with recombinant adenovirusesat a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5–20 particles/cell. Thesecells were analyzed for viral effects 20–24 h after infection, unlessotherwise indicated. For cells infected with shRNA-expressing virus, the cellswere harvested after 96 h to allow enough time for depletion of endogenousproteins. Construction of Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses wereconstructed, propagated, and titered as previously described by Dr. FrankGraham (33Graham F.L. Prevec L. Biotechnology. 1992; 20: 363-390PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly,pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre (Microbix), including the ΔE1 adenoviral genome,was co-transfected with the pDC shuttle vector containing the gene ofinterest, into 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Through homologousrecombination, the test genes were integrated into the E1-deleted adenoviralgenome. The viruses were propagated on 293 cells and purified usingCsCl2 banding followed by dialysis against 20 mmTris-buffered saline with 2% glycerol. Titering was performed on 293 cellsoverlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% equine serum and 0.5%agarose. Construction of shRNA Adenoviral ExpressionVectors—pSilencer 1.0-U6 expression vector was purchased fromAmbion. The U6 RNA polymerase III-dependent promoter and the polycloningregion were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pDC311 (Microbix).The hairpin forming oligonucleotides corresponding to bases 2315–2336(5′-AAGATGAAGCCACTACCCTATTTCAAGAGAATAGGGTAGTGGCTTCATCTTTTTTTT)of the rat RasGAP cDNA (accession number NM_013135), bases 489–509(5′-CAAGCCTGCCACCTTCACAATTTCAAGAGAATTGTGAAGGTGGCAGGCTTGTTTTTT)of rat filamin C cDNA fragment identified in the yeast two-hybrid system,bases 372–392(5′-AAAGGATAACAGCCTTGTGCTTTCAAGAGAAGCACAAGGCTGTTATCCTTTTTT)of mouse cdk7 cDNA (accession number BC068160), and bases 281–300 ofmouse RasGAP SH3-binding protein (accession number NM_013716(5′-CAACTGCCACACCAAGATCCTTCAAGAGAGGATCTTGGTGTGGCAGTTGTTTTTT),and their antisense with ApaI- and HindIII-compatible overhangs, weresynthesized, annealed, and subcloned distal to the U6 promoter. The loopsequence is underlined. A recombinant adenovirus was generated usinghomologous recombination in 293 as described above. Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and WesternBlotting— Cells were fractionated into cytosol, membranes, nuclei,and cytoskeleton using Subcellular ProteoExtract kit from Calbiochem accordingto the manufacturer's directions. For immunoprecipitation studies, a buffer containing 20 mm Tris,pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 wasused to lyse the cells. The samples consisting of either 100 μg of totalcellular protein or 0.1 μg of recombinant protein were then incubated withthe indicated antibody in the presence of protein A/G-agarose, for 2 h at 4°C, rocking. The beads were then washed three times with the above buffer,and the proteins were released using 50 μl of 2× sample buffer at 95°C. Twenty microliters of the final sample was analyzed on a 4–15%gradient SDS-PAGE followed by blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane. Theprimary and secondary antibody incubation buffer consisted of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 138 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% bovine serumalbumin. The antibodies used include: polyclonal and monoclonal anti-RasGAP (UpstateBiotechnologies); anti-FLN-C (custom made by ProSci Inc.); anti-sarcomericactin (Biomeda); anti-pS6 ribosomal, anti-Cdk7, anti-Cdk9, anti-Cdk4,anti-Akt, and anti-phosphoAkt-Ser473 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);anti-ribosomal S6 (Cell Signaling); anti-RNA polymerase II MMS-126R(BabCO). Detection of G3BP-bound mRNA—Cells were lysed in 20mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5%Nonidet P-40, and G3BP was immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonalantibody against amino acids 210–323, excluding the RNA-binding domains(BD Biosciences). RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitated complex usingRNeasy (Qiagen). The RNA was reverse transcribed and used for semiquantitativePCR detection of cdk7, cdk9, and β-actin mRNA. Primers used encompassnucleotides 476–585 of mouse cdk7 cDNA and nucleotides 348–498 ofmouse cdk9 cDNA. Immunocytochemistry and TUNEL Assay—The cells were fixed in3% paraformaldehyde/0.3% Tween in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 5min followed by 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °Cfor 20 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MF-20)or anti-RasGAP at 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin.After an overnight incubation the cells were washed and the secondaryantibody-Alexa-598 plus phalloidin-Alex488 were added to the cells (MolecularProbes). After washing, the slides were either mounted, as described below, orthe TUNEL reaction was performed using a kit from BD Biosciences according tothe recommended protocol. The reaction was terminated by 2×SSC followedby mounting of the slides using Prolong Gold anti-fade with4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using acolorimetric assay kit from Biosourse International, as described by themanufacturer. Transverse Aortic Constriction—Mice were anesthetized(intraperitoneally) with a mixture of ketamine (0.066 mg/g), xylazine (0.013mg/g), and acepromazine (0.002 mg/g). The animals were then ventilated viatracheal intubation connected to a rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus) witha tidal volume of 0.2 ml and a respiratory rate of 110 breaths per minute. Theleft chest was opened at the second intercostal space, and the thymus glandswere superiorly reflected. The transverse thoracic aorta between theinnominate artery and left common carotid artery was dissected and a 7-0 nylonsuture tied around the aorta against a 27-gauge needle. A control groupunderwent thoracotomy and aortic dissection without constricting theaorta. RasGAP Associates with Filamin—To identify proteins thatphysically associate with RasGAP in the heart, we used its N-terminal 666amino acids, nGAP, fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4 DB) as“bait” in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat neonatal heart cDNAlibrary. This fragment included the N-terminal hydrophobic, the SH2-SH3-SH2,and the pleckstrin homology domains. As a result we identified a protein(target) that interacted with nGAP, but not p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,which also contains SH2-SH3 domains, or the GAL4 DB region (not shown). Thetarget was identified as a 230-amino acid peptide that aligned with aminoacids 1678–1908 of a human muscle isoform of filamin (accession numberCAB46442) with 99.5% identity. Muscle filamin consists of an N-terminal actin-binding domain followed by24 repeats, ∼100 amino acids each forming anti-parallel β sheets,followed by the C-terminal dimerization domain. Our data show that RasGAPinteracts with a fragment encompassing most of repeats 15–17 (amino acid1678–1908). To further delineate the binding site we generated sixdeletion mutants, as outlined in Fig.1a, and tested their binding to RasGAP using the YTHassay. We show that neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal half of theFLN-C fragment retained any binding capacity, but an internal deletion of mostof repeat 16 did. This suggests that the interaction is mediated through theC-terminal end of repeat 15 and the N-terminal end of repeat 17, which comeinto close proximity in the model suggested for the rod formation(24Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat.Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), in which the repeats arestacked in an alternating and overlapping fashion as shown in the diagrams inFig. 1a. On the otherhand, deletion mutants of RasGAP indicated that the 3′-hydrophobicdomain, but not the pleckstrin homology domain, is necessary for theinteraction (Fig.1b). For determining the association of the two proteins in mammalian cells, wegenerated a FLN-C-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody. This antibodyrecognizes a >250-kDa protein in the heart and the skeletal muscle, but notin the brain, lung, or large intestine(Fig. 1c), that waslocalized to the cytosol, membrane, and cytoskeletal fractions (Akt andsarcomeric actin are used as markers for cytosol/membrane and cytoskeletalfraction, respectively, Fig.1d), and was displaced by the immunizing peptide (notshown). It also recognized a similar protein band that co-precipitated withRasGAP, but not with a mutant lacking the hydrophobic domain (ΔHD-His),from neonatal heart cells (Fig.1e). Overexpression of a peptide fragment encompassingrepeats 15–17 of FLN-C (ΔFLN) in neonatal cardiac cells,co-immunoprecipitated with RasGAP and displaced endogenous filamin(Fig. 1e). The resultsshow an interaction between endogenous RasGAP and FLN-C that can be disruptedby the competing ΔFLN peptide isolated in the YTH screen. FLN-C and RasGAP Knockdown, or Disruption of Their Interaction, Resultsin Reduced Cdk7 and Ribosomal S6 Levels—To determine the functionalsignificance of the interaction between RasGAP and filamin, we generatedrecombinant adenoviruses expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-formingsequences, specific for either molecule. The viruses were used to infectneonatal cultured myocytes. Five days later, we confirmed >90 ± 6%reduction in the proteins, each with its respective shRNA only, as detected byWestern blotting (Fig. 2). TheFLN-C knockdown showed normal levels and general distribution of RasGAP andAkt proteins (Fig.2a). The cells responded normally to acute serumstimulation by phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2. There was no decrease orredistribution of RhoA, another filamin-binding protein and regulator ofcytoskeletal organization. Similarly, Ras protein was unaffected. FLN-C, butnot RasGAP knockdown, was associated, but with a decline in sarcomeric actinprotein, possibly due to loss of actin bundling as will be seen later(Fig. 2a). On theother hand, RasGAP knockdown, as we recently reported(7Yue Y. Lypowy J. Hedhli N. Abdellatif M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12883-12889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was associated with lossof Akt, but not Erk1/2, phosphorylation in response to serum. We have previously reported that RasGAP overexpression in cardiac cellsinduces up-regulation of Cdk7 and its substrate, RNA polymerase II, andenhanced RNA and protein synthesis, aspects that are critical for thedevelopment of hypertrophy (3Abdellatif M. Packer S.E. Michael L.H. Zhang D. Charng M.J. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell.Biol. 1998; 18: 6729-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).We therefore asked whether the knockdown of RasGAP had the inverse effect andwhether filamin was an accessory. Concurringly, the results show that bothRasGAP (Fig. 2b) andfilamin (Fig. 2a)resulted in similar reductions, 70 ± 10% and 65 ± 10%,respectively, of nuclear Cdk7, but not Cdk9 or Cdk4, after 5 days. Inaddition, we discovered that both knockdowns were accompanied by a reductionin S6 ribosomal protein, 75 ± 15% and 83 ± 10%, respectively.Another important change was a 60–70% reduction in RNA polymerase IIlevels in both phenotypes. The reductions in these proteins appeared tocorrelate well with the level of filamin, as confirmed by another shRNAconstruct with less interference (not shown). These results may suggest, but do not prove, that the changes in proteinlevels associated with both knockdowns are regulated by the interactionbetween both molecules. To investigate this further we generated a recombinantadenovirus harboring the FLN-C deletion mutant consisting of repeats15–17 (ΔFLN), isolated from the YTH screen, or the hydrophobicdomain only of RasGAP (ΔRasGAP), which encompass the RasGAP- andFLN-C-interacting domains, respectively. The assumption is that overexpressionof either of these mutants will compete with the endogenous proteins' bindingsites. Three days after delivery of the constructs to cardiac myocytes, weobserved 85 ± 5% reduction in Cdk7 and ribosomal S6 with ΔFLN(Fig. 3a) and 81± 9 with ΔRasGAP (Fig.3b). These effects are in contrast to overexpression ofwild type RasGAP (Fig.3c), which was reversed upon deletion of its N-terminalhydrophobic filamin-interacting domain(Fig. 3d). Theinhibitory effect seen with the latter mutant may be due to its squelching ofother necessary RasGAP-binding proteins, such as G3BP, as will be seen later.Thus, we conclude that the interaction between RasGAP and FLN-C regulates Cdk7and ribosomal S6 protein levels. FLN-C and RasGAP Knockdown, or Disruption of Their Interaction,Inhibits Hypertrophic Growth—Cdk7 is a major kinase for theC-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, whereas ribosomal S6 regulatestranslation of mRNAs with 5′-oligopyrimidine tracts, mainly constitutingthose of the translational machinery. Thus, it may be predicted that RasGAPand FLN-C, through modulating the concentration of these two molecules,regulate cell growth. Cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes plated on a suitableextracellular matrix protein, such as fibronectin, will exhibit maximalgrowth, similar to that induced by serum or growth factors. The cells in thiscase are also characterized by parallel organization of their sarcomeres, asvisualized by phalloidi"

Pharmacologic chaperones restore correct folding, rescuing mutants and WT receptor from this oligomer. Rat WT retains the ability to oligomerize (since human and mouse mutants exert a DN effect on rat (r) WT sequence) but, unlike human or mouse, escapes the DN effect of GnRH receptor (Gn-RHR) mutants because rGnRHR mutants route to the plasma membrane with higher efficiency than mouse or human mutants. These distinct behaviors of mouse and rat GnRHRs (distinguished by only four semi- or non-conservative amino acid differences) led us to assess the role of each amino acid. The difference in both routing and the DN effect appears mediated primarily by Ser216 in the rGnRHR. The homologous amino acid in the hGn-RHR is also Ser and is compensated for by the primate-unique insertion of Lys191 that, alone, dramatically decreases routing of the receptor. These studies establish the relation between the DN effect and altered receptor trafficking and explain why hGnRHR is more susceptible to defective trafficking by disease-related point mutations than rodent counterparts.

The cellular etiology of this effect is a stable physical interaction between the mutant and wild-type GnRHR, producing an oligomer that is recognized by the cellular quality control apparatus as a defective complex (25Brothers S.P. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This oligomer is retained by the endoplasmic reticulum then presumably degraded (or recycled) (11Castro-Fernandez C. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 479-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Brothers S.P. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); plasma membrane expression of the WT receptor is thereby diminished. Not surprisingly, pharmacoperones also reverse the DN effect (24Leaños-Miranda A. Ulloa-Aguirre A. Ji T.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Brothers S.P. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) of this mutant on the wild-type receptor, since the rescued oligomer of the WT and mutant pass the cellular quality control apparatus. In the present study, unexpected and dramatic differences in both the DN effect and plasma membrane routing of rat and mouse GnRHR mutants were observed; rat, but not mouse, mutants failed to show a DN effect when co-expressed with WT receptor. This was surprising in light of the modest differences (four semi- or non-conservative changes) between the rat and mouse sequences. To determine the residue(s) responsible for the loss of dominant negativity by the rWT GnRHR, mouse, and rat homologs of the DN human mutant Glu90 → Lys (E90K) were prepared along with WT and other HH mutants in which combinations of the four semi- or non-conservative changes were made (mouseXrat: P11Q, I24T, I160T, and G216S, where X is the amino acid sequence position). The mutants were shown to be misrouted proteins but when rescued with pharmacoperones became fully functional “receptors” able to bind ligand and couple to the effector system. Additionally, the role of a primate-specific amino acid, Lys191, that is inserted in the human receptor sequence (328 amino acids) (20Costa E.M.F. Bédécarrats G.Y. Mendonca B.B. Arnhold I.J.P. Kaiser U.B. Latronico A.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2680-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was examined. The presence of Lys191 in the human GnRHR is associated with a decrease in the proportion of plasma membrane localized receptors. Like defective routing of mutants, this effect is superseded by pharmacoperones that rescue the mutant GnRHRs. Rodent GnRHRs (327 amino acids), which are normally transferred to the plasma membrane with higher efficiency than primate GnRHRs, lack this amino acid insertion. This observation suggests that the human sequence is normally trafficked to the plasma membrane with less than 100% efficiency. Removal of Lys191 from the human GnRHR(E90K) sequence rescues this mutant and increases the efficiency of hWT GnRHR routing the plasma membrane. The role of this primate-specific modification was examined with regard to the amino acid that governs the highly efficient transfer of rat WT GnRHR to the plasma membrane and loss of the DN effect of its mutants.

Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources. Rodent and human WT and mutant GnRHR cDNA were prepared as reported (3Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Transient Transfection and Co-transfection—Cells were cultured and plated in growth medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 20 μg/ml gentamicin), and growth conditions were 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere; all medium added to the cells was warmed to 37 °C prior to adding to the cells, unless otherwise noted. For transfection of WT or mutant receptors into COS-7 cells, 5 × 104 cells were plated in 0.25 ml of growth medium in 48-well Costar cell culture plates. Twenty-four h after plating, the cells were washed once with 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM and then transfected with 100 ng of total cDNA (pcDNA3.1+ without insert “empty vector” was included to bring the total cDNA to 100 ng/well, unless otherwise indicated) and 1 μl of Lipofectamine in 0.125 ml of Opti-MEM (room temperature), according to manufacture's instructions. For co-transfection experiments the cells were co-transfected with WT GnRHR (5 ng/well) and empty vector or mutant GnRHR (95 ng/well). Five h after transfection, 0.125 ml of DMEM with 20% fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin was added to the wells. Twenty-three h after transfection, the medium was removed and replaced with 0.25 ml of fresh growth medium. Where indicated, 1 μg/ml IN3 in 0.1% final dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) was added in respective media to the cells and then removed 18 h before agonist treatment, as described elsewhere (3Janovick J.A.

Data are presented as the means ± S.E., calculated from at least three independent experiments, each performed in replicates of six. Inositol Phosphate (IP) Assays—Twenty-seven h after transfection, cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 μg/ml gentamicin and then “preloaded” for 18 h with 0.25 ml of 4 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol in DMEM (prepared without inositol). After preloading, cells were washed twice with 0.3 ml of DMEM containing 5 mm LiCl (without inositol), then treated for 2 h in 0.25 ml of a concentration of Buserelin (10–7 m Buserelin, unless otherwise indicated) in the same medium (LiCl prevents IP degradation). The media were removed, and the cells were frozen and thawed in the presence of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m formic acid (to rupture cells), and total IPs were determined as described previously (30Huckle W. Conn P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by liquid scintillation counting. Data were normalized to correct for differences in counting efficiency and for differences in specific activity of tritiated inositol lots. Statistics—The Student's paired t test (SigmaStat 3.1) was used to determine significance, with p values < 0.05 considered significant. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine interexperimental variance between data sets. Structural Features of the GnRHR—Fig. 1A is a graphic of the rat WT GnRHR sequence, indicating the four positions of semi- or non-conservative mutations between the rat and mouse sequence (shaded boxes: mouseXrat: P11Q, I24T, I160T, and G216S, where “X” is the amino acid position). The amino acid at each of the four positions in the human sequence is also shown for comparison (shaded boxes). Conservative substitutions compared with the mouse sequence are shown in the small unshaded boxes. The human WT GnRHR also contains an “extra” amino acid, Lys191 (small circle, site of insertion shown by a black arrow); this amino acid is absent in all pre-primate species sequenced to date. The site of amino acid E90K, a mutant examined in this study, is shown (small circle, location shown with a black arrow) in the second transmembrane portion of the molecule. The comparative sequences for the fifth transmembrane domain of the three species are shown. Substantial Evolutionary Homology between the Rodent and Human GnRHR—Fig. 1B (top right) also shows a phylogram tree constructed from the reported sequences (2Millar R.P. Lu Z-L. Pawson A.J.

Rev. 2004; 25: 235-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) of mammalian GnRHRs and specifically the relationship between rat, mouse, and human receptors studied in the present work, along with others. The mGnRHR sequence is slightly closer to the human sequence (89% homology) than the rGnRHR (88% homology), indicated by the shorter line length. The two rodent GnRHRs are 96% homologous to each other. GnRHR Mutants Exert a DN Effect on the Wild-type Gn-RHR—Fig. 2A is an agonist dose response of IP production in cells transfected with 95 ng of human WT GnRHR. The absence of Buserelin produces a response only slightly above cells that did not contain GnRHR (note broken x axis in image). Cells lacking transfected GnRHR or mutant (i.e. cells containing empty vector only) do not respond to Buserelin (see legends to Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for vector-only control values). 10–7 m of the GnRH agonist, Buserelin, produces the maximal response and for this reason that amount was used in subsequent studies. Fig. 2B shows the DN effect of the hGnRHR(E90K) mutant on function of the human WT GnRHR. Although the DN effect of human E90K on human WT is significant (p < 0.05) at a ratio of 3:1 (mutant:WT), a 19:1 ratio was used in the present study for a more pronounced effect. In vivo, each cell in a human heterozygote (mutant:WT) would likely express those genes equally, a circumstance that may not occur when equal amounts of vectors are transfected into cells in vitro. Furthermore, since heterozygotic patients expressing highly DN mutants would likely be infertile, such mutations would have been selected against and those that appear in the population would be among the least severe in this regard. Accordingly, higher ratios were used in the present study.Fig. 6Pharmacological rescue of mouse GnRHR(E90K)-derived mutants. Transfected COS-7 cells (95 ng of mutant or WT with 5 ng of vector) were stimulated with 10–7 m Buserelin, and IP production was measured.

Each sequence was expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in COS-7 cells, and IP production was used as an indication of receptor-effector coupling. We have shown previously that IP production accurately reflects plasma membrane expression of these moieties (25Brothers S.P. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1787-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 also shows the effect of deleting the Lys191 residue from the human (WT or mutant E90K) GnRHR sequence. In addition, effects of the insertion of this amino acid into rat and mouse WT and E90K-derived sequences were examined. Removal of Lys191 from the human sequence increases expression of both the WT and mutant E90K forms of the receptor, since this amino acid normally precludes complete expression of the receptor at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, mouse and rat WT are apparently not affected by the Lys191 insertion. In both rodent sequences, expression of E90K mutants was reduced by the Lys191 insertion. The rat GnRHR(E90K) mutant expresses 15.06 + 0.32% compared with the WT, followed by very modest expression of the mouse GnRHR(E90K) mutant (3.59 + 0.20%) compared with the WT. The human E90K mutant is indistinguishable from a “vector only” control (vector only data in figure legend). Interspecific Specificity of the DN Effect—The species specificity of the rat, mouse, and human GnRHRs modified at E90K to exert a DN effect on the WT receptor from each of the three species is shown in Fig. 4. This figure indicates that the rat E90K:rat WT pair does not show dominant negativity, although both mouse E90K and human E90K GnRHR mutants show DN activity when co-expressed with the rat WT. This observation suggests that these human and mouse mutants are still able to interact with the rat WT, suggesting that the difference in the rat (compared with human or mouse) is not due to loss of the ability to oligomerize. Of interest, the human mutant is more effective as a DN regulator of the human WT and the mouse mutant is more effective in actions on both rodent WT receptors. Alteration of Amino Acid 216 in the Mouse GnRHR Mutant Creates a “Rat-like” Interspecific Structure and Increases Plasma Membrane Expression—Next, each of the four semi- or non-conservative amino acid changes (between the rodent species) in the mouse GnRHR(E90K) sequence were modified (singly) to make it more rat-like (Fig. 5A). Individual modification of three of these residues was uneventful; however, the substitution mGnRHR(E90K/G216S) resulted in markedly increased plasma membrane expression of the mouse (double) mutant. This interspecific construct had about 75% of the activity of the rat GnRHR(E90K). Consistent with expectations, modification of the rat GnRHR(E90K) sequence to make it more “mouselike” (S216G) is associated with a 2-fold loss of plasma membrane expression (Fig. 5B). Progressive modification of the remaining three semi- or non-conservative sites in the mouse GnRHR(E90K) sequence (with either G216S or Gly216) resulted in an unexpected loss of plasma membrane expression, suggesting a role for the conservative substitutions in the sequence (Fig. 5B). Because there are nine of these (Fig. 1, small boxes), further examination was not attempted in light of the earlier positive result. The Mutants in the Present Work Are Misrouted Proteins but Otherwise Fully Functional—It is conceivable that the effects observed with the derivative mutants of GnRHR(E90K) might reflect altered levels of mRNA expression, alterations in the ligand binding site or the sites that interact with effectors. To address these concerns, it was demonstrated that these mutants could be rescued with the pharmacoperone (IN3) to near wild-type levels (Fig. 6). Accordingly, these mutants are actually misrouted but rescuable and fully functional once restored to the plasma membrane. The DN Effect Is Also Lost Whenever the G216S Substitution Is Present—Fig. 7 shows the co-transfection of rat, mouse, and human WT GnRH receptors with mouse GnRHR(E90K) mutants in which the four rat-specific amino acids were altered singly or in combination. DN action was assessed in COS-7 cells. When mouse GnRHR(E90K) sequences contain the G216S mutation, the result is a loss in the ability of the mutant"

A particularly important requirement for plant virus infection at an earlystage involves the ability of a virus to move from cell to cell. Transport ofviruses between plant cells requires the function of virus-encoded movementproteins. These proteins participate actively in the intra- and intercellulartransport of viral genomes to such an extent that movement protein dysfunctionhinders viral infection (1McLean B.G. Waigmann E. Citovsky V. Zambryski P. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 105-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Plant viruses have evolved different strategies for cell-to-cell movement. Oneof these strategies involves the passage of complexes of the viral genome andmovement proteins through the plasmodesmata, the membranous channels formed byprolongations of theER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CRM, column-washedrough ER microsomes; EKRM, salt-washed ER membranes; IP, immunoprecipitation;Lep, leader peptidase; RNC, ribosome-nascent chain complex; SRP, signalrecognition particle; TM, transmembrane; TRAM, translocating chain-associatingmembrane protein;ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb,Nϵ-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNAamb.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CRM, column-washedrough ER microsomes; EKRM, salt-washed ER membranes; IP, immunoprecipitation;Lep, leader peptidase; RNC, ribosome-nascent chain complex; SRP, signalrecognition particle; TM, transmembrane; TRAM, translocating chain-associatingmembrane protein;ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb,Nϵ-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNAamb. membranes thatinterconnect cells in higher plants. It is now clear that several of thesevirus-encoded proteins associate with ER membranes(2Vilar M. Sauri A. Monne M. Marcos J.F. von Heijne G. Perez-Paya E. Mingarro I. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar),although the path by which they reach the membrane has not yet been explored.Clearly, the success of viral infection relies on the correct targeting andintegration of the viral movement proteins into the ER membrane. In thisreport, we focus on the biogenesis of one of these movement proteins thatassociates with ER membranes to unravel the mechanism used by these proteinsto reach and integrate into the biological membranes. Two alternative pathways for targeting membrane proteins to the ER membraneare recognized: a cotranslational or signal recognition particle(SRP)-dependent pathway and a post-translational or SRP-independent pathway(5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the majority ofintegral membrane proteins are targeted through the SRP pathway to themembrane of the ER in eukaryotic cells or to the bacterial inner membrane inprokaryotic cells. SRP targets the nascent membrane protein-ribosome-mRNAcomplex to the membrane by interacting with the membrane-bound SRP receptor.The SRP receptor is presumably located adjacent to a protein-conductingchannel, the so-called translocon(5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), that is comprised ineukaryotic cells of the Sec61 α, β, and γ subunits(6Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and the translocatingchain-associated membrane protein (TRAM)(7Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). After targeting, thetranslocon facilitates the integration and lateral exit of nascent membraneprotein TM segments into the ER membrane(5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar,8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol.

S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The translocon has beendescribed in all kingdoms of life, and the bacterial SecYEG complex ishomologous to the Sec61 complex(10Schnell D.J. Hebert D.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 491-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), whereas YidC may be afunctional homologue of TRAM(11Chen M. Xie K. Jiang F. Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of key components that target and insertcellular membrane proteins, the mechanism of insertion of viral membraneproteins into the host membrane is poorly understood. The current knowledge ismainly based in studies focused on small bacteriophage-coat proteins, such asM13 procoat and Pf3. These proteins have long been considered to insert intothe host cell membrane by a spontaneous mechanism(12Geller B.L. Wickner W. J.Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although recently it hasbeen demonstrated that in both cases, YidC mediates the membrane insertion ofthese SRP/translocon-independent bacteriophage proteins (reviewed in Ref.14de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBORep. 2003; 4: 939-943Google Scholar). As for viral proteinintegration in eukaryotic cells, intensive studies have been carried out withanimal viral proteins (reviewed in Ref.15Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 304: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) or insect-derived viralproteins (9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ithas to be mentioned that the above-mentioned viral proteins are all singlespanning membrane proteins and that there is no information regarding plantviral membrane protein integration to date. To investigate the membrane targeting and insertion of plant viral membraneproteins into the ER membrane and the mechanism by which a polytopic viralmembrane protein integrates into the lipid bilayer, we have examined p9, adouble-spanning viral movement protein from carnation mottle carmovirus. Thegenome of this virus is a single-stranded RNA encoding five proteins, two ofthem being the small movement proteins, p9 and p7. The latter has been shownto have RNA binding capacity(16Vilar M. Esteve V. Pallas V. Marcos J.F. Perez-Paya E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the interactionof the RNA-p7 complex with the membrane-anchored p9 protein would facilitatethe cell-to-cell viral transport through the membranous plasmodesmata channels(2Vilar M. Sauri A. Monne M. Marcos J.F. von Heijne G. Perez-Paya E. Mingarro I. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 23447-23452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is thus important togain knowledge concerning the mechanism by which this non-cellular p9 proteinis targeted and inserted into the ER membrane to dissect the infection processof these plant viruses. For this purpose, we used a site-directed photocross-linking approach todemonstrate that p9 is inserted cotranslationally into the ER membrane by thecell machinery in an SRP- and translocon-mediated fashion. In addition,photocross-linking to TRAM was observed for both TM segments of p9, althoughmany membrane protein TM segments do not photocross-link to TRAM(17Heinrich S.U. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Mothes W. Heinrich S. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.

Biol.Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Thus, plant viral membrane protein integration appears to utilize thetranslocon apparatus and associated factors of the host to achieve targetingto and integration into the ER membrane, although the viral and host processesmay differ somewhat with respect to the interaction with associated componentssuch as TRAM. In addition, we observed that both TM sequences of the viralprotein remain in the translocon until the termination of translation,suggesting that partition of the protein into the lipid bilayer occurs in aconcerted manner. Plasmids and tRNA—For in vitro translation, the p9sequence (without a stop codon) was inserted after the SP6 promoter, and the Cterminus of p9 was fused to the P2 domain of the Escherichia colileader peptidase sequence in a pGEM-1 plasmid as in Ref.2Vilar M.

Cotranslational and SRP-dependent Insertion of p9—Integration of p9 into ER-derived microsomes can be monitored byglycosylation. This modification is performed by the oligosaccharyltransferase enzyme, which is adjacent to the translocon. Oligosaccharyltransferase adds sugar residues cotranslationally to a NX(S/T)consensus sequence (25Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), withX being any amino acid except proline(26Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), after the proteinemerges from the translocon pore. Glycosylation of a protein translated invitro in the presence of microsomal membranes therefore indicates theexposure of the nascent chain to the oligosaccharyl transferase active site onthe lumenal side of the ER membrane(27Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using a glycosylation mapping strategy, the topology of integrated p9,which has both its N and C terminus facing the cytoplasmic side of themembrane, was established previously(2Vilar M. Sauri A. Monne M. Marcos J.F. von Heijne G. Perez-Paya E. Mingarro I. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 23447-23452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This topology wasdemonstrated using a mutant variant of p9(Fig. 1A), termed herep9EEE, in which insertion of the second TM segment (TM2) wasprecluded by the introduction of three glutamic acids in the middle of this TMhydrophobic region. Additionally, a glycosylation sequon was engineered at theC-terminal domain of p9EEE. When full-length p9EEE was translated in vitro in thepresence of CRMs containing SRP, much of the protein was glycosylated(Fig. 1B, lane1), as shown by the increase in electrophoretic mobility of the slowerradioactive p9EEE band after an endoglycosidase H treatment(Fig. 1B, lane2). However, when the CRMs were added post-translationally, afterinhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, no p9EEE wasglycosylated in the absence or presence of SRP(Fig. 1B, lanes3 and 4). Furthermore, these unglycosylated forms ofp9EEE did not integrate into the membrane, as they were solubleupon alkaline extraction (data not shown), thereby demonstrating thatp9EEE cannot target and integrate post-translationally. The SRPdependence of p9EEE targeting(Fig. 1B) was furtherdemonstrated by using microsomes that had been stripped of their SRP andresidual ribosomes by washing in EDTA and high salt (EKRMs)(23Walter P. Blobel G. MethodsEnzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Google Scholar). p9EEEproteins were only glycosylated when EKRMs were added at the beginning of thetranslation along with purified SRP (Fig.1B, lane 6). Thus, targeting, translocation,integration, and glycosylation of p9EEE are all SRP-dependentevents that occur cotranslationally. The above results suggest that p9 contains a signal sequence that directsthe ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) synthesizing this protein to thetranslocon via an SRP-dependent pathway. If this were true, one would predictthat the first TM segment of p9 (TM1) would constitute a signal sequence andbind to SRP54, the 54-kDa subunit of SRP(24Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,28Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1986; 320: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A direct method fordetecting this type of interaction consists of positioning a photoreactiveprobe in the signal sequence, where it would be expected to photocross-link toSRP54 upon illumination with UV light(24Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,28Kurzchalia T.V. Wiedmann M. Girshovich A.S. Bochkareva E.S. Bielka H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1986; 320: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled, fullyassembled translation intermediates can be prepared in vitro bytranslating, in the presence of [35S]Met, mRNAs that are truncatedwithin the coding region. A ribosome halts when it reaches the end of such anmRNA, but the nascent chain does not dissociate from the tRNA-ribosome complexbecause the absence of a stop codon prevents normal termination fromoccurring. A photoreactive probe can then be selectively incorporated into thenascent polypeptide by including in the translation reaction a modified ambersuppressor aminoacyl-tRNA (ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb) that recognizesand translates an amber stop codon positioned in the truncated mRNA sequence(8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To use the above strategy, an amber stop codon was substituted roughly inthe middle of TM1, at codon 15 of p9, to yield p9St15. A truncated mRNAencoding 70 residues of p9St15 was transcribed from this DNA and translated inthe presence or absence of SRP and either ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb orunmodified Lys-tRNAamb (Fig.2). In each case, the incubation lacked microsomes and thusgenerated only the RNC·SRP intermediate. The 70-residue nascent chainwas chosen to ensure that TM1 was outside the ribosome exit tunnel andaccessible for binding to SRP. Upon illumination, a ∼61-kDa photoadductwas formed only in the presence of added SRP(Fig. 2, lane 5). Asexpected, no photoadduct was observed in the absence of SRP(Fig. 2, lane 4), UVlight (Fig. 2, lane2), or a photoreactive probe (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 3). The apparent molecular massof the photoadduct corresponds to an adduct between the 70-residue nascentchain and SRP54 (9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,24Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting thatthe TM1 segment of p9 acts as a signal sequence and associates with the SRP54subunit of SRP to form a complex that targets the RNC to the translocon. These results demonstrated that plant viral p9 movement protein biogenesisis cotranslational and that p9 reaches the ER membrane in an SRP-dependentmanner, which clearly differs from bacterial virus coat proteins that insertinto the membrane in an SRP-independent manner. It seems likely that the SRPdependence of p9 plant viral protein targeting to the ER membrane ensures thatthe viral protein is integrated into a specific membrane, the ER membrane,that initiates and facilitates the proper sorting and transport of the viralgenome to adjacent cells through the plasmodesmata membrane system. p9 Is Integrated through the Translocon—After demonstratingthat p9 is targeted to the ER membrane through an SRP-dependent process, wefocused on determining whether this viral membrane protein is adjacent totranslocon proteins after targeting, as has been observed in a number ofprevious photocross-linking studies with eukaryotic or model membrane proteins(reviewed in Refs. 5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar and29Alder N.N. Johnson A.E. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22787-22790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To identify proteinsadjacent to p9 nascent chains during membrane insertion, integrationintermediates containing nascent p9 chains of increasing length(Fig. 3) were prepared usingCRMs and then photolyzed. Photoactivatable probes were incorporated by thetranslation of truncated mRNAs with amber codons at position 15 (p9St15,Fig. 3B) or 49(p9St49, Fig. 3C) inthe presence of ϵANB-Lys-tRNAamb. The probes were thereforelocated roughly in the middle of the p9 TM segments(Fig. 3A). Sincenative p9 is a small protein with only 87 amino acids, it was necessary toelongate its C-terminal domain to examine RNCs with long nascent chains andthereby trap the p9 in the RNC-translocon complex by preventing thetermination of protein synthesis and the release of p9 from the translocon. Toaccomplish this, we used the extramembranous P2 domain of the E. colileader peptidase (Lep) (see “Materials and Methods” for cloningdetails) and generated p9 truncates of different lengths by PCR, using3′ primers that anneal at selected positions. After photolysis, the extent of photocross-linking of each p9 derivative toSec61α was determined by IP using affinity-purified antibodies toSec61α. As shown in Fig.3B, the probe in TM1 (p9St15) reacts covalently withSec61α at all nascent chain lengths tested, with intermediates of 70 and80 amino acids showing the highest extents of photocross-linking. As expected,the p9-Sec61α photoadducts increased in size as the nascent chainlengthened, as shown by the gradual increase in apparent molecular mass of thephotoadduct (Fig. 3B).These data also reveal that some TM1 segments remain adjacent to Sec61αin the translocon long after TM2 reaches the pore, and these TM segmentsapparently partition into the bilayer only after being released from theribosome. In contrast, when the probe is located at position 49 (p9St49) in TM2, anascent chain at least 80 residues long is required to observe photoadductswith translocon proteins (Fig.3C). This delayed cross-linking nicely matches thedelayed incorporation of the probe into p9 and is consistent with therequirement of about 30 residues between the amber stop codon and theribosomal peptidyl transferase site (P-site) before the probe exits theribosomal tunnel and is exposed to translocon proteins. As with the TM1 probe,TM2 remained adjacent to Sec61α until termination(Fig. 3C). Whennascent chains were released from the ribosome by puromycin, neither p9St15nor p9St49 was cross-linked toSec61α(Fig. 3, B andC, lanes 10 and 11). Thus, both TM1 andTM2 diffused away from the translocon and into the membrane only after releaseof the p9 nascent chain from the tRNA in the P-site prior to photolysis. Are TM1 and TM2 Insertion Coupled?—The molecular details ofthe integration of multispanning membrane proteins are largely unknown. p9, adouble-spanning membrane protein, falls into the simplest category of suchproteins and thus provides some clues about this process. Two of the severalpossible mechanisms for the integration of membrane proteins containing two TMsequences are: (i) a “linear insertion model”(30Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), in which membraneintegration of TM1 occurs independently of the appearance at the translocon ofTM2; or (ii) a “concerted model,” in which both TM segments of thenascent protein bind to one or more translocon proteins and are held until thetermination of translation, being then released laterally as a group (ahelical hairpin for double-spanning proteins) into the lipid phase(8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After preparing integration intermediates with nascent chains of differentlengths, we observed that both TM segments from p9 were in proximity toSec61α, even when the nascent chain was long enough for the TM segmentsto exit the translocon individually (Fig.3), thereby indicating that they integrate together into the lipidbilayer as a helical hairpin. Furthermore, the extent of photoadduct formationwith TM2 did not decrease significantly as the length of the nascent chainincreased, although the length of the nascent chain tether to the ribosome wasenough for TM2 (and TM1) diffusion away from the translocon. For example, thedistance between the end of TM2 (residue 59,Fig. 3A) and the tRNAin the ribosomal P-site is about 81 residues for a 140-residue nascent chain.Even if 35 residues are located in the ribosomal tunnel, the nascent chaintether from the ribosomal exit site to the C-terminal end of TM2 would span∼45 residues, or more than 150 Å of a fully extended polypeptide, alength clearly sufficient to allow TM2 to move away from Sec61α. Thus,from these data, it appeared that p9 follows a bundling insertion mechanismbecause both TM segments remain in the translocon until the termination oftranslation and integrate into the lipid bilayer together. The most likelyexplanation for the long retention of the TM segments in the translocon isthat protein-protein interactions between the TM segments and the transloconproteins mediate TM segment release into the bilayer, as has been observedpreviously (8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results differed markedly from the previously reported behavior ofdouble-spanning membrane proteins derived from Lep. In the latter case, RNCswith nascent chains of 95 residues (or longer) and a photoreactive probe inthe middle of the first TM fragment cross-link very weakly with Sec61α,and both TM segments leave the eukaryotic translocation channel long beforethe termination of translation(17Heinrich S.U. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, a linearintegration of the two TM fragments of Lep has also been proposed in a recentstudy using E. coli inner membrane vesicles(31Houben E.N. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To what extent are theapparent differences between the Lep results and those reported here explainedby the difference in the lengths of the loops separating the TM segments inthe two proteins? To address this question, we prepared a chimera in which the42 residues of P1, the extramembranous region that connects the two TMsegments in Lep, replaced the 14 residues that constitute the loop between thetwo TM segments of p9 (Fig.4A). Nascent chains of different lengths were thensynthesized in the presence of CRMs. An aliquot of each sample was irradiatedwith UV light, whereas the remainder indicated the extent of nascent chainproduction (Fig. 4C).Irradiated samples were subjected to IP using affinity-purified antibodies toSec61α(Fig.4B). With RNCs containing nascent chains that were 78 and 88 amino acids inlength, strong cross-links to Sec61α were detected(Fig. 4B, lanes1 and 2). At these chain lengths, the RNC complex was targetedto the membrane, where the first TM segment contacts Sec61α. For allchain lengths longer than 98 residues, little or no photocross-linking toSec61α was observed, indicating that TM1 of p9 has partitioned into thelipid bilayer, a result that clearly differs from what was observed with wildtype p9 (compare Fig.4B with Fig.3B). Thus, although the larger loop in the modified p9protein allowed lateral diffusion of its first TM segment away from thetranslocon, the shorter loop in natural p9 RNCs prevents the independentdiffusion of the two TM segments into the bilayer. It therefore seems likelythat integration of p9 into the ER membrane in a functional state, and perhapsproper sorting of p9 in vivo, requires the concerted insertion of TM1and TM2 into the bilayer. Since TM2 is slightly less hydrophobic than TM1(-3.67 kcal/mol versus -4.41 kcal/mol, as calculated from theWhite-Wimley values (ΔGwoct -ΔGwif)(32White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar)), then possibly TM1 mustleave the translocon with TM2 to ensure that TM2 is inserted efficiently intothe ER membrane. Interestingly, a similar bundling insertion model has beenobserved for mannitol permease, a polytopic membrane protein with a shortinterconnecting loop between the first two TM segments(33Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Muller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TRAM Protein Is Adjacent to p9 during Integration—Anotherprotein component of the translocon, TRAM, has been photocross-linked toseveral different nascent secretory and membrane proteins(5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, the extent ofTRAM cross-linking varies tremendously for different membrane proteins(8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc.

Cell. 2000; 102: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To assess the proximityof p9 TM1 and TM2 to TRAM and its possible involvement in p9 integration, weexamined the extent of p9 photocross-linking to TRAM by immunoprecipitationwith affinity-purified antibodies specific for TRAM. As shown inFig. 5, probes in TM1 and TM2both reacted covalently with TRAM after photolysis. Cross-linking was observedfor nascent chains as short as 70 residues, indicating that TRAM is proximalto TM1 even at an early stage of p9 integration. Consistently, simultaneouscross-linking of both TM fragments (100-residue-long RNCs;Fig. 5, lanes 2 and3) with TRAM suggests that TM1 and TM2 partition into the lipidbilayer as a helical hairpin. It is also worth noting that the extent ofTM1-TRAM photocross-linking increases as the nascent chain length increasesfrom 70 to 100 residues (Fig.5, compare lanes 1 and 2), whereas the extent ofTM1-Sec61α photocross-linking decreases as the nascent chain lengthensfrom 70 to 100 residues (Fig.3B, compare lanes 2 and 5). Thus,although TM1 and TM2 are adjacent to both Sec61α and TRAM throughout p9integration, the positioning of TM1 and TM2 within the translocon may vary atdifferent stages of integration. Although several TM segments are apparently never adjacent to TRAM(8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the vesicular stomatitisvirus G TM α-helix (8McCormick P.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Lin J. Johnson A.E. Mol.

Since p9 is also a viral membrane protein, it is conceivablethat TRAM has a specific role in the mechanism of membrane integration ofthese “foreign” proteins, perhaps by usurping a natural hostselectivity function of TRAM during integration(9Saksena S. Shao Y. Braunagel S.C. Summers M.D. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 12537-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conclusion—Plant virus movement proteins may generallyinteract with cellular macromolecules through hydrophobic interactions(35Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Arch. Virol. 1993; 133: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several of theseproteins are known to be associated with membranes(2Vilar M. Sauri A. Monne M. Marcos J.F. von Heijne G.

Virol. 2004; 78: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The results presented in this study indicated that the carmovirus movementprotein, p9, is targeted to the ER membrane in a cotranslational/SRP-dependentfashion, in which membrane insertion proceeds through the translocon, as formost host membrane proteins. The simultaneous Sec61α and TRAMcross-linking to both TM segments suggested that the translocon assists in theassembly of this viral membrane protein before en bloc release intothe lipid bilayer. Thus, partitioning of wild type p9 into the bilayer onlyoccurs after the nascent membrane protein is released from the ribosome. Theconcerted insertion of TM1 and TM2 into the bilayer is ensured by the shortloop connecting the two TM segments of p9. Whether the viral TM sequencesinteract with Sec61α and TRAM in the same manner as host TM sequenceshas yet to be determined. Dissection of these processes will shed light in ourunderstanding of the role of the cellular endomembrane system in sorting anddelivering viral movement proteins to the plasmodesmata as a part of themechanism of viral infection.

Knobil E. Neill J.D. MammalianFertilization: The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press Ltd., NewYork1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be a hallmark of spermcapacitation(10Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J.

The protein kinase A-anchoring protein(s), AKAP(s),localized in the principal piece of the sperm flagella, have been explored ina greater detail in this regard(11Jha K.N. Shivaji S. Mol.Reprod.

Recently, tyrosinephosphorylation of AKAP3 has been shown to result in the recruitment ofprotein kinase A to the sperm flagella causing an increase in motility(17Luconi M. Carloni V. Marra F. Ferruzzi P. Forti G. Baldi E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theessentiality of a balance between protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphataseactivities has also been demonstrated as a mandatory requirement for asuccessful acrosome reaction(18Tomes C.N.

The head hosts the nucleus and theacrosome; the mid-piece of the flagellum hosts all the mitochondria and thetail piece, which is further divided into a principal piece and an end piece,and harbors cytoskeletal elements. The two ideal examples of non-canonicallocalization of metabolic enzymes in spermatozoa are the sperm-specificisoforms of hexokinase (localized in the mid piece and principal piece of theflagella and in the sperm head(25Travis A.J.

The non-canonicallocalizations of metabolic enzymes indicate there is an extra mitochondrialenergy production center; the ATP generated after glycolysis has been shown tobe the source of tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation of mousespermatozoa (3Travis A.J.

In ourprevious report we have established the importance of a post pyruvatemetabolic enzyme, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, in hamster spermhyperactivation and acrosome reaction(27Mitra K. Shivaji S. Biol.Reprod. 2004; 70: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also identified theenzyme to be a target of the capacitation-dependent protein tyrosinephosphorylation cascade. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, a flavoprotein disulfide oxidoreductase, isthe E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; PDHc,pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serumalbumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff. component ofα-ketoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes(28Patel M.S.

Dihydrolipoamideacetyltransferase, another component of the same multienzyme complexes, is thephysiological substrate of E3. The enzyme, E3, is active as a dimer, and themain catalytic actions of E3 are dehydrogenase (bidirectional,Reaction 1), diaphorase(Reaction 2), and oxidase(Reaction 3)(30Gazaryan I.G. Krasnikov B.F.

E3 knock-out mice dieearly in development, and the heterozygotes show half of the enzyme activityof that of the normal(36Johnson M.T. Yang H.S. Magnuson T. Patel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14512-14517Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) is a paradigmatic example ofα-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes hosting E3. Bacterial E3(37Wilkinson K.D. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2307-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pig heart E3(38Matthews R.G. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol.

However, aphosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of the α subunit of the E1component of PDHc seems to be a stronger regulator in eukaryotes(39Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl.

This paper reveals non-canonical extra mitochondrial localization ofdihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) in mammalian spermatozoa; in hamsterspermatozoa the enzyme shows dual localization in the acrosome and in theprincipal piece of sperm flagella. The data further demonstrate a strongpositive correlation between the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the enzymeand its bi-directional enzymatic activity in the two locations in the hamsterspermatozoa during capacitation, indicating a dual control of the metabolicenzyme during the cellular event. Spermatozoa Collection and in Vitro Capacitation—Male Goldenhamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) aged 6 months were used asexperimental animals. All animal experiments were performed in accordance withthe guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the Centre forCellular and Molecular Biology. Spermatozoa were collected from the caudalepididymides into TALP (modified Tyrode's medium, a medium known to supportcapacitation of hamster spermatozoa)(41Bavister B.D. GameteRes. 1989; 23: 139-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) by swim-up technique(27Mitra K. Shivaji S. Biol.Reprod. 2004; 70: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and thereafter counted ina Makler chamber using a computer-assisted semen analyzer (HTM-CEROS, HamiltonThorne, Maryland, MD). Aliquots from the swim-up were used for differentstudies. Hamster spermatozoa maintained in TALP medium in 5% CO2 at37 °C attained capacitation within 3–5 h(42Kulanand J. Shivaji S. Andrologia. 2001; 33: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For the time-courseexperiments spermatozoa maintained in TALP medium were harvested at the timepoints mentioned in the study. Detection of Phosphorylation and Protein Levels—5 ×106 spermatozoa were used to study tyrosine phosphorylation bySDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis(27Mitra K. Shivaji S. Biol.Reprod. 2004; 70: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with monoclonalanti-phosphotyrosine (αPY) antibody (Upstate) as follows: (a)blocking with 5% nonfat milk, (b) incubation with 1:10,000 dilutionof primary antibody (αPY) in 1% BSA in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% Tween20), and (c) incubation with 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibodyconjugated with horseradish peroxidase in 1% BSA in TBS-T. These steps wereinterspersed with washes in TBS-T. The blots were then developed using theEnhanced Chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting of thetwo-dimensional-PAGE was also performed as described above while thetwo-dimensional-PAGE was run according to the method of O'Farrell(44O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol.Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acrosome Reaction—A minimum of 100 spermatozoa were scoredfor each time point using a phase contrast microscope (Leitz, Germany) with a40× objective (42Kulanand J. Shivaji S. Andrologia. 2001; 33: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thesamples were stained with eosin Y (0.25% in TALP medium) and scored forspontaneous acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. The spermatozoa undergoing or havingundergone acrosome reaction were counted as positive. The results wereexpressed as a percentage of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. Generation of Antibody—Antibody against E3 was raised inrabbit by injecting 200 μg of pig heart E3 as the antigen (Sigma). Allinjections were given subcutaneously, the first three being in Freund'scomplete adjuvant and the later ones (one or two) in Freund's incompleteadjuvant. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Studies—Spermatozoamaintained in TALP medium were collected while carefully ignoring the pelletof dead cells at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes. Spermatozoa werewashed (1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature) and fixed with 2% formaldehyde(10 min) prepared freshly in TBS. The fixed sperm suspension was then coatedproperly on clean glass coverslips and air dried (37 °C). Cells on thecoverslips were freshly permeabilized by dipping in ice-cold (-20 °C)methanol (20 s) and were blocked (5% BSA in TBS) followed by incubations withprimary and appropriate secondary antibody (made in 1% BSA in TBS). All theincubation steps were interspersed with 3–4 washes in TBS. MitoTrackerCmxRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining of MCF-7 cells grown oncoverslips was performed using 200 nm dye for 45 min in serum-freemedium. Coverslips were washed with serum-free medium after which the cellswere fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde (in the same medium) for 10 min. Afterimmunostaining coverslips were processed for antibody staining as before andmounted on clean glass slides using Antifade (Vector) as the mounting mediumand viewed in an Axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.).Colocalization studies were done using a laser scanning confocal microscope,LSM510 Meta (Carl Zeiss Inc.). The dyes used were fluorescein isothiocyanateand Cy3 (or MitoTracker dye) for the dual staining, which were excited at 488nm and 543 nm laser lines, respectively. Optical sections (0.2 μm each) ofthe sperm samples were obtained during the scanning, and for each sample twoto five innermost sections were projected. Dissolution of Acrosomal Matrix—The acrosomal matrices weredislodged from the spermatozoa following an established protocol(45Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Davenport G.R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with littlemodifications. The spermatozoa were harvested at different stages ofcapacitation and placed on ice. The sperm pellets were then washed twice withcold TBS (500 × g for 5 min), resuspended in HEPES buffer (10mm HEPES and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% TritonX-100 and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and once again kepton ice for 1 h. After vortexing the spermatozoa were then subjected tohomogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. They were further kept on ice for 30min after which spermatozoa were centrifuged (350 × g for 5min) and washed again in TBS. SDS-PAGE extracts were prepared as mentionedbefore. Protein estimation was done with the extracts according to the methodof Karlsson et al.(46Karlsson J.O. Ostwald K. Kabjorn C. Andersson M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Acrosomal matrices were partially dislodged from the sperm head by themethod used for guinea pig spermatozoa(47Foster J.A. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Blobel C. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Kim K.S. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12714-12722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, hamsterspermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymides in a buffer having 20mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 0.15 m NaCl (along with0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and0.5 μg/ml aprotinin) and were washed at 500 × g (5 min) at 4°C. The sperm pellet was then suspended in the same buffer with 0.625%Triton X-100, and the suspension was passed through a 26-gauge needle 20times. Although this procedure did not dislodge all the acrosomal matricescompletely, it loosened them and spermatozoa could be identified at differentstages of acrosomal matrix loss. Immunohistochemistry—Testes, dissected out from the animalsand rinsed in TBS, were fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative (70%water-saturated picric acid, 20% formaldehyde, and 5% acetic acid) after whichthe tissue was washed in 70% alcohol and dehydrated in a graded series ofalcohol. Molds were prepared with paraffin wax, and 5-μm-thick sectionswere collected on slides coated with 0.5% gelatin. Sections weredeparaffinized in xylene (20 min), hydrated through graded alcoholincubations, and finally transferred to distilled water. Deparaffinizedhydrated sections were stained with PAS-hematoxylin, and staging of theseminiferous tubules was done according to Miething(48Miething A. Adv. Anat. Embryol.Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel sections wereprocessed for immunohistochemistry; they were blocked with 5% BSA (in TBS)followed by primary and appropriate secondary antibody (made in 1% BSA in TBS)incubations. Each incubation was interspersed with gentle washes in TBS.Finally, the color was developed by incubating the sections with nitro bluetetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in the presence of 0.1mm levamisole to inhibit any endogenous alkaline phosphataseactivity. Sections were rinsed in distilled water and mounted in 30% glyceroland viewed under the bright field of Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl ZeissInc.). Enzyme Assay—The detergent-soluble sperm lysates wereprepared, with sperm pellets harvested at different time points duringcapacitation, according to the method of Patel et al.(28Patel M.S. Vettakkorumakankav N.N. Liu T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, a pellet of100 million spermatozoa was suspended in 200 μl of hypotonic phosphatebuffer with Triton X-100 (1%), protease inhibitors (0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/mlaprotinin), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) and kept on ice for 1h. The suspension of cells was then subjected to three to four freeze-thawcycles and again kept on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min.5 μl of the supernatant was used for the enzyme assay (equivalent to 2.5× 106 spermatozoa). The enzyme assay was performed in a200-μl volume according to Gazaryan et al.(30Gazaryan I.G. Krasnikov B.F. Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N. Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol.Chem. 2002; 277: 10064-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with some modifications.The substrates for the assay were dihydrolipoamide (8 mm) andlipoamide (4 mm) for the forward and reverse reactions,respectively. NAD (0.32 mm) and NADH (0.16 mm) were usedas cofactors for forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The activity ofthe enzyme was measured as a change in optical density(A340) in a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu); theunit of activity was expressed as (micromoles of NADH/min)/μg of totalprotein in Table I. However, inthe experiment where E3 activity has been compared at different time points ofcapacitation, the enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of NADH/min andfurther normalized by a factor of 10-3 as inFig. 11. This is because ofthe fact that a lot of acrosomal proteins are lost during capacitation, whichwould overestimate the activity at the time points when the percentage ofacrosome reacted spermatozoa is high.Table IReverse activity of hamster spermatozoal E3 under differentconditions The “reverse activity” is the activity of E3 toreduce lipoamide to dihydrolipoamide accepting electrons from NADH. Activityof E3 is expressed in units representing change in micromoles ofNADH/min/μg of sperm lysate. Similar results were obtained for forwardactivity (data not shown).

For the sake of comparison the values of forward activity of E3were normalized with the percentage viability of spermatozoa at the respectivetime point, because during capacitation a reduction in viability wasobserved. Validation of the Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody Raised against PurifiedPig Heart Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase—The polyclonal antibodyraised against purified pig heart dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) wasvalidated by two-dimensional-PAGE immunoblots and immunofluorescence methods.The two-dimensional-PAGE immunoblot of hamster sperm lysate with thepolyclonal anti-E3 antibody detected a single spot(Fig. 1A, leftpanel), which was previously identified as E3 by N-terminal sequencing(27Mitra K. Shivaji S. Biol.Reprod. 2004; 70: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because E3 is a part ofthe pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), a polyclonal antibody raisedagainst the whole PDHc except E3 (kindly donated by Dr. R. A. Harris) was usedto detect the other components of the complex in immunoblot of sperm extracts,as shown in the right panel ofFig. 1A. E3 along with its host complex, PDHc, are canonically mitochondrialproteins. Therefore, it is expected that both E3 and PDHc would colocalizewith the MitoTracker used as a mitochondrial marker. Thus, dual staining wasperformed in a mammalian cell line, MCF-7, using the polyclonalanti-E3/anti-PDHc antibody and the MitoTracker dye. The upper twopanels of Fig. 1Bshow staining of the polyclonal PDHc antibody (PDHc) and that of thepolyclonal anti-E3 antibody (E3), respectively. The correspondingimages in Fig. 1A showthe MitoTracker staining, which is very similar to the corresponding antibodystaining. The corresponding panels of panel C show the merged imageof the MitoTracker and the PDHc/E3 staining, demonstrating clearcolocalization of the two as expected. Furthermore, preabsorption of thepolyclonal E3 antibody with purified E3 protein (100 μg/100 μl) failedto detect any antigen in the cells (panel B, Preabs), and thepreimmune serum also showed no staining (panel B, Preimm). Thecorresponding panels in panels A and C show the MitoTrackerstaining and the merged images, respectively. Our polyclonal anti-E3 antibodyalso could detect the E3 in immunoblots of extracts of MCF-7 cell lines (datanot shown). Thus the results taken together validate the specificity of thepolyclonal anti-E3 antibody, which is thus used for further experiments todetect dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) both in immunoblots andimmunofluorescence methods. Extra Mitochondrial Localization of Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase inMammalian Epididymal Spermatozoa—The localization ofdihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) has been investigated in spermatozoa fromthe hamster caput and cauda (non-capacitated) epididymides by indirectimmunofluorescence using polyclonal E3 antibody.Fig. 2 (A andB) shows acrosomal stain"
https://openalex.org/W1983122048,"Estrogen is a mitogen in most estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive breast cancers. We have found that Smad4, a common signal transducer in the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, acts as an ERα transcriptional corepressor. Here, we show that Smad4 induces apoptosis in ERα-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not in ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Smad4 induced expression of short Bim isoforms (by alternative splicing) and Bax and release of cytochrome c in ERα-positive cells only, and expression of these apoptotic marker genes was reduced when ERα small interfering RNA was introduced. Notably, Smad4 was able to induce apoptosis in MDA-231 cells with acquired ERα expression. Furthermore, Smad4 inhibited ERα-positive tumor growth by inducing apoptosis in tumor xenografts in nude mice. The sizes of tumors expressing Smad4 were only one-tenth the size of those expressing green fluorescent protein, whereas in ERα-negative cells, Smad4 did not reduce the tumor size. Notably, Smad4 also promoted short Bim isoform and Bax expression and release of cytochrome c only in ERα-positive MCF-7 tumor xenografts. Bim was sufficient for induction of apoptosis, and the short form was the most potent inducer. Our results demonstrate that Smad4 induces apoptosis by regulating Bim splicing as an initial intrinsic signal in ERα-positive cells. Smad4-induced apoptosis in ERα-positive breast cancer cells may explain the invasive nature of ERα-negative breast tumors, thereby providing a potential target for breast cancer intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2102827209,"Inhibition of general transcription and translation occurs during mitosis to preserve the high energy requirements needed for the dynamic structural changes that are occurring at this time of the cell cycle. Although the mitotic kinase Cdc2 appears to directly phosphorylate and inhibit key proteins directly involved in transcription and translation, the role of Cdc2 in regulating up-stream growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways is limited. In the present study, we examined mechanisms involved in uncoupling receptor-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) signaling pathway in mitotic cells. Treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) failed to activate the ERK pathway in mitotic cells, although partial activation of ERK could be achieved in mitotic cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The discrepancy between EGF and PMA-mediated ERK activation suggested that multiple events in the ERK pathway were regulated during mitosis. We show that Cdc2 inhibits EGF-mediated ERK activation through direct interaction and phosphorylation of several ERK pathway proteins, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos-1, and Raf-1 kinase. Inhibition of Cdc2 activity with roscovitine in mitotic cells restored ERK activation by EGF and PMA. Similarly, mitotic inhibition of ERK activity in cells expressing active mutants of H-Ras and Raf-1 kinase could also be reversed following Cdc2 inhibition. In contrast, ERK activation in cells expressing active MEK1 was not inhibited during mitosis or affected by roscovitine. These data suggest that Cdc2 inhibits growth factor receptor-mediated ERK activation during mitosis by primarily targeting signaling proteins that are upstream of MEK1. Inhibition of general transcription and translation occurs during mitosis to preserve the high energy requirements needed for the dynamic structural changes that are occurring at this time of the cell cycle. Although the mitotic kinase Cdc2 appears to directly phosphorylate and inhibit key proteins directly involved in transcription and translation, the role of Cdc2 in regulating up-stream growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways is limited. In the present study, we examined mechanisms involved in uncoupling receptor-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) signaling pathway in mitotic cells. Treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) failed to activate the ERK pathway in mitotic cells, although partial activation of ERK could be achieved in mitotic cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The discrepancy between EGF and PMA-mediated ERK activation suggested that multiple events in the ERK pathway were regulated during mitosis. We show that Cdc2 inhibits EGF-mediated ERK activation through direct interaction and phosphorylation of several ERK pathway proteins, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos-1, and Raf-1 kinase. Inhibition of Cdc2 activity with roscovitine in mitotic cells restored ERK activation by EGF and PMA. Similarly, mitotic inhibition of ERK activity in cells expressing active mutants of H-Ras and Raf-1 kinase could also be reversed following Cdc2 inhibition. In contrast, ERK activation in cells expressing active MEK1 was not inhibited during mitosis or affected by roscovitine. These data suggest that Cdc2 inhibits growth factor receptor-mediated ERK activation during mitosis by primarily targeting signaling proteins that are upstream of MEK1. Cdc2 is the major cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell cycle progression through the G2 phase and mitosis (1Norbury C. Nurse P. Ciba Found. Symp. 1990; 150 (177–183): 168-177PubMed Google Scholar). Through direct phosphorylation, Cdc2 regulates important mitotic structural changes including nuclear envelope breakdown (2Luscher B. Brizuela L. Beach D. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), centrosome assembly (4Nigg E.A. Blangy A. Lane H.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and Golgi complex fragmentation (5Lowe M. Rabouille C. Nakamura N. Watson R. Jackman M. Jamsa E. Rahman D. Pappin D.J. Warren G. Cell. 1998; 94: 783-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc2 also functions to inhibit other cellular processes that would utilize energy stores needed for the dynamic structural changes that are occurring at this time of the cell cycle. For example, the role of Cdc2 is well established in inhibiting transcription during mitosis (6Hartl P. Gottesfeld J. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) through direct phosphorylation of proteins such as RNA polymerase II and TFIIIB (7Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hartl P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Leresche A. Wolf V.J. Gottesfeld J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Gebara M.M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, evidence suggests that Cdc2 may indirectly cause inhibition of transcription during mitosis by targeting other unknown kinases (6Hartl P. Gottesfeld J. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other metabolic processes such as the high energy requirements of ribosome biogenesis and protein translation are also inhibited during mitosis through Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation (10Heix J. Vente A. Voit R. Budde A. Michaelidis T.M. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7373-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Sirri V. Hernandez-Verdun D. Roussel P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 969-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, Cdc2 was shown to inhibit the p90 S6 ribosomal kinase-1 through direct phosphorylation providing an additional level of regulation of mitotic inhibition of translation (12Shah O.J. Ghosh S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, mitotic cells coordinate the inhibition of biological processes that might interfere with the energetically demanding structural changes that are necessary to ensure the equal segregation of genetic material into each daughter cell. Mitotic cells are also less responsive to extracellular growth factor stimulation as compared with interphase cells. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein or extracellular signal-regulated kinases; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. receptor activity is reduced during mitosis following stimulation, reportedly because of reduced EGF binding and inhibition of EGF receptor dimerization (13Kiyokawa N. Lee E.K. Karunagaran D. Lin S.Y. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18656-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Klein S. Kaszkin M. Barth H. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Newberry E.P. Pike L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), possibly through a mechanism involving direct phosphorylation by Cdc2 (16Kiyokawa N. Karunagaran D. Lee E.K. Xie Y. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EGF receptor activity would also be beneficial for preventing the activation of signal transduction pathways that promote gene expression to preserve energy needs that are required for mitotic structural changes. The ability for EGF to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal transduction pathway has been shown to be inhibited in mitotic cells as compared with interphase cells (17Gomez-Cambronero J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). EGF receptor-mediated activation of the ERK proteins occurs sequentially through Ras G-proteins, Raf kinases, and direct phosphorylation by the mitogen activated protein (MAP) or ERK kinases (MEKs) (18Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shapiro P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 285-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The coupling between the EGF receptor and the Ras G-protein occurs primarily through the Src homology 2 domain containing adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 interacting with phosphorylated tyrosines on the EGF receptor and GTP loading on Ras by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1 (20Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). It is not known whether Cdc2 inhibits EGF receptor signaling during mitosis by targeting these proteins that link the activated EGR receptor with ERK activation. ERK pathway proteins may undergo unique regulation during mitosis. Recently phosphorylated MEK-1 has been reported to undergo partial proteolysis at the N terminus during mitosis, which results in the inability for MEK1 to interact with and activate ERK1/2 proteins (21Harding A. Giles N. Burgess A. Hancock J.F. Gabrielli B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16747-16754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that MEK1 is completely uncoupled from ERK1/2 during mitosis because activation of protein kinase C by treatment with phorbol esters can still activate the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway in mitotic cells (14Klein S. Kaszkin M. Barth H. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have reported that the observed proteolysis of MEK1 during mitosis may not be because of N-terminal cleavage but is the result of cross-reactivity of phosphorylation-specific MEK1/2 antibodies used in these studies with nucleophosmin, an abundant nucleolar protein of ∼33 kDa that is phosphorylated by Cdc2 during mitosis (22Cha H. Hancock C. Dangi S. Maiguel D. Carrier F. Shapiro P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The functions of the ERK pathway and mechanisms of regulation during G2 or M phase progression are not well defined and somewhat controversial. Earlier studies that suggested a potential involvement of ERK in mitotic events reported that Raf-1 was activated in cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole (23Laird A.D. Taylor S.J. Oberst M. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26742-26745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, Raf-1 activation in nocodazole-induced mitotic cells appeared to occur through a mechanism that is independent of receptor-mediated Ras and did not result in corresponding downstream MEK1 protein activation (24Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Laird A.D. Morrison D.K. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4430-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, although tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 by Src kinase appears to be partially responsible for mitotic Raf-1 activity (24Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a comprehensive analysis of the phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms that regulate mitotic Raf-1 activity has not been done. Thus, the function and targets of active Raf-1 during mitosis remain unknown. Nonetheless, a requirement for MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity during G2 phase and mitosis has been suggested in cell cultures using pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1/2 (26Hayne C. Tzivion G. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31876-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Roberts E.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), MEK2 knock-out cell lines (29Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), or Raf-1/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 down-regulation using RNA interference (30Liu X. Yan S. Zhou T. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 proteins have been shown to localize to the centrosomes and kinetochores, respectively, of mitotic cells and may regulate the function of proteins involved in metaphase to anaphase transitions (31Shapiro P.S. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whalen A.M. McIntosh J.R. Ahn N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Raf-1 and MEK1 have also been implicated in regulating Golgi complex fragmentation, which occurs as cells enter mitosis (33Acharya U. Mallabiabarrena A. Acharya J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1998; 92: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J.

Wang Q. Ruan Q. Liu T. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Guan K. Dai W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3822-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although ERK1/2 proteins are the only known substrates for MEK1 and MEK2, a role for the ERKs in regulating MEK1-induced mitotic Golgi fragmentation was not demonstrated in these studies. The aforementioned studies support a model where non-extracellular signal-mediated ERK pathway activation or phosphorylation occurs in localized intracellular regions and is important for mitotic transitions. The present study focused on identifying mechanisms involved in the inhibition of receptor-mediated ERK signaling in mitotic cells. Our findings indicate that Cdc2 plays a key role in negative regulation of receptor-mediated ERK signal transduction by forming complexes with several proteins that couple the EGF receptor with ERK activation. Thus, in addition to directly inhibiting proteins involved in transcription and translation, Cdc2 serves an important role in inhibiting extracellular growth factor-regulated signaling pathways during mitosis. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa or MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in a complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml, and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml) from Intergen Life Sciences (Carlsbad, CA). EGF, LY294002, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma and used at final concentrations of 100 ng/ml, 25 μm, and 0.1 μm, respectively. The MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. AG1517, roscovitine, and staurosporine were purchased from Calbiochem and used at final concentrations of 500 nm, 60 μm, and 2 μm, respectively. Antibodies specific for cyclin B1 (sc-245), ERK2 (sc-154), Sos-1 (sc-256), Grb2 (sc-255), Raf-1 (sc-133), and Cdc2 (sc-54) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (M-8159), α-tubulin (T-6557), and β-actin (A-1978) were purchased from Sigma. The antibodies specific for phosphorylated MEK1/2 (number 9121) and pY(1068)EGFR (number 2236S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Synchronization—HeLa cells were synchronized as has been previously described (40Shah B.H. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Tebar F. Llado A. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (50% confluent) were treated with 2 mm thymidine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + fetal bovine serum for about 16 h. Cells were released back into the cell cycle by washing with Hanks' buffered saline solution and incubated for 8 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + fetal bovine serum in the absence of thymidine. Cells were then treated a second time with 2 mm thymidine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + fetal bovine serum for 16 h, which results in greater than 80% of the cells synchronized in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Synchronized cells were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and then released back into the cell cycle and harvested at various times under various treatments. Cells were arrested in prometaphase of mitosis by treating with nocodazole (100 ng/ml), vinblastine (10 μg/ml), or paclitaxel (1 μm), all purchased from Sigma, for 12–14 h. In some cases, cells transfected with constitutively active mutants of MEK1 (kindly provided by Dr. Natalie Ahn, University of Colorado), BXB-Raf-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Ulf Rapp, University of Wurzburg), of V12 H-Ras (kindly provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb, University of Texas-Southwestern)) were arrested with nocodazole and treated in the presence or absence of roscovitine during the last hour of nocodazole treatment. Mitotic Shakeoff Analysis—Cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase boundary using excess thymidine and then released back into the cell cycle for 9 h, where the peak number of mitotic cells can be obtained (27Roberts E.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7226-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mitotic cells were dislodged by gently tapping the plates and placed in sterile tubes containing complete medium. The remaining attached cells (G2 phase) and the mitotic cells were immediately treated with EGF or PMA for 5 or 30 min followed by harvesting and immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was done as has been previously described. Briefly, protein lysates were collected from synchronized cells that were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 300 μl of cold tissue lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine), allowed to incubate on ice for about 10 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 revolutions per minute to clarify the lysates of insoluble material. The lysates were then diluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer before resolving them by SDS-PAGE, prior to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitations—Protein interaction studies were examined in co-immunoprecipitation assays using lysates harvested from asynchronous and mitotic cells stimulated with or without EGF or PMA. Lysates (200–300 μg) were incubated with 2 μl of the indicated primary antibody (0.1–0.2 mg/ml) for 2 h on ice, followed by incubation with 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-Sepharose A/G 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h under constant mixing. The immune complexes were washed twice (0.5 ml each) with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol or with tissue lysis buffer before reconstitution in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitating proteins. Densitometry Analysis—The relative amount of immunoprecipitated protein was measured by densitometry analysis of the immunoblots using NIH imager software. The relative density of the protein bands was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band and subtracting the background of an adjacent non-reactive area in the same lane of the protein of interest. To account for any variations in the amount of protein that was immunoprecipitated, the ratio of the co-immunoprecipitated protein to immunoprecipitated protein was calculated. ERK Activity in Mitotic Cells Treated with EGF or PMA— Previously, it has been shown that activation of the EGF receptor is inhibited during mitosis (13Kiyokawa N. Lee E.K. Karunagaran D. Lin S.Y. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18656-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Klein S. Kaszkin M. Barth H. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Newberry E.P. Pike L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Gomez-Cambronero J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, EGF receptor-mediated activation of the ERK pathway is inhibited in mitotic cells (17Gomez-Cambronero J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, phorbol ester induction of protein kinase C-mediated signaling pathways has been suggested to be intact in mitotic cells and result in a G2-arrest (14Klein S. Kaszkin M. Barth H. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38Kosaka C. Sasaguri T. Ishida A. Ogata J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C170-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kaszkin M. Furstenberger G. Richards J. Seidler L. Kinzel V. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4328-4335PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the mechanisms involved in inactivation of receptor-mediated signaling in mitotic cells, the activation of ERK was compared in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment or asynchronous cells following treatment with EGF or PMA. In contrast to previous studies, which claimed that PMA-induced signaling was largely independent of the cell cycle (14Klein S. Kaszkin M. Barth H. Kinzel V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); in our hands PMA-treated cells showed a delayed ERK activation in mitotic cells compared with asynchronous cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, ERK activation in response to EGF was almost completely inhibited in mitotic cells (Fig. 1B). Increased cyclin B1 expression (Fig. 1A) as well as analysis of mitotic chromosomes and fluorescence-activated cell sorting confirmed that nocodazole-treated cells were arrested in mitosis (data not shown). The effect of EGF activation of ERK was also tested in the context of other pharmacological agents that induce mitotic arrest. As shown, EGF stimulation of ERK was inhibited in cells arrested in mitosis using vinblastine (Fig. 2A) or paclitaxel (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar to nocodazole-arrested cells, the PMA-mediated activation of ERK was delayed in cells arrested in mitosis with vinblastine or paclitaxel (Fig. 2, A and C). We have also demonstrated that mitotic cells isolated by gently dislodging (shake off) from synchronized cells showed a similar decreased ERK activation in response to EGF or PMA as compared with the remaining adherent cells (data not shown). These data indicate that mitotic inhibition of ERK signaling is not related to the pharmacological agents used to induce mitosis. The differences in ERK activation observed following PMA or EGF treatment in mitotic cells prompted us to examine mechanisms responsible for PMA-mediated ERK activity and down-regulation of growth factor receptor-mediated ERK signaling at this time of the cell cycle. PMA-induced ERK Activation Does Not Require EGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activity—PMA-induced protein kinase C activation has been linked to transactivation of the EGF receptor (40Shah B.H. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Tebar F. Llado A. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Chen N. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Wu E. Liu G. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46722-46728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PMA-induced ERK activation observed during mitosis involves the EGF receptor, asynchronous or nocodazole-arrested cells were pretreated with AG1517, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity (43Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with either PMA or EGF and analyzed for ERK activation by immunoblotting. AG1517 had no effect on PMA-induced ERK activation in mitotic or asynchronous cells (Fig. 3A). As a control, pre-treatment with AG1517 effectively blocked EGF activation of ERK in asynchronous cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, PMA-induced activation of ERK during mitosis in HeLa cells does not appear to involve transactivation of the EGF receptor. Changes in Sos-1, Raf-1, and EGF Receptor Phosphorylation during Mitosis—We next examined the phosphorylation status of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos-1 and the Raf-1 kinase during mitosis to determine whether this post-translational modification could account for the inhibition of EGF or PMA-mediated ERK activation. Phosphorylation decreases the mobility of Sos-1 and Raf-1 in a polyacrylamide gel and this can be easily examined by immunoblot analysis. First, Sos-1, which is important for activating Ras, and the Ras effector kinase Raf-1 were examined. Sos-1 has been shown to be phosphorylated by MAP kinases following EGF receptor activation and this phosphorylation is thought to act as a negative feedback mechanism by inhibiting interactions with the adaptor proteins such as Grb2 resulting in the uncoupling of receptor-mediated signaling (44Corbalan-Garcia S. Degenhardt K.R. Bar-Sagi D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1063-1068PubMed Google Scholar, 45Dong C. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrate that Raf-1 is hyper-phosphorylated during mitosis (25Laird A.D. Morrison D.K. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4430-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although the functions of these phosphorylations are not known. Treatment of cells with EGF or PMA in asynchronous cells induced a slower migrating gel-retarded form of Sos-1 and Raf-1 indicative of phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Moreover, AG1517 blocked EGF-induced phosphorylation of Sos-1 and Raf-1 but had no effect on PMA-induced Sos-1 or Raf-1 phosphorylation in asynchronous cells (Fig. 4A). These data further demonstrate the specificity of AG1517 in targeting the EGF receptor. In contrast, gel mobility of Sos-1 and Raf-1 was retarded to a greater extent in cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole (Fig. 4A). Treatment of mitotic cells with EGF, PMA, or AG1517 had no effect on Sos-1 or Raf-1 gel mobility (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that Sos-1 and Raf-1 are hyperphosphorylated during mitosis through a mechanism involving mitotic specific kinases. To examine potential classes of kinases that may be responsible for hyperphosphorylated Sos-1 and Raf-1 during mitosis, cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole were treated during the last 1 h prior to harvesting with the Cdc2 inhibitor roscovitine, the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Both roscovitine and staurosporine inhibited the hyperphosphorylated forms of Sos-1 and Raf-1 as suggested by the increase in gel mobility (Fig. 4B). The decrease in Sos-1 phosphorylation was similar when using roscovitine or staurosporine indicating that Cdc2 was the primary kinase that directly or indirectly caused phosphorylation of Sos-1 during mitosis (Fig. 4B). In contrast, greater inhibition of Raf-1 gel mobility occurred in cells treated with staurosporine compared with roscovitine (Fig. 4B). This supports previous studies that suggest Cdc2 and other kinases directly or indirectly mediate Raf-1 phosphorylation during mitosis (25Laird A.D. Morrison D.K. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4430-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells treated with U0126 or LY294002 had little effect on the mitotic Raf-1 gel mobility indicating that MEK1/2 and PI3K-mediated signaling does not affect Raf-1 phosphorylation events during mitosis (Fig. 4B). The previous data suggested that Cdc2 might regulate multiple proteins involved in the activation of the ERK pathway. Previously, it was suggested that ligand-induced autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF receptor is inhibited in mitotic cells (13Kiyokawa N. Lee E.K.

Alternative splice siteutilization is controlled in a developmental stage-, sex-, or tissue-specificmanner and is influenced by the way the cells respond to their surroundingmicroenvironment.

Within this line of evidence, we have shown recently thata mammary mesenchymal cell-conditioned medium acts through aphosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent cascade to regulate alternativesplicing in a mammary epithelial cell line(11Blaustein M.

Fibronectin (FN) is the best characterized extracellular matrix (ECM)glycoprotein and plays a key role in cell adhesive and migratory behaviorrelated to fundamental processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing,maintenance of tissue integrity, and malignancy. Alternative splicing in threedifferent regions of the FN pre-mRNA referred to as extra domain II (EDII,also known as EDB or EIIIB), extra domain I (EDI, also known as EDA or EIIIA),and type III connecting segment (IIICS or V region) gives rise to 12 isoformsin rodents (12Kornblihtt A.R.

FNalternative splicing is modulated in a cell type-, development-, andage-specific manner, and therefore it becomes paradigmatic to study theregulation of this complex process by extracellular cues. EDI and EDII arecassette exons, either excluded from or included into the mature FN mRNA. Thethird site of alternative splicing, IIICS, is subject to total inclusion,partial inclusion, or total exclusion because of the presence of threealternative 3′-splice sites, generating the variants referred to asIIICS-120, IIICS-95, and IIICS-0 according to their lengths in the encodedamino acid residues (see Fig.1A). EDI has a role in cellular migration(13Shimao Y. Nabeshima K. Inoue T. Koono M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and cell cycleprogression (14Manabe R.

This exonwas also shown to be responsible for the conversion of lipocytes intomyofibroblasts in fibrotic liver as well as for the induction of severalmatrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9) required for cell migrationand tissue remodeling (15Huhtala P.

Onthe other hand, IIICS inclusion is higher in all fetal versus adulttissues, and this region is required for the secretion of FN dimers duringbiosynthesis (18Pankov R. Yamada K.M.

Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate celladhesion to ECM components, creating a link between the outside and the insideof the cell. The ECM not only provides a scaffold for the organization ofcells in tissues, but it is also known to exert extraordinary control on cellbehavior (23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). This isparticularly evident in the mammary gland, where stromal and epithelial cellscommunicate with each other through a basement membrane (BM)-like ECM. This BMinfluences mammary epithelial cell differentiation both in vivo andin culture, initiating a plethora of signaling processes including thoseleading to the expression of milk proteins(24Roskelley C.D.

Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Upon binding to different BM components, integrins trigger a variety of signaltransduction pathways (27Guo W. Giancotti F.G. Nat.Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 816-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Inthis regard, integrin-mediated signaling can lead to the activation of the ERKor the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascades, and it has been shown that thisintegrin-initiated JNK activation does not occur through the classical stresspathway (23Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar,28Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J.

We have shown previously that a laminin-rich BM (lr-BM) is able to modulateFN EDI alternative splicing in the hepatoma cell line Hep3B(30Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Considering itsphysiology and the availability of a culture system that mimics the epithelialdifferentiation process observed in vivo, the mammary glandrepresents an interesting model to study the regulation of alternativesplicing by extracellular signals(11Blaustein M.

In this context, we nowextend the effects observed in Hep3B cells upon treatment with a lr-BM to thefunctionally normal mouse mammary epithelial cell line EpH4. Furthermore, thistreatment favors the use of more distal 3′-splice sites within IIICS,increasing the proportion of the LDV-lacking isoforms. As for theintracellular mechanism involved in this signal-dependent splicing regulation,we show that the lr-BM acts through a JNK cascade to change FN EDI and IIICSsplicing patterns. We also present evidence supporting a role for ERKdephosphorylation in this process, suggesting that different signalingpathways regulating alternative splicing might interact with each other.Indeed, the presence of the lr-BM completely inhibits the ability of a mammarymesenchymal cell-conditioned medium to stimulate EDI and IIICS inclusion,consistent with the negative cross-talk reported between the PI 3-kinase-Aktand the JNK signaling pathways(31Aikin R. Maysinger D. Rosenberg L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,32Barthwal M.K. Sathyanarayana P. Kundu C.N. Rana B. Pradeep A. Sharma C. Woodgett J.R.

Cell Culture and Treatments—EpH4 cells were grown inDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2%fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 μg/ml, Sigma), and gentamicin (50 μg/ml,Invitrogen). Hep3B cells were maintained and treated as described previously(30Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To perform the corresponding treatments, ∼1 × 105 EpH4cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 supplemented with2% fetal bovine serum into 35-mm tissue culture wells. After 24 h, cells weretreated with 1.5% (v/v) reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel,Collaborative Biomedical Products) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12without serum. Alternatively, 35-mm tissue culture wells were precoated on icewith 0.2 ml of cold Matrigel, which was allowed to gel in a humidifiedincubator for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were immediately plated on top ofit. Mammary mesenchymal cell-conditioned medium (g6CM) was obtained by plating1 × 106 SCg6 cells into 100-mm tissue culture dishes in 2%fetal bovine serum medium and replacing it by serum-free Dulbecco's modifiedEagle's medium:F-12 after 24 h. The cell supernatant was collected 24 h laterand centrifuged to discard cell debris. For the experiments with kinase inhibitors, 24 h after plating, the cellswere preincubated with the corresponding inhibitor or an equal volume ofMe2SO (vehicle) for 2–4 h and then treated with Matrigel orleft untreated in the presence of the inhibitor for 24 h. Kinase inhibitorsused were from Calbiochem. Transfections and Plasmids—Transfection of EpH4 and Hep3Bcells were performed 24 h after plating using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science)or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 × 105 EpH4 or2 × 105 Hep3B cells were transfected with 3 μl of FuGENE 6or 6 μl of Lipofectamine and 2 μg of total plasmid DNA in 35-mm tissueculture wells.

RT-PCR products wereelectrophoresed in 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide native gels and detected byautoradiography. Radioactivity in the bands was measured in a scintillationcounter by the Cerenkov method. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment, cells were lysed inboiling 2× sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris,pH 6.8, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol) atthe time points indicated. Proteins were electrophoresed (12% acrylamideSDS-PAGE), blotted, probed with specific antibodies, and visualized byenhanced chemiluminescence detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugatedsecondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Luminol (Sigma).Anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-ERK2, anti-JNK,anti-p38, and anti-Akt antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Anti-phospho-Akt was from Cell Signaling Technology. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase (LUC) activity in cell lysateswas measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). 24 hposttransfection the cells were treated with Matrigel for 8 h and then washedwith phosphate-buffered saline before lysis with 100 μl of reporter lysisbuffer (Promega). Cell extracts were centrifuged, and 30 μl of thesupernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer II (Promega).LUC activity was tested with a Junior luminometer (Berlthold, Bad Wildbad,Germany). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Duplexed RNA oligonucleotides(Stealth RNAi) were synthesized by Invitrogen. Hep3B cells were transfectedwith plasmid DNA in combination with 40 pmol of different siRNAs usingLipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to themanufacturer's protocols, and they were treated 5 h post-transfection.

A Laminin-rich Basement Membrane Regulates FN EDI and IIICS Splicing inMammary Epithelial Cells—We have shown previously that a lr-BMinhibited FN EDI inclusion but did not regulate FN EDII exon splicing in Hep3Bcells (30Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results ledus to study ECM-dependent regulation of FN alternative splicing in thefunctionally normal mouse mammary epithelial cell line EpH4. These cellsundergo morphological and functional differentiation when cultured on areconstituted lr-BM, a process characterized by the formation ofthree-dimensional structures that resemble mammary alveoli and the productionof milk proteins in the presence of lactogenic hormones(24Roskelley C.D. Desprez P.Y. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12378-12382Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). EpH4 cells were cultured with or without an overlay of a lr-BM.Alternatively, the lr-BM was used as a substratum, and the cells were platedon top of a thick BM gel. In both cases, cells were harvested after differenttime points, RNA was purified and subjected to RT-PCR with different primerpairs designed to compare the relative proportion of the different FN mRNAisoforms, EDI+ versus EDI–, EDII+ versus EDII–,or IIICS-120 versus IICS-95 + IIICS-0(Fig. 1A). Similar to what we observed in Hep3B cells, the addition of a lr-BMinhibited the inclusion of the EDI exon by 2-fold(Fig. 1B) but had noeffect on EDII splicing in EpH4 cells (Fig.1C). Down-regulation of EDI inclusion was clearlyobserved after 24 h of treatment and persisted for at least 3 days (data notshown). Interestingly, IIICS alternative splicing was also altered by thepresence of the lr-BM; the ratio between the LDV-containing isoform(IIICS-120) versus the LDV-lacking isoforms (IICS-0 and IIICS-95)decreased by 3-fold (Fig.1D). Signal Transduction Pathways Activated by a lr-BM—Theeffects of the ECM are basically mediated by integrins, a large family of cellsurface receptors that anchor cells to different ECM proteins and transducemechanical and biochemical signals through the cell membrane(23Giancotti F.G.

To uncover the signaling pathways involved in transducing the informationfrom the lr-BM to the splicing machinery, we first analyzed whether differentknown protein kinases were activated or inhibited by the treatment with alr-BM. We performed Western blot analysis with antibodies against thephosphorylated isoforms of ERK, JNK, p38, and Akt, a classical PI 3-kinasetarget. We observed a robust activation of JNK(Fig. 2A) and ERK(Fig. 2B) after a5-min treatment with lr-BM, whereas the phosphorylation levels of p38 and Aktremained unchanged (Fig. 2, C andD). These results were confirmed by a LUC-based reporter assay. EpH4 cells weretransiently transfected with a combination of two plasmids. One plasmidcarrying the LUC reporter gene driven by a minimal promoter fused to GAL4binding sites (GAL4-LUC) and the other plasmid coding for a fusion proteincontaining the GAL4 DNA binding domain plus the transactivation domain ofc-Jun, a transcription factor that is phosphorylated and therefore activatedby JNK (GAL4-c-JunTAD). Treatment with a lr-BM induced a 3-fold increase inLUC activity, confirming the activation of the JNK pathway under these cultureconditions (Fig.3C). Alternatively, cells were co-transfected with the GAL4-LUC constructtogether with a plasmid that codes for the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused tothe transactivation domain of ATF-2, a transcription factor that could beactivated either by JNK or p38 depending on the cellular context. Treatment ofco-transfected EpH4 cells with a lr-BM did not induce LUC activity (data notshown), indicating that ATF-2 is not a downstream target of JNK in thiscontext and, furthermore, confirming that p38 is not activated by thistreatment as already observed by Western blot analysis. Altogether, theseresults indicate that a lr-BM induces the activation of JNK and ERK, twoclassical signal transduction kinases already reported to be activated inresponse to integrin signaling(23Giancotti F.G.

Other extracellularstimuli have been shown to regulate alternative splicing through proteinkinase C/Ras (7Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol.Cell.

Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and p38(6van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A.R. Moscat J. Caceres J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the kinases that were phosphorylated inresponse to the lr-BM could account for the signal-dependent changes in FNalternative splicing, we studied the influence of different pharmacologicalkinase inhibitors on the lr-BM regulation of EDI and IIICS alternativesplicing. Blocking JNK activity with SP600125 (SP) inhibited up to 75% of thelr-BM-regulated EDI exon inclusion (Fig.3A) and caused up to 100% inhibition of the lr-BM effecton IIICS inclusion (Fig.3B). The observed effect of SP was dose-dependent,already seen at a concentration of 10 μm and reaching themaximum inhibition at 50 μm (data not shown). As expected, SPtotally inhibited the lr-BM-mediated JNK activation(Fig. 3C), although itneither inhibited lr-BM-induced ERK phosphorylation nor MLK3-induced p38activation (data not shown), demonstrating its functionality as well as itsspecificity in this context. These results demonstrate that JNK activation isnecessary for the signal-dependent splicing regulation exerted by the lr-BM,implicating this pathway in the regulation of alternative splicing. JNK Regulates Alternative Splicing in Transient TransfectionAssays—The results shown in Fig.3 revealed a role for a JNK-dependent cascade in thelr-BM-mediated splicing regulation. To further confirm those results, we madeuse of a formerly reported system consisting in the transfection of anα-globin/FN EDI minigene(30Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A basic scheme of thisminigene is depicted in Fig.4A. The regulation of FN alternative splicing by thelr-BM is also observed in transcripts derived from this minigene(30Srebrow A. Blaustein M. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To confirm the requirement of JNK signaling for the lr-BM-induced splicingregulation, we designed siRNAs targeting JNK. Transfection of the JNK1 siRNAcompletely knocked down the expression of JNK1 and did not affect the levelsof JNK2 (Fig. 4B).Conversely, JNK2 siRNA effectively knocked down JNK2 without affecting thelevels of JNK1 (Fig.4B). We then tested the lr-BM effect in the presence ofthese siRNAs and, in agreement with the results obtained using the JNKpharmacological inhibitor (Fig.3), knocking down JNK expression inhibited the lr-BM-mediatedsplicing regulation (Fig.4C). Furthermore, overexpression of non-phosphorylatablemutants of JNK also inhibited the lr-BM effect on alternative splicing (datanot shown). On the other hand, activation of the JNK signaling pathway eitherby overexpression of stress-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (SEK) and JNK(Fig. 4D) or byextracellular stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (data not shown)was not sufficient to mimic the regulation of alternative splicing exerted bythe lr-BM. Altogether, these results further confirm the requirement of the JNKsignaling cascade in alternative splicing regulation and also indicate thatthe effect exerted by the lr-BM is somehow more complex than the activation ofone single pathway leading to the splicing regulation. Instead, there might bean intricate interaction between more than one signaling cascade (seebelow). PI 3-Kinase and p38 Are Not Involved in the lr-BM-induced SplicingRegulation—Earlier reports indicate that PI 3-kinase connects Rasto Rac, leading to the activation of JNK(43Rodriguez-Viciana P.

https://openalex.org/W2037714600,"We reported that the first two cysteine residues out of three present inpaired domain (PD), a DNA-binding domain, are responsible for redox regulationof Pax-8 DNA binding activity. We show that glutathionylation of thesecysteines has a regulatory role in PD binding. Wild-type PD and its mutantswith substitution of cysteine to serine were synthesized and named CCC, CSS,SCS, SSC, and SSS according to the positions of substituted cysteines. Theywere incubated in a buffer containing various ratios of GSH/GSSG and subjectedto gel shift assay. Binding of CCC, CSS, and SCS was impaired with decreasingGSH/GSSG ratio, whereas that of SSC and SSS was not affected. Because[3H]glutathione was incorporated into CCC, CSS, and SCS, but notinto SSC and SSS, the binding impairment was ascribed to glutathionylation ofthe redox-reactive cysteines. This oxidative inactivation of PD binding wasreversed by a reductant dithiothreitol and by redox factor (Ref)-1 invitro. To explore the glutathionylation in cells, Chinese hamster ovarycells overexpressing CSS and SCS were labeled with [35S]cysteine inthe presence of cycloheximide. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against PDrevealed that treatment of the cells with an oxidant diamide induced the35S incorporation into both mutants, suggesting the PDglutathionylation in cells. Since the two cysteine residues in PD areconserved in all Pax members, this novel posttranslational modification of PDwould provide a new insight into molecular basis for modulation of Paxfunction.

Various cellular functions such as gene expression, signal transduction,and enzyme activity are modulated by intracellular redox potential(1Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In the context of geneexpression, it has been shown that the redox potential alters the DNA bindingactivity of a number of transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB,through oxidoreductive modification of thiols on the redox-reactive cysteineresidues that mostly reside in the DNA-binding domain(2Abate C.

Pax-8 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain a paireddomain (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, paired domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary;DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NRS, normalrabbit serum. as aDNA-binding domain (9Walther C. Guenet J.L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Pax-8stimulates expression of a set of thyroid-enriched proteins, thyroglobulin,thyroperoxidase, and sodium/iodide symporter(10Zannini M. Francis L.H. Plachov D. Di L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,11Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We previously reportedthat DNA binding of Pax-8 is reversibly regulated via a redox controlmechanism: its binding is abolished by treatment with an oxidant diamide andrestored by a reductant dithiothreitol (DTT)(12Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showedin rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells that thyrotropin increases Pax-8 binding probablyby converting the oxidized form of Pax-8 to the reduced one and that thisreduction of Pax-8 is accompanied by the increase in Ref-1 expression(12Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar,13Asai T. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro, Ref-1can restore binding of oxidized Pax-8. It was therefore speculated that Ref-1is involved in the reduction of Pax-8 in thyroid cells. Consistent with ourresults, Tell et al.(14Tell G. Pellizzari L. Cimarosti D. Pucillo C. Damante G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) also reported theinvolvement of Ref-1 in redox regulation of Pax-8. Our recent study defined the redox-reactive cysteine residues in Pax-8(15Cao X. Kambe F. Ohmori S. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Six cysteine residuesare present in Pax-8; three residues are in PD located at the N-terminalregion, and three are located in the C-terminal region(16Plachov D. Chowdhury K. Walther C. Simon D. Guenet J-L. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 110: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated thatoxidation of the first two cysteine residues, Cys-45 and Cys-57, in rat PDloses Pax-8 binding in vitro. We also demonstrated by transfectionassay that the modification of these cysteine residues plays a role invivo because Ref-1 is capable of enhancing transcriptional activity ofwild-type Pax-8 in cells but not that of the mutant in which both Cys-45 andCys-57 are substituted with serines. The mutant displays constitutivetranscriptional activity. These observations indicate that the wild-type Pax-8with no DNA binding ability possesses the oxidized Cys-45 and/or Cys-57.However, the nature of the oxidized cysteine residues remained to beelucidated. It has been established that reduced GSH is the most abundant non-proteinthiol in mammalian cells and that it plays a pivotal role in the maintenanceof cellular reducing environment and defense against oxidative stress(17Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar,18Dickinson D.A. Forman H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 488-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Glutathione is present incells at millimolar concentrations, and thus the GSH/GSSG ratios constitute amajor redox buffer in cytosol. In resting cells, the GSH/GSSG ratio rangesfrom 30:1 to 100:1, whereas its ratio in endoplasmic reticulum is shown to be1:1 to 3:1, which may facilitate the formation of protein disulfide that isoften essential for the structure and function of secreted proteins(19Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). In addition, a number ofrecent studies suggest that GSH/GSSG coupling is involved in modulation ofprotein function through reversible disulfide bond formation between proteincysteines and glutathione (glutathionylation). Several mechanisms of glutathionylation have been proposed(20Reddy S. Jones A.D. Cross C.E. Wong P.S. Van DerVliet A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347 (Pt 3): 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Pineda-Molina E. Klatt P. Vazquez J. Marina A. Garcia deLacoba M. Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14134-14142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Humphries K.M. Juliano C. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43505-43511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Under a lower ratio of GSH/GSSG, glutathionylation may occur with the increasein amount of GSSG, which can exchange disulfide with reactive protein thiol.Because GSH prevails over GSSG in normal cells, oxidation of the limitedamount of GSH can dramatically lower GSH/GSSG ratio. Indeed, it has been shownthat the GSH/GSSG ratio is changed in response to growth factors and cytokines(23Hothersall J.S. Cunha F.Q. Neild G.H. Norohna-Dutra A.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,24Musallam L. Ethier C. Haddad P.S. Bilodeau M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms mayinclude chemical oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or diamide, which serve ascatalysts and promote direct disulfide formation between reactive proteinthiol and GSH. Also, the mechanisms involving the formation of sulfenic acidor S-nitrosothiol as intermediate products followed byglutathionylation have been proposed. As for the control of transcription factors by glutathionylation, it wasreported that the conserved cysteine residue in the basic region, aDNA-binding domain, of c-Jun undergoes glutathionylation and that thisglutathionylated c-Jun loses binding activity(25Klatt P. Molina E.P. De Lacoba M.G. Padilla C.A. Martinez-Galesteo E. Barcena J.A. Lamas S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It was also reportedthat glutathionylation of one cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domain ofp50 NF-κB inhibits its binding(21Pineda-Molina E. Klatt P. Vazquez J. Marina A. Garcia deLacoba M. Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14134-14142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement ofglutathionylation in redox regulation of the DNA binding activity of Pax-8 PDin vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that a decrease inthe GSH/GSSG ratio induces glutathionylation of Cys-45 and Cys-57, resultingin loss of DNA binding. Plasmid Construction, in Vitro Translation, and ProteinPurification—Cloning of rat Pax-8 cDNA and preparation of themutant cDNA (Pax146), which encodes only 146 amino acids from N-terminal andthus harbors only the PD, were described previously(12Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar,15Cao X. Kambe F. Ohmori S. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesiswas also described previously(12Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar,15Cao X. Kambe F. Ohmori S. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequencing of theentire cDNAs verified the mutations. As shown inFig. 1, wild-type and PDmutants were named CCC, CSS, SCS, SSC, and SSS, according to the positions ofsubstituted cysteines. These cDNAs were ligated into pIVEX2.3-MCS vector(Roche Applied Science). This vector contains six His codons at the3′-end of the cloning sites. In vitro transcription andtranslation were performed using the Rapid Translation System (RTS 500instrument, Roche Applied Science). The His-tagged PD proteins were thenpurified by using nickel chelate resin (His MicroSpin purification module,Amersham Biosciences). After removing imidazole by Ultra Free C3-GC filter(molecular weight cut-off, 10,000, Millipore, Bedford, MA), the proteins werestored at -80 °C in the presence of 1 mm DTT. Protein contentswere determined by Bradford method. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Procedures forEMSA were described previously(26Kambe F. Seo H. J.Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Oligo(C) containing arecognition site for Pax-8 in the C region of rat thyroglobulin promoter(10Zannini M. Francis L.H. Plachov D. Di L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was used as a probe.In vitro translation lysates or purified PD proteins were firsttreated with 3 mm DTT and then subjected to an Ultra Free C3-GCfilter to remove excess DTT. Subsequent chemical oxidation was achieved byincubation with 1 mm diamide (Sigma). After the removal of excessdiamide by the filtration, the samples were again incubated with 3mm DTT. These lysates or purified PD proteins (final 30nm) were incubated with 32P-labeled oligo(C) in EMSAreaction buffer without DTT. The reaction mixture without dye was subjected topolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to Fujixbioimage analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). In someexperiments, the reduced PD proteins were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C inEMSA reaction buffers containing various ratios of GSH/GSSG and then subjectedto EMSA. Since two GSH molecules are oxidized into one GSSG, the totalconcentration of glutathione, GSH plus 2 GSSG, was kept at 3 mm.Therefore, GSH/GSSG ratios of 200, 20, 2, and 0.2 correspond to final GSH/GSSGconcentrations (in mm) of 3.0/0.015, 2.7/0.135, 1.5/0.75, and0.3/1.35, respectively. GSH and GSSG were purchased from Sigma. In someexperiments, the samples were subsequently incubated in the buffer containing1 mm DTT, 20 μm reduced human Ref-1, orheat-denatured Ref-1. The reduction of purified Ref-1 protein(27Seki S. Hatsushika M. Watanabe S. Akiyama K. Nagao K. Tsutsui K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was performed in the samemanner as the purified PD proteins, and the excess DTT was removed by thefiltration. The heat-denatured Ref-1 was prepared by incubating the reducedRef-1 at 95 °C for 5 min. Analysis of PD Glutathionylation—A part of tritium-labeledglutathione ([3H]GSH, 1924 GBq/mmol, 37 MBq/ml, PerkinElmer LifeSciences) was diluted at 1:10 with 33 mm solution of unlabeled GSHto make 30 mm stock solution of [3H]GSH. According tothe previous report (28Pajares M.A. Duran C. Corrales F. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),another part of [3H]GSH was oxidized by hydrogen peroxide toprepare a 30 mm stock solution of [3H]GSSG. Then thepurified CCC, CSS, SCS, SSC, and SSS proteins (each 10 pmol/tube) wereincubated for 60 min at 37 °C in EMSA reaction buffer containing thelabeled GSH/GSSG with the ratio of 200 or 0.2. Incorporation of[3H]glutathione was assessed by measuring radioactivities oftrichloroacetic acid precipitates. Statistical analysis was performed byone-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—CSS and SCS cDNAswere cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen),and the plasmids were transiently transfected into CHO cells by using aLipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After an 18-h incubation with theliposome-DNA solution, the reagent was replaced with a fresh culture medium.After an additional 24-h incubation, the medium was changed to Hanks' balancedsalt solution containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). After a 60-minincubation, endogenous glutathione pool was labeled with 3.7 MBq of[35S]cysteine (39.8 TBq/mmol, 370 MBq/ml, PerkinElmer LifeSciences) for 60 min. Cycloheximide was used to prevent incorporation of[35S]cysteine into proteins and therefore to facilitate itsincorporation into glutathione. The cells were then treated with 1mm diamide for 5 min and harvested for immunoprecipitation. As aparallel experiment, the transfected cells were labeled with[35S]methionine. The detailed procedure was reported previously(29Kambe F. Seo H. Mori Y. Murata Y. Janssen O.E. Refetoff S. Matsui N. Mol.Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cells werepreincubated in methionine-free Eagle's minimal essential medium for 2 h andthen incubated in minimal essential medium containing[35S]methionine (Express 35S-protein labeling mix,PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed usinganti-Myc antibody (Roche Diagnostics), normal rabbit serum (NRS), andGammaBind G beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were incubated for5 min at 100 °C in a gel loading buffer with or without 10 mmDTT and then subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Afterfixation, gels were incubated in an enhancer for fluorography (Amplify,Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to the BAS 2000 system. To evaluatethe efficiency of transfection, the whole cell lysates prepared from thetransfected cells or their immunoprecipitates with anti-Myc antibody weresubjected to Western blot analysis using the same antibody. Procedures forWestern blot analysis were described previously(30Cao X. Kambe F. Moeller L.C. Refetoff S. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The proteins werevisualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Immunocytochemical Analysis—CHO cells transfected with CSS-or SCS-expressing plasmid were subjected to immunocytochemical analysis. Theprocedures were described previously(30Cao X. Kambe F. Moeller L.C. Refetoff S. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc antibody andAlexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) wereused to visualize CSS and SCS proteins in cells. To identify the nucleus, thecells were simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). Theimages were obtained using an Axiophot 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss,Oberkochen, Germany). Oxidative Modification of Cys-45 or Cys-57 Impairs DNA Binding ofPD—PD and its mutants that contain only one or no cysteine residuewere synthesized as fusion proteins with His6 by in vitrotranslation system (Fig. 1).The products were reduced with DTT and then subjected to EMSA. As shown inFig. 2, the reduced CCC, CSS,SCS, SSC, and SSS possess similar DNA binding activities (lanes 1, 4, 7,10, and 13). When they were treated with diamide, not only CCCbut also CSS and SCS lost the binding (lanes 2, 5, and 8).In contrast, the oxidation did not affect the binding of SSC and SSS(lanes 11 and 14). These results demonstrate that oxidativemodification of the thiol of a single cysteine residue, Cys-45 or Cys-57,leads to impaired binding of PD. Of note, this modification is reversiblebecause subsequent reduction of the oxidized proteins by DTT entirely restoredthe binding (lanes 3, 6, and 9). GSH/GSSG-dependent Oxidation Inhibits DNA Binding of PD—Toexplore the possible involvement of glutathionylation in the modification ofCys-45 or Cys-57, the translation products were subjected to purification bynickel columns. To remove the imidazole, which was used as eluent, and toreconstitute fusion proteins in EMSA reaction buffer, the eluates werefiltered with EMSA reaction buffer. The purified proteins were then incubatedin the buffer containing various GSH/GSSG ratios and subjected to EMSA. Asshown in Fig. 3, a decrease inthe GSH/GSSG ratio induced marked inhibition of the DNA binding activities ofCCC, CSS, and SCS, and this inhibition was reversed by DTT. Although CCCpossesses two redox-reactive cysteine residues, its sensitivity to GSH/GSSGratios appeared to be similar to those of CSS and SCS. In contrast, a changein the GSH/GSSG ratio did not affect SSC and SSS binding. These resultsclearly demonstrate that GSH/GSSG-dependent oxidation of Cys-45 or Cys-57inhibits DNA binding of PD. Thus, the most likely oxidative modification isglutathionylation. Lower Ratio of GSH/GSSG Promotes Incorporation of Glutathione into CSSand SCS—To validate GSH/GSSG-dependent glutathionylation of Cys-45and Cys-57, [3H]glutathione incorporation into PD mutants wasevaluated. As shown in Fig. 4,when the GSH/GSSG ratio was 200, only low level incorporation was observed inCSS, SCS, SSC, and CCC. In contrast, when the ratio was set at 0.2, thepronounced incorporation was detected in CSS, SCS, and CCC but not SSC.Notably, the incorporation into CCC nearly doubled when compared with thoseinto CSS and SCS, suggesting that the glutathionylation of Cys-45 and Cys-57can occur simultaneously. These results demonstrate the GSH/GSSG-dependentglutathionylation of Cys-45 and Cys-57 in PD. Ref-1 Is Capable of Reducing Glutathionylated CSS andSCS—Previously, we and others demonstrated that Ref-1 can restorebinding activity of oxidized Pax-8(14Tell G. Pellizzari L. Cimarosti D. Pucillo C. Damante G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,15Cao X. Kambe F. Ohmori S. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although the nature ofthe oxidized form of Pax-8 was not defined. We thus investigated whether Ref-1is capable of reducing glutathionylated CSS and SCS. As shown inFig. 5, when CSS and SCS, in abuffer with a 0.2 GSH/GSSG ratio, were incubated with reduced Ref-1, theirbinding activities were entirely restored. In contrast, heat-denatured Ref-1could not restore the binding, indicating that Ref-1 enzymatically reduces theglutathionylated CSS and SCS. Possible Glutathionylation of CSS and SCS in Cells—The abovestudies were conducted in vitro. We next investigated possibleglutathionylation of CSS and SCS in cells by utilizing transfection, metaboliclabeling, and immunoprecipitation methods. First, we evaluated thetransfection efficiency. Whole cell lysates were prepared from CHO cellstransfected with the plasmids expressing Myc-tagged CSS or SCS and weresubjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody. As shown inFig. 6A, a single bandwith ∼17 kDa was detected in both CSS and SCS lysates (lanes 3and 4). In contrast, no band was detected in the lysate prepared fromthe cells transfected with a parent plasmid (pcDNA, lane 2). SinceMyc-tagged CSS or SCS consists of 146 amino acids of PD plus 26 amino acids ofMyc epitope, the molecular mass of 17 kDa is an expected mass for the fusionproteins. We next examined the efficiency of immunoprecipitation using 13times more lysates than those used above. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotanalysis demonstrated that the substantial amounts of CSS and SCS proteinscould be precipitated and detected with anti-Myc antibody (lanes 8and 10) but not with NRS (lanes 7 and 9). Noprotein was detected in the lysates from the pcDNA-transfected cells(lanes 5 and 6). These results led us to the followingmetabolic labeling experiment. CHO cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing CSS or SCS, and theglutathione pool was labeled with [35S]cysteine in the presence ofcycloheximide. The cells were then exposed to oxidative stress by diamide. Asa parallel experiment, the transfected cells were labeled with[35S]methionine. As shown inFig. 6B, when thecells were labeled with [35S]methionine, CSS and SCS proteins witha molecular mass of 17 kDa were precipitated with anti-Myc antibody (lanes1 and 2), whereas no corresponding protein was detected with NRS(data not shown). Also, no corresponding protein was precipitated withanti-Myc antibody in a non-reducing condition, when the pcDNA-transfectedcells were labeled with [35S]cysteine, and then treated withdiamide (lane 3). In contrast, 17-kDa protein was detected withanti-Myc antibody in a non-reducing condition, when the CSS-expressing cellswere labeled with [35S]cysteine, and then treated with diamide(lane 7). However, the corresponding protein disappeared, when theprecipitate was reduced by DTT (lane 8) or in the absence of diamidetreatment (lane 4). Also, no protein was detected by theimmunoprecipitation with NRS (lanes 5 and 6). The similarresults were obtained by the experiment with SCS (lanes 9–13).Together, these results strongly suggest that CSS and SCS form a complex with[35S]glutathione via reversible disulfide bond in cells underoxidative stress with diamide, although 35S incorporation into themutants may imply not only the incorporation of [35S]glutathionebut also that of [35S]cysteine itself (S-thiolation). We next examined subcellular localization of Myc-tagged CSS 42 h aftertransfection when the above metabolic labeling experiments were conducted.Fig. 7, A andC, show the staining of CSS- and pcDNA-transfected CHOcells with anti-Myc antibody, respectively.Fig. 7, B andD, are the nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. It wasclearly shown that Myc-tagged CSS was dominantly present in the nucleus; twonuclei out of four were stained with anti-Myc antibody(Fig. 7, A andB). The two non-stained nuclei would represent theabsence of CSS-expressing plasmid in the cells. When the cells weretransfected with pcDNA, no remarkable staining with anti-Myc antibody wasdetected in nucleus and cytoplasm (C and D). The similarresults were obtained by the experiment with SCS (data not shown). Theseobservations are consistent with the previous report showing that theendogenous Pax-8 is detected in the nucleus of dog thyrocytes(31Van Renterghem P. Vassart G. Christophe D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and with the reportdemonstrating the presence of nuclear translocation signal in PD(32Poleev A. Okladnova O. Musti A.M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Plachov D. Eur. J.Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results indicatethat glutathionylation of Pax PD may occur in the nucleus. Our previous studies defined Cys-45 and Cys-57 in PD as redox-reactivecysteine residues that are responsible for the reversible oxidativeinactivation of Pax-8 binding(15Cao X. Kambe F. Ohmori S. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present studyexpanded this finding. Using CSS and SCS mutants, it was clearly demonstratedthat oxidation of either one of the cysteine residues results in loss ofbinding (Fig. 2). To prove the glutathionylation of the cysteine residues, we investigatedGSH/GSSG-dependent glutathionylation using purified PD mutants. A decrease inthe GSH/GSSG ratio induced the inhibition of CSS and SCS binding, whereas SSCand SSS binding was not affected (Fig.3). In addition, [3H]glutathione was only incorporatedinto CSS and SCS (Fig. 4).These results strongly indicated that GSH/GSSG-dependent glutathionylation ofCys-45 and Cys-57 induces oxidative inactivation of PD. Since thecorresponding cysteines in Pax-6 and Drosophila paired (prd) areshown to contact with the DNA backbone(33Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,34Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), glutathionylation maydirectly interfere with the DNA contact of PD. Accordingly, it was reportedthat the mutation of Cys-57 in human Pax-8, which corresponds to rat Cys-57,to tyrosine abolished DNA binding and led to congenital hypothyroidism(35Vilain C. Rydlewski C. Duprez L. Heinrichs C. Abramowicz M. Malvaux P. Renneboog B. Parma J. Costagliola S. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), also indicating that thelarge side group of tyrosine may interfere with DNA binding. Note that theglutathionylation-dependent inhibition of PD binding was reversed by DTT,indicating the reversible control of PD by glutathione(Fig. 3). Furthermore, it wassuggested that glutathionylation of CSS and SCS occurs in cells in response totreatment with 1 mm diamide for 5 min(Fig. 6). Since it was reportedthat treatment of retina pigmental epithelium cells with 0.5 mmdiamide for 5 min induced a marked decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio to less than1 (36Obin M. Shang F. Gong X. Handelman G. Blumberg J. Taylor A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the glutathionylationof CSS and SCS in cells may occur in a GSH/GSSG-dependent manner as it doesin vitro. Recently, several studies demonstrated that a change in intracellular redoxpotential influences thyroid cell function. Our previous study showed that theoxidative stress induced by redox-active copper attenuates thyroperoxidase andPax-8 expression and stimulates cell proliferation(37Iseki A. Kambe F. Okumura K. Hayakawa T. Seo H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4373-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lonigro et al.(38Lonigro R. Donnini D. Fabbro D. Perrella G. Damante G. Ambesi Impiombato F.S. Curcio F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrated that adecline in intracellular GSH level by an inhibitor forγ-glutamylcysteine synthetase is associated with decreased thyroglobulinexpression and Pax-8 binding in FRTL-5 cells. This observation is ofparticular interest for us because the GSH/GSSG-dependent oxidativeinactivation of Pax-8 could account for the decreased thyroglobulin expressionin the cells with a low level of GSH. To date, a number of proteins such as protein phosphatase 1B, proteinphosphatase 2A, creatine kinase, protein kinase C, protein kinase A,thioredoxin, NF-1, c-Jun, and p50 NF-κB have been proven to beglutathionylated in vitro and/or in vivo. Furthermore,recent studies demonstrated that a large number of proteins undergoglutathionylation in response to oxidative stress(39Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3505-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar,40Lind C. Gerdes R. Hamnell Y. Schuppe-Koistinen I. vonLowenhielm H.B. Holmgren A. Cotgreave I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, the role ofglutathionylation has been considered to protect critical cysteine residuefrom irreversible modification such as sulfinic or sulfonic acid by oxidativestress. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxylradical are generated in cells as a result of normal aerobic metabolism aswell as oxidative stress. Thyroid follicular cells are unique in that theyproduce hydrogen peroxide for thyroid hormone synthesis by a thyroid-specificsystem, and its generation is increased by thyrotropin(41De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J.Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Therefore, one of theplausible roles of glutathionylation of Pax-8 PD may be the protection ofCys-45 and Cys-57 against oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species. On theother hand, we and others demonstrate that thyrotropin stimulates expressionof various anti-oxidative, reducing enzymes such as Ref-1, thioredoxin, andperoxiredoxin (12Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar,13Asai T. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These proteins serve as areactive oxygen species-scavenger and/or as a modulator for redox-sensitiveproteins. Indeed, this study showed that Ref-1 can enzymatically reduce theglutathionylated PD and restore its binding(Fig. 5). Therefore, thepresent findings of oxidative inactivation of Pax-8 by glutathionylation andits reversal by Ref-1 may provide a molecular basis for thyrotropin-dependentactivation of Pax-8 binding. How does Ref-1 reduce the glutathionylated PD? It was demonstrated that thereduction of two cysteine residues (Cys-65 and Cys-93) in human Ref-1 isrequired for reducing c-Jun(4Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Hydrogen derived fromthese cysteines would be provided to c-Jun because the binding of oxidizedc-Jun was restored by the addition of only reduced Ref-1, where no otherproteins nor reducing equivalents were present. A similar observation wasreported by others (44Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).Therefore, it is likely that Ref-1 itself releases hydrogen and enzymaticallyprovides it to glutathionylated PD. In our assay, 20 μm Ref-1was an excess over 30 nm CSS and SCS, suggesting that Ref-1 canreduce most of glutathionylated PD present in the assay, without the reductionof the oxidized Ref-1. In conclusion, the cysteine residues corresponding to Cys-45 and Cys-57 andthe surrounding amino acid sequences are well conserved in all Pax familymembers (9Walther C. Guenet J.L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This may implythat the thiols of the conserved cysteine residues are highly reactive, as arethose of Cys-45 and Cys-57 in Pax-8 PD. Thus, the glutathionylation, a novelposttranslational modification for PD, would provide a new insight into themolecular basis for the modulation of Pax function."
https://openalex.org/W2006878208,"2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid, and it plays a critical role in cannabinoid receptor-mediated cell signaling. Although 2-AG was shown to induce ERK activation via the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), only a nonspecific CB receptor agonist and antagonist was used in those studies. Whether cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is involved in 2-AG-induced ERK activation is still unclear. Moreover, whether 2-AG is involved in mediation of AP-1 activity and cell transformation is also not known. In the present study, we show that 2-AG stimulates AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity and enhances epidermal growth factor-induced cell transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 P+ Cl41 cells. Using JB6 P+ C141 cells, stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter, we found that 10 μm 2-AG induced up to a 3-fold stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity. The AP-1 stimulation appeared to be mediated by ERK but not JNK or p38 kinase. PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, almost completely blocked 2-AG-induced ERK phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. Using CB1/2–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts, we present the first direct evidence that both cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1/2) are involved in 2-AG-induced ERK activation. 2-AG could not stimulate ERK phosphorylation or Fyn kinase activity in dominant negative Fyn. In addition, the Fyn inhibitor PP2 blocked 2-AG-induced Fyn kinase activity and ERK phosphorylation and activity. Small interfering RNA Fyn also suppressed 2-AG-induced ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, 2-AG enhanced epidermal growth factor-induced AP-1 DNA binding and cell transformation. Taken together, our data provide direct evidence suggesting that 2-AG may have a novel role in cell transformation and carcinogenesis in a signaling pathway involving CB1/2 and activation of Fyn, ERKs, and AP-1. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid, and it plays a critical role in cannabinoid receptor-mediated cell signaling.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Also, cannabinoid receptor ligands may have opposite effects depending on concentration (19Berdyshev E.V. Boichot E. Germain N. Allain N. Anger J.P. Lagente V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 330: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and other experimental conditions (11Carrier E.J. Kearn C.S.

The expression of cytokine mRNAs was also shown to be differentially affected by cannabinoids depending on cell line and the cytokine tested (20Srivastava M.D. Srivastava B.I. Brouhard B. Immunopharmacology. 1998; 40: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Hence, cell signaling induced by cannbinoid receptor ligands needs additional and extensive investigation.The most thoroughly investigated cannabinoid receptor ligands are anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Both of these ligands occur in trace amounts in virtually all vertebrate cells and tissues (21Schmid H.H. Schmid P.C. Berdyshev E.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 121: 111-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although both anandamide and 2-AG are ligands for cannabinoid receptors, significant differences exist between these two agonists. Recent work has clearly shown that 2-AG is a full agonist for both cannabinoid 1 (CB1; 22Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S. Nakane S. Kondo H. Waku K. Ishima Y. Watanabe K. Yamamoto I. J. Biochem.

Fan X. Narula S. Lundell D. Hipkin R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1045-1050PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, whereas anandamide is only a partial agonist for CB1 and CB2. Taken together with the fact that physiological levels of 2-AG tend to exceed those of anandamide by several orders of magnitude (21Schmid H.H. Schmid P.C. Berdyshev E.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 121: 111-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), 2-AG is more likely to play a critical role in cannabinoid receptor-mediated cell signaling.2-AG is believed to induce cell signaling through the cannabinoid receptors (10Bouaboula M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1385-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, studies utilized a relatively nonspecific cannabinoid receptor agonist and antagonist to show that 2-AG induces ERK activation via the CB1. Thus no direct evidence exists that distinguishes between the involvement of CB1 and CB2 in 2-AG-induced ERK activation.Recently, Carrier et al. (11Carrier E.J. Kearn C.S. Barkmeier A.J. Breese N.M. Yang W. Nithipatikom K. Pfister S.L. Campbell W.B. Hillard C.J. Mol.

(12Alberich Jorda M. Rayman N. Tas M. Verbakel S.E. Battista N. van Lom K. Lowenberg B. Maccarrone M. Delwel R. Blood. 2004; 104: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed that 2-AG and cannabinoid receptors are related to two distinct oncogenic effects, altered migration and block of neutrophilic development. Furthermore, Porcella et al. (18Porcella A. Gessa G.L. Pani L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported that δ9-THC, a major psychoactive cannabinoid, up-regulated the mRNA levels of immediate-early genes in the rat brain. δ9-THC was shown to increase sequence-specific AP-1 DNA-binding activity by acting on the cannabinoid receptors (18Porcella A. Gessa G.L. Pani L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We reported that N-acetylethanolamines and anandamide stimulate cannabinoid-receptor-independent ERK phosphorylation and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity up to 2-fold in mouse epidermal JB6 cells (27Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Hillard C.J. Huang C. Chen N. Dong Z. Schmid H.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether 2-AG directly regulates AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity and is involved in cell transformation is as yet unknown. We addressed this question by studying signal transduction initiated by 2-AG in mouse epidermal JB6 P+ Cl41 cells, which provide a model system used extensively to study signal transduction and neoplastic transformation (28Huang C.

The signaling pathways resulting in activation of AP-1 are well characterized in these cells, and JB6 cells were shown to synthesize both anandamide (27Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Hillard C.J. Huang C. Chen N. Dong Z. Schmid H.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 2-AG (32Li J.J. Dong Z. Dawson M.I. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 483-489PubMed Google Scholar) and also express CB1/2 (27Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Hillard C.J. Huang C. Chen N. Dong Z. Schmid H.H. Biochem.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether 2-AG acts directly through CB1/2 to regulate AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity and whether 2-AG is involved in cell transformation. Here we report that in JB6 P+ Cl41 cells, 2-AG stimulated AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity through the ERK pathway and 2-AG enhances EGF-induced cell transformation. Furthermore, by using CB1/2–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we present the first direct evidence indicating that 2-AG stimulates ERK phosphorylation through both CB1 and CB2 with the subsequent activation of Fyn.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Reagents—The mouse CB1 plasmid (PcDNA3-CB1 plasmid) was kindly provided by Dr. Beat Lutz (Group Molecular Genetics of Behavior Max-Planck-Institute of Psychiatry, Kraepelinstr., 2–10 D-80804 Munich, Germany).

AM251 was from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The anti-Fyn was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Preparation of CB1/2+/+ and CB1/2–/– MEFs—CB1/2 double knock-out mice were provided by Dr. Andreas Zimmer, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology Clinic of Psychiatry, University Hospital (Bonn, Germany). CB1/2+/+ and CB1/2–/– MEFs were isolated from the embryos of c57/BL wild type mice and CB1/CB2 double knock-out mice, respectively.Verification of Genotype of CB1/2–/– Knock-out Mice and MEFs—DNA were obtained from mouse tails by digesting the tail with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm, pH 7.5, Tris buffer). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (91:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) solutions. DNA was further purified using the DNA STAT-60 reagent. The primers used for PCR verification of CB1 from tail DNA and cellular DNA, were: primer 1 (5′-CTCCTGGCACCTCTTTCTCAGTCACG-3′), primer 2 (5′-TCTCTCGTGGGATCATTGTTTTTCTCTTGA-3′), and primer 3 (5′-TGTGTCTCCTGCTGGAACCAACGG-3′).The PCR amplification was done at 95 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and was carried out for 35 cycles using Taq polymerase. For CB1/2+/+ cells and mice, we obtained a 284-bp band, and for CB1/2–/– cells and mice, we obtained a 334-bp band (data not shown). The primers used for PCR verification of CB2 from tail DNA and cellular DNA were: primer 1 (5′-AAATGCTTGATTGGTGTCAGCCTCTC-3′), primer 2 (5′-TAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTT-3′), and primer 3 (5′-GGCTCCTAGGTGGTTTTCACATCAGCCTCT-3′).The PCR amplification was done at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and was carried out for 30 cycles using Taq polymerase. For CB1/2+/+ cells and mice, we obtained a 1100-bp band, and for CB1/2–/– cells and mice, we obtained a 850-bp band (data not shown). Therefore the genotype for the CB1/2–/– cells and mice is correct.Cell Transfection—For stable transfections, according to the protocol from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), we transfected CB1/2–/– cells with CB1 or CB2 expression constructs using the Lipofectamine method (Invitrogen) as specified by the supplier. All the transfected CB1/2–/– cells were selected for 2 weeks in media containing 400 μg/ml of G418 after which time the G418 concentration was decreased to 200 μg/ml and maintained.Establishing Dominant Negative (DN)-Fyn and Small Interfering (si)-RNA Fyn Expressing JB6 Cl41 Cells—The K299M Fyn pLJ plasmid was provided by Dr. Moses V. Chao from the New York University Medical Center (First Avenue, New York). Using these plasmids, we established stable transfections according to the protocol from Invitrogen. All the transfected JB6 cells were selected for 2 weeks in media containing 400 μg/ml of G418 after which time the G418 concentration was decreased to 200 μg/ml and maintained. siRNA Fyn JB6 cells were established as previously reported (33He Z. Cho Y.-Y. Ma W.-Y. Choi H.-S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 2446-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, we “knocked down” Fyn expression by the siRNA method. The sense oligonucleotide of Fyn used for siRNA was 5′-TTTGCAGCTCGGAAGGAGATTGGTTCAAGAGACAATCTCCTTCCGAGCTGTTTTT-3′ and the antisense was 5′-CTAGAAAAACAGCTCGGAAGGAGATTGGTCTCTTGAACCAATCTCCTTCCGAGCTG-3′. The ligated pair of oligonucleotides was inserted into the mU6pro vector. The oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing of the inserted sequences in the mU6pro vector were performed by Sigma. The plasmid siRNA-Fyn-mU6pro was stably transfected into JB6 Cl41 cells using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent.Cell Culture—JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells (C141) and AP-1 luciferase reporter (Cl41 AP-1 mass 1) stable transfectants were cultured in monolayers at 37 °C in MEM containing 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.AP-1 Activity Assay—Confluent monolayers of JB6 P+ C141 cells (5 × 103), stably transfected with the luciferase reporter driven by AP-1, were suspended in 200 μl of 5% FBS/MEM and added into each well of a 96-well plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Twenty-four to forty-eight h later, cells were starved by culturing in 100 μl of 0.1% FBS/MEM for 24 h before treatment. After treatment in a total volume of 200 μl for 8–24 h, cells were extracted with lysis buffer and luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and the Luminoskan Ascent (ThermoElectron Corp., Helsinki, Finland). The results are expressed as relative AP-1 activity compared with an untreated control value of 1.ERK Activity Assay—The assay for ERK activity was carried out as described in the protocol provided by Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). In brief, JB6 P+ cells (wild type Fyn) and DN-Fyn cells were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS/MEM and then treated for 45 min with 1.0 μm PP2 or its vehicle, Me2SO (<0.1%), which was used as a negative control. This was followed by treatment with 10 μm 2-AG for 30 min. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted in 300 μl of cell lysis buffer. The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged. Endogenous ERKs were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant fraction containing 300 μg of protein by incubating with the specific phospho-specific ERK antibody (Thr202/Tyr204) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A/G plus-agarose beads for another 4 h. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). For determination of ERK-induced phosphorylation of Elk-1, the kinase reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of the kinase buffer containing the immunoprecipitates and 200 μm ATP with 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein as the substrate. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was then analyzed by Western blotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific antibodies against phosphorylation of Elk-1 at serine 383.Fyn Kinase Assay—Analysis of Fyn kinase activity was carried out as described in the protocol provided by Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). In brief, the cells were treated for the indicated times with 10 μm 2-AG and different doses of PP2 or its vehicle, Me2SO (<0.1%), which was used as a negative control. The procedure was essentially the same as that for assay of ERK activity except that the immunoprecipitates were combined with 10 μl of [32P]ATP and 2.5 μl of the Src substrate peptide. Fyn kinase activity was then determined by scintillation counter.Western Blotting—ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies against ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185), and p38 kinases (Thr180/Tyr182), respectively. Antibodies bound to proteins were detected by chemifluorescence (ECF substrate, Amersham Biosciences) using the Storm 840 Imaging System (Amersham Biosciences). Some membranes were stripped (7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm glycine (pH 10.8), 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and re-probed.Anchorage-independent Transformation Assay—The role of 2-AG in EGF-promoted cell transformation was investigated in JB6 C141 cells (33He Z. Cho Y.-Y. Ma W.-Y. Choi H.-S. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 2446-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In brief, 8 × 103/ml cells were exposed to EGF (0–0.1 ng/ml) with or without 2-AG (1–10 μm) in 1 ml of 0.3% basal medium Eagle's agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 days, and the cell colonies were scored as described previously (29Dong Z. Ma W. Huang C. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4414-4419PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of 2-AG and EGF on JB6 Cl41 cell transformation is presented as colony number per 8,000 seeded JB6 C141 cells in soft agar.AP-1 DNA Binding Study—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from cells, as described previously (29Dong Z. Ma W. Huang C. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4414-4419PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, JB6 P+ C141 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h of starvation, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of EGF or 2-AG or EGF and 2-AG for 12 h. The cells were then harvested and disrupted in 500 μl of lysis buffer A (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 1-min centrifugation (16,000 × g at 4 °C), the pellets containing the nuclei were washed once with 500 μl of Buffer B (Buffer A without Nonidet P-40). The pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (Buffer B, but with 500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol) and strongly shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation (16,000 × g at 4 °C), the supernatant solutions were moved into fresh tubes and stored at –70 °C until analysis. The DNA binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a mixture containing 5 μg of nuclear protein, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 15,000 cpm of a α-32P-labeled double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′). The samples were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the gels were analyzed using the Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTS2-AG-stimulated ERK Phosphorylation and AP-1 Transcriptional Activity—MAP kinases are important elements of cell signaling cascades that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and tumorigenic transformation. When cells were treated with 2-AG, this endocannabonoid was found to stimulate ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in JB6 P+ cells (Fig. 1A) but had no effect on phosphorylation of JNKs or p38 kinase (Fig. 1A). Because ERKs are upstream of and known to activate the AP-1 transcription factor (36Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), 2-AG-induced ERK activation may also result in enhanced AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity. Indeed, we found that 10 μm 2-AG significantly stimulated AP-1-dependent transcription activity (Fig. 1B, *, p < 0.05).2-AG-stimulated ERK Phosphorylation and AP-1 Transcriptional Activity Were Blocked by PD98059—To determine whether 2-AG stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity is mediated directly by ERK phosphorylation, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, which is a kinase upstream from ERKs, was used. Results indicate that PD98059 almost completely blocked 2-AG-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and significantly inhibited AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B, *, p < 0.05) in JB6 cells.Fig. 2The effect of PD98059 on 2-AG-induced ERK phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. A, JB6 P+ Cl41 cells (5 × 104/well) were starved for 48 h in 0.1% FBS/MEM. Cells were treated with PD98059 at various concentrations for 30 min and subsequently treated with 10 μm 2-AG for another 30 min. Cells were disrupted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, JB6 P+ C141 AP-1 luciferase reporter-transfected cells (8 × 103/well) were seeded into 96-well plates. After reaching 80% confluence, cells were starved for 24 h by replacing the medium with 0.1% FBS/MEM. Cells were treated with PD98059 at various concentrations for 30 min and subsequently treated with 10 μm 2-AG for another 24 h. The AP-1 activity was measured using a luciferase assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results are presented as relative AP-1 activity compared with control without PD98059.

Specifically we asked whya small subset of TRβ mutations that arise in resistance to thyroidhormone syndrome inhibit both T3 binding and formation of TRβhomodimers on thyroid hormone response elements. We reasoned that thesemutations may affect structural elements involved in the coupling ofT3 binding to inhibition of TR DNA binding activity. Analysis of TRx-ray structures revealed that each of these resistance to thyroid hormonesyndrome mutations affects a cluster of charged amino acids with potential forionic bond formation between oppositely charged partners. Two clusters (1 and2) are adjacent to the dimer surface at the junction of helices 10 and 11.Targeted mutagenesis of residues in Cluster 1 (Arg338,Lys342, Asp351, and Asp355) and Cluster 2(Arg429, Arg383, and Glu311) confirmed thatthe clusters are required for stable T3 binding and for optimal TRhomodimer formation on DNA but also revealed that different arrangements ofcharged residues are needed for these effects. We propose that the chargeclusters are homodimer-specific extensions of the dimer surface and furtherthat T3 binding promotes specific rearrangements of these surfacesthat simultaneously block homodimer formation on DNA and stabilize the boundhormone.

TRs utilize their DNAbinding domain to recognize specific thyroid hormone response elements (TREs)comprised of AGGTCA repeats and bind these elements either as heterodimerswith the closely related retinoid X receptor (RXR) or as homodimers andmonomers. T3 does not affect RXR-TR interactions with TREs but doespromote release of TR homodimers from some TREs (inverted palindromes(F2/IP-6) and direct repeats (DR-4)) but not from TREs at which TRs bind asmonomers or paired monomers (palindromes, TREpal)(22Ribeiro R.C.

Thus, it is thought thatT3-dependent inhibition of homodimer formation relievestranscriptional repression by unliganded TRs. Nevertheless the mechanismsinvolved in coupling of T3 binding to inhibition of DNA binding arenot clear; TRs utilize the same surface at the junction of H10 and H11 inhomodimer and heterodimer formation on DNA(27Ribeiro R.C.

The structural elementsthat render homodimers sensitive to T3 are not known. In this study, we utilized targeted mutagenesis to explore elements of theTR that are specifically required for homodimer formation on TREs and testedthe hypothesis that the same elements are involved in coupling T3binding to inhibition of DNA binding. Whereas most TRβ mutations thatarise in resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) reduce the affinity ofTRβ for T3 (3Yen P.M.

Here we report that theseRTH mutations affect clusters of charged amino acids in the LBD with potentialfor electrostatic stabilization of TR conformation but that distinctarrangements of charged residues are needed for stable T3 bindingand DNA binding by unliganded TRs. We propose that the charge clustersrearrange upon T3 binding to block homodimer formation and createnew ionic bonds that stabilize bound hormone. TR Mutants—The pCMX vector was used for expression of thefull-length human TRβ(17Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Mutations withinTR-encoding sequences were created using the QuikChange XL site-directedmutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutation of target sequences was verified byautomated DNA sequence (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Hayward, CA). Transfections—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's H-21 4.5 g/liter glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovineserum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/mlstreptomycin. For transfection, cells were collected and resuspended inDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/4.5 × 107 cells)containing 0.1% dextrose and typically 4 μg of reporter, 1 μg of TRexpression vector or empty vector control, and 2 μg ofpCMV-β-galactosidase(17Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.J. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Cells wereelectroporated at 240 V and 960 microfarads, transferred to fresh media, andplated into 12-well plates. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C withT3 or vehicle, cells were collected, and pellets were lysed byaddition of 150 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1%Triton X-100. The reporters contained two copies of each TRE (DR-4, F2, andTREpal) upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter TATAbox linked to luciferase coding sequence. Luciferase and β-galactosidaseactivities were measured by using a luciferase assay system (Promega) andGalacto-Light Plus β-galactosidase reporter gene assay system (AppliedBiosystems). Glutathione S-Transferase Pull-down Assays—Full-length humanTRβ was expressed in a coupled transcription translation system(TnT, Promega). N-CoR (amino acids 1944–2453) and GRIP1(amino acids 563–1121) were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferaseaccording to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Bindings wereperformed by mixing glutathione-linked Sepharose beads containing 4 μg ofglutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (Coomassie Plus proteinassay reagent, Pierce) with 1–2 μl of 35S-labeled humanTRβ in 150 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,and protease inhibitors) containing 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1.5h. Beads were washed three times with 200 μl of binding buffer, the boundproteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and proteins wereseparated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized byautoradiography. T3 Binding Assay—TRs were expressed using theTnT T7 quick coupled transcription translation system (Promega).The affinities of T3 binding were determined using a saturationbinding assay. Briefly 15 fmol of each in vitro translated proteinwere incubated overnight at 4 °C with varying concentrations of[125I]T3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 100 μl ofE400 buffer (400 mm NaCl, 20 mm KPO4, pH 8,0.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol), 1mm monothioglycerol, and 50 μg of calf thymus histones(Calbiochem). The bound [125I]T3 was isolated by gravityflow through a 2-ml Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) column and quantifiedusing a γ-counter (COBRA, Packard Instruments). Off rate(koff) was determined by adding a 1000-fold molar excessof unlabeled T3 to a mixture containing TR and 1 nm[125I]T3 incubated previously overnight at 4 °C;aliquots were taken at the indicated time points to determine how rapidly thelabeled ligand dissociates from TR. These aliquots were applied to SephadexG-25 columns, and TR-bound [125I]T3 was quantified usinga γ-counter. As each T3-TR complex dissociates at a randomtime, the amount of specific binding follows an exponential dissociationequation: Y =Span·e–k·x + Plateauwhere x is time (min), Y is total binding (cpm), Span is thedifference between binding at time 0 and plateau (cpm), and k is thedissociation rate constant (koff, expressed inmin–1). Binding curves were fit by nonlinear regression, anddissociation constant (Kd) and koffvalues were calculated using the one-site saturation binding, one-phaseexponential decay, and one-phase exponential association models, respectively,contained in the Prism version 3.03 program (GraphPad Software, Inc., SanDiego, CA). Gel Shifts—Binding of TR to DNA was assayed by mixing 20fmol of TRs produced in a reticulocyte lysate system, TnT T7(Promega), with 300,000 cpm [γ-32P]ATP-radiolabeled DR-4 andF2 oligonucleotides and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a20-μl reaction (32Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Baxter J.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2076-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Incases in which TR ligand binding activity was severely affected by Cluster 1mutations, the overall amount of translated TRs in the extracts was alsoverified independently by Western blot. The binding buffer contained 25mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10μm ZnSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol. After 30min at room temperature, the mixture was loaded onto a 5% nondenaturingpolyacrylamide gel that was previously run for 30 min at 200 V. To visualizethe TR-DNA complexes, the gel was run at 4 °C for 120–180 min at 200V in a running buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 1mm EDTA. The gel was then fixed, dried, and exposed forautoradiography. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means± S.D. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test or t test wasperformed using GraphPad Prism version 3.03 for Windows. Data analyzedreferred to at least three independent experiments. A p value of<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RTH Mutations That Inhibit T3 and DNA Binding Reside inCharge Clusters—RTH mutations that inhibit homodimer formation onDNA affect positively charged Arg residues (R338W, R429Q, and R316H)(30Collingwood T.N.

Investigation of TR structural models revealed that each of theseamino acids lies within separate clusters of closely juxtaposed chargedresidues (Fig. 1A andTable I). The TRβ LBDcontains only one similar charge cluster that is not known to be affected byRTH mutations (Cluster 4, see TableI).Table ILocation and conservation of TR charge clustersClusterResiduesLocationRTH mutantsConservation1Arg338, Lys342, Asp351, Asp355Surface, links H7-H8R338W, R338L, K342I, A337delCharged residues at similar location in several NRs2Arg429, Arg383, Glu311Partially buried, links H11 and H10 to H6R383H, R429QArg429 conserved in 70% of NRs3Arg316, Gln374, Thr232, His229Buried, links H6 and H9 to H1R316HPolar cluster observed in similar location in many NRs4Arg410, His412, Asp366, Glu369Buried, links H9 and H10-H11 loopNoneGlu369 well conserved Open table in a new tab Clusters 1 and 2 are comprised of residues that are exposed or partiallyexposed on the surface of the LBD and are both adjacent to the classical dimersurface at the junction of H10 and H11(Fig. 1A andTable I). Unlike many residuesthat are affected by RTH mutations, none of the residues in the clustersdirectly contacts T3 or comprises part of a known coregulatorbinding surface. The residues in Clusters 1 and 2 have the potential to engage inelectrostatic interactions with each other. Cluster 1 includesArg338 and Lys342 on H7 and two negatively chargedresidues on H8, Asp351 and Asp355, and is completelysurface-exposed. We originally suggested that Arg338 andLys342 engage in parallel ionic pairings with Asp355 andAsp351, respectively, based on analysis of x-ray crystal structuresof the TRα LBD (12Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).Reinvestigation of TRβ-LBD structures(13Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A. Cunha Lima S.T. Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) suggested anotherarrangement: Arg338 and Lys342 both pair withAsp351, and Asp355 is not directly engaged in thecluster (Fig. 1B).Cluster 2 includes Arg429 on H11 and Arg383 on H9, bothof which are also mutated in RTH but reported not to affect DNA binding(36Clifton-Bligh R.J. de Zegher F. Wagner R.L. Collingwood T.N. Francois I. Van Helvoirt M. Fletterick R.J. Chatterjee V.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 609-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is partiallysurface-exposed. Here x-ray structures of TRα and TRβ indicatedthat both Arg residues pair with Glu311 on H6 in the LBD core(Fig. 1C). Residues in Clusters 1 and 2 show considerable conservation. They areconserved in TRs throughout vertebrate species (not shown). Residuesequivalent to those in charge Cluster 1 are conserved on H7 and H8 in otherNRs, including retinoic acid receptors and PPARs(Fig. 1D). Residues inCluster 2 show even better conservation(Fig. 1E). Togetherall of these considerations indicate that the charge clusters play animportant, and unappreciated, role in TR activities. Furthermore the fact thatmutations in the clusters affect T3 binding and homodimer formationindicates that the clusters must play a role in activities associated withliganded and unliganded TRs. Cluster 1 Is Required for Optimal T3 Binding—Wefirst examined effects of mutations in Cluster 1 on activities of ligandedTRs. Because residues of this cluster are completely surface-exposed itappeared unlikely that these mutations would exert indirect effects on TRfunction by disrupting internal folding of the LBD. We introduced 1) Alasubstitutions, which swap a residue with a small neutral side chain for aresidue with a charged side chain and thereby eliminate the potential forelectrostatic interactions, and 2) charge reversal mutations, which shoulddisrupt ionic bonds between oppositely charged residues by juxtaposingresidues with like charges. Fig. 2 shows effects ofmutations on activity of transfected TRβ in mammalian cells. TRβCluster 1 mutants did not affect maximal activation of transcription from aTRE-driven reporter (F2) in the presence of saturating T3 orrepression of basal transcription in the absence of T3(Fig. 2A).Nevertheless several TRβ Cluster 1 mutants displayed alteredT3 concentration dependence(Fig. 2B andTable II) both in HeLa cells(shown here) and in other cells (U2-OS and CV-1, not shown). Mutations in tworesidues (Arg338 and Asp351) led to reducedT3 sensitivity. The TRβR338W RTH mutant required 17-fold moreT3 than wild type TRβ for half-maximal activation(EC50). TRs bearing Ala substitutions at Arg338 andAsp351 (TRβR338A and TRβD351A) exhibited more modestreductions in T3 sensitivity, and TRs with charge reversalmutations at Arg338 and Asp351 (TRβR338D andTRβD351R) displayed more marked reductions in T3 sensitivity.In contrast, different mutations at Lys342 exhibited divergenteffects. A relatively mild Ala substitution mutation (TRβK342A) hadeither no effect or slightly enhanced T3 sensitivity(Table II). Nevertheless a moresevere charge reversal mutation, TRβK342D, exhibited decreasedT3 sensitivity as did the TRβK342I RTH mutant (not shown).Finally mutations at Asp355 did not reduce T3sensitivity. TRβD355A and TRβD355R either exhibited T3sensitivity comparable to wild type TRβ or enhanced T3sensitivity at some reporters (Fig.2B and TableII).Table IIAverage EC50 for T3 response obtained with TRsbearing Cluster 1 mutants at different TREsTRE/TRTRR338AK342AD351AD355AF2 (IP-6)100a,1357 ± 149.1b,173 ± 9.5a,1608 ± 185.5c,156 ± 11.3a,1DR-4100a,1112 ± 14.6a,268 ± 11.8a,1,2389 ± 98.6b,2102 ± 27.7a,2TREpal100a,b,1155 ± 37.0b,1,237 ± 16.7a,2308 ± 56.7c,233 ± 3.5a,1 Open table in a new tab None of the Cluster 1 mutations impaired binding to a coactivator (GRIP1,Fig. 3A) or to acorepressor (N-CoR, Fig.3A) in pull-down assays in vitro. This isconsistent with the results that show no impairment in the maximal effect ofthe hormone in transfection assays. By contrast, the same mutations thatreduced T3 sensitivity in vivo also reduced the affinityof the TR for T3 (Fig.3B) and increased T3 dissociation rates(Fig. 3C). Together our results indicate that Arg338, Asp351,and, to a lesser extent, Lys342 are required for optimalT3 binding and response and that Asp355 is not. This isconsistent with the apparent organization of Cluster 1 in TRβ crystalstructures where Arg338, Lys342, and Asp351side chains engage in electrostatic interactions with each other, andAsp355 does not (Fig.1B). Mutations in Cluster 1 Can Either Impair or Enhance Homodimer Bindingto DNA, and Effects Do Not Correlate with T3Binding—Next we examined effects of mutations in Cluster 1 on TRhomodimer formation on DNA. The data inFig. 4A confirmed thatthe TRβR338W RTH mutant exhibits defective homodimer formation at F2 andDR-4 elements along with normal levels of heterodimer formation(30Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Tone Y. Chatterjee V.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1262-1277PubMed Google Scholar,31Kitajima K. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Thyroid. 1995; 5: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By contrast, anartificial mutation (TRβL422R) in the classical dimer interface abolishedboth homodimer and heterodimer formation. In parallel, TRs bearing Alasubstitution mutants at Arg338 and Asp351 (both requiredfor optimal T3 binding) exhibited reduced homodimer but notheterodimer formation at F2 and DR-4 elements(Fig. 4B) just likethe TRβR338W RTH mutant. However, TRβK342A displayed reducedhomodimer formation even though it did not inhibit T3 binding(compare Figs. 2B and4B). Moresurprisingly, the charge reversal mutants exhibited enhanced DNA binding(Fig. 4C) even thoughmost of these mutations inhibit T3 binding(Fig. 2B). The preciseeffect of the charge reversal mutants varied; TRβR338D showed enhancedDNA binding in the absence of T3, whereas TRβD351R andTRβK342D showed enhanced DNA binding in the presence or absence ofT3. TRβD355R exhibited enhanced DNA binding in the presence ofT3, reversing the usual effects of T3 on TR DNA bindingactivity (Fig. 4C).Again these effects were largely homodimer-specific, although TRβK342Ddid exhibit somewhat enhanced heterodimer formation. Together our resultsconfirm that Cluster 1 is required for TR homodimer but not heterodimerformation on DNA. Nevertheless the sam"

This enzyme displays a peculiar reversible low-high affinity transition, never observed in other GSTs, which involves the G-site and shifts the apparent KD for glutathione (GSH) from 200 to 0.18 mm. The transition toward the high affinity conformation is triggered by the simultaneous binding of two GSH molecules to the dimeric enzyme, and it is manifested as an uncorrected homotropic behavior, termed “pseudo-cooperativity.” The high affinity enzyme is able to activate GSH, lowering its pKa value from 9.0 to 7.0, a behavior similar to that found in all known GSTs. Using 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, this enzyme reveals a potential optimized mechanism for the GSH conjugation but a low catalytic efficiency mainly due to a very low affinity for this co-substrate. Conversely, PfGST efficiently binds one molecule of hemin/monomer. The binding is highly cooperative (nH = 1.8) and occurs only when GSH is bound to the enzyme. The thiolate of GSH plays a crucial role in the intersubunit communication because no cooperativity is observed when S-methylglutathione replaces GSH. Docking simulations suggest that hemin binds to a pocket leaning into both the G-site and the H-site. The iron is coordinated by the amidic nitrogen of Asn-115, and the two carboxylate groups are in electrostatic interaction with the ϵ-amino group of Lys-15. Kinetic and structural data suggest that PfGST evolved by optimizing its binding property with the parasitotoxic hemin rather than its catalytic efficiency toward toxic electrophilic compounds.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). A prominent catalytic activity performed by eucaryotic GSTs (in particular by the Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, and Sigma GSTs) is the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to a number of toxic electrophilic compounds, thus promoting their excretion from the cell (1Jakoby W.B. Habing W.H. Jakoby W.B. Enzymatic Basis of Detoxification. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 63-94Google Scholar, 2Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Besides catalyzing conjugation activity, GSTs are involved in the sequestering and transport of exogenous hydrophobic compounds (i.e. pesticides, herbicides, and antibiotics) and of a large variety of endogenous compounds (i.e. steroids, bilirubin, and ferriprotoporphyrin IX). In contrast to many other organisms, the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum possesses only one GST isoenzyme (PfGST). A gene encoding a protein with sequence identity of up to 33% with known GSTs was identified on chromosome 14 of P. falciparum. The three-dimensional structure of PfGST shares several structural features with the Mu class GSTs even though alignments with its members display low sequence identities (20–33%) (12Perbandt M. Burmeister C. Walter R.D. Betzel C. Liebau E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1336-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite this structural similarity with Mu class GSTs, PfGST shows very low or no affinity toward the classical GST substrates. The homodimeric enzyme catalyzes the reaction GSH-dependent toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, ethacrynic acid, o-nitrophenyl acetate and cumene hydroperoxide but shows very low catalytic efficiency in comparison with other GSTs (in particular Pi, Alpha, and Mu class GSTs) (13Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Liebau E. Bergmann B. Campbell A.M. Teesdale-Spittle P. Brophy P.M. Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PfGST, which represents 1–10% of cellular proteins, may be involved directly in the heme detoxification of the parasite, avoiding the incorporation of the heme molecule into hemozoin, a highly insoluble material (15Egan T.J. Combrinck J.M. Egan J. Hearne G.R. Marques H.M. Ntenteini S. Sewell B.T. Smith P.J. Taylor D. Van Schalkwyk D.A. Walden J.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that the parasitotoxic hemin inhibits PfGST uncompetitively (Ki = 6.5 μm) indicating that free hemin can be bound by the enzyme in the micromolar range (13Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is known that chloroquine, one of the most important antimalarial drugs, inhibits hemin catabolism, leading to intracellular hemin accumulation (16Famin O. Krugliak M. Ginsburg H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In chloroquine-resistant parasites, PfGST activity significantly increases compared with sensitive strains (17Dubois V.L. Platel D.F. Pauly G. Tribouley-Duret J. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Strivastava P. Puri S.K. Kamboj K.K. Pandey V.C. Trop. Med. Int. Health. 1999; 4: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PfGST inhibitors are thus expected to act synergistically with the antimalarial drug chloroquine (which itself is a very weak inhibitor for GST, showing IC50 > 200 μm), increasing the accumulation of hemin in the parasite and thus enhancing its antiparasitic effects (13Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Starting from these preliminary observations, we have investigated the binding and activation of GSH and the kinetic mechanism of the reaction between GSH and the alternative co-substrate, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl). Moreover, the mechanism of interaction of the hemin with PfGST has been elaborated carefully on using pre-steady state, steady state kinetic, and fluorescence experiments. Our results reveal the existence of two distinct cooperative phenomena that modulate the interaction of this enzyme with GSH and with hemin. Structural intersubunit communication in GST superfamily has been demonstrated previously for GSTP1-1, GSTA1-1, and GSTT2-2 (19Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W.

Our results confirm that cooperativity is a mechanism adopted by a number of GST isoenzymes. Because of this cooperative mechanism, GSTs might be able to modulate interactions with different compounds, thereby responding to specific evolutionary pressures. Materials—GSH, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), NBD-Cl, 7-fluoro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-F), and hemin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Enzyme—The recombinant PfGST was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The purified form of PfGST was stored at –20 or 5 °C in the presence of 10 mm GSH. Under these conditions, the enzyme was stable for a few weeks. After a Sephadex G-25 chromatography and subsequent incubation of the enzyme at 25 °C for 12 h, the 90% inactive enzyme (PfGSTi) was used for reactivation and stopped-flow binding experiments. Protein concentration was calculated assuming an ϵ1 mg/ml of 1.1 at 280 nm for PfGST on the basis of the amino acid sequence (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). A molecular mass of 25 kDa/GST subunit was used in the calculation (14Liebau E. Bergmann B. Campbell A.M. Teesdale-Spittle P. Brophy P.M. Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Detection of GSH Thiolate—Difference spectra of the GSH thiolate bound to PfGST were obtained with a Kontron double beam Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 °C. In a typical experiment, 1 mm GSH was added to the enzyme (15 μm) in a phosphate-acetate-borate (50:50:50 mm) buffer, pH 7.0, and the spectra were recorded after 60 min. Spectra were corrected for the contribution of free GSH and free enzyme. The amount of thiolate was calculated by assuming an ϵ240 nm of 5000 m–1 cm–1. Experiments at different pH values were carried out using the phosphate-acetate-borate (50:50:50 mm) buffer between pH 5.0 and 7.5. The pKa value of the bound GSH was calculated by fitting the spectral data to Equation 1, A240nm=Alim/(1+10(pKa−pH)) (Eq. 1) where Alim is the limiting thiolate absorbance at 240 nm and at alkaline pH values. Enzymatic Activity—Standard PfGST activity with CDNB as co-substrate was measured at 25 °C in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. The activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by following the enzymatic product at 340 nm (ϵ = 9600 m–1cm–1). Steady state kinetic experiments with NBD-Cl as co-substrate were performed in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (25 °C), by varying NBD-Cl from 0.2 to 2 mm and GSH from 0.1 to 1 mm over a matrix of 16 substrate concentrations. The enzymatic product absorbs at 419 nm (ϵ = 14,500 m–1cm–1). Fluoride/Chloride Leaving Group Substitution—Kinetic data were obtained at 25 °C and at fixed NBD-Cl or NBD-F (0.2 mm) and GSH (1 mm) concentrations in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing suitable amounts of PfGST. The spontaneous reactions were evaluated under the same experimental condition in the absence of the enzyme. Stopped-flow Experiments—Rapid kinetic experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics Kinetics spectrometer stopped-flow instrument equipped with a thermostatted 2-mm light path observation chamber. Binding of GSH to PfGSTi was studied at 25 °C by rapid mixing of enzyme (30 μm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) with the same volume of GSH (from 2 to 100 mm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Binding of GSH was monitored by following the decrease of intrinsic fluorescence of the protein at 333 nm (λex = 280 nm) and the increase of the absorbance at 240 nm due to the ionization of the bound GSH. Likewise, binding of hemin to PfGST was studied under the same experimental conditions by rapid mixing of 20 μm enzyme and 20 mm GSH in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with the same volume of a hemin solution (from 10 to 100 μm). Binding of hemin was monitored by following the decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein at 333 nm. A fresh stock hemin solution was prepared by dissolving hemin chloride in 100 mm NaOH and then centrifuging for 10 min at 15,000 rpm to remove the remaining hemin crystals. Heme concentrations were estimated from the absorbance using ϵ385 nm = 58,400 m–1 cm–1. This stock hemin solution was diluted to 0.1 mm hemin and 10 mm NaOH and used immediately. No solubility artifacts were observed in control spectrophotometric experiments carried out under experimental conditions similar to those used for the stopped-flow technique or for the fluorometric experiments described below. Isothermic Binding of GSH and Hemin—Isothermic binding of hemin to PfGST was measured in a single photon counting spectrofluorometer (Fluoromax, S.A. Instrument, Paris) with a sampler holder thermostatted at 25 °C. Excitation was at 295 nm, and emission was collected at 333 nm. The affinity of PfGST (2 μm) for hemin was determined by measuring the perturbation of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein following the addition of the inhibitor (from 0.5 to 5 μm) in the presence of 10 mm GSH in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Fluorescence data were corrected both for dilution and inner filter effects. Similarly, the isothermic binding of GSH to PfGST was studied by incubating PfGSTi (2 μm) with variable amounts of GSH (from 0.1 to 10 mm) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Fluorescence quenching at 333 nm was measured after 60 min at 25 °C. Inhibition of PfGST by Hemin—Inhibition of PfGST by hemin was studied by adding variable amounts of hemin (from 0.5 to 6 μm) with a fixed enzyme concentration (2 μm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. After about 10 s, 5 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB were added for activity measurement. The data obtained by varying the hemin concentration were analyzed to the Hill equation, vi/vmax=[S]n/(Kn+[S]n) (Eq. 2) where vi is the initial velocity observed at a given concentration of hemin, vmax is the velocity observed in absence of inhibitor, [S] is the hemin concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient at the hemin concentration corresponding to the half-enzyme saturation. Inhibition data were also analyzed with a two-site Adair model for ligand binding to a homodimeric macromolecule, vi/vmax=([S]/K1+[S]2/αK12)/(1+2[S]/K1+[S]2/α (Eq. 3) where K1 is the dissociation equilibrium constant for hemin binding to the free enzyme, αK1 (=K2) represents the dissociation equilibrium constant for hemin to the monoligated enzyme, and α is the adimensional interaction parameter coupling the two functionally linked hemin binding sites. Docking Simulations—Docking simulations were performed with the program Autodock 3.0.5 (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9208) Google Scholar) using the PfGST crystal structure in complex with S-hexylglutathione (Protein Data Bank code 1Q4J), after removal of the hexyl moiety. Polar hydrogen atoms were added geometrically, and Kollman united atom charges were assigned. Docking experiments for hemin were performed with a flexible ligand. Hemin charges were added by the Gasteiger-Marsili method (28Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4884) Google Scholar). Grids of molecular interactions were calculated in a cubic box, size 33.375 Å, grid spacing 0.375 Å, centered on the oxygen atom of the tyrosine side chain participating in GSH activation (Tyr-9). Docking was performed 100 times using the Lamarkian genetic algorithm with random starting position and conformation, a population size of 50, standard parameters (29Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3228Crossref Scopus (3601) Google Scholar), and a maximum of 250,000 energy evaluations and 27,000 generations. The 100 final docked conformations were ranked according to their binding free energy and clustered using a tolerance of 3 Å root-mean-square deviation. The MOLMOL program (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) was used for graphical interpretation and representation of results. Low-High Affinity Transition—PfGST shows good stability and constant specific activity only when it is stored at 1 mm or higher GSH concentrations. On the contrary, a rapid and biphasic inactivation occurs in GSH-depleted solutions. For example, the specific activity of the enzyme stored in the presence of 10 mm GSH drops to 50% in a few minutes after a Sephadex G-25 chromatography (t½ = 3–4 min), whereas a complete inactivation is reached only after about 48 h of incubation at 25 °C (t½ = 12 h). In the presence of traces of GSH, both of the phases become slower, and only the first phase of inactivation can be readily observed (Fig. 1). At 0.1 mm GSH concentration, the 50% inactivation kinetics displays a t½ of 12 min. The hemi-inactivated enzyme completely recovers the original activity in less than 1 min upon incubation with 10 mm GSH. A complete reactivation is also observed starting from a 90% inactivated enzyme (PfGSTi) using either 1 mm GSH (Fig. 1) or 10 mm GSH. In both cases the reactivation is a monophasic process, but a nonlinear dependence of the reactivation rate on GSH concentration may reveal a cooperative phenomenon (Fig. 1, inset). When the enzyme completely looses its original activity, GSH is unable to trigger an efficient reactivation, indicating that a further irreversible process takes place. Interestingly, S-methylglutathione is also able to trigger the activation of PfGSTi, and thus the free sulfhydryl group of GSH is not essential for this event. Apart from the possibility that the low-high activity transition may be caused by a structural modification of essential residues involved in catalysis, alternatively, this could be due to structural changes of the G-site and/or of the H-site lowering the affinity for GSH or for the co-substrate. Isothermic binding of GSH to PfGSTi, followed on the basis of the intrinsic fluorescence quenching at variable GSH concentrations, indicated that changes of the enzyme affinity for GSH are likely involved in this transition. In fact, a marked sigmoid behavior suggests that GSH binding shifts the enzyme from a low affinity to a high affinity conformation (data not shown). However the fluorescence data did not fit satisfactorily to a cooperative equation, and only an approximate estimation of the affinity constants for GSH has been calculated, i.e. KD > 200 mm for the low affinity conformation and KD < 0.2 mm for the high affinity conformation. Stopped-flow Experiments—The low-high affinity transition triggered by GSH and the binding mechanism of GSH have been detailed by means of stopped-flow experiments following the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence after rapid mixing PfGSTi (30 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) with GSH at variable concentrations (from 100 to 2 mm) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, kobs values do not increase linearly by increasing GSH concentrations, as expected for a simple bimolecular interaction, but follow a clear exponential behavior. It should be noted that reaction half-times span from ∼200 ms to >500 s by changing the final GSH concentrations from 50 to 1 mm, respectively. However, all experimental traces do not fit satisfactory to a classical positive cooperative mechanism (Fig. 2, inset). Conversely, kobs values increase linearly on the square of GSH concentration (Fig. 3), suggesting the occurrence of a trimolecular interaction. All experimental data obtained from the stopped-flow experiments, taken together with kinetics of enzyme activation and inactivation observed in the presence of GSH or after its removal, have been rationalized on the basis of a more complicated binding mechanism (Scheme 1). GSH binds to the two PfGST subunits of the inactive enzyme (I-I) sequentially, with identical rate constants. Only when both subunits are saturated with GSH does the inactive enzyme rapidly convert into the active dimeric enzyme (A-A). The conversion of the inactive enzyme with GSH bound into the active enzyme apparently is not reversible. The active enzyme becomes inactive only by following Step 4 (in Scheme 1) to give the GSH-A-I species (which may correspond to the hemi-inactivated enzyme recovered after Sephadex G-25 chromatography). Stopped-flow data fit very well to this mechanism (Fig. 2), and the fitting procedure allowed us to estimate with satisfying precision k1, k–1, k2, and k–2 values (Table I). The rate constants for the conversion of the inactive enzyme to the active enzyme (k3 and k–3, as well as k–5) were not resolved by the fitting procedure. In these cases, the fitting procedure can only indicate the upper or lower limits of the rate constants. Rate constants for dissociation of GSH from the active enzyme (k–4 and k–5) were found experimentally by looking at the rate of the biphasic inactivation due to dilution or removal of GSH from an activate enzyme solution (see Fig. 1). The hysteresis represented by the cyclic reaction in Scheme 1 is due to the very low rate constant for the conversion of the active enzyme into the inactive enzyme in the presence of bound GSH, which causes the apparent irreversibility of reaction 3. Interestingly, the low activity enzyme shows a kinetics of GSH binding (k1 and k2) that is thousands of times lower than those observed for Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs (31Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Nicotra M. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); conversely, the kinetics of GSH release (k–1 and k–2) is similar. Thus, it appears that in the low affinity conformation, the G-site is partially obscured so that GSH cannot interact at a high rate with its protein counterpart. The overall dissociation constant calculated by the stopped-flow data ranges from 200 mm for the low affinity conformation to 0.18 mm for the high affinity state, close to the values calculated by the preliminary analysis of the fluorescence data at equilibrium.Fig. 3Dependence of kobs on GSH concentration. Stopped-flow experiments were performed as described in the legend for Fig. 2. kobs values were calculated by following the intrinsic fluorescence quenching at 333 nm (○) and the increase of absorbance at 240 nm (□).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters for GSH binding to PfGSTk1 = k2(4 ± 1) 103 m-1s-1k-1 = k-2(1 ± 0.5) 103 s-1k3aUpper or lower limits as indicated by the fitting procedure.≥10-2 s-1k-3aUpper or lower limits as indicated by the fitting procedure.≤10-5 s-1k4bRate constants were found experimentally by following the biphasic inactivation due to dilution or removal of GSH from the enzyme solution.(20 ± 5) m-1s-1k-4bRate constants were found experimentally by following the biphasic inactivation due to dilution or removal of GSH from the enzyme solution.(3.5 ± 0.8) 10-3 s-1k5aUpper or lower limits as indicated by the fitting procedure.≥10-6 m-1s-1k-5bRate constants were found experimentally by following the biphasic inactivation due to dilution or removal of GSH from the enzyme solution.(5 ± 2) 10-5 s-1a Upper or lower limits as indicated by the fitting procedure.b Rate constants were found experimentally by following the biphasic inactivation due to dilution or removal of GSH from the enzyme solution. Open table in a new tab GSH Activation—Differential spectrophotometry has been used to verify whether PfGST forces the deprotonation of the bound GSH in the same manner that it occurs in most GSTs (2Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). These experiments, based on the peculiar absorbance of the thiolate anion at 240 nm, were carried out at different pH values and at fixed 1 mm GSH, a concentration that stabilizes the high affinity conformation. As shown in Fig. 4, the high affinity enzyme lowers the pKa of GSH so that detectable amounts of GS– are found even at neutral pH values. The pH dependence of the absorbance at 240 nm indicates that about 1 mol of thiolate/mol of enzyme subunit is formed at pH 8.5. The apparent pKa of the bound GSH is 7.0, a value 2 units lower than that of the free GSH. Stopped-flow experiments performed by mixing the low affinity enzyme with variable amounts of GSH also indicated that kinetics of thiolate formation are similar to that of the binding process (see Fig. 3); thus, these two events appear synchronous. Kinetic Mechanism with NBD-Cl as Co-substrate—One peculiar feature of PfGST is its very low specific activity for reactions involving classical GST substrates such as CDNB. In the high affinity conformation, its specific activity is only 1 unit/mg, which is 50–100 times lower than that found for Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs. As suggested previously (13Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Liebau E. Bergmann B. Campbell A.M. Teesdale-Spittle P. Brophy P.M. Lüersen K. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 124: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this low catalytic efficiency could be mainly because of the scarce affinity of the enzyme for CDNB. Our steady state kinetic experiments confirmed that the Km for CDNB is very high (»10 mm), and an accurate determination of kinetic parameters such as Km and kcat was precluded because of the scarce solubility of this compound.

The antibody traps ErbB2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby down-regulating cell surface ErbB2. The transfected cells showed inactivation of ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced heterodimerization of ErbB2 and ErbB3. This resulted in greater sensitivity to apoptosis induced by growth deprivation and delayed tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, decreased heterodimerization of ErbB2 and ErbB3 led to a reorganization in ErbB function in transfected cells as heterodimerization between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB3 increased, whereas ErbB3 activation remained almost the same. Importantly, elimination of ErbB2 signaling resulted in an increase in EGFR expression and activation in transfected cells.

The binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase induces receptor dimerization, activation of the intracellular kinase domain, and autophosphorylation (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated residues serve as high affinity binding sites for Src homology 2-containing proteins and allow for the modulation of intracellular pathways (2Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F.

Constitutive activation of these pathways is apparent in many malignancies and provides maintenance of the malignant phenotype as well as a viable target for cancer therapy.

Four members of this family are currently known: the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ErbB, protein-tyrosine kinases related to the epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAb, monoclonal antibody; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Qd, quiescent day; tTA, tetracycline-controlled transactivator; JOE, 6-carboxy-4′,5′-dichloro-2′,7′-dimethoxyfluorescein. receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), ErbB2 (also called Neu/HER2), ErbB3, and ErbB4 (6Earp H.S.

All of them share a similar primary structure, but they differ in their ligand specificity and kinase functions (7Peles E. Ben-Levy R. Tzahar E. Liu N. Wen D. Yarden Y.

Increased expression of EGFR is associated with relatively aggressive tumors of the stomach, bladder, lung, and breast (9Gullick W.J. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 1990; 5: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An abnormal level of EGFR has been correlated with tumor size and stage in head and neck cancer (10Nicholson R.I. Gee J.M.

Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In patients with colon carcinoma, increased EGFR mRNA in the tumors is associated with a higher rate of liver metastasis (14Radinsky R. Risin S. Fan D. Dong E. Bielenberg D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 19-31PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work in this laboratory indicated that inappropriate expression of EGFR and its ligand, transforming growth factor-α, associates with neoplastic transformation and induces malignant progression of human colon carcinoma (15Ziober B.L.

Li W. Jiang W. Humphrey L.E. Howell G.M. Brattain M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Receptor-receptor interactions between ErbB family members were first described by Stern and Kamps (18Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and by Wada et al. (19Wada T. Qian X.L. Greene M.I.

Ligand-induced receptor dimerization of EGFR is believed to provide an allosteric regulatory signal coupled to kinase activation (20Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, ligand-induced heterodimerization of ErbB family members also occurs, and transmodulation of family members is also observed (8Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

Transmodulation is regarded as providing more complex and flexible downstream signal transduction than homodimerization (26Riese Jr., D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 27Hynes N.E. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 occurs in cells coexpressing these proteins, and although ErbB2 itself does not bind heregulin, ErbB2 and ErbB3 heterodimerize to form a high affinity heregulin receptor complex in association with transphosphorylation (21Sliwkowski M.X.

Moreover, ErbB3 appears to lack kinase activity and is therefore phosphorylated through ErbB2 transmodulation (8Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

Furthermore, cells coexpressing EGFR and ErbB3 show an EGF-dependent ErbB3 phosphorylation, which indicates the heterodimerization and transactivation of ErbB3 (33Kim H.H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

EGFR heterodimers (EGFR/ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3) also play a major role in regulating downstream signaling in MCF-7 cells (36Knowlden J.M. Hutcheson I.R. Jones H.E. Madden T. Gee J.M. Harper M.E. Barrow D. Wakeling A.E. Nicholson R.I. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1032-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Gene amplification and overexpression of ErbB2 are correlated with poor prognosis in breast and ovarian cancer (37Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar, 38Negro A. Brar B.K. Lee K.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2004; 59: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but the role of ErbB2 in colon cancer is largely unknown. Our work has suggested a role for ErbB2 in colon cancer because coexpression of ErbB2 and heregulin in colon tumors and cell lines was demonstrated, indicating that constitutive activation of “normal” levels of ErbB2 could provide the signaling basis of tumor growth (39Venkateswarlu S. Dawson D.M. St. Clair P. Gupta A. Willson J.K. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the role of ErbB2 in supporting colon tumor growth using GEO cells, which have been shown to have both autocrine transforming growth factor-α and autocrine heregulin loops (39Venkateswarlu S. Dawson D.M. St. Clair P. Gupta A. Willson J.K. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ScFv5R is a single chain antibody directed to the extracellular domain of ErbB2. This antibody has the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal, KDEL, at the C terminus. Therefore, when expressed ectopically, it traps ErbB2 in the ER and prevents the appearance of ErbB2 on the plasma membrane. This in turn leads to a functional inactivation of the receptor and reversion of ErbB2 induced transformation in vitro (40Beerli R.R. Wels W. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23931-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report that ErbB2 activation was reduced significantly in ScFv5R-transfected GEO colon cancer cells, and tumorigenicity was inhibited. Blockade of ErbB2 in colon cancer cells also resulted in enhanced EGFR activation as well as changes in heterodimerization among ErbB family members in association with alterations in cell survival signaling. The compensatory changes in the ErbB family after inhibition of one of its members are of potential importance in optimizing current EGFR and ErbB2 directed therapies in cancer. Cell Culture—The GEO human colon carcinoma cell line was maintained continuously in a chemically defined serum-free medium (41Boyd D.D. Levine A.E. Brattain D.E. McKnight M.K. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K. Long B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The standard maintenance medium (designated “SF”) consists of McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, 20 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 4 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis). The supplemented McCoy's medium (designated “SM”) is McCoy's 5A medium without any exogenous growth factors. Working cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and checked routinely for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were subcultured using 0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen) in Joklik's tissue culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% EDTA and replated into SF medium. To isolate proteins and DNAs for biochemical assays, cells were plated into 100-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in SF medium. At 80% confluence cells were changed from SF to SM medium to induce growth arrest and quiescence. Quiescence was previously operationally defined as stable minimal steady state [3H]thymidine incorporation (43Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This required 3-5 days exposure to medium without growth factors (SM medium). Cells were harvested for different assays at various times leading up to 5 days of growth factor deprivation (43Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some cases, cells were harvested at day 6 after starvation. Antibodies—Anti-ErbB2, anti-ErbB3, anti-ERK polyclonal antibodies, and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-actin was from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody clone 4G10 and anti-phospho-ErbB2 Y1248 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phospho-EGFR Y1173 and anti-EGFR MAb225 were from Calbiochem. Caspase-3 polyclonal, anti-phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51) and eIF2α antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). ScFv5R Expression Vector Construction and Transfection—The ScFv5R (a single chain antibody against ErbB2) cDNA was subcloned into a tetracycline-controllable expression system kindly provided by Dr. H. Bujard at University of Heidelberg, Germany (44Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). As described previously (45Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this system includes a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), which is generated by fusing the tetracycline repressor with the activating domain of virion protein 16 of herpes simplex virus, and an expression vector that consists of a tetracycline operator sequence as well as a minimal promoter sequence derived from the human cytomegalovirus promoter. When the tetracycline repressor of the tTA binds to tetracycline operators, the virion protein 16 domain of the tTA can activate the minimal promoter to start transcription. Tetracycline can block this activation by preventing the tTA from binding to the tetracycline operator sequence. A neomycin-resistant gene under control of the mouse β-globin promoter was subcloned into the tTA-containing plasmid. This plasmid (designated pUHD15-1, 4 μg) and the ScFv5R expression vector (designated pUHD10-3, 16 μg) were linearized and cotransfected into GEO cells. Electroporation was carried out at 250 V, 960 microfarads, with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The transfected cells were allowed to grow for 2 days in normal medium (SF medium) before being subjected to selection with 620 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Stable cell clones resistant to G418 sulfate were ring cloned after 2-3 weeks and expanded further for screening for the mobility shift of ErbB2 as described previously (46Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). ErbB2 is a glycoprotein (47Akiyama T. Sudo C. Ogawara H. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1986; 232: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 48Huang S.S. Koh H.A. Konish Y. Bullock L.D. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3340-3346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that undergoes N-linked glycosylation in the ER followed by modification and extension of the carbohydrate side chains in the Golgi apparatus. In ScFv5R-transfected cells, the glycosylation of the ER-retained ErbB2 is impaired, which leads to an increased mobility on SDS-PAGE (40Beerli R.R. Wels W. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23931-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mobility shift of ErbB2 serves as a marker for clones stably expressing the antibody (46Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml leupeptin). Crude cell lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle four times to sheer DNA and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell lysates were heated for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol). 100 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) and electroblotted onto Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were labeled with peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz) for 1 h, and the protein was detected using an ECL method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—This experiment was carried out as described previously (49Jackson J.G. St. Clair P. Sliwkowski M.X. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with different antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were absorbed by protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by heating for 5 min at 95 °C in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, then transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to Western blot analysis with detection by the ECL method. Quantitative PCR—RNA was collected from the appropriate cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A reverse transcription reaction was then performed on the RNA, and quantitative PCR was used to analyze the samples using the Taqman gene expression system following the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The BiP primer-probe mix was purchased from Applied Biosystems, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-JOE probe was used as endogenous control. Data were analyzed using the SDS 2.2 software from Applied Biosystems. DNA Fragmentation Assay (DNA Laddering and Cell Death Detection ELISA)—Cells were incubated on ice in DNA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris [pH 7.5], 20 mm EDTA, 05% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with proteinase K (0.4 mg/ml) and SDS (0.5%). DNA was then extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The concentration and purity of DNA were determined by measuring UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Ten micrograms of DNA from each sample was analyzed by 1.6% agarose gel electrophoresis. For cell death detection ELISA, cells were plated in a density of 8,000 cell per well in SF medium in 96-well plates, they were subsequently allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. The next day, media were changed and cells were treated with either AG1478 or MAb225 for another 48 h at 37 °C. DNA fragmentation was detected by using Roche Cell Death Detection ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Analysis of PARP—Cells from different stages were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping, and lysed with buffer containing protease inhibitors as described above. 100 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The Western blotting was performed as described above, using 1 μg/ml PARP antibody (Santa Cruz). Flow Cytometry Analysis—2-3 × 106 cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were trypsin treated at 37 °C until the cells were detached and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 20 °C and resuspended in 0.4-0.6 ml of low salt propidium iodide stain (0.03 g/ml polyethylene glycol, 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 4 mm sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100). The suspensions were then transferred to Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes with 2 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml, DNase-free), vortexed gently for less than 2 s, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. An equal volume of high salt stain (same as above except 400 mm sodium chloride was used instead of 4 mm sodium citrate) was added after the incubation. The mixture was vortexed gently for less than 2 s and stored at 4 °C overnight before analysis of DNA content. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed by using a ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Inc.). Tumorigenicity—Tumorigenicity studies were performed as described previously (46Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from exponential cultures of ScFv5R-transfected GEO cells (designated GEO C) and control cells were inoculated subcutaneously behind the anterior fore limb of 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (athymic nu/nu, Case Western Reserve University Cancer Center athymic mouse colony). Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment. Growth curves for xenografts were determined by externally measuring tumors in two dimensions using a caliper. Volume was determined by Equation 1,V=(L×W2)×0.5(Eq. 1) where V = volume, L = length, and W = width of the tumor. ErbB2 Expression and Activation in ScFv5R-transfected GEO Cells—We stably transfected ScFv5R (a single chain antibody against ErbB2) cDNA under tetracycline-repressible control into GEO cells. A typical positive clone (designated GEO C) with faster migration of the ErbB2 protein in SDS-PAGE was selected for study (Fig. 1A). The faster migration is the result of underglycosylation of ErbB2, which was trapped in the ER by the antibody in ScFv5R-transfected cells (40Beerli R.R. Wels W. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23931-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of tetracycline in the culture medium resulted in substantial reversal of the mobility shift of ErbB2 in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, far left lane), indicating that the tetracycline-regulatable expression system was functional in GEO cells. However, total ErbB2 expression level did not change (Fig. 1A). The transfection was further confirmed by examining the activation of ErbB2 in GEO C and parental GEO cells. The phosphorylation of ErbB2 was reduced significantly in GEO C compared with parental GEO cells (Fig. 1B). ErbB2/ErbB3 Heterodimer Formation and ErbB3 Activation—Heterodimer formation between ErbB2 and ErbB3 was determined by immunoprecipitation with ErbB2 followed by Western analysis of ErbB3. Immunoprecipitation by antibody to ErbB2 was utilized because others have suggested reduced accessibility of ErbB3 after heterodimerization (50Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We found that ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization decreased in GEO C, and this was reversed by addition of tetracycline in the culture medium (Fig. 2A). Although the ErbB2 transphosphorylation function on ErbB3 has been reduced because both ErbB2 activation and ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization were reduced after transfection, Fig. 2B shows that ErbB3 activation was increased slightly in GEO C compared with the control cells. These results suggested that redistribution of ErbB3 among the ErbB family members occurred after ErbB2 was sequestered in the ER. Activation through heterodimerization is thought to play an important role in signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases. ErbB3 may also be activated through heterodimerization with receptors other than ErbB2. Thus we investigated the relationships between the ErbB receptors with respect to heterodimerization as a function of the cells' autocrine activity during quiescence. Quiescence was induced by exposing the cells to the medium without growth factors (SM medium) for 5 days as described under “Materials and Methods.” This ruled out any effects of exogenous growth factors. The determination of heterocomplexes involving EGFR was performed using an antibody specific for the EGFR which does not cross-react with other family members. ErbB2 or ErbB3 heterodimerization to EGFR was detected by Western blot analysis of the anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates. The formation of EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer decreased in GEO C compared with GEO cells as a result of decreased ErbB2 activation (data not shown). In contrast, EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimerization increased in GEO C (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that EGFR may compensate for ErbB2 loss in transphosphorylating ErbB3 through heterodimerization in antibody-transfected cells. Consequently, EGFR expression and activation were investigated. EGFR Expression and Activation—Expression and activation of EGFR were low in GEO wild type cells. When GEO cells were transfected with the single chain antibody against ErbB2, EGFR expression and activation increased dramatically (Fig. 3). The activation of EGFR was assayed either by immunoprecipitation using phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 or by Western blot using an activated EGFR antibody (Y1173) as described under “Materials and Methods.” On the other hand, ErbB3 expression as well as ErbB2 remained almost the same in GEO C compared with GEO parental cells (data not shown). These results implied that EGFR compensated for the loss of ErbB2 activation in GEO C through increased expression and activation. We hypothesized that increased EGFR activation may play a role in GEO C cell survival because our previous studies had shown that ErbB2 was critical to cell survival signaling in GEO cells (40Beerli R.R. Wels W. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23931-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with the highly selective EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (51Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar) showed that DNA fragmentation was significantly increased in GEO C cells compared with that of GEO control cells (Fig. 4A). In a separate experiment, different concentrations of anti-EGFR MAb225 treatment showed similar results (Fig. 4B). Western blot results showed that both AG1478 and MAb225 inhibit p-EGFR in GEO and GEO C cells efficiently, but PARP cleavage was increased strongly in GEO C cells as AG1478 or MAb225 concentrations increased (Fig. 4). These results indicated that increased EGFR activation contributed to maintenance of cell survival in GEO C cells. Furthermore, this implies a shift of roles between ErbB2 and EGFR in supporting survival af"
https://openalex.org/W2051218014,"During early assembly of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), an assembly complex is formed, the components of which include genomic RNA, Gag, GagPol, tRNALys, and lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS). Directly increasing or decreasing cellular expression of LysRS results in corresponding changes in viral infectivity and in the viral concentrations of LysRS, tRNALys, and, surprisingly, reverse transcriptase (RT). Since altering the cellular expression of LysRS does not lead to a change in the incorporation of the RT precursor protein, GagPol, in protease-negative HIV-1, we propose that the altered viral content of RT resulting from alterations in cellular LysRS concentration results from the ability of LysRS to inhibit premature activation of Gag-Pol viral protease within the complex. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that increases and decreases in cellular LysRS expression are accompanied by 5–8-fold increases and 5-fold decreases, respectively, in the cytoplasmic proteolysis of Gag and GagPol to mature viral proteins. Using a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay to directly measure HIV-1 protease activity in vivo also indicates that the overexpression of LysRS in the cell reduces viral protease activity.

Using a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay to directly measure HIV-1 protease activity in vivo also indicates that the overexpression of LysRS in the cell reduces viral protease activity. During viral assembly, the Gag and GagPol precursors are processed into the final mature viral proteins by the viral protease located within GagPol (1Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar). Proteolysis is believed to occur during or immediately after viral budding (2Kaplan A.H. Manchester M. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6782-6786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mechanisms that prevent premature cytoplasmic processing of the viral precursors and their loss from the virion are clearly desirable. Since protease dimerization is required for the activity of the enzyme (1Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar), the concentration of GagPol at the plasma membrane could be an important factor favoring dimerization. Another mechanism regulating protease activity could involve a GagPol conformation, rendering it resistant to protease dimerization during its transit to the plasma membrane. Such a GagPol transport complex will include Gag and RNA since interaction with Gag is required for GagPol incorporation into budding viruses (3Park J. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Smith A.J. Srivivasakumar N. Hammarskjöld M.-L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction requires the RNA-facilitated multimerization of Gag (5Khorchid A. Halwani R. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This RNA/Gag/GagPol complex will also include tRNALys and lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS), the enzyme that aminoacylates tRNALys.

Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the tRNALys isoacceptors, tRNA1Lys,tRNA2Lys, and tRNA3Lys (the primer tRNA for reverse-transcriptase (7Mak J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), are selectively packaged into HIV-1 (8Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This incorporation requires the presence of both Gag, which binds specifically with LysRS (9Halwani R. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Saadatmand J. Kim S. Shiba K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7553-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and GagPol, which interacts with both Gag (3Park J. Morrow C.D. J.

Biol. 2000; 299: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). LysRS incorporation into Gag viral-like particles occurs independently of tRNALys incorporation (6Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which requires the additional presence of GagPol, suggesting that LysRS itself may act as a signal for targeting tRNALys for selective packaging into HIV-1. A complex containing Gag, GagPol, and LysRS has been coimmunoprecipitated with anti-integrase from lysates of 293FT cells infected with protease-negative HIV-1 (9Halwani R. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Saadatmand J. Kim S. Shiba K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7553-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GagPol present in an early form of this assembly complex may be more resistant to dimerization and protease activation than at later stages when budding is initiated. In support of this hypothesis, we present data herein that indicate that altering the content of one of the packaging complex components, LysRS, produces corresponding changes in viral protease activity. Plasmids—BH10 is a simian virus 40-based vector that contains full-length wild-type HIV-1 proviral DNA. BH10.P-is similar to BH10 but contains an inactive viral protease (D25G). hGagPol codes for Gag and protease-positive GagPol. hGagPolΔFSΔPR was constructed by deleting 5 thymidines in the frameshift site and codes for GagPol but not Gag. This protein contains an inactive protease due to an R42G mutation in the active site. Both proteins are made from mRNAs that have had their codons optimized for mammalian cell codon usage. The “humanized” proteins have identical amino acid sequences to their viral counterparts. pcDNALysRS contains cDNA encoding full-length (1–597 amino acids) human LysRS cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and was constructed through PCR amplification of the cDNA as described previously (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is C-terminally tagged with V5. BH10Lys3 and BH10Lys2 contain both wild-type HIV-1 proviral DNA and a human tRNA3Lys or tRNA2Lys gene, respectively. These vectors were constructed as described previously (12Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) analysis, a DNA construct was prepared coding for a fusion protein between humanized sea pansy Renilla reniformis Luciferase (hRLuc2) and a humanized green fluorescent protein (hGFP2). The HIV-1 p2/p7 protease cleavage site (4 amino acids on each side of the scissile bond: ATIM/MQRG) was fused between and in-frame to create the hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc construct, as described (13Hu K. Clement J.F. Abrahamyan L. Strebel K. Bouvier M. Kleiman L. Mouland A. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Cell Transfections, siRNA, and Virus Purification—The culture of HEK-293T cells, their transfection with these plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the isolation of virions 48 h after transfection from the cell supernatant were done as described previously (14Cen S. Guo F. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Deflassieux J. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33177-33184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). siRNA experiments were performed as described previously (15Guo F. Cen S. Niu M. Javanbakht H. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9817-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 293T cells were first transfected with small interfering RNA specific for either LysRS (siRNALysRS) or a control small interfering RNA siRNALuc) specific for luciferase, and 24 h later, transfected with BH10. Viruses were harvested 48 h after transfection with BH10. Specific siRNAs were constructed as described previously (15Guo F. Cen S. Niu M. Javanbakht H. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9817-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For transfection of 293T cells with siRNA, cationic lipid complexes were prepared by incubating 50 pmol of indicated siRNA with 5 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min and were then added to the wells in a final volume of 0.75 ml with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 4 h later, 0.75 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum was added to the cells. The BRET Analysis for HIV-1 Protease Activity—The BRET assay used for the determination of HIV-1 protease activity is described in detail elsewhere (13Hu K. Clement J.F. Abrahamyan L. Strebel K. Bouvier M. Kleiman L. Mouland A. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells are transfected with hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc (1.5 mg), hGagPol (0.5 mg), and increasing concentrations of V5.LysRS. At 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for protein expression (see below) or 100,000 cells were plated in a microwell and were submitted to BRET analysis as follows. 5 mm DeepBlue C coelenterazine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to cells, causing the oxidation of the donor hRLuc and resulting in the emission of light of wavelength 395 nm. Part of the energy can be transferred non-radiatively to a codon-optimized and -humanized GFP2 (hGFP2) if the hRluc and the hGFP2 are in close proximity (Forster distance being about 10–100 Å). The hGFP2 will then emit light at 510 nm. Both emissions are quantitated by sequential top-reading, using a combined luminometer and fluorescence plate reader (Fusion α-FP apparatus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BRET ratio is determined from the following equation: ((emission at 510 nm/emission at 395 nm) in cells expressing the hRluc and hGFP2 fusion proteins)) – ((emission at 510 nm/emission at 410 in cells expressing hRluc alone)). The following filters are used: the hRLuc emission, 410 nm bandpass of 80 nm, and the hGFP2 emission, 515 nm bandpass of 30 nm. In contrast to the first generation BRET analysis (16Chatel-Chaix L. Clement J.F. Martel C. Beriault V. Gatignol A. Des-Groseillers L. Mouland A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2637-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the BRET analysis used here provides better resolution between the emission spectra of hRLuc and hGFP2, allowing for a straightforward ratiometric calculation to assess molecular proximity between hGFP2 and hRLuc and HIV-1 protease activity (13Hu K. Clement J.F. Abrahamyan L. Strebel K. Bouvier M. Kleiman L. Mouland A. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar, 17Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol.

Methods. 2004; 1: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The BRET ratio was found to be stable over several readings (evaluated within 5–8 min (13Hu K. Clement J.F. Abrahamyan L. Strebel K. Bouvier M. Kleiman L. Mouland A. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar)). In some experiments, the expression levels of total hGFP2 and hRLuc were determined by direct measurements of total hGFP2 and luminescence levels on aliquots of transfected cell samples as follows. The hGFP2 total fluorescence was measured using Fusion α-FP apparatus with an excitation filter of 400 nm and an emission filter of 510 nm. After the fluorescence measurement, the same cells were incubated for 10 min with coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 μm, and the total luminescence of cells was measured using the same instrument set up for bioluminescence readings. In contrast to DeepBlue C coelenterazine, coelenterazine H does not lead to energy transfer to hGFP2 and thus allows us to assess to hRluc expression without hGFP2 emission quenching. When expressed as a ratio, the total hGFP2:hRluc ratio was found to be similar in each experiment, indicating stable levels of expression of each protein. Protein Analysis—Cellular and viral proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell and viral lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies that are specifically reactive with HIV-1 capsid (Zepto Metrocs Inc.) and β-actin (Sigma), reverse transcriptase (anti-RTp66/p51, National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), and rabbit antibody to human LysRS (19Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Detection of HIV proteins was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using as secondary antibody sheep anti-mouse for anti-RT, anti-capsid, and anti-β-actin and donkey anti-rabbit for anti-LysRS (Amersham Biosciences). Bands in Western blots were quantitated using the UN-SCAN-IT gel™ automated digitizing system (Silk Scientific). After BRET analysis, Western blots of cell lysates were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-V5 (Sigma) to detect LysRS C-terminally tagged with V5 and with antibody to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), obtained from Research Diagnostics. Overexpression of tRNALys in the Cell Increases the Viral Concentration of Both LysRS and RT—293T cells were transfected with a plasmid containing HIV-1 proviral DNA alone (BH10) or a plasmid containing HIV-1 proviral DNA and a gene for either tRNA3Lys (BH10Lys3) or tRNA2Lys (BH10Lys2). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of tRNA3Lys results in an increase in its packaging into the virion, with a corresponding decrease in the viral concentration of the other tRNALys isoacceptors, tRNA1Lys and tRNA2Lys, i.e. the total viral tRNALys/virion remains constant (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were purified, and Western blots of viral protein were probed with anti-RT, stripped, and reprobed with anti-CA (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis using the UN-SCAN-IT gel™ automated digitizing system indicated that there was ∼1.7 times more RT/CA in virions produced from BH10Lys3 or BH10Lys2 than in wild-type virus. This increase of RT in virions as a result of overexpression of tRNA3Lys or tRNA2Lys is not associated with an increase in the overall viral concentration of tRNALys (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that some other molecule may be responsible for the increased viral RT. Since LysRS is also selectively packaged into HIV-1 during assembly (6Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), an increase in LysRS concentration in the virus could be associated with the increase in RT. In Fig. 1B, we show that the overexpression of tRNA3Lys does in fact result in an increased concentration of viral LysRS. 293T cells were transfected with either BH10 or BH10Lys3, and Western blots of viral proteins shown in Fig. 1B were probed first with anti-LysRS and then with anti-CA. It can be seen that the overexpression of tRNA3Lys not only results in an increase in RT (Fig. 1A) but also results in an increase in the viral concentration of LysRS. The Viral Concentration of RT Is Directly Proportional to the Amount of LysRS Expressed in the Cell and Packaged into the Virion—The experiments represented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the change in the concentration of RT in the virus is directly proportional to the change in the concentration of LysRS in the cell and in the virus. Fig. 2A, left panel, shows Western blots of lysates of viruses produced from 293T cells cotransfected with the BH10 plasmid and either a vector plasmid (pcDNA3.1) or this plasmid containing the human LysRS gene (pcDNALysRS). We have previously shown that the expression of exogenous LysRS in the cell results in an approximate 2-fold increase in the viral incorporation of both major tRNALys isoacceptors and of LysRS (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) The Western blots, containing equal amounts of CAp24, were probed with anti-RT and then with anti-CA. The scanned results indicate that the direct overexpression of LysRS results in a 1.8-fold increase in the viral concentration of RT. We have reported that transfection of 293T cells with small interfering RNA specific for LysRS (siRNALysRS) will reduce the incorporation of LysRS into virions 80%, and this reduction in viral LysRS is correlated with a similar reduction in the synthesis of new LysRS in the cytoplasm (15Guo F. Cen S. Niu M. Javanbakht H. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9817-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows Western blots of lysates of viruses produced from 293T cells first transfected with either siRNALuc (specific for luciferase) or siRNALysRS and transfected 24 h later with the BH10 plasmid. Viruses were harvested 48 h after transfection of the BH10 plasmid, and the Western blots of viral protein were probed consecutively with anti-RT and anti-CA. The results, analyzed by UN-SCAN-IT gel™ automated digitizing system, indicate that the reduction in the cellular expression and viral incorporation of LysRS also results in an ∼50% decrease in the viral concentration of RT. Proteolysis of Viral Protein in the Cytoplasm Is Correlated with the Cytoplasmic Concentration of LysRS—Since LysRS and GagPol are found in the same tRNALys packaging complex, the increased concentration of viral RT due to the increased incorporation of LysRS could reflect an increased recruitment of GagPol into this complex by the excess LysRS. However, this is not likely since we have previously shown that in a protease-negative virion, overexpression of LysRS results in close to a 2-fold increase in both LysRS and tRNALys, without changing the GagPol:Gag ratio (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that LysRS inhibits premature activation of viral protease in this cytoplasmic complex. The data in Figs. 3 and 4 support this premise.Fig. 4Effect of LysRS expression upon cytoplasmic processing of a hGFP/hRLuc fusion protein. A, the HIV-1 p2/p7 protease cleavage site was fused between and in-frame with the BRET donor hRLuc2 and the BRET acceptor hGFP2 to create a hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc construct. The site of protease cleavage of Gag p2/p7 is indicated by the exclamation point in the hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc. B, Western blots of lysates of 293T cells: mock-transfected (lane 1); cotransfected with hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc and hGagPol, which expresses HIV-1 Gag and protease-positive GagPol (lanes 2–6); cotransfected with hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc, hGagPol, and increasing concentrations of pcDNALysRS (0.5, 1, or 2 μg, lanes 3–5, respectively), a vector that expresses full-length hLysRS C-terminally tagged with V5. Cell extracts were prepared at 40 h after transfection. 40 mg of total protein, containing approximately equal amounts of GAPDH, was loaded in each well, and expression levels of V5-tagged LysRS were detected using a rabbit anti-V5 antibody. Lanes 6–8 represent 293T cells cotransfected with hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc and hGagPolDFSDPR, a plasmid coding for protease-negative GagPol (lane 6), hRLuc alone (lane 7), or hGFP2 alone (lane 8). C, BRET analysis of HIV-1 protease activity. The average BRET ratios are the means ± standard deviations of experiments performed three or more times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 shows Western blots of lysates of 293T cells that have been cotransfected with a plasmid coding for either protease-positive HIV-1 DNA (A and C, BH10) or protease-negative HIV-1 DNA (B and D, BH10P–) and a second plasmid or small interfering RNA that will alter the expression of cytoplasmic LysRS. Western blots were probed with anti-CA, anti-RT, anti-LysRS, or anti-β-actin. In A and B, the second plasmid is either the vector alone (pcDNA3.1) or this vector containing the gene for LysRS (pcDNALysRS). The results in A, which are quantitated in E, show that there is less proteolysis of viral proteins upon overexpression of LysRS in the cytoplasm, i.e. the cytoplasmic Gag/CA and GagPol/RT ratios are ∼4.5- and 8-fold greater, respectively, when the LysRS/actin ratio is increased. B is a control showing the cytoplasmic viral protein pattern when no viral protease is present. The cells represented in C and D have been transfected with either siRNALuc or siRNALysRS as well as either BH10 (C) or BH10P– (D). The results in C, which are quantitated in E, show that there is more proteolysis of viral proteins when the concentration of cytoplasmic LysRS is decreased, i.e. when the LysRS/β-actin ratio is reduced ∼90%, the cytoplasmic Gag/CA and GagPol/RT ratios are reduced ∼80–85%. D is again a control showing the cytoplasmic viral protein pattern when no viral protease is present, indicating that the proteolysis of the viral proteins is not due to the activation of cellular proteases due to the reduced LysRS in the cell. Effect of LysRS Expression on Viral Protease Activity Using BRET Analysis—We next examined the effect of LysRS concentration upon HIV-1 protease activity using BRET to assay for HIV-1 protease activity in living cells (13Hu K. Clement J.F. Abrahamyan L. Strebel K. Bouvier M. Kleiman L. Mouland A. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). BRET analysis has been used to study Gag binding partners in HIV-1, homo- and heterodimerization of integral membrane receptors, protein-protein interactions during transcription, and more recently, in an ubiquitination biosensor assay (16Chatel-Chaix L.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The assay takes advantage of the physical distance between a donor and acceptor molecule, and when these are within close proximity (between 10–100 Å), a resonance energy transfer (RET) occurs between the donor and acceptor pair. To initiate this reaction, a membrane soluble coelenterazine, DeepBlueC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), is added to cells in culture. In the presence of oxygen, humanized sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase (hRLuc) catalyzes the DeepBlueC into coelenteramide with concomitant light emission (l1em = 395 nm). The acceptor of this emission is a codon-optimized (humanized) green fluorescent protein 2 (hGFP2) that is engineered to maximally absorb l1em. Excitation of hGFP2 by RET results in an emission of green light (l2em=510nm). The broad spectral emission spectra exhibited by these molecules enable a straightforward ratiometric calculation (16Chatel-Chaix L. Clement J.F. Martel C. Beriault V. Gatignol A. Des-Groseillers L.

To determine whether LysRS expression affects viral protease activity in live cells, the amino acids that encode the p2/p7 protease cleavage site in Pr55Gag were fused in-frame with the donor protein, hRLuc, and the acceptor protein, hGFP2, to create hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc (Fig. 4A). 293T cells were cotransfected with this construct, a plasmid coding for codon-optimized protease-positive Gag and GagPol (hGagPol (22Huang Y. Kong W.-P. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)), and increasing amounts of pcDNALysRS. 40 h after transfection, cells were exposed to the membrane-diffusible substrate for luciferase, DeepBlueC, and analyzed by BRET. After BRET analysis, cells were lysed, and Western blots of cell lysates were probed with anti-V5 and anti-GAPDH to show the increased ratio of LysRS/GAPDH (Fig. 4B). BRET analysis is shown in Fig. 4C. A close association between hGFP2 and hRLuc will result in a maximum BRET ratio (lane 6). However, if hGFP2 and hRLuc are separated as a result of cleavage by the viral protease, there will be a decreased BRET ratio (lane 2). Fig. 4C shows that the BRET ratio increases with increasing cellular concentrations of LysRS (lanes 2–5), indicating the inhibition of hGFP2/hRLuc cleavage. Fig. 4C, lanes 6–8, represent control experiments in which cells are either cotransfected with the plasmid coding for hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc and a plasmid (hGagPolΔFSΔPR (22Huang Y. Kong W.-P. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) coding for protease-negative codon-optimized GagPol (lane 6), hRLuc alone (lane 7), or hGFP2 alone (lane 8). The BRET ratio is maximal when no cleavage occurs (lane 6), and in this experiment, the ratio is reduced by 60% when only endogenous levels of LysRS are expressed (lane 2). Thus, these BRET data also indicate that LysRS has an inhibitory effect upon viral protease activity. GagPol incorporated into the assembling Gag particle through its interaction with Gag (3Park J. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Smith A.J. Srivivasakumar N. Hammarskjöld M.-L. Rekosh D. J.

Hammarskjöld M.-L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6106-6114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of GagPol at the cell membrane is believed to facilitate the concentration of GagPol molecules, allowing for GagPol dimerization, a prerequisite to protease activation. Premature dimerization of GagPol at the wrong cellular site could result in the production of processed viral proteins that will not take part in viral assembly. GagPol interacts with multimeric Gag (5Khorchid A. Halwani R. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and because pre-plasma membrane complexes of Gag/GagPol may exist in the cytoplasm, means may be necessary for preventing premature protease dimerization and activation in such complexes until they reach the proper cellular compartment. Our data indicated that the interaction between Gag and GagPol is not sufficient to prevent premature protease activation and that another member of the assembly complex, LysRS, may also help stabilize GagPol protease during the transition to the plasma membrane. In the virion, estimates for Gag are ∼1500–1800 molecules/virion (1Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar), and based on estimated differences in translation rates of Gag and GagPol, there may be ∼150–200 molecules of GagPol. This is considerably more than the estimated of 20–25 molecules LysRS/virion (25Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and unsaturated LysRS binding sites may exist in the Gag/GagPol/RNA complex. The overexpression of LysRS results in an approximate 2-fold increase in LysRS incorporation into HIV-1 (20Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) without any increase in GagPol incorporation (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the limited increase in LysRS packaging may reflect either limited cellular LysRS overexpression or some other limiting factor. These results suggest that within the experimental conditions used here (such as overproduction of virions), there may exist in the cell multiple assembly complexes of varying stabilities due to limiting amounts of cellular factors such as LysRS. The mechanism by which LysRS blocks proteolytic activity is not known. It could be inhibiting the viral protease activity generally, or it could act to block access to cleavage sites by the protease. The first cleavage is believed to occur at the p2/NCp7 site (26Pettit S.C. Everitt L.E. Choudhury S. Dunn B.M. Kaplan A.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8477-8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the site examined by BRET. Although it is clear that proteolytic activity at later cleavage sites is also inhibited (such as the ones producing mature CAp24 and RTp66/p51), later cleavages might be prevented as a result of preventing the first cleavage. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that the relatively small number of LysRS molecules associated with virions could directly protect the much larger number of cleavage sites or protease molecules. We have been unable to detect an interaction between Pol and LysRS using coimmunoprecipitation studies (data not shown), and we suggest that the most likely cause of inhibition of protease activity may be changes induced by LysRS in the GagPol conformation, which might result in either inhibiting protease activity or blocking one or more cleavage sites in GagPol. The changes observed in the RT incorporation into virions induced by alterations in the cellular concentration of LysRS (Fig. 2) are consistent but not large. Increases and decreases in cellular LysRS cause increases and decreases in the RT/CAp24 ratios of 1.77 and 0.56, respectively. On the other hand, the data in Fig. 3 show that the cellular concentration of LysRS has a much larger influence on the amount of Gag or GagPol processed in the cytoplasm. Thus, a 5-fold increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of LysRS produces a 4.6- and 7.8-fold increase in the Gag/CAp24 and GagPol/p66 ratios, respectively. Similarly, an almost 10-fold decrease in cytoplasmic LysRS shows a 4- and 5-fold decrease in Gag/CAp24 and GagPol/p66 ratios, respectively. Thus, an increase in the amount of premature processing of GagPol may have less effect upon the amount of RT incorporated into virions (i.e. RT/CAp24) because there is also less Gag produced. Thus, the data obtained from the Western blots shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate inhibition of viral protease activity by LysRS, and as shown in Fig. 4, this conclusion is supported using a very different experimental technique, BRET. In this technique, HIV-1 protease activity is detected by its ability to act upon the cleavage site between Gag p2 and p7 that is present in the hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc molecule, thus separating donor hRLuc from acceptor hGFP2. Since there is no evidence that this molecule can be packaged into virions, it is implied that it is the cleaved viral protease, free of the Gag/GagPol complex, that is acting upon hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc. Other work has shown that the infectivity of the HIV-1 population increases 2.5–3-fold when LysRS and tRNALys are overexpressed in the cell. The viral population increases its incorporation of LysRS and tRNALys, and there is also an increase in tRNA3Lys annealing to viral RNA (11Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although this increase in tRNA3Lys annealing had been thought to be the prime factor responsible for the increased infectivity, it is now clear that other factors, such as the decreased premature proteolysis of Gag and GagPol studied here, may also contribute to increased infectivity of the viral population."

Forexample, coronary artery SMC are derived from proepicardial cells(1Landerholm T.E. Dong X.R. Lu J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W.

With these diverseorigins, it is likely that distinct nuclear factors are involved in regulatingsmooth muscle development and differentiation in different smooth muscletissues. Differentiated smooth muscles are characterized by the presence of a set ofunique isoforms of contractile proteins, ion channels, and signaling moleculesthat are necessary for the contractile properties of the tissue. Severalgroups have investigated the mechanisms regulating the expression of uniquesmooth muscle-specific isoforms of contractile proteins, and experiments usingtransgenic mice have identified minimal promoter regions that are necessary tomediate smooth muscle-specific expression of several of these genes. Forexample, studies have demonstrated that a 16-kb fragment of the smooth musclemyosin heavy chain extending from -4.2 to +11.6 kb(7Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I.

In addition, transgenesdriven by 435 bp of the proximal SM22α promoter, although not mimickingendogenous SM22α expression, were restricted to arterial SMC in adultmice(12Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B.

Progress has also beenmade in identifying some of the major transcription factors that regulate theexpression of smooth muscle-specific genes, although their tissue-specificroles have, thus far, been poorly defined. Transcription factors identified toregulate smooth muscle-specific genes include serum response factor (SRF),myocyte enhancer factor 2B (MEF2B), MEF2C, myocardin, myocardin-relatedfactor-A (MRTFA, MLK1, MAL), GATA family members, GATA 4/5/6, Krupple-likezinc finger proteins such as Sp1/3, BTEB3, single-stranded DNA-bindingproteins Purα and Purβ, and homeodomain proteins such as Gax, Hex,Nkx3.1, Nkx3.2, Barx1b, Barx2b, and Hoxb7 (for review, see Refs.15Kumar M.S.

Homeodomain (Hox)-containing transcription factors play a crucial role inorganogenesis and pattern formation during embryogenesis and regulateproliferation, differentiation, and migration in multiple cell types(17Lorentz O. Duluc I. Arcangelis A.D. Simon-Assmann P. Kedinger M. Freund J.N. J. CellBiol. 1997; 139: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, expressionof these proteins often persists in adult tissues where they play a role incell type specification. Homeobox genes were first identified inDrosophila as genes whose mutations caused body segmenttransformation, or homeotic transformation(18Forlani S. Lawson K.A. Deschamps J. Development. 2003; 130: 3807-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Homeobox genes encodeevolutionary conserved transcription factors with a common 60-amino acidDNA-binding motif that folds into three α-helices and is referred to asthe homeodomain (19Santini S. Boore J.L. Meyer A. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Inaddition to the clustered Hox genes, there are many additional proteins inmammals which contain a homeodomain and play important roles in development.Several of these homeodomain proteins, including Mhox(Prx1), Nkx3.1, Barx1b,and Barx2, have been proposed to play a role in regulating expression ofsmooth muscle genes through their ability to interact with SRF and promote itsDNA binding activity(20Carson J.A.

Circ.Res. 2001; 88: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For example, thehomeodomain protein Gax is expressed at high levels in differentiated vascularsmooth muscle, and its expression is down-regulated during phenotypicmodulation and dedifferentiation. It has also been shown that Gax is importantto induce cell cycle arrest in vascular SMC through its activation of p21CIP-1(25Smith R.C. Branellec D. Gorski D.H. Guo K. Perlman H. Dedieu J.F. Pastore C. Mahfoudi A. Denefle P. Isner J.M. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1674-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Several other Hox genes,including HOXA5, HOXA11, HOXB1, HOXB7, and HOXC9 were foundto be expressed in fetal human vascular SMC, of these only Hoxb7 andHoxa11 were detected in adult mouse smooth muscle tissues (inintestine and uterus, respectively)(26Miano J.M. Firulli A.B. Olson E.N. Hara P. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1996; 93: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hoxa2, Hoxa4, Hoxa5, andHoxb7 have been cloned from an adult rat vascular smooth muscle cDNA library,although the functions of these proteins were not determined in this study(27Gorski D.H. Walsh K. Circ.Res. 2000; 87: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Hoxb7 hasbeen shown to increase expression of SM22α in 10T1/2 cells(28Bostrom K. Tintut Y. Kao S.C. Stanford W.P. Demer L.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Clustered Hox genes havebeen shown to be important for vascular development and have been implicatedin several pathological processes such as arterial restenosis after balloondilatation, and abnormal expression of homeobox genes has also been found tocontribute to infertility and sterility in humans(29Taylor H.S. Bagot C. Kardana A. Olive D. Arici A. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 14: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although Hox proteins have been implicated in the regulation of smoothmuscle differentiation, the downstream targets of these proteins are poorlydefined. To elucidate further the role of Hox genes in adult SMC, we useddegenerate RT-PCR and cDNA library screening to identify Hox proteinsexpressed in the smooth muscle of adult mouse bladder and then examine therole of these proteins in regulating smooth muscle-specific genes. Clonesencoding Hoxa10 and Hoxb8 were isolated from this screen. Reporter genecotransfection studies demonstrated that Hoxa10-1 activated the smoothmuscle-specific telokin promoter in fibroblasts. siRNA-mediated knock-down ofHoxa10-1 demonstrated that Hoxa10-1 plays an important physiological role inactivating telokin expression in SMC. In contrast, Hoxb8 repressed the telokinpromoter and several other smooth muscle-specific promoters in vascular SMC.Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated binding of Hoxa10-1, Hoxa10-2, andHoxb8 to four AT-rich regions in the telokin promoter. One of these regionsincludes the CArG box. which binds SRF, and Hox binding to this region isabolished by SRF binding. Mutational analysis of the telokin promoter revealedthat each of the other three AT-rich regions in the telokin promoter isrequired for Hoxa10-1 and Hoxb8 to regulate telokin promoter activity. Takentogether, these data demonstrated a critical role of clustered homeodomainproteins in regulating smooth muscle-specific genes. RT-PCR and cDNA Library Screening—Total RNA was isolatedfrom mouse bladder using a single step guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure.mRNA was isolated from total RNA using magnetic oligo(dT) beads (Invitrogen).Prior to use poly(A)+ mRNA was treated with DNase to remove genomicDNA contamination. cDNA was generated from poly(A)+ mRNA usingrandom primers and murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. Hox cDNA wasthen amplified by PCR using degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotides(Hox sense, CTRGARCTRGARAARGARTTYCAYTT; and Hox antisense,RTTYTGRAACCARATYTTWACYTG), derived from helix 1 and 3 of the Hox domain. PCRwas carried out for 35 cycles, using an annealing temperature of 51 °C.Gel-purified PCR products were then used as probes to screen a mouse bladdercDNA library in λgt11. Library filters were hybridized overnight at 65°C with a 32P-labeled probe. Filters were washed in 2 ×SSPE (0.36 m NaCl, 0.02 m NaH2PO4,and 0.002 m EDTA, pH 7.7) + 1.0% SDS at room temperature for 15min, 2 × SSPE + 1.0% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min followed by 0.2 ×SSPE + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. λ-DNA was isolated usingLambdasorb (Promega, Madison, WI), digested with EcoRI, and the resultingfragments were subcloned into pGEM 7Z (Promega) and sequenced by automatedsequencing. Construction of Hoxa10, Hoxb8, and Hoxb7 Mammalian ExpressionVectors—The Hoxa10-1 cDNA isolated from the λ libraryextended from base 206 through 2450 and was thus missing 198 bp of5′-coding sequence. To generate a full-length clone, a 603-bp fragmentat the 5′-end of the Hoxa10 gene was amplified from genomic DNA usingPCR. Oligonucleotides were created from the published Hoxa10 sequence. Theamplified 5′-end was joined to the 3′-portion of Hoxa10-1 cDNA ata common SacII restriction site to generate full-length cDNA. The full-lengthHoxa10-1 was ligated into the pcDNA3 HisC mammalian expression vector(Invitrogen). The integrity of cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. The codingregion of Hoxa10-2 was amplified by PCR from the cDNAs isolated from thebladder cDNA library and cloned in-frame into a modified pShuttle vector(Clontech) that included an amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag. Becausethe Hoxb8 clones isolated from our library did not contain the entire codingsequence, a 740-bp fragment of mouse Hoxb8, including the entire codingregion, was isolated by RT coupled to PCR from mouse bladder mRNA. RT wasperformed using random primers and SuperScript reverse transcriptase(Invitrogen). PCR was then performed using Deep Vent DNA polymerase and thefollowing Hoxb8-specific primers: sense, actcagaatgagctcttatttcgtcaactc;antisense, aggatcctacttcttgtcacccttctgcgcatc. After sequence confirmation theHoxb8 coding region was cloned in-frame into pcDNAHisC (Invitrogen) orpShuttle (Clontech) for expression experiments. A Hoxb7 cDNA was amplifiedfrom Image clone 4413080 (Invitrogen) and ligated into the pShuttle expressionvector (Clontech). Reporter Gene Constructs—Promoter-luciferase constructs weregenerated in the pGL2BorpGL3B luciferase vectors(Promega) as described previously(10Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am.J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter fragments usedwere -256 to +147 of the rabbit telokin promoter (T400(10Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am.J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), -4,200 to +11,600 ofthe smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene(7Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K.

Circ.Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), -435 to +60 of theSM22α gene (11Hoggatt A.M. Simon G.M. Herring B.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and-113 to +20 of thymidine kinase gene (TK). For mutational analysis of thetelokin promoter, deletion of the AT-rich regions was generated using a -82 to+82 fragment of the mouse telokin promoter as a template. All mutant reportergene constructs were initially generated in pCRBlunt vector (Invitrogen) by aQuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and then transferred to thepGL2B luciferase reporter vector. The resultant plasmids weresequenced to verify the integrity of the insert. Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Plasmids weretransfected into A10 vascular SMC and 10T1/2 embryonic fibroblast cells usingFuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 10T1/2 cells were grown in high glucoseDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Roche Applied Science) containing 5units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. A10cells were grown in the same medium, but fetal bovine serum was increased to20%. A10 smooth muscle and 10T1/2 fibroblast cells were seeded at a density of2.5 × 104/well in a 24-well plate. 16–18 h postseedingcells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and replacedwith 0.5 ml of complete medium. Cells were then incubated with a total of 1μg of plasmid DNA (0.25 μg of promoter-pGL2B, 0.5 μg ofvarious expression plasmids or empty vectors, and 0.25 μg ofpRLTK-Renilla luciferase as an internal control) and 2 μl ofFuGENE 6 in 50 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 24 h aftertransfection, extracts (100 μl/well) were prepared for measurement ofluciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay as described by themanufacturer (Promega). The level of firefly luciferase activity wasnormalized to the control Renilla luciferase activity. Measurementswere made from a minimum of six independent transfections, and all assays wererepeated at least twice. Results were reported as the mean ± S.E., andall variables were analyzed by t test, and significance was set atp ≤ 0.01. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays wereconducted in a 15-μl final volume. 0.2 ng (15 × 103counts/min) of 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe was added tothe binding mix. The binding mix also contained 200 ng of poly(dI-dC), 4.5μg of bovine serum albumin, and different amounts of recombinant proteindiluted in binding buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1mm dithiothreitol, as needed. The mix was incubated for 15 min atroom temperature during the binding reaction. For antibody supershift assays,incubations were extended for 1 additional h on ice, after the addition of theappropriate antibody. Antibodies used were anti-MEF2α, SRF, Omni, andSP1, obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-hemagglutinin,obtained from Covance (Richmond, CA). In addition, unlabeled double-strandedDNA probes were used as competitors in some experiment as indicated in thefigure legends. The sequences of the sense strand of each probe used in gelmobility shift experiments were as follows: -90 to -53 core wild type probethat encompasses the -80 to -67 5′-AT-rich region and -65 to -56 CArGbox, 5′-GCTTTATATAAACTATCCCTTTTATGGGAGCT-3′; -90 to -67 probe thatencompass the -80 to -67 5′-AT-rich region,5′-CGATCTGCAGTTGCTTTATATAAACTAT-3′; -69 to -55 CArG probe,5′-CGATATCCCTTTTATGGG-3′; -2 to +23 region that encompasses the +2to +6 3′-AT-rich region and the +14 to +17 region,5′-ACTGTCACATTAACTCGCACATCAGTTCCA-3′; -2 to +23 region with +14 to+17 deleted, 5′-CATGCACATTAACTCGCACGTTCCA-3′; -2 to +23 regionwith +2 to +6 deleted, 5′-CATGCACCTCGCACATCAGTTCCA-3′; -2 to +35region with +2 to +6 and +14 to +17 mutations,5′-ACTGTCACGCGCGCTCGCACGTCGGTTCCAGAACCCATTCCA-3′; AP2,5′-CCGATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′; core wild type CArG mut (-90to -53), 5′-GCTTTATATAAACTATCCCTTTTCTACGAGCT-3′; -68 to -48 probewith CArG mut, 5′-CGATATCCCTTTTCTACGAGCTGAA-3′. Annealedoligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]-dCTP by Klenow DNApolymerase. Free [α-32P]dCTP was removed by agarose gelelectrophoresis. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresisthrough 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 6.5 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 3.3mm sodium acetate, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol.The gel was then dried and exposed to photographic film with intensifyingscreens at -80 °C. Protein Expression and Western Blotting—For preparation ofextracts for gel mobility shift assays COS cells were plated at a density of1.8 × 106/100-mm dish. 16–20 h postplating, cells weretransfected with appropriate expression plasmids using FuGENE 6. 16 μg ofplasmid and 32 μl of FuGENE 6 were used for each dish of cells. 24 hpost-transfection cells were washed three times on ice with rinsing buffercontaining 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.15m NaCl. COS cells were then scraped in 1 ml of rinsing buffer andtransferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were collected by centrifugationand resuspended in 200 μl of resuspension buffer mix containing 40mm HEPES, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.02 mg/mlleupeptin. The cells were then lysed by freeze thawing three times, thelysates clarified by centrifugation for 5 min, and the supernatant was storedat -80 °C in aliquots. Protein concentrations were determined using theBradford protein determination method. The expression of recombinant proteinswas verified by Western blotting as described previously(21Herring B.P. Kriegel A.M. Hoggatt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription Coupled to PCR—Total RNA was isolatedas described previously (30Zhou J. Herring B.P. J.Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).400 ng of RNA template was used for RT and PCR with specific primers using theSuperScript One-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). Unique primers were designedfor Hoxa10-1, telokin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase asfollows: Hoxa10-1 sense, 5′-AGCGAGTCCTAGACTCCACGCCACC-3′, andantisense, 5′-TCACTTGTCTGTCCGTGAGGTGGACG-3′, yielding a 339-bpproduct; telokin sense, 5′-GACACCGCCTGAGTCCAACCTCCG-3′, andantisense, 5′-GGCTTTTCCTCAGCAACAGCCTCC-3′, yielding a 214-bpproduct; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense,5′-GCAGTGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC-3′, and antisense,5′-GGAGATGATGACCCTTTTGGCTCCAC-3′, yielding a 294-bp product. Adenovirus-mediated Expression of siRNA Directed against Hoxa10—A plasmid-based system for the production of siRNA was generatedby inserting oligonucleotides specific to Hoxa10-1 CAATGTCATGCTCGGAGAGdownstream of an H1 promoter in the adenoviral shuttle vectorpRNAT-H1.1/Shuttle (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). This shuttle vector iscompatible with the Adeno-X adenoviral system Clontech and was used togenerate adenovirus expressing the siRNA as described previously(30Zhou J. Herring B.P. J.Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For adenoviralinfection, primary mouse uterine and colonic SMC were prepared as describedpreviously (31Yin F. Herring B.P. J. Biol.Chem. 2005; 280: 4745-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), seeded in6-well plates, and allow to grow to a density of 2–2.5 ×105 cells/well. Primary cells were washed with phosphate-bufferedsaline and infected with Hoxa10-1 siRNA or control siRNA adenovirus inphosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at 37 °C. 72 h after infection proteinextracts were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1%Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 2mm EDTA, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) containingprotease inhibitors. Protein concentrations of the extracts were determinedusing the BCA protein assay. For RT-PCR analysis total RNA was extracted usingTRIzol reagent as described previously(30Zhou J. Herring B.P. J.Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10861-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hoxa10 and Hoxb8 Are Expressed in Adult Mouse Bladder—RT-PCR, using degenerate oligonucleotides prepared to the first and thirdα-helixes of the conserved homeodomain of mouse Hox genes, amplified a110-bp fragment from mRNA isolated from mouse bladder. The cDNAs present inthis fragment were gel purified and used as probes to screen a λgt11cDNA library generated from mouse bladder. Five different positive clones wereobtained from the library screen, three represented Hoxa10, and tworepresented Hoxb8. Each of the Hoxa10 clones represented a distinct isoform.The Hoxa10-1 clone obtained was 2,244 bp and extended from 206–2450 ofthe published mouse Hoxa10-1 sequence. This clone was missing 198 bp of the5′-coding sequence, hence, PCR was used to obtain the missing5′-end and generate a full-length Hoxa10-1 expression construct asdescribed under “Experimental Procedures.” A 1,600-bp cloneencoding the entire coding sequence of Hoxa10-2 and a 752-bp fragment ofHoxa10-3 was obtained. Hoxb8 clones were 317 bp and ∼1,067 bp, extendingfrom 1,539 to 1,856 and from 1,440 to 2,507 bp, respectively, of the publishedHoxb8 cDNA. A full-length Hoxb8 coding region (1,059–1,787) was isolatedby RT-PCR using mouse bladder mRNA as a template as described under“Experimental Procedures.” Hoxa10 and Hoxb8 mRNA Are Expressed at a High Level in Adult SmoothMuscle Tissues and Cells—RNase protection analysis of total RNAisolated from adult mouse tissues revealed expression of Hoxa10-1 at highlevels in uterus and bladder and at lower levels in colon, kidney, skeletalmuscle, and aorta (Fig.1A). Hoxa10-1 was also detected in intestinal SMC (colonSMC) (Fig. 1A). RNaseprotection analysis of Hoxa10-2 expression showed that Hoxa10-2 is expressedin a pattern similar to that of Hoxa10-1 with the exception that Hoxa10-2 butnot Hoxa10-1 was detected in A10 vascular SMC(Fig. 1, A andB). RNase protection analysis revealed high levels ofHoxb8 mRNA in uterus, colon, and kidney and lower levels in bladder and aorta(Fig. 1C). Inaddition, RT-PCR data indicated that Hoxb8 is also expressed in primaryuterine SMC and a colon smooth muscle cell line(Fig. 1D). Hoxa10-1 Activates and Hoxb8 Represses Smooth Muscle-specificPromoters—To determine whether Hoxa10 and Hoxb8 directly regulatethe expression of smooth muscle-restricted proteins, expression constructswere cotransfected together with smooth muscle-specific promoter reportergenes into A10 vascular smooth muscle and 10T1/2 fibroblast cells, and theeffects on luciferase activity were determined. Results from these experimentsdemonstrated that in 10T1/2 cells Hoxa10-1 increased the activity of thetelokin promoter 3-fold without affecting the activity of the other promotersanalyzed (Fig. 2A).Similar results were also observed in A10 SMC (data not shown). In contrast,Hoxb8 significantly repressed the activity of the telokin, smooth muscleα-actin, and SM22α promoters by 70, 50, and 70%, respectively,without significantly altering the activity of the smooth muscle myosin or TKkinase promoters in A10 cells (Fig.2B). Hoxb8 had little effect on the activity of thesepromoters in 10T1/2 cells (data not shown). In contrast to Hoxa10-1, Hoxa10-2had no significant effect on telokin promoter activity in 10T1/2 cells(Fig. 2C) and resultedin a 30% reduction of promoter activity in A10 cells(Fig. 2D). Sequenceanalysis indicated that Hoxa10-3 does not encode for a homeodomain protein,and the protein product of this mRNA has not been defined, hence Hoxa10-3 wasnot pursued further in this study. Because Hoxb7 has also been suggested toplay a role in regulating smooth muscle-specific genes we also examined theef"
https://openalex.org/W1978180365,"We have identified four mutations in Xenopus TFIIIA that increase the stability of TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene complexes. In each case, the mutation has a relatively modest effect on equilibrium binding affinity. In three cases, these equilibrium binding effects can be ascribed primarily to decreases in the rate constant for protein-DNA complex dissociation. In the fourth case, however, a substitution of phenylalanine for the wild-type leucine at position 148 in TFIIIA results in much larger compensating changes in the kinetics of complex assembly and dissociation. The data support a model in which a relatively unstable population of complexes with multi-component dissociation kinetics forms rapidly; complexes then undergo a slow conformational change that results in very stable, kinetically homogeneous TFIIIA-DNA complexes. The L148F mutant protein acts as a particularly potent transcriptional activator when it is fused to the VP16 activation domain and expressed in yeast cells. Substitution of L148 to tyrosine or tryptophan produces an equally strong transcriptional activator. Substitution to histidine results in genetic and biochemical effects that are more modest than, but similar to, those observed with the L148F mutation. We propose that an amino acid with a planar side chain at position 148 can intercalate between adjacent base pairs in the intermediate element of the 5 S rRNA gene. Intercalation occurs slowly but results in a very stable DNA-protein complex. These results suggest that transcriptional activation by a cis-acting sequence element is largely dependent on the kinetic, rather than the thermodynamic, stability of the complex formed with an activator protein. Thus, transcriptional activation is dependent in large part on the lifetime of the activator-DNA complex rather than on binding site occupancy at steady state.

TFIIIA 1The abbreviations used are: TFIIIA, transcription factor IIIA; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside.

We have described previously a method for the genetic analysis of the Xenopus TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene interaction (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Setzer D.R. Schulman D.B. Bumbulis M.J. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 431-449PubMed Google Scholar). In this approach, the Xenopus 5 S rRNA gene substitutes for the natural upstream activating sequence in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYC1 promoter which, in turn, controls expression of the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene in yeast cells. Transcriptional activity from the CYC1 core promoter is dependent upon binding of an artificial activator Xenopus TFIIIA fused to the transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein from the herpes simplex virus (18Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 19Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this system, the level of β-galactosidase activity is dependent on the affinity or, as we show in this manuscript, the kinetic stability of the Xenopus TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene complex (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because β-galactosidase activity in vivo can be assessed readily using X-gal indicator plates, screening large numbers of randomly mutagenized forms of TFIIIA for those mutants with altered DNA binding affinity or specificity is relatively straightforward (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Setzer D.R. Schulman D.B. Bumbulis M.J. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 431-449PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we have already described a number of mutant forms of TFIIIA that form complexes with the 5 S rRNA gene that are less stable than is the case with the wild-type protein (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the isolation, using this genetic system, of several mutant forms of TFIIIA that interact with the 5 S rRNA gene to form complexes that are more stable than is the case with wild-type TFIIIA. One of these variant proteins is particularly interesting in that it exhibits only a small increase in equilibrium binding affinity, but the rates of both DNA binding and dissociation are reduced greatly in comparison to the wild-type or other gain-of-function mutants. A more detailed analysis of various amino acid substitutions at the site mutated in this kinetically altered form of TFIIIA suggests that the kinetic effects result from intercalation of a planar amino acid side chain between adjacent base pairs in the DNA helix. The fact that the ability of these variant proteins to activate transcription by RNA polymerase II correlates with kinetic and not equilibrium binding properties also suggests an unorthodox mechanism whereby transcriptional activators stimulate transcription by RNA polymerase II. Genetic Screen—The genetic screen used to isolate the mutant forms of TFIIIA discussed in this paper has been described previously (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Setzer D.R. Schulman D.B. Bumbulis M.J. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 431-449PubMed Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Fig. 1. Error-prone PCR using primers GP5 and VP3 along with pG1-803 as a template was used to generate pools of mutant TFIIIA sequences. These were introduced via homologous recombination into pG1-803 that had been doubly cut with SacI and SalI. The recombination event occurred after co-transformation with both gapped pG1-803 and the error-prone PCR product into strain BJ2168 containing the plasmid pY25SR-Z. After selection of transformants on C-Ura-Trp plates, β-galactosidase activity was assessed by replica plating onto SSX-Ura-Trp plates. Four colonies that were darker blue than was the case with pG1-803 (wild-type TFIIIA) were chosen for further analysis, and viable cells were recovered from the original transformation plate. The TRP1 plasmids were recovered from these strains and used to transform E. coli. After further recovery from E. coli, these pG1-803 variants were used to transform BJ2168 containing pY25SR-Z, and the β-galactosidase phenotype was again assayed on X-gal plates to confirm that the elevated β-galactosidase activity was plasmid-dependent. We used Western blots with a polyclonal rabbit anti-TFIIIA antibody to measure the level of variant TFIIIA-VP16 expression in the TRP1+URA3+ yeast strains to ensure that the expression level was similar to that observed with wild-type TFIIIA-VP16. Finally, the TFIIIA moiety of the pG1-803 variants was sequenced to determine the amino acid changes responsible for the elevated transcriptional activity of the reporter gene. Measurement of β-Galactosidase Activity—We used a variation of the method of Kippert (20Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) to measure β-galactosidase activity in yeast cells. Cells were grown in C-Ura-Trp to an A600 of 0.5–1.0 (∼7–21 × 106 cells/ml) and pelleted from 4 ml of this culture. After washing one time in 4 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and resuspending the resulting pellet in 4 ml of the same buffer, the A600 of a 1-ml aliquot was determined. A 200-μl aliquot of the resuspended cells was then added to 400 μl of Z buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium Sarkosyl. After 30 min at 30 °C, 150 μl of a 4 mg/ml solution of o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactoside in Z buffer was added, and the incubation continued at 30 °C until a yellow color developed. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of Na2CO3 (1 m), and insoluble material was pelleted by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge. Absorbance of the supernatant at 420 nm was measured relative to that from a control reaction mixture containing no yeast cells. Units of β-galactosidase activity were determined according to Equation 1,Units=[(A420)1000]/[(A600)Vt ](Eq. 1) where V is the volume (in milliliters) of washed and resuspended yeast cells added to the reaction mixture, t is the time (in minutes) of the incubation after addition of o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactoside, A420 is the absorbance at 420 nm after stopping the reaction with Na2CO3, and A600 is apparent absorbance of the yeast cell suspension after resuspending in Z buffer. All assays were performed in triplicate using independent yeast cultures, and triplicate assays were repeated on different days a total of three times. Thus, nine independent determinations were used for each reported β-galactosidase activity measurement. Relative activities were determined by normalizing to the level of activity measured for BJ2168 containing pY5SR-Z and pG1-803 (wild-type TFIIIA-VP16). Saturation Mutagenesis of Residue 148—Overlap extension PCR was used to generate a population of Xenopus TFIIIA-encoding DNA fragments in which the nucleotide sequence for codon 148 was randomized. Specifically, two initial amplifications were performed using pG1-803 as a template. One made use of primers GP5 (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and an antisense oligonucleotide (L148X-AS) containing wild-type sequence flanking codon 148, but with the three nucleotides of codon 148 being synthesized as a random mixture. The second amplification used primer VP3 (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the reverse complement of L148X-AS, that is, the corresponding TFIIIA sense sequence with a randomized codon 148 (L148X-S). The products of these two PCRs were gel-purified and used as templates in a single amplification reaction containing primers GP5 and VP3. The product of this reaction was also gel-purified and used in combination with the large SacI/SalI fragment of pG1-803 to transform yeast strain BJ2168 containing either plasmid pY5SR-Z or pY25SR-Z (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). URA+TRP+ transformants were selected on C-Ura-Trp plates and replica-plated onto SSX-Ura-Trp. Colonies were selected based on their color in comparison to control strains containing pG1-803 (expressing wild-type TFIIIA-VP16) or pG1 (expressing no TFIIIA-VP16) in addition to the relevant reporter plasmid (pY5SR-Z or pY25SR-Z). The TRP1-containing plasmid was recovered, cycled through E. coli, and used to transform BJ2168 containing pY25SR-Z. The β-galactosidase phenotypes of these strains were confirmed on SSX-Ura-Trp plates. The TFIIIA-encoding DNA sequences of the plasmids of interest were then determined. Equilibrium Binding Constants and Dissociation Rate Constants— Mutant TFIIIA-encoding sequences of interest were introduced into pTA105 (11Kehres D.G. Subramanyan G.S. Hung V.S. Rogers Jr., G.W. Setzer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20152-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli (21Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These proteins were then purified through the BioRex 70 column step using standard methods (11Kehres D.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding of TFIIIA to the Xenopus borealis somatic type 5 S rRNA gene was assayed using an established electrophoretic mobility shift assay (10Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Kehres D.G. Subramanyan G.S. Hung V.S. Rogers Jr., G.W. Setzer D.R. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding constants were determined by carrying out a set of binding reactions containing various concentrations of a restriction fragment containing the 5 S rRNA gene and a fixed concentration of TFIIIA. The fraction of DNA bound in each case was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and Scatchard analysis was used to extract the Kd. Analysis of covariance was used to combine results from multiple independent determinations and arrive at a single best estimate of the Kd with an associated S.E. These methods have been described in detail elsewhere (10Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Kehres D.G. Subramanyan G.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dissociation rate constants for wild-type and mutant TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene complexes were also determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to distinguish protein-bound DNA from free DNA. Binding reaction mixtures typically contained 0.1–1.0 nm labeled DNA and sufficient TFIIIA to achieve 60–80% DNA bound at equilibrium. These mixtures were preincubated to allow formation of DNA-protein complexes, and the dissociation of these complexes was then assayed as a function of time after the addition of an unlabeled DNA trap. Data were fit to a first-order decay equation using linear regression analysis, and the results from multiple determinations were combined using analysis of covariance to arrive at a single best estimate of the rate constant for dissociation (koff) and an associated S.E. These methods have been described in detail elsewhere for the analysis of TFIIIA-5 S rRNA complexes (13Setzer D.R. Menezes S.R. Del Rio S. Hung V.S. Subramanyan G. RNA. 1996; 2: 1254-1269PubMed Google Scholar, 22Setzer D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 115-128PubMed Google Scholar) and were adapted directly for the analysis of TFIIIA-DNA complexes described here. In the kinetic experiments, the trap used was a double-stranded DNA fragment containing the X. borealis somatic type 5 S rRNA gene internal control region prepared by annealing two single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides, 45/100-C (5′-TCCCAGGCGGTCTCCCATCCAAGTACTAACCAGGCCCGACCCTGCTTGGCTTCCGA-3′) and 40/95-NC (5′-TGATCTCGGAAGCCAAGCAGGGTCGGGCCTGGTTAGTACTTGGATGGGAGACCGCC-3′). In general, this double-stranded DNA was used at a concentration of 1 μm. Identification of Mutant TFIIIAs—We used the approach outlined in Fig. 1 and described in detail elsewhere (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Setzer D.R. Schulman D.B. Bumbulis M.J. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 431-449PubMed Google Scholar) to screen for mutant forms of TFIIIA with reduced or altered binding affinity for the X. borealis somatic type 5 S rRNA gene. As expected, this screen identified many yeast colonies that were white or light blue on X-gal indicator plates; those chosen for further detailed analysis were shown to express mutant forms of TFIIIA-VP16, the TFIIIA moiety of which exhibited reduced affinity for the 5 S rRNA gene (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we also recovered four colonies that stained a darker blue than was observed with wild-type TFIIIA-VP16. Quantitative enzyme assays confirmed that these four strains express elevated levels of β-galactosidase (Fig. 2). DNA sequence analysis of the plasmids encoding the mutant TFIIIAs revealed the particular mutations responsible for the elevated β-galactosidase phenotype (Fig. 3). In three cases, the mutations K92R, D209G/K309E, and E270K resulted in relatively modest increases in β-galactosidase activity. Strikingly, however, the L148F mutation produced a large (∼20-fold) increase in reporter gene activity. In the case of the D209G/K309E double mutant, we showed that the enhanced β-galactosidase phenotype was due entirely to the D209G mutation. K309E alone had no effect on β-galactosidase production, and D209G produced the same effect as the D209G/K309E double mutant (data not shown). We hypothesized that the mutations K92R, L148F, D209G, and E270K result in increased affinity of TFIIIA for the 5 S rRNA gene and that the L148F mutation would have a particularly large effect on binding affinity.Fig. 3Sequence of Xenopus TFIIIA, with locations of the gain-of-function mutations identified in this study.

The four residues that are underlined and shown in boldface (Lys-92, Leu-148, Asp-209, and Glu-270) are the subjects of this analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Surprising Effects of L148F on Equilibrium Binding Affinity—We expressed the four mutant forms of TFIIIA initially identified in the genetic screen (K92R, L148F, D209G/K309E, and E270K) in E. coli and determined the equilibrium binding constants for the interaction of these proteins with the X. borealis somatic type 5 S rRNA gene (10Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Setzer D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 115-128PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). As anticipated, the relatively modest increases in β-galactosidase activity associated with the K92R, D209G/K309E, and E270K mutants were reflected in relatively modest increases in equilibrium binding affinity (1.7–5-fold decreases in the Kd). Surprisingly, however, L148F also exhibited a relatively modest increase in affinity for the 5 S rRNA gene (3.4-fold), despite the much larger effect on β-galactosidase activity. Thus, it appears that the strong correlation noted previously (16Bumbulis M.J. Wroblewski G. McKean D. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) between transcriptional activity as measured by expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene and the equilibrium binding constant of the TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene interaction does not hold in the case of the L148F mutant. Effects of Mutations on Kinetic Stability of the TFIIIA-5 S rRNA Gene Complex—To investigate this discrepancy further, we measured the in vitro dissociation rates of TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene complexes for wild-type TFIIIA and for each of the four mutants under analysis (Fig. 5). For K92R, D209G/K309E, and E270K, the dissociation rate data could be fit readily to simple first-order decay curves, and the measured first-order rate constants for the dissociation reaction were roughly consistent with the equilibrium constants for the binding reaction, indicating that the effects of the mutations were mediated primarily through effects on complex stability and not on complex formation. In contrast, the rate of L148F dissociation from the 5 S rRNA gene was both much slower and kinetically complex, making it impossible to extract a single first-order rate constant that described the dissociation process accurately. The initial equilibrium binding and kinetic experiments were carried out under our standard conditions for analyzing TFIIIA-5 S rRNA gene interactions (10Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which include an incubation time of 30 min to allow the binding reaction to come to equilibrium. This is much longer than is necessary for wild-type TFIIIA-DNA complexes (data not shown). Because the kinetically complex dissociation curve obtained with L148F suggested that multiple forms of TFIIIA-DNA complexes existed after such a 30-min incubation, however, we measured dissociation rates for this particular complex following a wide range of preincubation times ranging from 5 min to 48 h. A comparison of the dissociation curves obtained with wild-type TFIIIA and L148F after a 5-min preincubation is shown in Fig. 6, and a comparison of the curves obtained with L148F after 5-min and 30-hour preincubations is shown in Fig. 7. These results demonstrate that at least two forms of DNA-protein complexes with different kinetic stabilities form initially in the case of the L148F mutant but that the complicated dissociation rate data resolve into a single, first-order process after prolonged preincubation times. Remarkably, however, the first-order dissociation rate constant for L148F is very low, corresponding to a half-life of ∼3 h in comparison with a t½ of ∼6–9 min for the wild-type TFIIIA-DNA complex. In contrast to the multi-component kinetics observed after short preincubations with L148F, simple first-order dissociation kinetics are observed after preincubation times of only 5 min in the case of wild-type TFIIIA, as well as when the K92R, D209G/E309K, and E270K mutants are analyzed (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the measured half-life of the wild-type TFIIIA-DNA complex is independent of the preincubation time (Fig. 8).Fig. 7Dissociation kinetics of L148F-5 S rRNA gene complexes after varying preincubation times. Complexes between the 5 S rRNA gene and the L148F variant of TFIIIA were allowed to form for either 5 min or 30 h. Dissociation of these complexes was then monitored as a function of time (10Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Setzer D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 115-128PubMed Google Scholar). A logarithmic plot of the fraction of complexes remaining at various times is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Half-lives of TFIIIA-DNA complexes after variable preincubations. Dissociation rate constants and half-lives were determined for complexes of either wild-type or L148F TFIIIA with the 5 S rRNA gene after 5 min or 2, 30, or 48 h of preincubation. In the case of L148F, multi-component dissociation curves prevented the determination of a single first-order rate constant that accurately described the process. Half-lives of the complexes are plotted here. Error bars represent the S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the fact that preincubations of many hours are required for L148F-5 S rRNA gene complexes to form a kinetically homogeneous population, those DNA-protein complexes that are formed rapidly (less than a few minutes) are indistinguishable in quantity and electrophoretic mobility from those present after much longer incubations, as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown). This result suggests that formation of the L148F-DNA complex occurs rapidly, but the initial complex that forms is less kinetically stable than the complex that predominates after long incubations. Thus, the data described here are consistent with a model in which L148F binds to DNA rapidly to form a relatively unstable complex, but this initial complex then undergoes a slow conformational change to assume a kinetically very stable form. Our original measurements of apparent equilibrium binding constants for complexes of the 5 S rRNA gene with the various mutant forms of TFIIIA had been made using 30-min incubation times. Because of the very long time required to reach a true equilibrium state for the L148F mutant, it is clear that our original measurements of Kd for L148F were not made at equilibrium. Thus, the apparent Kd value obtained is not a true equilibrium dissociation constant and should not be interpreted as an accurate measurement of equilibrium binding affinity. To address this problem, we repeated our determinations of Kd after 30-hour incubations and, as shown in Fig. 4, obtained the same apparent Kd as before. Thus, the discrepancy between Kd and koff remains, consistent with the model in which the overall rate of formation of the stable L148F-DNA complex is quite low. No Ma"

In investigating an ATF that does function exceptionally well in vivo, we uncovered an unexpected relationship between transcription function and a binding interaction between the activation domain and an adjacent region of the DNA binding domain. Disruption of this interaction leads to complete loss of function in vivo, even though the activation domain is still able to bind to its target in the transcriptional machinery. We propose that this interaction parallels those between natural activation domains and their regulatory proteins, concealing the activation domain from solvent and the cellular milieu until it binds to its transcriptional machinery target. Inclusion of this property in the future design of ATFs should enhance their efficacy in vivo.

The expression of specific genes is mediated by transcriptional regulators that bind to DNA and interact with various protein partners to exert transcriptional control. There is increasing evidence that malfunctioning transcriptional regulators play a central role in the etiology of human diseases as diverse as cancer and diabetes (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev.

The development of artificial transcription factors (ATFs), 1The abbreviations used are: ATFs, artificial transcription factors; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: ATFs, artificial transcription factors; GST, glutathione S-transferase. molecules that target specific genes and control their transcriptional levels, has thus become a highly active area of research. ATFs will likely have a clear role in the study and eventual treatment of transcription-based disorders (2Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3116-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Ansari A.Z. Mapp A.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Mapp A.K. Org.

Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 903-921Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A significant challenge has been the creation of fully functional artificial transcriptional activators that seek out and robustly up-regulate specific genes (4Ansari A.Z. Mapp A.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Mapp A.K. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 2217-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Ansari A.Z. Curr. Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 903-921Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Endogenous activators are modular proteins minimally composed of two domains as follows: a DNA binding domain that dictates the genes to be targeted and an activation domain that governs the nature and the extent of the transcriptional response through interactions with the transcriptional machinery (Fig. 1A) (6Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes & Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). The two domains typically operate in an independent fashion such that the DNA binding domain of one protein can be attached to the activation domain of another to generate a fully functional activator. The nature of the linker connecting the two domains is variable but most often consists of a dimerization domain that facilitates specific and high affinity DNA binding (6Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes & Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Inspired by the architecture of natural activators, artificial activators have typically been generated through a modular replacement strategy in which the endogenous DNA binding domain is replaced with an engineered counterpart with desired DNA targeting properties (4Ansari A.Z. Mapp A.K. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Ansari A.Z. Curr. Org. Chem. 2001; 5: 903-921Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Mapp A.K. Ansari A.Z.

In contrast to the diversity of DNA binding domains used in ATF construction, it has proven much more challenging to identify non-natural activation domains that function robustly in vivo (4Ansari A.Z.

Attempts to develop non-natural activation domains have predominantly yielded peptides or, more recently, RNA molecules that function only moderately relative to natural systems (11Liu B. Han Y.

There are, however, two artificial activators that are exceptions to this trend and function strongly in vivo; these thus serve as excellent models for the design or discovery of potent artificial activation domains. One potent activation domain is P201, a hydrophobic peptide (YLLPTCIP, see Fig. 1B) that when coupled to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (residues 1–100) activates transcription to levels that are comparable to those obtained by some of the most potent natural activators (Fig. 1) (19Lu X.Y. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Lu Z. Ansari A.Z. Lu X.Y. Ogirala A. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to natural activators that typically interact with a number of transcriptional machinery proteins, the function of P201 is most likely mediated by targeting the Gal11 component of the transcriptional machinery. In support of this, a single point mutation in Gal11 (T322K) abolishes the ability of P201 to activate transcription in vivo and the ability to bind to that protein in vitro (20Lu Z. Ansari A.Z. Lu X.Y. Ogirala A. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second example of a potent artificial activation is observed when Gal4(1–100), a fragment of the transcriptional activator Gal4, is present in a yeast strain bearing a mutated version of Gal11. The first 50 residues of Gal4 compose the minimal DNA binding domain, and the next 50 residues form an extended dimerization domain (see Fig. 1B). In normal yeast strains, Gal4(1–100) is an inert DNA-binding protein. However, when a single point mutation (N342V) is introduced into Gal11, Gal4(1–100) stimulates high levels of transcription (27Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C.

Several studies indicate that this mutant version of Gal11, called “potentiator” or Gal11P, retains the normal function of Gal11 but is able to interact with the dimerization domain of Gal4 (Gal4dd, residues 50–100; see Fig. 1, B and D) (28Hidalgo P.

Structure-activity studies indicate that the primary interactions with Gal11P occur in helix 3 and loop 1 of Gal4dd, both of which contain a number of hydrophobic residues (28Hidalgo P. Ansari A.Z.

Gal11, a primary target of two of the most potent artificial activators, is also one of the targets of natural yeast activators (20Lu Z. Ansari A.Z. Lu X.Y. Ogirala A. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Gal11 resides in the mediator complex; this multiprotein complex interacts with RNA polymerase II and is thought to mediate the positive or negative signals of transcriptional regulators bound to their respective genes (33Kim Y.J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In support of this model, a number of mediator subunits have been found to interact with transcriptional activators (35Lee T.I.

Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Davis J.A.

Because both of the potent artificial activators described above function through an interaction with Gal11, this suggests that Gal11 could be a privileged target for the development of potent activation domains. Recent evidence has emerged indicating that exclusive targeting of Gal11 does not provide potent transcriptional activation domains. For example, peptides selected specifically for their ability to bind to Gal11 function only modestly as transcriptional activators despite affinities for Gal11 comparable with natural activation domains (23Wu Z. Belanger G. Brennan B.B. Lum J.K. Minter A.R. Rowe S.P. Plachetka A. Majmudar C.Y. Mapp A.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12390-12391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding interaction with Gal11 is unlikely to be the sole contributor to the unusually potent function of P201. To gain insight into additional properties of P201 that make it a robust artificial activator, we examined its ability to activate transcription in yeast strains bearing various mutants of Gal11 and to bind these Gal11 mutants in vitro. These experiments indicate the existence of a second binding interaction that is essential for P201-mediated activation. Remarkably, this interaction is not with a transcriptional machinery protein but with the hydrophobic dimerization domain of Gal4 (Gal4dd). We propose that this dynamic interaction between Gal4dd and P201 plays a role analogous to the interactions between natural activation domains and their regulatory proteins, preserving the hydrophobic activation sequences from nonproductive binding events with other cellular proteins. This finding provides an important guiding principle for the future design of robust artificial activators. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The yeast strain used was JPY52::JP188 MATα his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52::JP188 lys2Δ385 gal4Δ11 gal11::LYS2. This strain contains a GAL1-lacZ reporter with two GAL4 DNA-binding sites 191 bp upstream of the TATA box integrated at the URA3 locus. The Gal4dd or P201 constructs were on a CEN4 plasmid under the control of a β-actin promoter with a HIS+ selection. The GAL11 constructs were based on YCplac111 (CEN LEU+). Expression and Purification of GST-Gal11(186–619)—The plasmid pGEXVsh1 was transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) pLysE Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), and cells were plated onto LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml). Cultures (50 ml) from single colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C (275 rpm) in LB supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml) before addition to 1 liter of LB supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). After 3 h, the cultures were cooled to 16 °C, and expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.5 mm) for 5 h. The cell pellet was lysed using sonication, and the GST-tagged protein was isolated from the cell lysate using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Elution from the beads was accomplished with 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 15 mm glutathione and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The protein solution thus obtained was concentrated to ∼20–25 μm and the buffer exchanged to storage buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) using a Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal filter device. The protein solution was stored in 50-μl aliquots at -80 °C until needed. The protein concentration was measured by using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The identity and purity of the fusion protein was verified by reducing SDS-PAGE with appropriate molecular weight standards. β-Galactosidase Assays—For quantitative measurement of activity, freshly transformed colonies were used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of SC media containing 2% raffinose, 2% galactose but lacking uracil, histidine, and leucine. The cultures were incubated overnight at 30 °C at 250 rpm. Following incubation, these cultures were used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of SC media, which were subsequently incubated overnight at 30 °C with agitation to an A600 of 0.6–0.9. The yeast cells were harvested, and the culture was then lysed with glass beads in Z buffer (for 500 ml: 4.26 g of sodium phosphate, 2.76 g of sodium phosphate monobasic, 0.37 g of potassium chloride, 0.123 g of magnesium sulfate, pH 7.0) for 5 min in the cold. A portion of the cell extract was used to measure β-galactosidase activity via incubation with o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 4 mg/ml in Z buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Na2CO3, and the A420 was measured. The activity reported was normalized to the total protein concentration of the extract, which was measured using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescent Labeling—XLY (LTGLFVQDYLLPTCIP) and XLR (LTGLFVQDRLLPTCIP) were synthesized on Rink amide resin from Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids, using standard protocols as in Ref. 61Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar. At the conclusion of the synthesis, the peptides were fully deprotected, precipitated with cold ether, and purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (C18 column with a gradient solvent system: buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, CH3CN). Each peptide was characterized using electrospray mass spectrometry. The peptides were labeled at the N terminus with fluorescein using 5/6-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, purified using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized using electrospray mass spectrometry. The labeled peptides were divided into 2-nmol aliquots and stored as dry pellets at -80 °C. Dissociation Constant Measurements—Dissociation constant measurements were carried out on a Spex Fluoromax-2 fluorimeter at room temperature. Prior to each experiment, a 2-nmol aliquot of fluorescein-labeled XLY or XLR was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer S (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40), and the concentration of the solution was determined by using the absorbance of fluorescein. The concentration of the solution was adjusted to 1.25 μm with Buffer S, and 1 μl of this solution was added to 49 μl of GST+Gal11, GST+Gal11P, or GST+Gal11DM (20 μm final protein concentration for most measurements). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the first measurement was taken (excitation wavelength, 487 nm; emission wavelength, 516 nm). For each successive measurement, the solution was diluted by addition of Buffer S containing 25 nm fluorescein-labeled XLY or XLR (to keep the concentration of the labeled component constant throughout the experiment), manually mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. At concentrations above 25 μm, GST+Gal11(186–619) aggregates to a significant degree, and dissociation constants greater than 10 μm thus were not measured. The same procedure was used for binding experiments with GST+Gal4dd or GST+Gal4dd+P201, except that a 10 nm concentration of XLY or XLR was used. The data obtained were plotted in Origin 7.0 and fit to the following equation using the Levenberg-Marquardt least squares method: Y = ((a × X)/(Kd + X)) + b, where a is the amplitude of the curve and b is the anisotropy of the free labeled peptide. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and errors were calculated using the mean ± S.D. of the three experiments. Gel Shift Experiments—Reaction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.01% Nonidet P-40), Gal4(1–100), DNA master mix (32P-5′-end-labeled DNA, salmon sperm DNA, reaction buffer), and Gal11, Gal11P, or Gal11DM were used to make up 10-μl reactions. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. A 7% acrylamide, 3% glycerol gel was pre-run for 15 min. The 10-μl reactions were loaded while the gel was running. Gels were run at room temperature at 95 V, dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). koff Measurements—All koff determinations were carried out at 25 °C on a Beacon 2000 polarization system (Invitrogen). For the Gal11-XLY interaction, fluorescein-labeled XLY (25 nm in Buffer S) was incubated with 18 μm GST+Gal11(186–619) until equilibrium was reached, as determined by anisotropy measurements. Following equilibration, a 1700-fold excess of unlabeled XLY was added by mixing, and anisotropy measurements were taken every 11.5 s to monitor the release of the labeled peptide. An identical procedure was used for the XLY·Gal4dd experiment, except that a 10 nm concentration of fluorescein-labeled XLY was used and a 50 μm concentration of GST+Gal4dd. A control experiment was carried out to determine the loss in anisotropy due solely to the dilution of the protein and accounted for in the data analysis. All data were plotted using Origin 7.0 and fit to a single phase exponential decay using the Levenberg-Marquardt least squares method. In Vivo Activation—P201 was originally identified by a screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of random 8-residue peptides attached to Gal4(1–100). We initially postulated that the potent function of Gal4(1–100)+P201 could be due to some residual affinity of Gal4dd (residues 50–100 of Gal4) for wild-type Gal11. Thus the overall level of activation observed with Gal4(1–100)+P201 would be the result of two binding interactions, P201·Gal11 and Gal4dd·Gal11. To delineate the relative contributions of P201 and Gal4dd, we first looked at the function of Gal4(1–100)+P201 and Gal4(1–100) in yeast strains bearing wild-type Gal11 or its mutants. The first of the key Gal11 mutations is the substitution of threonine 322 to lysine (T322K), a change that disrupts binding with P201. The second mutation results from replacement of asparagine 342 with a valine (N342V, also referred to as the Gal11P mutation), and this alteration promotes an interaction with Gal4dd (20Lu Z. Ansari A.Z. Lu X.Y. Ogirala A. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8591-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Hidalgo P. Ansari A.Z. Schmidt P. Hare B. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Shin E.J. Ptashne M. Wagner G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also tested the function of Gal4(1–100)+P201 and Gal4(1–100) in a yeast strain bearing the Gal11 double mutant (Gal11 DM) that has both the T322K and N342V mutations. Gal4(1–100)+P201 functions well in the wild-type Gal11-bearing strain, and as expected, the T322K substitution in Gal11 abolishes P201 activity (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Gal4dd does not activate transcription in yeast strains containing either wild-type Gal11 or Gal11 with the T322K mutation (Fig. 2, C and D). Introduction of a second mutation in Gal11 (N342V, Gal11DM) restores activation function to Gal4dd to levels nearly identical to those observed with Gal11P (Fig. 2, E and F). The latter result demonstrates that the T322K mutation has little effect on the ability of Gal4dd to activate transcription. The Gal11P mutant contains binding sites for both Gal4dd and for P201, but as illustrated in Fig. 2G, the levels of transcription elicited by Gal4(1–100)+P201 in this strain are similar to those obtained in the presence of wild-type Gal11 (Fig. 2A). In the final experiment, we examined the function of Gal4(1–100)+P201 in yeast bearing Gal11DM to decouple the effect of P201 on activation mediated by Gal4dd (Fig. 2H). The T322K mutation in Gal11 abrogates P201-mediated activation (Fig. 2B) but has little effect on the function of Gal4dd (Fig. 2F). It would be expected, then, that Gal4(1–100)+P201 would activate transcription in Gal11DM yeast primarily because of the interaction of Gal4dd with the binding surface generated by the N342V mutation (Fig. 2H). However, activation was significantly diminished in this strain (Fig. 2H). In other words, P201 somehow blocks the function of Gal4dd. Identical results were obtained in yeast strains bearing a single binding site for Gal4 (see supplemental Fig. 1 for details). Taken together, these results suggest that although Gal4dd and P201 do not appear to function cooperatively, there is a functional interplay between the two peptides. Subsequent experiments were therefore designed to first more clearly define the P201·Gal11 interaction, and second to investigate a possible Gal4dd·P201 interaction. Defining the Minimal Gal11-binding Peptide—The results from the in vivo activation studies above indicate that Gal4dd does not interact with wild-type Gal11 in the context of Gal4(1–100)+P201. However, previous mutagenesis studies have shown that residue 97 in helix 3 of Gal4dd is important for P201 function, and there thus remained the possibility that some portion of Gal4dd is necessary for P201 to interact effectively with Gal11 (19Lu X.Y. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine the role of helix 3 of Gal4dd in P201-mediated activation, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis of this region (Fig. 3A). To avoid any effect on DNA binding, we replaced the DNA binding domain of Gal4 with the DNA binding domain of the bacterial protein LexA. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the replacement of residues 96–98 in Gal4dd with alanine eliminated P201-mediated transcription, whereas substitution of residues 92–94 had modest effects. The in vivo results were correlated in vitro by examining the interaction of the peptides P201, Gal4(96–100)+P201, and Gal4(93–100)+P201 with Gal11. These experiments revealed that only Gal4(93–100)+P201 binds to Gal11 with any appreciable affinity (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Thus, both the in vivo functional data and the in vitro binding experiments are consistent with a requirement for both the P201 sequence and residues 93–100 of Gal4dd for interaction with Gal11 and for transcriptional activation. All subsequent binding experiments were therefore carried out with this minimal peptide (Gal4(93–100)+P201, LTGLFVQDYLLPTCIP), referred to as XLY. Interaction of XLY with Gal4dd and Gal11—The data of Fig. 2H suggest that XLY binds directly to Gal4dd and interferes with its ability to interact"
