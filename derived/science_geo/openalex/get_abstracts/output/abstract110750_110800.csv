https://openalex.org/W1559173033,"We report in this paper that highly purified Escherichia coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, fumarase A, fumarase B, and mammalian aconitase are inactivated by O2- with second order rate constants in the range of 10(6) to 10(7) M-1 s-1. Each of these enzymes belongs to the hydro-lyase class and contains catalytically active [4Fe-4S] clusters. Simultaneous with inactivation by O2- is the release of iron from their clusters. Our working hypothesis is O2- inactivates these enzymes by oxidizing their clusters to an unstable oxidation state, and cluster degradation follows. Consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that spinach dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, a member of the hydro-lyase class that has a catalytically active [2Fe-2S] cluster, is not inactivated and does not lose iron in the presence of O2-. Porcine fumarase, a member of the hydro-lyase class that does not contain an Fe-S cluster, is also not inactivated by O2-. We also report the rate constants for the inactivation of E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, fumarase A, fumarase B, and mammalian aconitase by O2 are close to 2 x 10(2) M-1 s-1, and the rate constants for the inactivation of E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase and mammalian aconitase by H2O2 are about 10(3) M-1 s-1. E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase has been reported previously to be inactivated in vivo when cells are grown in hyperbaric O2, presumably due to the increased O2- generated under these conditions. We report here that E. coli fumarase A, fumarase B, and aconitase are also inactivated in vivo by hyperbaric O2. Thermodynamic parameters for the oxidation of the cluster of aconitase by O2- and O2 are calculated."
https://openalex.org/W1582691127,"To gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of obesity and specifically the role of nutrient partitioning in the development of obesity, we overexpressed the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) in transgenic mice under the control of the fat-specific aP2 fatty acid-binding protein promoter/enhancer. Two lines of transgenic mice were generated, which overexpressed GLUT4 6-9-fold in white fat and 3-5-fold in brown fat with no overexpression in other tissues. In vivo glucose tolerance was enhanced in transgenic mice. In isolated epididymal, parametrial, and subcutaneous adipose cells from transgenic mice, basal glucose transport was 20-34-fold greater than in nontransgenic littermates. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was 2-4-fold greater in cells from transgenic mice. Total body lipid was increased 2-3-fold in transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 in fat. Surprisingly, fat cell size was unaltered and fat cell number was increased > 2-fold. This is the first animal model in which increased fat mass results solely from adipocyte hyperplasia and it will be a valuable model for understanding the mechanisms responsible for fat cell replication and/or differentiation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1743153984,"It is often assumed, but has not been demonstrated, that the oscillations of cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+i) that occur in various secretory cells induce oscillations in secretion. Here, we have used single pancreatic islets from normal mice to monitor simultaneously insulin release and Ca2+i in beta-cells for periods up to 25 min. Ca2+i and insulin secretion were found to oscillate in synchrony during stimulation by glucose. This synchrony persisted when the frequency of both events changed spontaneously or upon addition of the hypoglycaemic sulfonylurea tolbutamide, or when their relative amplitudes varied. Repolarizing the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide abolished both Ca2+i and insulin oscillations. In contrast, epinephrine suppressed insulin oscillations in spite of the persistence of Ca2+i oscillations. This study is the first direct demonstration that, in an intact organ, sustained oscillations of Ca2+i induced by a physiological stimulus entrain synchronous oscillations of the functional response, and that both events can vary simultaneously or be dissociated depending on the experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1571161105,"We have used 14C-labeled bacteriophage lambda O-DNA replication protein as a probe to identify and purify Escherichia coli proteases capable of its degradation. In this manner, five different proteases (termed Lop) have been identified capable of degrading lambda O protein to acid-soluble fragments in an ATP-dependent fashion. One of these activities was purified to homogeneity and shown to be composed of two different polypeptides. The 23,000-Da component (LopP) was identified as the previously characterized ClpP protein, known to complex with ClpA to form the ClpAP, an ATP-dependent protease, capable of degrading casein. The second 46,000-Da component was identified as ClpX (LopC), coded by a gene located in the same operon, but promoter distal to that coding for ClpP (Gottesman, S., Clark, W. P., de Crecy-Lagard, V., and Maurizi, M. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22618-22626). This identification was based on the determination of the sequence of the first 24 amino acid residues of the purified ClpX protein and its identity with that predicted by the DNA sequence. The ClpXP protease is substrate specific, since it degrades casein (known to be degraded by ClpAP), lambda P, or DnaK proteins slowly or not at all. These results suggest that ClpX protein directs ClpP protease to specific substrates. It is estimated that 50% of all lambda O-specific protease activity present in crude E. coli extracts is due to the ClpXP protease. We propose that transient inhibition of lambda O degradation observed in vivo during the later stages of lambda-DNA replication in vivo is responsible for the switch from bidirectional to unidirectional replication. One round unidirectional replication will lead to strand separation resulting in a switch from early (theta) to late (sigma) mode of lambda-DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1929067551,"A rat heme oxygenase (HO-1) gene without the sequence coding for the last 23 amino acids has been constructed and expressed behind the pho A promoter in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is expressed at high levels as a soluble catalytically active protein that causes the bacterial cells to accumulate biliverdin. The purified truncated heme-heme oxygenase complex is spectroscopically indistinguishable from the complex with the native enzyme and converts heme to biliverdin when reconstituted with rat liver cytochrome P450 reductase. Reaction of the recombinant heme-heme oxygenase complex with H2O2 produces a species with the spectroscopic properties of verdoheme. Unidentified products are obtained when this intermediate is directly extracted from the protein, but biliverdin is obtained if the verdoheme-protein complex is exposed to cytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH before the extraction step. In contrast, reaction of the heme-heme oxygenase complex with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), tert-butylhydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide yields a ferryl (FeIV = O) complex. Reaction of the heme-heme oxygenase complex with mCPBA also produces an EPR-detectable protein radical. In accord with formation of a ferryl intermediate, recombinant heme oxygenase catalyzes the mCPBA- and alkylhydroperoxide-dependent peroxidation of 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol). Guaiacol oxidation is not observed during turnover of the enzyme by cytochrome P450 reductase/NADPH or H2O2. Conversely, biliverdin is not formed with tert-butylhydroperoxide or mCPBA. H2O2 thus supports the first step of the normal catalytic oxidation of heme by heme oxygenase, but alkyl and acyl hydroperoxides do not. These results suggest that the alpha-meso-hydroxylation required for biliverdin formation is mediated by the distal of the two oxygens in the iron-dioxygen intermediate (Fe-O-O) engendered by reaction with either cytochrome P450 reductase/NADPH or H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1605052148,"We have determined the molecular mechanism of the automodification reaction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (EC 2.4.2.30). While PARP-mono(ADP-ribose) conjugates were the predominant products of automodification at 200 nM NAD, enzyme-bound branched polymers were preferentially synthesized at 200 microM NAD. Thus, the initiation, elongation, and branching reactions catalyzed by PARP appear to be [NAD]-dependent. Initial rates of automodification increased with second order kinetics as a function of [PARP] at both 200 nM and 200 microM NAD. Therefore, 2 molecules of PARP, i.e. a catalytic dimer, are required for the auto-mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation and the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions. Initial rates of automodification also increased with second order kinetics at low NAD concentrations. Therefore, the catalytic dimer also requires 2 molecules of NAD. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the automodification reaction of PARP is intermolecular and that the 2 monomeric units of PARP may simultaneously function as catalyst and acceptor molecules in the automodification reaction. Confirmatory evidence for the catalytic role of protein-protein interactions in the automodification reaction was manifested by a marked inhibition of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation at 40 nM or higher [PARP]."
https://openalex.org/W1600280692,"The small GTP-binding protein Rho regulates the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in cells responding to growth factors. ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3 transferase blocks this function; however, an enzymatic target for Rho has not yet been defined. We now report that Rho activates phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase in soluble preparations of platelets. Activation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase by GTP gamma S is blocked by ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Rho, and Rho shifts to the cytoskeleton in platelets exposed to thrombin. The inhibitory effects of ADP-ribosylation are overcome by exogenous recombinant Rho but not by recombinant Rac, another member of the Ras superfamily. Exposure of platelets to thrombin has been reported to lead to activation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase, a shift of this enzyme to the platelet membrane skeleton, and rapid cytoskeletal reorganization. In other studies, ADP-ribosylation of Rho has been found to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, a cytoskeletally linked event. We suggest that Rho may exert its effects on cytoskeletal reorganization via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1581436439,"The effects of stimulated Ca2+ influx on cytosolic ([Ca2+]c) or intramitochondrial free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) were examined in the new pancreatic beta-cell line, INS-1. [Ca2+]c was monitored by video imaging of single fura-2-loaded INS-1 cells, or in populations of cells transfected with non-targeted (cytosolic) aequorin. [Ca2+]m was measured after transfection with aequorin targeted to the mitochondria by fusion of the gene in frame with the signal peptide of cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. Two physiological stimuli of native beta-cells, glucose and ATP, raised [Ca2+]c in INS-1 cells largely by stimulating Ca2+ influx. Thus, glucose (20 mM) induced repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]c (0.42 min-1, mean amplitude 229 nM above 102 nM basal). These transients were largely due to periodic stimulation of Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, since they could be rapidly and reversibly blocked by chelation of external Ca2+, by addition of the hyperpolarizing agent diazoxide, or with the Ca2+ channel blocker SR 7037. ATP, by contrast, caused single transient [Ca2+]c increases, to about 300 nM above basal levels, which could be inhibited by > 90% upon external Ca2+ chelation. Challenge of aequorin-transfected cells with ATP increased [Ca2+]m to 4 microM or above, an effect blocked by EGTA. Furthermore, plasma membrane depolarization with high K+, used as a glucose surrogate to mimic, in a synchronized fashion, the influx-induced Ca2+ transients observed at the single-cell level, also increased [Ca2+]m to > 4 microM. Similar increases in [Ca2+]m were also measured in other aequorin-transfected insulin-secreting cells, RINm5F, during mobilization of internal Ca2+ with carbachol. In contrast, glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]m were below the level of detection in INS-1 cell populations, consistent with the asynchrony of the [Ca2+]c transients induced by this nutrient at the single-cell level, and the consequent small average [Ca2+]c rise. These data are in line with the view that stimulated Ca2+ influx into excitable cells raises [Ca2+]m as efficiently as internal Ca2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells. In the case of INS-1 and pancreatic beta-cells, this may be important both to enhance oxidative metabolism, hence fueling the secretory process, and also to maintain the production of metabolic signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1498580215,"Expression of RNA for the NMDAR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor was detected by Northern hybridization in both nerve growth factor-differentiated and undifferentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The NMDA receptor type 1 (NMDAR1) message in PC12 cells was similar in size to that expressed in hippocampal neurons. PC12 cell cDNAs that were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers flanking the coding region of NMDAR1 corresponded to the NMDAR1 splice variant NMDA receptor type 1 isoform C (NMDAR1C). Using calcium imaging or patch-clamp recording, no functional NMDA-gated ion channels were found in PC12 cells. A monoclonal antibody against NMDAR1 was developed in order to investigate whether or not NMDAR1 protein was present in PC12 cells. Only trace amounts of NMDAR1 protein were found in native PC12 cells. However, expression of NMDAR1 protein was detected in PC12 cells that were transfected with an expression vector containing an NMDAR1C clone under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. These findings suggest that the expression of NMDAR1 protein in PC12 cells may be controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. The PC12 cell line may serve as a model system for the study of the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational regulation of NMDAR1. Furthermore, the presence of NMDAR1 RNA in a particular cell type may not necessarily indicate expression of NMDAR1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1485463834,"Upon entering a cell the natural product rapamycin, like the structurally related immunosuppressant FK506, associates with members of the FKBP family of proteins. One or more of the resulting FKBP-rapamycin complexes blocks signaling pathways emanating from some growth factor receptors. Recently, the addition of rapamycin was shown to inhibit the phosphorylation and activation of a 70-kDa ribosomal S6 protein kinase, which normally occurs minutes after the activation of certain cytokine and growth factor receptors. We now report that rapamycin can be added 4 to 6 h after the addition of serum growth factors to quiescent human osteosarcoma cells and still arrest these cells in G1. This window of action correlates with the inducible appearance of a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity, and the induction of this activity is inhibited by the addition of rapamycin. Furthermore, p36cyclin D1 associates with this cdk protein complex in lysates of untreated cells, but does not associate with this cdk protein complex in lysates of rapamycin-treated cells. Together, these studies demonstrate that FKBP-rapamycin can modulate a cyclin-dependent kinase activity and a cyclin D1-cdk association during early G1 in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984011022,"In the rat central nervous system, the mRNA encoding the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit R1 is the most ubiquitously distributed among the cloned subunit mRNAs of this glutamate receptor subtype. The N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 mRNA is very abundantly expressed and N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 coexpression is necessary for functional expression of all other cloned N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. Therefore, the R1 subunit is likely to be an essential component of all known N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat brain. By employing sequence specific polyclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that rat brain N-methyl-D-aspartate R1, as well as recombinantly expressed receptor protein, has an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The receptor protein is heavily glycosylated. It is specifically localized to the central nervous system, and it co-enriches with synaptic membranes upon subcellular fractionation of the cerebral cortex. Chemical cross-linking of synaptic membrane proteins shows that the N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 protein is part of a receptor protein complex with a molecular mass of 730 kDa. By using immunocytochemical methods, we demonstrate a widespread but distinct distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 in neurons of the rat brain, with prominent immunostaining in certain layers of the cerebral cortex, in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, as well as in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W1486193010,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin (RAP) is a potent inhibitor of the entry of interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated T cells into S-phase. Earlier results indicated that RAP treatment arrested the growth of the murine IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2 in late G1-phase. To explore further the interactions of RAP with the cell cycle control machinery in T cells, we examined the effects of RAP treatment on the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinases p34cdc2 and p33cdk2 in G1-phase CTLL-2 cells. Stimulation of factor-deprived cells with IL-2 led to the assembly of high molecular weight complexes containing active p34cdc2 and p33cdk2. The appearance of these complexes was explained, at least in part, by the association of both cyclin-dependent kinases with IL-2-induced cyclin A. RAP treatment profoundly inhibited both cyclin A expression and the appearance of active cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes in IL-2-stimulated, late G1-phase CTLL-2 cells. Although p34cdc2 activation was largely dependent on association with cyclin A, a significant proportion of the active p33cdk2 pool was complexed with cyclin E. In contrast to cyclin A, the IL-2-induced accumulation of cyclin E in G1-phase cells was only partially suppressed by RAP, and cyclin E-p33cdk2 complexes were readily detected in drug-treated cells. These cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes were nonetheless devoid of histone H1 kinase activity. The inhibitory effects of RAP on the activation of cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinases suggest that one or both events participate in the regulation of T cell entry into S-phase."
https://openalex.org/W1559415385,"The trans-Golgi network (TGN) plays a central role in protein sorting/targeting. TGN38 is an integral membrane protein confined mainly to the TGN. When the cytoplasmic 32-residue sequence of TGN38 was fused to the ecto- and transmembrane domains of glycophorin A (a surface protein), the resulting chimeric protein was localized to the TGN. Detailed mutagenesis of the 32-residue sequence revealed that the Ser, Tyr, and Leu residues at positions 23, 25, and 28, respectively, are essential for TGN localization. Further studies demonstrate that the sequence SXYQRL can by itself confer significant TGN localization."
https://openalex.org/W1600489130,"We previously showed that neurofilaments interact with microtubules (MTs) via their high molecular weight subunits (NF-H) after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Here we studied the effects of phosphorylation of NF-H on this interaction. tau protein kinase II, Ser/Thr protein kinase, phosphorylated NF-H in the tail domain, decreased its electrophoretic mobility to a native level, and also restored its property to be less interactive with MTs. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused no shift of electrophoretic mobility or dissociation from MTs. We conclude that the tail domain of NF-H directly interacts with the MT surface, and the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation of the tail domain of NF-H by Ser/Thr protein kinase like tau protein kinase II. To characterize the binding domain of NF-H on MTs, subtilisin digestion of MTs and competition analysis with the MT binding fragment of tau protein were performed. The dissociation constant of NF-H to subtilisin MTs was higher than that to intact MTs. The maximum binding of NF-H was reduced when tau fragments existed. These results revealed that the COOH-terminal region of tubulin is involved in the binding to NF-H, and the NF-H and microtubule-associated protein binding domains are closely apposed on the surface of MTs."
https://openalex.org/W2133324304,"In mammalian cells, clathrin-coated vesicles mediate transport of the lysosomal enzyme receptors from the trans-Golgi network to the endocytic pathway. A critical step of this process is the recruitment of Golgi-specific adaptors onto Golgi membranes for efficient clathrin polymerization. An in vitro assay was used here to quantitate this event in streptolysin-O-permeabilized NRK cells. At 37 degrees C, these interactions are cytosol- and energy-dependent, sensitive to GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)) and brefeldin A. We report that Golgi-specific adaptor binding is enhanced in mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) receptor-overexpressing cells and reduced in mannose 6-phosphate receptor-deficient cells. Furthermore, adaptor binding is partially inhibited after addition of soluble cytoplasmic domains of the mannose 6-phosphate/IGF II receptor. Almost complete inhibition is only observed when this domain is phosphorylated on serines 2421 and 2492, a major modification acquired during exit of the receptor from the Golgi. These results show that the mannose 6-phosphate/IGF II receptor is part of the components that recruit the Golgi-specific adaptors and that its phosphorylation is an important feature for high affinity interactions with sorting components."
https://openalex.org/W1938283067,"Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a critical role in many physiological processes, but the mechanism(s) which regulate apoptosis are poorly understood. We demonstrate that in a hematopoietic cell line, which can grow in either interleukin (IL)-2 or IL-3, both of these growth factors can increase bcl-2 mRNA levels and prevent apoptosis normally seen following growth factor withdrawal. Herbimycin A, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocks the ability of IL-2 and IL-3 to up-regulate bcl-2 mRNA levels and induces apoptosis. Transfection of a bcl-2 expression vector not only prolongs survival following growth factor withdrawal but also confers resistance to the effect of herbimycin A. We conclude that herbimycin A-sensitive protein tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and bcl-2 expression, but these protein tyrosine kinases appear not to be required for the action of Bcl-2 since Bcl-2 can exert its growth survival effect even in the presence of herbimycin A."
https://openalex.org/W1626461983,"CHIP28 is a major water transporting protein in erythrocytes and plasma membranes in kidney proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle. Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with the coding sequence of cloned rat kidney CHIP28k using expression vectors containing cytomegalovirus or Rous sarcoma virus promoters. Clonal cell populations expressed a 1.3-kilobase mRNA on Northern blot probed by CHIP28k cDNA and a 28-kDa protein on immunoblot probed by a polyclonal CHIP28 antibody. The clone with greatest expression produced approximately 8 x 10(6) copies of CHIP28k protein/cell. Plasma membrane osmotic water permeability (Pf), measured by stopped-flow light scattering, was 0.004 cm/s in control (vector-transfected) cells (10 degrees C) and 0.014 cm/s in the CHIP28k-transfected cells. Pf in CHIP28k-transfected cells had an activation energy of 4.9 kcal/mol and was reversibly inhibited by HgCl2. CHIP28k expression did not affect the transport of protons and the small polar non-electrolytes urea and formamide. CHIP28k immunoreactivity and function was then determined in subcellular fractions. Pf in 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled endocytic vesicles, measured by a stopped-flow fluorescence quenching assay, was 0.002 cm/s (control cells) and 0.011 cm/s (CHIP28k-transfected cells); Pf in transfected cells was inhibited by HgCl2. Immunoblotting of fractionated endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and plasma membranes revealed high densities of CHIP28k (approximately 5000 monomers/microns 2 in plasma membrane) with different glycosylation patterns; functional water transport activity was present only in Golgi and plasma membrane vesicles. Antibody detection of CHIP28k by confocal fluorescence microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy revealed localization to plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles. These studies establish a stably transfected somatic cell line that strongly expresses functional CHIP28k water channels. As in the original proximal tubule cells, the expressed CHIP28k protein is a selective water channel that is functional in endocytic vesicles and the cell plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1518247336,"The 7 Lys residues in mammalian calmodulin (CaM) were reductively methylated with 13C-enriched formaldehyde and studied by (1H,13C)-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR. The apo- and Ca(2+)-forms of CaM, as well as a complex with a 22-residue peptide which comprises the CaM binding region of myosin light chain kinase were studied. The complete assignment of the two-dimensional NMR spectra was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Lys–>Gln) of all the Lys. The pKa values for the individual Lys could be determined by pH titration experiments. In Ca(2+)-CaM, the pKa values range from 9.29 (Lys-75) to 10.23 (Lys-77). The Lys in apo-CaM have higher pKa values than those in Ca(2+)-CaM. The binding of the myosin light chain kinase peptide gives rise to an increase of the pKa values of Lys-148 and Lys-75 by 0.5 and 0.8 pH units, respectively; this results from the relocation of their side chains to a completely solvent accessible state. The changes in the pKa values upon binding Ca2+ or the myosin light chain kinase peptide show a remarkable correlation with earlier reported chemical reactivity changes. Thus, our results indicate that pKa values, rather than structural and steric effects, play the dominant role in determining the reactivity of Lys side chains towards small electrophilic chemical modification reagents. The methodology used here could prove useful for the determination of individual pKa values in other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547382703,"PA28, a protein activator of the 20 S proteasome, was previously identified in soluble extracts of bovine red blood cells (Ma, C.-P., Slaughter, C. A., and DeMartino, G. N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10515-10523). To determine whether this regulatory protein is as widely distributed as the proteasome, PA28 content and activity were examined in various eukaryotic tissues by immunoblot analysis and by functional assays of tissue extracts. PA28 protein was present in all sources examined. PA28 activity, however, was not detected in many of these sources, including those with the highest level of PA28 protein. To determine the biochemical basis of this result, PA28 was purified from extracts of rat liver, which had high levels of PA28 protein but no PA28 activity. The resulting purified PA28 had no detectable activity but had native and subunit molecular weights indistinguishable from the active PA28 of bovine red blood cells. Using the inactivation of purified PA28 as an assay, a protein that inactivated PA28 without altering its apparent molecular weight on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was identified, purified, and characterized from bovine liver. It had biochemical and catalytic characteristics similar to those of lysosomal carboxypeptidase B. When leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal carboxypeptidase B, was included in the buffers used for the preparation of PA28, PA28 activity was detected in tissues which otherwise failed to demonstrate this activity. A similar result was obtained when extracts were prepared in a manner that minimized disruption of lysosomes. Other carboxypeptidases such as carboxypeptidase Y and pancreatic carboxypeptidase B also inactivated PA28 without altering its apparent molecular weight. Active PA28 binds to the proteasome to form a protease-activator complex that can be isolated after velocity sedimentation centrifugation through glycerol density gradients. Carboxypeptidase-inactivated PA28 failed to form such a complex, suggesting that the carboxyl terminus of PA28 is required for binding to the proteasome. These results indicate the importance of the carboxyl terminus of PA28 for proteasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W1604805265,"Many cell types show repetitive short lasting cytosolic calcium spikes with long interspike periods when stimulated with submaximal concentrations of agonists linked to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. In pancreatic acinar cells these spikes have been shown to be evoked by constant levels of inositol trisphosphate through a mechanism of calcium-induced calcium release and do not depend acutely on the presence of external calcium. However, the processes involved in the interspike period have remained unclear. Here we report that the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase play a significant role, not only in resequestering calcium after a spike, but also in regulating the long interspike period. Decreasing the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps leads to shorter interspike intervals and thus higher spiking frequencies, while the duration of each spike increases. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases are able to entirely suppress a response that can subsequently be evoked by partial inhibition of the pumps. This suggests that during the interspike period there is a considerable amount of calcium released from intracellular stores, which is rapidly buffered by the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps and the cytosolic calcium-binding proteins. A calcium spike will be initiated by calcium-induced calcium release only when the buffering is saturated."
https://openalex.org/W1508401731,"PECAM-1 (CD31/EndoCAM) is an adhesion molecule in the immunoglobulin supergene family that is expressed on endothelial cells, platelets, and some hematopoietic lineage cells. In this paper, using several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against PECAM-1, we identified PECAM-1 molecules on human, rat, and murine solid tumor cell lines. Immunocytochemical labeling and flow cytometric analysis using either polyclonal, monoclonal, or Fab portion of the antibodies against PECAM-1 detected a distinct distribution on tumor cell surface. Immunoblotting revealed proteins ranging from 120 to 130 kDa in tumor cells derived from different species. Immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation studies indicated that PECAM-1 is constitutively expressed on the surface of human tumor cells (i.e. colon adenocarcinoma). The specificity of a major polyclonal anti-PECAM-1 used in the current study (i.e. SEW-3) was confirmed by the preabsorption studies. PECAM-1 molecules on tumor cells appear to bear terminal carbohydrate moieties (i.e. sialic acid residues) different from those on platelets, since neuraminidase treatment of tumor cells, unlike platelets, did not result in a mobility shift. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic DNA derived from tumor cell lines of different species revealed the presence of PECAM-1 gene in the genome. The mRNAs of PECAM-1 in tumor cells were detected by reverse transcription-PCR followed by Southern hybridization. Screening of more than 20 human, rat, and murine solid tumor cell lines indicated that PECAM-1 is widely expressed, although the level of expression varies considerably among different cell lines. The expression of PECAM-1 message in tumor cells was confirmed by Northern blotting. DNA sequencing of the PCR fragment revealed that human tumor cell PECAM-1 matches 100% to the human endothelial cell counterpart. Finally, it was demonstrated that tumor cell PECAM-1 is involved in mediating tumor cell adhesion to endothelium, as evidenced by the ability of anti-PECAM-1 antibodies to decrease the adhesion of unstimulated tumor cells to microvascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606360435,"Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na,K-ATPase by binding to the catalytic alpha subunit of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of the H1-H2 domain has demonstrated the importance of this region in determining cardiac glycoside affinity. In this study, random mutagenesis was used to identify an amino acid, arginine 880, in the COOH-terminal portion of the alpha subunit which influences the sensitivity of the enzyme to ouabain. This residue is predicted to reside in the H7-H8 extracellular loop. Conversion of arginine 880 to a proline causes a 10-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant and a 2-fold increase in the association rate constant for [3H]ouabain binding. This results in an enzyme with a KD for ouabain 5-fold higher than the wild-type sheep alpha 1 isoform. These data are compatible with arginine 880 comprising a portion of the ouabain binding site. Furthermore, if arginine 880 is at the physical binding site, then this finding lends support to models that place this amino acid extracellularly since cardiac glycosides interact with the extracellular surface of the Na,K-ATPase. The ouabain binding characteristics of substitution R880P were compared with those of several different Na,K-ATPases, each of which contains a single amino acid substitution in the H1-H2 region of the alpha subunit. The substituted enzymes, C104A, Y108A, E116Q, P118K, and Y124F, vary considerably in their rates of dissociation (1-4-fold increase in the dissociation rate constant). In addition, the rate of association of [3H]ouabain binding to substitution P118K is 2-fold slower than that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that the H1-H2 domain may participate directly in ouabain binding as well as be involved in conformational changes, both of which could affect the sensitivity of the enzyme to ouabain."
https://openalex.org/W1480346916,"P-type ATPases are a family of cation transport enzymes present in all species from bacteria to mammals whose members mediate membrane flux of all common biologically relevant cations. More than 50 members of this family of transporters have been sequenced; extensive structural data are available, and several members have been analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. Nonetheless, there is no current consensus regarding their membrane topology. In this work, the Salmonella typhimurium Mg2+ transporting P-type ATPase encoded by the MgtB locus has been used as a model for P-type ATPases. Unlike other prokaryotic P-type ATPases, the MgtB protein is similar in length, amino acid sequence, and hydropathy profile to known eukaryotic P-type ATPases. The membrane topology of MgtB was analyzed by several epitope insertions in MgtB and from the activity of 35 protein fusions between MgtB and the reporter enzymes BlaM (beta-lactamase) and LacZ (beta-galactosidase). The epitope insertions within MgtB all retained function as assessed by cation uptake assays and were regulated normally by the level of Mg2+ within the growth medium. The epitope insertion and fusion protein data are completely incompatible with the numerous previously proposed models for P-type ATPases predicting 7, 8, 9, or 12 transmembrane segments. Rather, they indicate that MgtB contains 10 transmembrane segments with both amino and carboxyl termini residing within the cytosol. By extension, we suggest that all eukaryotic P-type ATPases contain 10 transmembrane segments with both termini within the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1541290836,"Rabphilin-3A is a putative target protein for Rab3A, a member of the small G protein superfamily that is implicated in regulated secretion, particularly in neurotransmitter release. Rabphilin-3A contains at least two functionally different domains: the N-terminal Rab3A-binding domain and the C-terminal C2 domain, which interacts with both Ca2+ and phospholipid. Because Rabphilin-3A interacts preferentially with GTP-Rab3A rather than with GDP-Rab3A, we have examined here whether Rabphilin-3A affects the GTPase activity of Rab3A. Rabphilin-3A and its N-terminal fragment, but not its C-terminal fragment, very weakly stimulated the basal GTPase activity of Rab3A. However, Rabphilin-3A and its N-terminal fragment strongly inhibited the Rab3A GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of Rab3A. Ca2+ and phospholipid showed no effect on these activities of Rabphilin-3A. The physiological significance of the GAP activity of Rabphilin-3A is obscure, but it is likely that Rabphilin-3A inhibits Rab3A GAP activity and keeps Rab3A in the GTP-bound active form during its action as a target molecule for Rab3A."
https://openalex.org/W1514785608,"The cot gene is an oncogene encoding serine/threonine kinases isolated by DNA transfection assay. In this study, we isolated cDNA for the human cot protooncogene (proto-cot gene) and examined the structure and function of its gene products. The proto-cot gene has an open reading frame encoding 467 amino acids of which the first 397 amino acids are identical to those in the corresponding part of the cot gene. The protein products of the proto-cot gene were identified as 58- and 52-kDa proteins with intrinsic protein serine/threonine kinase activity. These two protein species were suggested to be generated by alternative initiation from two AUGs. The 58- and 52-kDa proteins are both localized predominantly in the cytosol, but the 58-kDa protein has a shorter half-life than the 52-kDa protein, suggesting the importance of the amino-terminal domain in regulating the stability of the proto-Cot protein. More interestingly, the 58-kDa protein showed stronger transforming activity than the 52-kDa protein, although this activity was much weaker than that of the Cot oncoprotein. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of the Cot protein may be necessary for cellular transformation, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain may negatively regulate the transforming activity."
https://openalex.org/W1537742882,"A high level of plasma fibrinogen has been shown to be an important risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke. Thus, we were prompted to investigate regulation of human fibrinogen biosynthesis, a process wherein expression of the B beta-chain of fibrinogen appears to be rate-limiting for fibrinogen secretion. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with synthetic probes representing portions of the human B beta-fibrinogen promoter, we have defined several elements that bind distinct classes of transcription factors present in human hepatoma cell nuclear extracts. The contribution of each element to promoter activity was demonstrated in transfection experiments using promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and human hepatoma cells. Our observations indicate that two distinct sequence elements are required for maximal induction of transcription by interleukin-6. One of these sequences is an IL-6-RE core element similar to that reported for the rat alpha 2-macroglobulin promoter and the other is a binding site for the C/EBP family of transcription factors. We also report two additional elements, one negative- and one positive-acting, that bind novel sequence-specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W1587369907,"Fibroblasts have cell surface sites that mediate the assembly of fibronectin (Fn) into the extracellular matrix. Treatment of fibroblasts with kinase inhibitors (ML-7, H7, HA1004, calphostin C, and staurosporine) resulted in the rapid decrease in the binding of 125I-labeled plasma Fn and iodinated amino-terminal fragments of Fn. The dose responses of the four inhibitors suggest that the target kinase is protein kinase C (PKC) rather than the cyclic AMP- or cyclic GMP-dependent kinases. Three different fibroblastic cells were similarly affected. The inhibition was rapid and reversible and could not be overcome by increasing concentrations of Fn. Treatment of fibroblasts with phorbol esters and other agents that activate PKC resulted in increased amounts of 125I-labeled Fn binding to the cell surface. These results imply that Fn matrix assembly is modulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1591271884,"Rat DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) is a 39-kDa monomeric protein, organized in two structurally and functionally distinct domains. The 8-kDa NH2-terminal domain binds single-stranded (ss) DNA, whereas the 31-kDa COOH-terminal domain does not. To facilitate studies on ssDNA binding structure-function relationships of beta-pol, we overexpressed the 8-kDa domain in Escherichia coli, and purified the recombinant protein to homogeneity. Single-stranded nucleic acid binding of the recombinant 8-kDa domain was found to be similar to that previously reported for the 8-kDa fragment prepared by proteolysis of intact beta-pol (Kumar, A., Widen, S. G., Williams, K. R., Kedar, P. Karpel, R. L., and Wilson, S. H. (1990b) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2124-2131; Casas-Finet, J. R., Kumar, A., Morris, G., Wilson, S. H., and Karpel, R. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19618-19625). Residues in or near the DNA-binding pocket of the recombinant 8-kDa domain were examined by photochemical cross-linking to [32P] p(dT)16. Cross-linking was localized to a tryptic fragment spanning residues 28 through 35 and a V8 protease fragment spanning residues 27 through 58. Sequence analysis of the various [32P]p(dT)16-labeled proteins indicated that Ser30 and His34 were modified by cross-linking to p(dT)16. Therefore, these residues of the ssDNA-binding domain of beta-pol appear to be in close contact with this nucleic acid probe."
https://openalex.org/W1594019881,"Abstract The human neurofibromatosis type 1 gene encodes a Ras GAP (GTPase-activating protein) of 2818 amino acids called NF1. This GAP contains a domain of 338 amino acids (residues 1194-1531) called NF1-GRD, which shares 26% sequence identity with the C-terminal domain (GAP1C, residues 709-1044) of another Ras GAP called GAP1. Both NF1-GRD and GAP1C activate normal Ras GTPases but not oncogenic mutants such as v-Ha-Ras. Any attempt to reverse the v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant transformation by the GAP1C has, so far, been unsuccessful. However, we have found that when the NF1-GRD is overexpressed in v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells, it greatly reduces their ability to form colonies in a soft agar, the property tightly associated with their malignancy. This is, so far, the first demonstration that a Ras-binding protein can act as a potent antagonist of the oncogenic Ras mutants in mammalian cells. In an attempt to further screen the smallest anti-oncogenic fragment derived from the NF1-GRD, we have prepared a series of its deletion mutants and examined their interaction with Ras first by monitoring their GAP activity (ability to activate the normal Ras GTPase). The deletion analysis has revealed that the N-terminal 247 amino acids (residues 1194-1440) of NF1-GRD are not required for its GAP activity, suggesting that its remaining domain of 91 amino acids (NF91, residues 1441-1531) is sufficient to bind the v-Ha-Ras, although its GAP activity is 20 times lower than the NF1-GRD. The NF91 is indeed able to reverse the v-Ha-Ras-induced malignant transformation as the NF1-GRD. The NF91 is, so far, the smallest among the tumor suppressor proteins that show the anti-v-Ha-Ras action in vivo. Thus, the NF91 appears to be a good starting material from which a smaller and more potent v-Ha-Ras antagonist could be devised to be used as a potential cure for the human cancers caused by the Ras mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1539890723,"Protein degradation in Escherichia coli involves the ATP-dependent serine protease La. Protease La is a homotetramer with one proteolytic and one ATP binding site per monomer. Its proteolytic activity has been shown to be highly increased by simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP, which is essential for the degradation of protein substrates by this enzyme. We have cloned and purified a proteolytically inactive La mutant, in which the catalytically active serine residue at position 679 was replaced by alanine. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra of the purified wild type and mutant enzyme revealed identical conformations of the proteins. Based on this observation, the catalytic properties of the wild type enzyme and the S679A mutant were compared. Although the S679A mutant lacks proteolytic activity toward both peptide and protein substrates under all conditions investigated, its ATPase activity is completely unaffected by the removal of the protease activity. Since protein substrates stimulate the ATP-dependent hydrolysis of peptides by protease La, it has been argued that this stimulation is due to interactions with a regulatory binding site on the enzyme. In accordance with this model, protein substrates such as alpha-casein and denatured bovine serum albumin stimulate the ATPase activity of the S679A mutant to the same degree as in the active protease. Therefore, the intrinsic ATPase activity of protease La as well as its stimulation is not dependent on the simultaneous hydrolysis of the protein substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1668646263,"beta-Glucuronidase undergoes proteolytic C-terminal processing during or after its transport to lysosomes or endosomes. We determined the C-terminal processing site for human placental beta-glucuronidase to be the peptide bond between Thr633-Arg634. To evaluate the role of the 18-amino acid peptide removed in C-terminal processing, we changed the codon for Arg634 to a stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis and studied expression of the truncated mutant enzyme in COS-7 cells. An increased fraction of newly synthesized enzyme from R634Stop cDNA was secreted. Pulse-chase experiments provided no evidence for increased degradation of the intracellular R634Stop enzyme. The total amount of catalytic activity expressed from the R634Stop mutant cDNA was only half that seen with the wild type cDNA, and the Kcat of the mutant enzyme was 52% that of wild type enzyme. These results indicate that the C-terminal propeptide in the precursor is important for beta-glucuronidase to achieve maximal activity. The truncated enzyme formed hybrid tetramers in cotransfection experiments with the cDNA for rat beta-glucuronidase. There appeared to be no decrease in stability of the R634Stop enzyme, since chaotropic agents, heat treatment, and pH had similar effects on the mutant and the wild type enzymes. The uptake rate of the truncated mutant (R634Stop) enzyme by beta-glucuronidase-deficient human fibroblast cells was only 55-60% that of the wild type enzyme. Binding to the immobilized cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and measurement of the 32P-labeled phosphorylated oligosaccharides revealed that the truncated mutant enzyme was 32-34% less phosphorylated and appeared to contain proportionately more covered phosphate groups than the wild type enzyme. These results suggest that the propeptide influences the accessibility to both processing enzymes that produce the mannose-6-phosphate recognition marker on beta-glucuronidase."
https://openalex.org/W1608832822,"We showed previously that a truncated form of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor lacking its kinase region can form a nonfunctional heterodimer with the wild-type beta-receptor and thereby inhibit its signal transduction. In this paper we investigated whether the truncated form of either alpha- or beta-receptor could block the function of the other type of wild-type PDGF receptor. When the truncated alpha-receptor was expressed in Xenopus oocytes in excess over either the wild-type alpha- or beta-receptor, the Ca2+ mobilization signal elicited by either the wild-type alpha- or beta-receptor was completely blocked. The truncated beta-receptor abolished signaling by the wild-type alpha-receptor in response to PDGF-AB or -BB. However signal transduction by the alpha-receptor in response to PDGF-AA was not affected by the truncated beta-receptor. In the presence of PDGF-AB or -BB, both the wild-type and truncated beta-receptors formed a heterologous complex with the alpha-receptor in intact cells. A kinase-inactive beta-receptor (an ATP-binding site mutation) became cross-phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the co-expressed wild-type alpha-receptor in response to PDGF-AB or -BB but not in response to PDGF-AA. These findings indicate that the alpha-and beta-receptors interact in response to PDGF-AB or -BB and are consistent with the hypothesis that the truncated alpha-receptor inhibits function of the wild-type beta-receptor through formation of a ligand-dependent nonfunctional alpha beta-heterodimer. A similar heterodimer can form between the truncated beta-receptor and the wild-type alpha-receptor. These observations provide useful information for future studies using dominant-negative mutations of PDGF receptors to selectively inhibit the actions of specific PDGFs in animals."

The protein was isolated from serum-free culture medium directly by chromatography on an ovine prolactin affinity column and yielded approximately 1.5 mg of protein/liter of suspension culture. The extracellular domain of the rat prolactin receptor inhibited the ovine prolactin-dependent mitogenesis of rat lymphoma Nb2 cells with an IC50 of 7.1 pM and bound 125I-labeled ovine prolactin with a Kd of 1.21 +/- 0.19 nM. In contrast, the binding of the 125I-labeled extracellular domain to ovine prolactin exhibited positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.73. High pressure gel filtration chromatography was used to demonstrate the formation of a complex consisting of one molecule of ovine prolactin and two molecules of the extracellular domain of the rat prolactin receptor. Complex formation occurred with human growth hormone, but not with ovine growth hormone, a non-lactogen."
https://openalex.org/W1492938815,"Site-specific antibodies against different regions of the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor) were developed and used as probes for immunoblotting of the major tryptic fragments resulting from partial digestion of the ryanodine receptor in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Five major tryptic fragments, some of which migrated as doublets, with apparent masses of 150/140, 110/100, 55, 170/160, and 76 kDa were ordered so that they covered the bulk of the protein from the NH2 to the COOH terminus. Tryptic subfragments of 53, 63, and 115/95 kDa were also derived from the 150/140-, 110/100-, and 170/160-kDa fragments, respectively. All of these fragments and subfragments were detected only in the insoluble membrane fraction of the trypsinized sarcoplasmic reticulum. Upon Na2CO3 extraction, the 150/140-, 110/100-, and 55-kDa fragments could be solubilized, suggesting their origin in the cytoplasmic domain of the ryanodine receptor. The 170/160- and 76-kDa fragments and the 115/95-kDa subfragment remained insoluble, suggesting their origin in the transmembrane region of the ryanodine receptor. The 150/140-, 110/100-, 170/160-, and 76-kDa fragments and the 115/95 subfragment co-migrated near the bottom of a sucrose density gradient after CHAPS solubilization, suggesting that they were associated in an oligomeric complex. By contrast, the 53- and 63-kDa subfragments and the 55-kDa fragment were detected near the top of the sucrose gradient after CHAPS solubilization, suggesting that they were not involved in the formation of the core of the oligomeric complex. These studies identify 7 sites that are exposed to trypsin in the ryanodine receptor in sarcoplasmic reticulum, 3 of which are novel and 4 of which are in the same location as proteolytic cleavage sites identified previously (Marks, A. R., Fleischer, S., and Tempst, P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13143-13149)."
https://openalex.org/W1504676529,"The action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was investigated in single rat pituitary corticotrophs using indo-1 microfluorimetry, in part in combination with the monitoring of membrane electrical events with the perforated patch-clamp technique. In corticotrophs showing the series of short-lived [Ca2+]i rises (transient pattern) in response to corticotropin-releasing factor, 100 nM AVP evoked either the transient pattern or a [Ca2+]i spike followed by a sustained plateau (spike/plateau pattern). Not all corticotrophs responded to changes in AVP concentration in the same manner. Some cells exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i transient activity, whereas others showing the spike/plateau at high AVP concentrations responded to low agonist concentrations by two [Ca2+]i responses: a slow rising step or two to three sinusoidal-like oscillations. Combined [Ca2+]i and patch-clamp recordings as well as manipulation of extracellular Ca2+ showed that both transient pattern and the plateau of spike/plateau response depended on Ca2+ entry mainly through voltage-gated, dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. By contrast, step, oscillations, and spike were due to Ca2+ release from internal stores. These Ca(2+)-mobilizing responses caused the activation of Ca(2+)-activated, apamin-sensitive K+ channels, which led to a membrane hyperpolarization. These results reveal cell-specific [Ca2+]i signals and associated electrical events in individual AVP-stimulated corticotrophs."
https://openalex.org/W1515075543,"Horseradish peroxidase, when incubated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine-specific reagent, shows time-dependent inactivation to oxidize aromatic electron donor, guaiacol. The inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics with a second order rate constant of 0.67 min-1 M-1. The pH dependence of inactivation shows an inflection point at 6.02, indicating histidine derivatization by DEPC. A difference spectrum of modified versus native enzyme shows a peak at 244 nm for N-carbethoxyhistidine that is diminished by hydroxylamine. Stoichiometric studies indicate that out of 2 histidine residues modified, one is responsible for inactivation. A plot of log reciprocal half-time of inactivation against log DEPC concentration suggests that only 1 histidine is essential. From the computer-stimulated structure of horseradish peroxidase, we tentatively suggest that this critical histidine is most likely distal histidine 42. Binding studies show that this histidine is not involved in guaiacol binding. Modified enzyme forms compound I with H2O2 but not compound II, suggesting a block of electron transfer process. Modified compound I cannot oxidize guaiacol as evidenced by the absence of donor-induced spectral shift from 408 nm, suggesting a block of electron transfer from bound donor to compound I. We suggest that this tentatively identified distal histidine controls aromatic donor oxidation by regulating electron transport without affecting donor binding or compound I formation."
https://openalex.org/W1526141535,"In contrast to typical secretory proteins, apolipoprotein B pauses at distinct points along the nascent chain during its translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Specific pause transfer sequences mediate such discrete pauses in the translocation of apolipoprotein B. These sequences have been shown to confer this translocational behavior to heterologous chimeric proteins. To investigate the function of pause transfer sequences, we: (i) examine whether the multiple pause transfer sequences of apolipoprotein B act independently or are dependent upon the action of upstream pause transfer sequences, (ii) identify residues of the prototypical B' pause transfer sequence that are involved in pausing, and (iii) determine whether the stopping step of a translocational pause is a consequence of translational pausing, as has been suggested by other investigators. We conclude that pause transfer sequences act independently of each other and of translation; translocational pausing occurs even in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. Furthermore, like other topogenic sequences such as signal sequences, pause transfer sequences are degenerate in structure yet have distinctive features necessary for their action. This characterization of the B' pause transfer sequence may aid in the identification of such sequences elsewhere in apolipoprotein B and in other proteins and has implications for the mechanism of translocational pausing."
https://openalex.org/W1543094789,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), the first catalytic component of the bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, is composed of two nonidentical subunits in a tetrameric alpha 2 beta 2 form. The sulfhydryl-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used to identify the reactivities and function of cysteinyl residues and subsequent identification of these residues in the active site of bovine E1. Treatment of E1 with 0.2 mM NEM resulted in loss (90%) of enzymatic activity; the inactivation followed bimolecular reaction kinetics. The inactivation was almost entirely prevented by thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) and pyruvate; protection is probably due to formation of the hydroxyethylidene-TPP intermediate. To identify the reactive cysteinyl residues in the active site region, the nonessential SH groups in E1 were first modified with NEM in the presence of TPP and pyruvate. After quenching with dithiothreitol and removal of the substrate and cofactor by dialysis, the modified E1 was treated with [14C]NEM to label the exposed cysteinyl residue(s) in or near the active site region. The data indicate that NEM reacted in the active site region of the E1 component with a stoichiometry of 2 mol of [14C]NEM bound per mol of E1 tetramer. The initial rapid labeling of E1 with [14C]NEM established that incorporation was predominantly into the alpha subunit. A single radiolabeled peptide was isolated following V8 protease digestion of radiolabeled E1 by [14C]NEM. Sequence analysis of the labeled peptide derived from bovine E1 demonstrated that the labeled cysteinyl residue was equivalent to Cys-62 in the alpha subunit (mature form) of human E1."
https://openalex.org/W1586839602,"Several members of the Src family, including Blk, Lyn, Fyn(T), and Lck, are expressed in B cells. These kinases associate with the antigen receptor complex, and the activities of Blk, Fyn(T), and Lyn increase upon receptor engagement. Differences in the amino acid sequences and patterns of expression of these kinases suggest that they serve distinct functions. In this communication it is shown that the SH2 domains from Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T) preferentially bind distinct sets of phosphoproteins from the mature B cell line A20. These interactions were found to depend on recognition of phosphotyrosine. The Blk SH2 domain bound more than 10 distinct phosphoprotein species, most of which reacted with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody; the phosphotyrosine content of these proteins was increased if surface immunoglobulin was cross-linked before extracts were made. Phosphoproteins of 72, 76, 115, and 130 kDa bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T). Phosphoamino acid analysis of these four proteins revealed that each contained phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Proteins of 90 kDa, 130 kDa, and 150 kDa were preferentially bound by the Blk SH2 domain, while the Fyn(T) SH2 domain showed preferential binding to proteins of 76 and 180 kDa. The Lyn SH2 binding profile resembled that of Blk, but differences in the binding specificities of these kinases were also observed. Thus, among proteins that exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation following antigen receptor cross-linking, several have been identified that bind preferentially to SH2 domains of Blk, Fyn(T), or Lyn, suggesting that these kinases serve distinct functions. In addition, chimeric Fyn(T)-Blk SH2 domains were shown to be functional in binding assays and to exhibit binding specificities intermediate between those of the parent domains, consistent with the interpretation that the differences we observe in phosphoprotein binding by Fyn(T) and Blk SH2 domains reflect differences in their native structures."
https://openalex.org/W1635247575,"Peptides from the alpha 1 domain of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigen (MHC class I), e.g. Dk-(61-85) and Dk-(62-85), have been shown previously to augment glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated cells and to inhibit insulin receptor internalization (Stagsted, J., Reaven, G. M., Hansen, T., Goldstein, A., and Olsson, L. (1990) Cell 62, 297-307). We now report that these peptides inhibit by 80-100% the internalization of glucose transporters (GLUT4) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors in insulin-stimulated cells and correspondingly double insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity and the number of GLUT4 and IGF-II receptors on the cell surface. In addition, the peptides enhance the apparent affinity about 3-fold of IGF-II binding to its receptor. It is concluded that the effects of the peptides on glucose transport and IGF-II binding are a consequence of the peptide-mediated inhibition of internalization of GLUT4 and IGF-II receptor. The active peptides are derived from the alpha 1 domain of a MHC class I molecule, suggesting that the latter is involved in regulation of internalization of cell surface integral membrane proteins such as the GLUT4 and IGF-II and insulin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1529849365,"Abstract Thioredoxin has been identified as a key component of the pregnancy system, a system of components present in pregnancy sera which expresses a lymphocyte modifying activity in an assay known as the rosette inhibition assay. Although thioredoxin alone is inactive, addition of thioredoxin to lymphocytes in combination with nonpregnancy sera or platelet-activating factor results in a positive response. We have changed several amino acids of human thioredoxin by site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the residues required for this cooperative function. Conversion of the two active site residues (cysteines 32 and 35) to serines results in a protein devoid of classical redox activity; however, this protein retained its ability to cooperate with non-pregnancy sera or platelet-activating factor in the rosette inhibition assay. Vertebrate thioredoxins contain an additional conserved pair of cysteine residues in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Changing both to serines resulted in no change in redox activity but completely abolished function in the rosette inhibition assay. Further study revealed this function was solely dependent on cysteine 74 as conversion of only cysteine 74 to serine abolished function, whereas replacement of only cysteine 70 with serine had no effect. The nonfunctional mutants counteracted the action of pregnancy serum in the assay strongly supporting the hypothesis that thioredoxin is an integral part of the early pregnancy factor system with residue cysteine 74 having an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1660545959,"The small GTP-binding protein Rab3A (identical to smg p25A) is expressed in neural/exocrine/endocrine cells, is distributed between the cytosol and secretory vesicle membranes, and may cycle between these locations to regulate exocytosis. It is proposed that the GTP/GDP state of Rab3A controls this distribution. In PC12 cells, cytosolic Rab3A is predominantly GDP-bound, whereas membrane-associated Rab3A is approximately 50% GTP-bound. Two cytosolic factors, GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GRF), act only on GDP.Rab3A, and preferentially with post-translationally modified Rab3A. Rab3A GTPase-activating protein (GAP) does not preferentially act on processed Rab3A, and interacts selectively with GTP.Rab3A. GDI antagonizes GRF but not GAP activity toward Rab3A. These data are consistent with the concept of an ordered Rab3A cycle controlled by factors that regulate the guanine-nucleotide binding state of Rab3A."
https://openalex.org/W1536195536,"The FLP recombinase of the 2-microns plasmid of Saccharomyces cerevisiae binds to its recognition target (FRT) site, induces a bend in the DNA, and promotes DNA cleavage and strand ligation. We have subjected this protein to limited proteolysis and have purified three polypeptides: P13 (13 kDa), P21 (21 kDa), and P32 (32 kDa). These peptides are derived from the following regions of FLP: P13, amino acids 2-123; P21, amino acids 148-346; P32, amino acids 124-423. In this report, we show that P13 binds to DNA nonspecifically and P32, like P21, binds to the FRT site specifically. A single molecule of P32 is able to induce a bend in the DNA of 55 degrees, similar to that induced by intact FLP (63 degrees). P13 enhances the binding of P21 or P32 to the FRT site. Both P32 and P21 can catalyze DNA ligation in combination with P13. P32 can cleave and covalently attach to the FRT site in combination with P13, whereas P21 cannot. These results suggest that FLP contains two DNA-binding domains. A nonspecific DNA-binding region is located in the NH2-terminal 123 amino acids, whereas the region that imparts specific DNA-binding resides in amino acids 148-346. Only the regions in P13 and P21 are needed for ligation activity, but those in P13 and P32 are required for cleavage."

The veracity of the TS assay (known as the tritium release assay) employed in these experiments may be compromised, however, because it requires the S phase-specific enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) to phosphorylate the substrate [5-3H]dUrd. In our study, this problem was further illustrated as the phosphorylated products of [14C]dCyd and [6-3H]dUrd were simultaneously quantitated to determine the activities of TS, TK, and dCyd kinase in intact CCRF-CEM cells. TS and dCyd kinase were unaffected by aphidicolin, hydroxyurea, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, whereas TK was strongly inhibited by these agents. Elevation of the cellular dTTP pool that accompanied drug treatment was not the primary mechanism affecting TK activity because incubation of cells with dCyd elevated the dTTP pool to similar levels, but did not inhibit TK to the same extent as did the drugs. Furthermore, after cells were washed from aphidicolin, [6-3H]dCyd incorporation, which primarily labels dTMP in DNA, proceeded at a linear rate, whereas a lag period of 15 min was observed before [3H]dThd was incorporated at a linear rate. These results suggest that TK activity is affected by more than one mechanism in intact cells. Because the activities of dCyd kinase and dCMP deaminase do not fluctuate as much as that of TK in response to changes in DNA synthesis activity and cell cycle, dCyd incorporation appears to be a more reliable assay of TS in intact cells than does dUrd incorporation. Our findings also imply that [3H]dThd incorporation assays may overestimate inhibition of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1601912001,"We have selectively synthesized a number of peptides encompassing the region of helix 3 of growth hormone (GH). These peptides and native human (h) GH have been evaluated for mitogenic and receptor activities in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. In this system, wild type hGH is anti-mitogenic. In contrast, hGH 108-129 stimulated DNA synthesis while other GH-derived peptides were ineffective. hGH (L) 108-129 had an EC50 of about 0.2 nM and was maximally effective at about 0.5 nM in stimulating [3H]thymidine incorporation in 3T3-F442A cells. hGH (L) 108-129 was mitogenically as active as insulin-like growth factor-I and more active than insulin. It was less effective than transforming growth factor-beta. By cell cycle analysis, hGH (L) 108-129 increased the proportion of cells in S/G2/M phases to 28%. hGH, when coincubated with hGH (L) 108-129, blocked the mitogenic response of the peptide. A monoclonal antibody to the GH receptor significantly reduced binding of 125I-hGH to its receptor but had no effect on binding of 125I-hGH (L) 108-129. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-hGH to its receptor was not duplicated with 125I-hGH (L) 108-129. No other GH peptides or insulin competed for binding of 125I-hGH 108-129. Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd of 5.2 nM with 5.6 x 10(5) binding sites/cell for hGH (L) 108-129. These studies indicate that hGH (L) 108-129, a sequence encompassing helix 3 of hGH, acts by binding to a site other than the GH receptor and evokes high mitogenic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1555185061,"We have isolated recombinant genomic clones encompassing several kilobase pairs of the 5'-flanking regions of both the human and murine gas-1 gene (growth arrest-specific gene 1). Both species share a highly conserved region of approximately 550 base pairs upstream of the gas-1 transcription start site. Deletion analysis of the murine gas-1 promoter demonstrated that a fragment containing the first 665 base pairs is sufficient to drive the serum-regulated expression of a luciferase reporter gene in NIH3T3 cells, in a manner qualitatively reflecting the activity of the endogenous gene. Gel retardation assays indicated the presence of a number of DNA-binding proteins specific for sequences contained within the gas-1 transcription regulatory region. Comparative studies with extracts prepared from growing and resting cells revealed several growth state-specific binding activities. One promoter fragment that bound prominent growth- and arrest-specific complexes was further analyzed by copper-phenanthroline footprinting. It was found that the same DNA element is a target both for growth- and for arrest-specific activities. The factors characterized in this study are the first candidates for transcriptional regulators mediating cell growth-specific repression and/or growth arrest-specific activation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1542928087,"Abstract The control of hepatic 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression by glucagon was studied. Intraperitoneal administration of glucagon rapidly decreased the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content by phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and diminution of its Vmax. Immunologic studies using a specific liver antibody showed that the amount of enzyme rapidly decreased. Northern blot analysis showed that the isozyme expressed is the adult liver form. The 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase mRNA content decreased, whereas that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased, and that of albumin did not change. Run-on transcription assays with isolated nuclei showed inhibition in the relative transcription rate of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase gene and a stimulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. The regulation of mRNA stability of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase by glucagon was also studied. The half-life of mRNA decreased in the presence of glucagon, suggesting that proteins modulated by a glucagon-dependent process are regulating its stability. The time course of mRNA levels correlated with the transcription inhibition of gene and destabilization of mRNA, indicating that glucagon modulates 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase gene expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W2127260144,"We have recently described the appearance of a specific DNA-binding protein in nuclei from human cells exposed to ionizing radiation which was not detected in nuclear extracts from unperturbed cells (Singh, S. P., and Lavin, M. F. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 5279-5285). We report here a similar activity which is constitutively present in nuclei of both unirradiated and irradiated cells from patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). Activity was present in unirradiated nuclear extracts from 3 A-T cell lines of different complementation groups, but was not detected or was present only at a low level in 4 controls. Active protein was detected in the cytoplasm of both cell types. Exposure to ionizing radiation did not change the amount of DNA binding activity in A-T nuclei but led to an increase in nuclei from 4 control cell lines. Purification of the binding activities from A-T nuclei and control cytoplasm was carried out by affinity chromatography, as described previously for control extracts (Teale, B., Singh, S. P., Khanna, K. K., Findik, D., and Lavin, M. F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10295-10301). Southwestern analysis and UV cross-linking confirmed the presence of a major DNA-binding species at 70 kDa in both cases with a minor binding activity at 47 kDa also evident. It was not possible to distinguish between the binding activities from A-T and control cells under different conditions, and phosphorylation was required for binding activity in both cases. Footprint analysis revealed that the same sequence was being recognized by the control and A-T proteins. The constitutive presence of a specific radiation-responsive DNA-binding protein in A-T cells may be indicative of a continuous state of stress in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1595665997,"We have previously expressed the human insulin receptor beta subunit domain containing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (IRTMTPK) in insect cells, and showed that the purified IRTMTPK was highly active (Li, S. L., Yan, P.-F., Pax, I. B., and Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 12455-12462). To investigate the role of COOH-terminal and acidic domains of the insulin receptor kinase, we have expressed deletion mutants IRTMTPK delta CT (delta 76 amino acids) and IRTMTPK delta Acid (delta 19 amino acids). Both enzymes were purified by a one-step method using the same immunoaffinity column as used for IRTMTPK. While Km and Vmax for prephosphorylated IRTMTPK and delta Acid mutant enzyme determined using poly(Glu, Tyr)(4:1) were similar, catalytic efficiency of the delta CT mutant enzyme was significantly lower than those of IRTMTPK and delta Acid mutant enzyme as judged by Km and Vmax. Experiments for thermostability and susceptibility to proteases revealed that Tm of delta CT mutant enzyme was 3.5 degrees C lower than that of IRTMTPK enzyme (= 33.3 degrees C) and that delta CT mutant enzyme was digested by either trypsin or Lys-C into a 28,000 core domain much faster than IRTMTPK. Activation of delta CT mutant enzyme by polylysine was less significant than that of IRTMTPK and delta Acid mutant enzyme, approximately 4-versus approximately 17-fold. These studies suggested that the COOH-terminal domain plays important roles in both catalytic efficiency and stability of the insulin receptor kinase, and that the acidic domain by itself is not responsible for kinase activation by polylysine."
https://openalex.org/W1594626013,"Models of the micelle-bound conformation of a 17-residue major histocompatibility complex-derived peptide, [Ala85]Dk(69-85), have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. This peptide is a truncated, substituted version of Dk(61-85), which is a fragment of the murine major histocompatibility complex class I molecule H-2Dk. Dk(61-85) has been shown to adopt an ordered conformation required for augmentation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Stagsted, J., Baase, W. A., Goldstein, A., and Olsson, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12844-12847). [Ala85]Dk(69-85) retains full biological activity. Thirty-eight converged NMR structures of [Ala85]Dk(69-85) bound to dodecyl phosphocholine micelles have been generated. The NMR-derived models display a propensity for a type-I beta-bend involving residues 73-76 and an amphipathic helical region involving residues 77-84. CD spectra yield a helical content (8% at 20-25 degrees C) consistent with transient, partial helix formation. The relative orientation of the beta-bend region with respect to the helical region is not well defined by the NMR data. This may reflect true heterogeneity of the micelle-bound conformation. The NMR structures were compared with a model of [Ala85]Dk(69-85) derived from the x-ray coordinates of the human major histocompatibility complex class I allele HLA-Aw68 (Garrett, T. P. J., Saper, M. A., Bjorkmann, P. J., Strominger, T. L., and Wiley, D. C. (1989) Nature 342, 692-696). Structural features that are important for the bioactivity of [Ala85]Dk(69-85) are discussed with reference to reported structure-activity relationships (Stagsted, J., Mapelli, C., Myers, C., Matthews, B. W., Anfinsen, C. B., Goldstein, A., and Olsson, L. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). A general description of the structural properties of the putative receptor site(s) that are likely to be required for binding [Ala85]Dk(69-85) is given."
