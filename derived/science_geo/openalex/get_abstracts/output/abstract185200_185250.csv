The ion channel TRPV4 is in the TRP family and is a candidate for a mechanosensitive calcium-permeable channel. It is located in dorsal root ganglia. In the present study, we show that disrupting the Trpv4 gene in mice markedly reduced the sensitivity of the tail to pressure and acidic nociception. The threshold to noxious stimuli and the conduction velocity of myelinated nerve responding to stimuli were also impaired. Activation of unmyelinated nerve was undetected. However, the mouse still retained olfaction, taste sensation, and heat avoidance. The TRPV4 channel expressed in vitro in Chinese hamster ovary cells was opened by low pH, citrate, and inflation but not by heat or capsaicin. These data identify the TRPV4 channel as essential for the normal detection of pressure and as a receptor of the high-threshold mechanosensory complex.

Stimulation of sensory receptors by pressure due to a weight affects a variety of sensations, including touch, pressure, and pain. The molecular mechanism underlying both touch and pain has been investigated by studies on mice lacking a mechanosensitive channel (1Price M.P. Gary R. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstkak R.F. Yangk B. Williamsonk R.A. Welsh M.J.

Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). A mouse disrupted with MEC/DEG has reduced low-threshold mechanosensation but the sense of acidic stimuli is not affected (1Price M.P. Gary R. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstkak R.F. Yangk B. Williamsonk R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A mouse lacking Trpv1 does not respond to stimulation with capsaicin; heat and acid induce nociception, but the knock-out shows response to the pressure sensation (2Caterina M.-J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). The ion channel that converts pressure or anisosmomolarity into electrical stimuli remains unknown. A clue to its identity came from the discovery of Osm-9 in a genetic screen of high-osmolarity-insensitive Caenorhabditis elegans mutants (3Heather A.C. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of Osm-9 is quite similar to the vanilloid-receptive channel, VR1 (TRPV1) (4Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar), as well as to TRPV4 (SAC1 (5Suzuki M. Ishibashi K. Imai M. J. Am. Soc.

Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). TRPV1 is a member of the TRP family; it has six transmembrane segments and ankyrin-like repeats and is responsive to the physical factor of heat. Assuming that the family operates through a mechanically gated channel, we have cloned the incomplete form of Trpv4 (a PCR-based chimera of TRPV1 and TRPV4) as a stretch-inhibitable channel (11Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, we did not confirm that TRPV4 was a mechanosensitive channel at that point. TRPV4 has been reported as a swell-activated but not inflation-activated channel (6Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Further it has also been reported to be activated by heat (12Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of TRPV4 in mechanosensation, we disrupted the mouse Trpv4 gene and then examined its role in the sensation of pressure. We reproduced affluent stimuli in vitro. Cloning of cDNA and Detection—Homologous cDNA of Trpv4 was screened by the BLAST program on the EST (expressed sequence tag) data base, resulting in two independent clones, Trpv2 and Trpv4 (GenBank™ accession number AB021875). The cloned cDNA was ligated to mammalian expression vector pCMV-SPORT (Invitrogen). A plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (pEGFP-N1, BD Biosciences) or red fluorescence protein (pDsRed1-N1, BD Biosciences) was used as a marker for transfection into cells, which was performed using FuGENE 6™ (Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH). The functional experiments were performed 48 h after the transfection. Reverse polymerase followed by polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: RT-PCR, reverse transcription followed by PCR; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; RR, rapid response with rapid inactivation. was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNAPCR, Takara, Osaka, Japan) with 0.3 μg of RNA as a template. The amplification conditions consisted of incubation at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for a total of 29 cycles. Antibody was raised against C-terminal peptide (CDGHQQGYAPK) in a solution using keyhole limpet homocyanin as a conjugate. The antigen of 1 mg/ml DW with 1 ml of Freund's adjuvant was injected intramuscularly into a New Zealand White rabbit followed by a biweekly booster injection of the same dose of the antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The titer of the serum used was more than 10,000 times higher than the control. To obtain polyclonal anti-TRPV4 antibodies, the IgG fraction was purified with a protein G column (HiTrap, Amersham Biosciences) and affinity-purified with a kit (Prot On™, MPS, San Diego). Western blot analysis with a blocking test by excess of antigen was performed to evaluate the specificity. Histologic staining was performed and detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Kyoto, Japan). Construction of Targeting Vector and Generation of Trpv4 Mutant Mice—We disrupted the Trpv4 gene by homologous recombination using the PKG-neo cassette and standard methods (13Mizuno A. Amizuka N. Irie K. Murakami A. Fujise N. Kanno T. Sato Y. Nakagawa N. Yasuda H. Mochizuki S. Gomibuchi T. Yano K. Shima N. Washida N. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Ozawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Murine genomic clones were obtained from a 129/SV mouse bacterial artificial chromosome genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) using Trpv4 cDNA as a probe. The targeting vector contained a 2.2-kb (short) and a 3.7-kb (long) arm of homology flanking a PKG-neo cassette. The vector was electroporated into RW4 embryonic stem cells (Genome Systems), which were selected in G418 (Invitrogen). The resulting chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females. Mice heterozygous for the Trpv4 mutation (TRP4+/–) were intercrossed to generate Trpv4-null mice (Trpv4–/–). The genotype was examined by Southern blot or PCR. Mice at 11–19 weeks of age were used throughout this experiment. Trpv4–/– mice were mated to C57BL/6 to the fourth generation. Sex-matched wild-type littermates (Trpv4+/+) were used as controls. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were carried out according to methods described previously (8Suzuki M. Ohki G. Mochizuki T. Somlo S. Ishibashi K. Imai M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded at room temperature with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Pflaz, Germany). Current was normalized by capacitance of the individual cell. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2,and3mm HEPES. The whole-cell patch pipette contained a filtered solution of 150 mm CsCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP (pH 7.2, pCa 7.6). To measure Ca2+/CS permeability the bath solution underwent a substitution with 10 mm CaCl2, 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 1 mm MgCl2,and3mm HEPES. To elucidate a candidate opener, a solution of 4-aminopyridine (10–5m), quinidine (10–5m), capsaicin (10–5m), and organic acids (1 mm) was used. A single channel of TRPV4 in inside-out configuration was observed with a symmetrical NaCl bath solution. Frequency of discharge in vivo from the hind limb was measured electrically with an amplifier (DAM-8, World Precision Instruments, FL) using methods described previously (14Kress M. Koltzenburg M. Reeh P.W. Handwerker H.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Action potentials were recorded using Axon software. The needle pricking the skin was connected to a pulse generator to determine the conduction velocity. The mechanical threshold was determined with a needle connected to a manometer. TRPV4 Is Distributed in Various Sensory Organs—According to Northern blot analysis, TRPV4 is rich in the kidney and lung, and precise detection by antibody or RT-PCR reveals its presence in various other organs than kidney and lung (7Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 27: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 9Delany L.S. Hurle M.

TRPV4 protein was analyzed histologically using Western blot analysis with antibody raised against the C terminus. An excess of antigen supported the specificity of this affinity-purified antibody (Fig. 1, upper left). Using the antibody, neuronal tissues were histologically stained. In the sensory system, neurons in the trigeminal nerve, cauda equina, skin nerve (9Delany L.S. Hurle M. Facer P. Alnadaf T. Plumpton C. Kinghorn I. See C.G. Costigan M. Anand P. Woolf C.J. Crowther D. Sanseau P. Tate S.N. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and cochlear hair cells (7Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 27: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) were positively stained. The internal elastic membrane but not the taste bud of the tongue was positively stained (Fig. 1). Disruption of the Trpv4 Gene—We made a knock-out mouse by a conventional method. We inserted a neo cassette into the fourth exon encoding the ankyrin-repeat domain (Fig. 2A). Southern blot revealed that the neo cassette was successfully inserted into the BglII fragment (Fig. 2B). Using RT-PCR with primers downstream from the targeted region and Northern blot (from lung, data not shown), we failed to detect transcripts in the trigeminal root and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of Trpv4–/–animals (Fig. 2C). Histologically, DRG stains positively but did not do so in the Trpv4–/– mice (Fig. 2D). Therefore, TRPV4 expression was successfully disrupted in the Trpv4–/– mice. Impaired Pressure and Acid Sensation in Trpv4–/– Mice— Trpv4–/–, heterozygous (+/–), and wild-type (+/+) mice were produced in the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. Trpv4–/– mice had normal appearance, growth, size, temperature, and fertility and showed no obvious behavioral abnormalities. Trpv4–/– and Trpv4+/+ mice avoided the odors induced by acetate, ammonium, benzene, ether, alcohol, pyrazine, and diacetyl. Dietary behavior was determined from the amount of jelly consumed. Over a 2-day period, mice were allowed to eat jelly containing 10% sucrose for 3 h/day. Then we changed the jelly by substituting other tastes. The taste sensation toward sweet (sucrose 10%, 1.2 ± 0.22 g/h), bitter (denatonium benzoate 1 mm, 1.1 ± 0.25 g/h), hot (capsaicin 0.1 mm, 0.01 ± 0 g/h), and sour (citrate 10%, 0.6 ± 0.23 g/h) tastes did not differ between Trpv4 +/+ and –/– mice (n = 8). Serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium were not different, and other abnormalities suggesting renal or hepatic failure were not found (data not shown). Trpv4–/– mice showed a significantly reduced response to harmful stimuli caused by pressure on the tail and reduced their frequency of writhing for 10 min after application of acetic acid to the abdomen (0.7%, 100 μl) (Fig. 3). However, a negative response to the hot plate (50 °C) was not altered, indicating that heat detection was intact. The response of von Fray hairs to low-threshold mechanosensation (i.e. touch) did not differ between Trpv4+/+ and Trpv4–/– mice (Fig. 3). Response of TRPV4 to Pressure in DRG—To explore the characteristics of neurons with TRPV4, we investigated neural activity in vivo. The response of the femoral nerve to a pricking on the glabrous skin was measured. Using a manometer to push the 23-gauge needle evoked a rapid response (RR) discharge (Fig. 4, A and B). The threshold was measured in triplicate for a single nerve resulting in 120 ± 15 mm Hg in Trpv4+/+ and 350 ± 50 mm Hg in Trpv4–/– (n = 16 mice, p < 0.01). The needle was connected to a pulse generator to measure the conduction velocity of the nerve under pressure. Mean conductance of these nerves was 15 and 14 m/s, respectively. A slow response (SR) nerve was defined as a nerve that responds slowly to the applied pressure. The nerve began to be activated at a threshold pressure. This pressure was 92 ± 15 mm Hg in Trpv4+/+ and 210 ± 40 mm Hg in Trpv4–/– (n = 8 mice, p < 0.01). The frequency of discharge over a 1-min span was markedly reduced in Trpv4–/– mice (Fig. 4, A and C). Pressure-response relationship, defined as inactivation by reduction of the pressure, occurred similarly in both animals within 1 min. The mean conductance of these nerves was similar to that of RR, 14 and 16 m/s, respectively. To detect C-fiber, we recorded RR and then measured the conduction, because RR was detected frequently. In 300 pricks, six sites revealed slower (<10 m/s) conductance in Trpv4+/+ but none in Trpv4–/– mice. This difference was significant, using chi square analysis (Fisher). Finally we touched the foot by von Fray hair (<1 g/mm2) and recorded the nerve activity. Although the conduction was not measured, this procedure evoked a continuous discharge with similar frequency in Trpv4+/+ (n = 12 sites) and Trpv4–/– mice (n = 14 sites). Electrophysiologic Analysis of TRPV4 Current in Vitro—We evaluated possible stimuli to the ion channel expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by patch clamping. We then estimated the candidate stimuli of taste and heat by their response to intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i with fluo-3 (data not shown). The following reagents or stimuli inducing a sour, bitter, or hot sensation were tested: 4-aminopyridine, quinidine, denatonium benzoate, capsaicin, heat at 50 °C, acetate, propionate, lactate, pyruvate, and citrate. Comparable with the structurally similar TRPV2, TRPV4 responded significantly to low pH and citrate (Fig. 5, A–C). Among the organic acids in neutral pH, citrate was a specific activator of the TRPV4 channel, which suggested its involvement in the mechanism of sour detection. The current was activated dose-dependently by H+ and citrate (Fig. 5D). The range of pH that activates TRPV4 is similar to that of TRPV1 (15Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) but lower than the acid-sensing ion channel (16Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). In the same way as seen in an earlier study (7Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 27: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), mechanical stresses by hypo-osmolarity induced little TRPV4, and heat failed to activate it. Inflation of cell volume approaching a factor of 1.5 was done by positive pressure through a patch pipette. This inflation significantly increased the evoked current as compared with the basal current (Fig. 5C, *), as well as that of TRPV4 (p < 0.05) compared with the evoked current (Fig. 5C, #). Response to heat (50 °C) was determined by [Ca2+]i, which rose in TRPV2 but not in TRPV4 (data not shown). The current encoded by TRPV4 was outwardly rectified, selective for cation (Cs:Na:NMDG:Ca:Cl = 1:1.1:0.01:9: 0.01) (8Suzuki M. Ohki G. Mochizuki T. Somlo S. Ishibashi K. Imai M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and abolished by 0.1 μm GdCl3 (Fig. 5B). Mice Lacking Trpv4 Showed an Abnormal Sensory Phenotype—Because of the small but significant localization of TRPV4 in the sensory system, we examined various sensations in Trpv4–/– mice. Because TRPV4 is similar to Osm-9 in structure, we examined odor first. An Osm-9 mutant does not avoid pyrazine and diacetyl, but Trpv4–/– did avoid them. Next, we examined taste sensation. Mice lacking Trpv4 do not avoid capsaicin in tap water, whereas Trpv4–/– mice avoided it. Although TRPV4 was detected in the trigeminal ganglion and tongue and it was opened by citrate, citrate did not affect the sour sensation in vivo. Most previous studies have substantiated that the that is channel sensitive to sour is the epithelial sodium channel (17Lindemann B. Nature. 2001; 413: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) in taste buds. TRPV1 is expressed in taste buds, sensing capsaicin directly, but TRPV4 was detected in the elastic membrane of the tongue and not in the taste buds, suggesting other mechanical roles in eating behavior. TRPV4 is known to be sensitive to temperature in in vitro HEK293 cells (12Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, chicken but not rodent TRPV4 in CHO cells is sensitive to temperature (7Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 27: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In both CHO and HEK293 cells, TRPV4 is activated at 34–40 °C but is not activated over 40 °C in vitro. This observation is compatible with the present data. TRPV4 detects a physiological range of temperatures rather than noxious heat. TRPV4 is not a nociceptor to heat but may play a role in thermoregulation during energy production, for example. Writhing is a characteristic response to acidic nociception in a rodent. Like TRPV1, TRPV4 is a kind of nociceptor. Acetic acid administration into the abdominal cavity induces a noxious pain; the pH that opened the channel in vitro was lower than the physiologic level. Such low pH damages tissues. TRPV1 is sensitive to this range of pH and plays a role in inflammatory hyperalgesia (18Davis J.B. Gray J. Gunthorpe M.J. Hatcher J.P. Davey P.T. Overend P. Harries M.H. Latcham J. Clapham C. Atkinson K. Hughes S.A. Rance K. Grau E. Harper A.J. Pugh P.L. Rogers D.C. Bingham S. Randall A. Sheardown S.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Thus, TRPV4 may play the same role in hyperalgesia, whereas the dorsal root acid-sensing channel detects the physiological range of the acidic irritant (19Perl E.R. Handbook of Physiology. 1984; II: 915-975Google Scholar, 20Price M.P. McIlwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J. Lewin G.R. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Touch by von Fray hair is a well known method to examine the sensation of innocuous stress. In BNC1 (brain sodium channel 1) knock-out mice, detection of touch sensation is impaired, but harmful pressure can still be detected (1Price M.P. Gary R. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstkak R.F. Yangk B. Williamsonk R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In Trpv1 knock-out mice, avoidance of heat is impaired, but harmful pressure can still be detected (2Caterina M.-J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Science. 2000; 288: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered that TRPV4 might play its own role in detection of high-threshold mechanosensation or pressure. The hot plate test, tail pressure, and von Fray touch are convenient tests that are easily reproduced. Taken together, impaired acid and pressure but intact hot and touch sensation was observed in Trpv4–/– mice, which was expected from the in vitro electrophysiologic study. Detection of Functional Pressure-sensing Nerves—We found the presence of TRPV4 in DRG neurons histologically by fluorescence. We also detected it using hematoxylin to visualize the cell body. Less than 10% of the neurons contained TRPV4. Most of the TRPV4-positive cells (38 of 50 cells counted) were less than 20 μm in diameter. The results are matched with the previous findings with in situ hybridization (21Schumacher M.A. Jong B.E. Frey S.L. Sudanagunta S.P. Capra N.F. Levine J.D. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 287: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Smaller cells spread nonmyelinated axons corresponding to C-fiber, which is believed to be nociceptive. Therefore, we expected that the impaired axon in Trpv4–/– would be C-fiber. Frequency of detection of the mechanosensitive C-fiber by the present method is rare (about 1 in 50 measurements) (14Kress M. Koltzenburg M. Reeh P.W. Handwerker H.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, no C-fiber responding to pressure was detected in 300 measurements in Trpv4–/–, suggesting that pressure-sensitive C-fiber was actually absent in Trpv4–/– mice. This result should be clarified in the future by another method. The impaired pressure-sensing fibers in Trpv4–/– were myelinated fibers according to their conductance. Burgess and Perl (22Burgess G.E. Perl E.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1967; 190: 541-562Crossref Scopus (392) Google Scholar) discovered a substantial population of high-threshold mechanoceptive sensory units in myelinated afferent fibers. The impaired conduction velocity was around 15 m/s, corresponding to Aβ-fiber or A-γ deflection. The high-threshold mechanosensation is transmitted through Aβ-fiber, innervated mostly to Ruffini endings, or through A-γ with nonspecialized endings (14Kress M. Koltzenburg M. Reeh P.W. Handwerker H.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Perl E.R. Handbook of Physiology. 1984; II: 915-975Google Scholar). TRPV4 is located in skin nerve endings as well as in mechanosensitive small bodies (9Delany L.S. Hurle M. Facer P. Alnadaf T. Plumpton C. Kinghorn I. See C.G. Costigan M. Anand P. Woolf C.J. Crowther D. Sanseau P. Tate S.N. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, pressure-sensing TRPV4 may be located primarily in these endings, transmitting the harmful input through myelinated fibers. Electrophysiological Characterization in Vitro in CHO Cells—TRPV4 is known as a swell-activated but not an inflation-activated channel (6Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). We expressed TRPV4 in CHO cells but failed to find significant activation by hypo-osmolarity. We could recognize an infrequent swell-activated current in TRPV4-expressed CHO. The level of the activated current was 400 pA in hypotonic solution, which is consistent with the results of our previous work (7Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J. Friedman J.M. Heller S. Cell. 2000; 27: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Thus a lack of significance in our expression may be due to a statistical reason. In contrast, a recent study showed that TRPV4 was expressed as an osmosensing channel when transfected in HEK293 cells (6Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). We thought that TRPV4 expressed differently in different cells and examined the current again. In the setting of 150 mm NaCl bath solution and 150 mm CsCl in the pipette fill, TRVP4 endowed a larger current compared with the control in HEK293 cells, which was activated by hypo-osmolarity and decreased by hyperosmolarity (data not shown). Strotmann et al. (6Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) explicitly indicate that TRPV4 is not activated by inflation of the HEK cell. However, elasticity of the cell membrane is different in individual cells, and response of the cytoskeleton to hypo-osmolarity may be dependent on the enrichment of water channel and elasticity. Thus inflation of the cell can be a stimulus to open TRPV4 when it is expressed in other cell types. The vanilloid receptor, TRPV1, is a channel that is sensitive to acid, capsaicin, and heat, where heat activation is the least sensitive stimulus in heterogeneously expressed cells using measurement of the currents (15Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Likewise, the TRPV4 channel is sensitive to acid, citrate, and swelling, where swelling is the least sensitive stimulus. In conclusion, TRPV4 detected a nociceptive level of mechanical stimuli, which was substantiated in vivo in the sensory system of Trpv4–/– mice. We thank Daiichi Pharmacy Co. for technical help."

https://openalex.org/W1985004048,"The live tuberculosis vaccines Mycobacterium bovis BCG (bacille Calmette-Guérin) and Mycobacterium microti both lack the potent, secreted T-cell antigens ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target) and CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein). This is a result of independent deletions in the region of deletion-1 (RD1) locus, which is intact in virulent members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. To increase their immunogenicity and protective capacity, we complemented both vaccines with different constructs containing the esxA and esxB genes, which encode ESAT-6 and CFP-10 respectively, as well as a variable number of flanking genes. Only reintroduction of the complete locus, comprising at least 11 genes, led to full secretion of the antigens and resulted in specific ESAT-6-dependent immune responses; this suggests that the flanking genes encode a secretory apparatus. Mice and guinea pigs vaccinated with the recombinant strain BCG::RD1-2F9 were better protected against challenge with M. tuberculosis, showing less severe pathology and reduced dissemination of the pathogen, as compared with control animals immunized with BCG alone."

https://openalex.org/W2017756762,"Eukaryotic chromosomes are packaged in nuclei by many orders of folding. Little is known about how higher-order chromatin packaging might affect gene expression. SATB1 is a cell-type specific nuclear protein that recruits chromatin-remodeling factors and regulates numerous genes during thymocyte differentiation. Here we show that in thymocyte nuclei, SATB1 has a cage-like 'network' distribution circumscribing heterochromatin and selectively tethers specialized DNA sequences onto its network. This was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization on wild-type and Satb1-null thymocytes using in vivo SATB1-bound sequences as probes. Many gene loci, including that of Myc and a brain-specific gene, are anchored by the SATB1 network at specific genomic sites, and this phenomenon is precisely correlated with proper regulation of distant genes. Histone-modification analyses across a gene-enriched genomic region of 70 kb showed that acetylation of histone H3 at Lys9 and Lys14 peaks at the SATB1-binding site and extends over a region of roughly 10 kb covering genes regulated by SATB1. By contrast, in Satb1-null thymocytes, this site is marked by methylation at H3 Lys9. We propose SATB1 as a new type of gene regulator with a novel nuclear architecture, providing sites for tissue-specific organization of DNA sequences and regulating region-specific histone modification."

https://openalex.org/W2020055953,"DNA damage induced by UV radiation is a critical event in skin photocarcinogenesis. However, the role of racial/ethnic origin in determining individual UV sensitivity remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationships between melanin content and DNA damage induced by UV exposure in situ in normal human skin of different racial/ethnic groups, phototypes, and UV sensitivities. The minimal erythema dose (MED) was established for each subject exposed to UVA/UVB radiation, and skin was biopsied before as well as 7 min, 1 day, and 1 wk after UV exposure. There was great variation among individuals in the amount of DNA damage incurred and rates of its removal. The results show that after exposure to 1 MED of UV, the skin of subjects from all groups suffered significant DNA damage, and that increasing content of constitutive melanin inversely correlated with the amount of DNA damage. It is clear from these results that measured erythemal UV sensitivity of the skin (MED) is a more useful predictor of DNA photodamage than is racial/ethnic origin or skin phototype and that rates of DNA damage removal following UV radiation may be the critical determinant of the UV sensitivity (including predisposition to cancer) of the skin."

https://openalex.org/W1990258459,"The Foxp subfamily of forkhead/HNF3 transcription factors has recently been recognized because of its involvement in autoimmune disease, speech and language disorders, and lung development. Domains unique to this subfamily include a divergent DNA-binding winged helix, a leucine zipper, a zinc finger, and a polyglutamine tract. Little is known about the properties of these proteins that are fundamental to their function as transcription factors nor how the Foxp sequence motifs regulate their transcriptional regulatory properties. We report here a structure/function analysis of the Foxp1 protein. We have analyzed the alternative splice isoforms 1A and 1C and also report the cloning and characterization of a novel isoform Foxp1D that lacks the polyglutamine domain. We have isolated the preferred DNA-binding sites for Foxp1 transcription factors. Foxp1A, C, and D isoforms and the related Foxp2 protein repress gene transcription via binding to this consensus site or to a naturally occurring site within the SV40 and the interleukin-2 promoters. In some cases the strength of Foxp1 repression is mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Unlike previously characterized forkhead factors, Foxp1 proteins can form homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members. The dimerization domain was localized to an evolutionarily conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motif. Finally, we demonstrate that Foxp1, although broadly expressed, is further regulated by tissue-specific alternative splicing of these functionally important sequence domains.

These results suggest that Foxp1 proteins have diverse functional roles in different cell and tissue types. The Fox gene family encompasses a large number of transcription factors homologous to forkhead and HNF3. Fox transcription factors are identified by a conserved 110-amino acid DNA-binding (winged helix) domain (1Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Google Scholar). These proteins play important roles in regulating gene transcription during early development and organogenesis and control cell type- and tissue-specific gene expression (1Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Google Scholar). Among the Fox transcription factors, recent attention has been drawn to members of the Foxp subfamily (Foxp1, Foxp2, and Foxp3). The functional importance of the Foxp proteins is underscored by their spontaneous mutation in mouse and human diseases. Misregulation of FOXP1 expression is seen in a variety of tumors, leading to the speculation that FOXP1 is a tumor suppressor gene (3Banham A.H. Beasley N. Campo E. Fernandez P.L. Fidler C. Gatter K. Jones M. Mason D.Y. Prime J.E. Trougouboff P. Wood K. Cordell J.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8820-8829Google Scholar). Mutations in FOXP2 provided the first incidence for linkage of a single mutant allele to speech and language disorders (4Enard W. Przeworski M. Fisher S.E. Lai C.S. Wiebe V. Kitano T. Monaco A.P. Paabo S. Nature. 2002; 418: 869-872Google Scholar). FOXP3 (JM2) mutations cause X-linked autoimmunity-allergic disregulation syndrome in humans (5Chatila T.A. Blaeser F. Ho N. Lederman H.M. Voulgaropoulos C. Helms C. Bowcock A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R75-R81Google Scholar), and the mouse orthologue of Foxp3 is responsible for the Scurfy mouse phenotype (6Brunkow M.E. Jeffery E.W. Hjerrild K.A. Paeper B. Clark L.B. Yasayko S.A. Wilkinson J.E. Galas D. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 68-73Google Scholar, 7Wildin R.S. Ramsdell F. Peake J. Faravelli F. Casanova J.L. Buist N. Levy-Lahad E. Mazzella M. Goulet O. Perroni L. Bricarelli F.D. Byrne G. McEuen M. Proll S. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 18-20Google Scholar). Despite the interesting physiological roles that have been uncovered by mutations in Foxp genes, little is understood about how Foxp transcription factors participate in signaling and gene regulation. Several candidate target genes with promoters containing forkhead binding sites have been proposed (8Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Google Scholar, 9Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar). Identification of a Foxp subfamily-specific DNA binding preference would be useful in validating current candidates and help identify new targets. Clues to the mechanisms by which Foxp proteins regulate transcription may lay in several interesting protein domains unique to the Foxp subfamily. Foxp transcription factors are among the most distantly related Fox subfamily members. Homology is limited to an 80-amino acid region within the DNA-binding domain that is truncated at the carboxyl helices Wing 1 and Wing 2 (5Chatila T.A. Blaeser F. Ho N. Lederman H.M. Voulgaropoulos C. Helms C. Bowcock A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R75-R81Google Scholar, 6Brunkow M.E. Jeffery E.W. Hjerrild K.A. Paeper B. Clark L.B. Yasayko S.A. Wilkinson J.E. Galas D.

Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar). Such diversion from the HNF3 winged helix structure would predict significant differences in the preferred DNA-binding sequences for Foxp proteins. The HNF3 structure further indicated that Fox proteins bind DNA as monomers (10Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar, 11van Dongen M.J. Cederberg A. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Wikstrom M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 351-359Google Scholar, 12Weigelt J. Climent I. Dahlman-Wright K. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5861-5869Google Scholar). However, the observation that all characterized Foxp proteins contain a leucine zipper motif that resembles the N-myc zip dimerization domain questioned the generality of this conclusion. Mouse Foxp1 and Foxp2 and human FOXP1 also include an N-terminal polyglutamine stretch of 37–40 residues (9Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar). Among transcription factor domains, polyglutamine has been identified as a common protein-protein interaction motif that can regulate transcriptional activity (13Chamberlain N.L. Driver E.D. Miesfeld R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3181-3186Google Scholar). The role of the polyglutamine domains in Foxp proteins has not been tested. In this study, we provide evidence that various Foxp1 isoforms repress transcription via direct binding to Foxp consensus DNA-binding sites present in the promoter regions of SV40 and IL-2. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CASTing, cyclic amplification and selection of targets; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CASTing, cyclic amplification and selection of targets; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. We show that the N-terminal polyglutamine domain strongly modulates Foxp1 repression activity on SV40 promoter. We demonstrate that a domain including leucine zipper and zinc finger motifs is both necessary and sufficient for specific dimerization between Foxp proteins. Finally, we show that Foxp isoform expression is highly regulated in tissues and cells. Expression Vectors—Foxp1A was cloned into pCDNAI/NEO (Invitrogen) and is driven by cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. In our original cDNA cloning effort, we isolated a partial Foxp1A cDNA lacking exon 1. This cDNA encodes the same protein as Foxp1D and was cloned into pCDNAI/NEO. 5′HA-Foxp1A and 3′HA-Foxp1A were generated by introducing an HA epitope tag in frame of Foxp1A using PCR. Foxp1A mutants were generated using single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 181-187Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding full-length Foxp1C and Foxp2 were described previously (9Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Ed Morrisey (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Yeast Two-hybrid Constructs—pASICYH2-Foxp1FL′ and pACTIIFoxp1FL′ were generated by subcloning a Foxp1A (V543L,R544E) BstYI fragment encoding amino acids 146–654 into the BamHI sites of pAS1CYH2 and pACTII in translational frame, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid vectors were kindly provided by Clarence Chan (University of Texas at Austin). pASICYH2-ab, a and b constructs were made by PCR amplifying the Foxp1A cDNA. Transcription Reporter Constructs—1xb-pGL3 promoter was generated by subcloning a single Foxp1 DNA-binding site B upstream of the SV40 promoter into the BglII site of pGL3 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). 3xbp-GL3 control was made by inserting tandemly ligated binding site B primer pairs into the BglII site of pGL3 control (Promega). IL-2-GL3 (NFAT-GL3) (15Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Google Scholar), which contains trimerized human distal NFAT site inserted into the IL-2 minimal promoter, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Crabtree (Stanford University School of Medicine). IL-2-mutGL3 was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A single Foxp1A cDNA clone was isolated by using a (CAG)12 repetitive oligonucleotide probe to screen a cDNA library prepared in λ Zap from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from B-cell leukemia (BCL-1) cells. The BCL-1 cells were stimulated in culture by IL-5 and IL-2 to differentiate before harvesting of RNA. Its complete sequence was determined on both strands by the Exoquence method (8Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Google Scholar). The Foxp1 cDNA sequence was confirmed from independent cDNAs using fragments generated from the initial isolate (fragment 1, nucleotides 1–357; fragment 2, nucleotides 1516–1978) as hybridization probes. Seven randomly picked clones were plaque-purified, and the cDNA inserts were excised as plasmids (λ ZAP protocol; Stratagene). RNase protection assays were performed using the RPAII kit according to manufacturer's protocols (Ambion, Austin, TX). 20 μg of mouse total RNAs were used to assay for Foxp isoforms using either “5′ probe” (nucleotides 93–425) or “3′ probe” (nucleotides 1978–2122). 2 μg of mouse total RNAs were used for mGAPDH control. Either a DNA sequence ladder or radiolabeled PUC19 digested with Sau3AI was used as size marker for protected RNA bands. Mouse tissue Northern blot was hybridized with the 3′ probe. The hybridization and washes were performed under high stringency (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 181-187Google Scholar) and exposed for 3 days on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Monoclonal antibody 1G1 was generated against the forkhead DNA-binding domain of Foxp1. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Monoclonal anti-HA ascites 16B12 (BAbCO, Berkley, CA) was used in 1:1000 dilution, and 1G1 ascites were used in 1:5,000 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin, phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody at 1:1,500 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin, phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100. The blots were visualized with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). In cell line Western blots, 50 μg of protein from various cell lysates were loaded. For immunoprecipitation, one-half of 35S labeled in vitro translation lysates were incubated with 175 μl of RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.1 μl of 16B12 at 4 °C for 1 h. The antibody and lysate mix was incubated with a 50% protein A (Sigma)/RIPA slurry for 1 h at 4 °C before being washed in 1 ml of RIPA three times. One-half of the final products were loaded on SDS-PAGE. We found that expression of Foxp1FL′ fused to the GAL4 activation domain (pACTII-FL′) inhibited cell growth, perhaps because of disregulation of a yeast gene. For the purpose of yeast expression, we circumvented this problem by introducing into the forkhead DNA-binding domain two point mutations (V543L,R544E) that had been shown to eliminate DNA binding in other forkhead transcription factors (16Clevidence D.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5306-5317Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed as described (18Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 178-179Google Scholar). Foxp1 pASICYH2 subclones were co-transformed with either pACTII-Foxp1FL′ or pTD1-1 (pACTII-T-antigen from Clontech) into strain Y190. As a positive control, pVA3–1 (pASICYH2-P53) was co-transformed with pTD1-1. Protein-protein interactions were assayed by growth on selective media lacking histidine and confirmed by β-galactosidase activity assays using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) filter assay (19Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Google Scholar). Constructs for in vitro transcription/translation of Foxp1C and FOXP3 (JM2) were obtained from Dr. Edward Morrisey (University of Pennsylvania) and Dr. Talal A. Chatila (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO), respectively. Luciferase control or Foxp proteins were [35S]Met-labeled by in vitro translation, and equal aliquots of each protein were incubated with 1 μg of GST-Foxp1 (amino acids 378–578) fusion protein in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at a final volume of 250 μlat4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times in NETN buffer and then boiled in 10 μl of gel loading buffer for 10 min prior to loading on SDS-PAGE. Foxp1 CAST experiments were carried out as described (20Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A random oligonucleotide pool (76 nucleotides) containing unique flanking sequences was rendered double-stranded by second strand synthesis. 2 μl of C-terminally HA-tagged Foxp1A in vitro translation product and 0.5 μl of anti-HA antibody 16B12 were used for binding and immunoprecipitation, respectively. PCR was carried out after phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation of the eluted oligonucleotides. One-fourth of the precipitant was used for subsequent PCR amplification. Four rounds of selection and amplification were carried out, and the final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pBluescript II KS (+) for sequencing. For DNA binding assays, oligonucleotides A (CAAGGTAAACAAGACAACACAAATAA), B (AGGAATAAACACAACATAAATAATG), V1P (TCAAAAATATTGAAGTGTTATCACATACAC), SV40 (ATTTTTTTTATTTATGCAGAGGCCGAGGGC), IL-2-wt (ATCGGAAAATTTGTTTCATAATC), and IL-2-mut (ATCGGAAAAGAAGTTACATAATC) were annealed to their complementary strands and then gel-purified to eliminate nonhybridized oligonucleotides. Either in vitro translated protein, Escherichia coli expressed proteins or nuclear extracts were used as a source of Foxp1. Construction and expression of Foxp1 GST fusion proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were previously described (8Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of various cell lines were isolated by the method of Lee et al. (21Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Google Scholar). For competition experiments, competitors were allowed to bind with the GST fusion proteins for 5 min at room temperature before the labeled probe was added. The supershift assay was done by the method of Neufeld (22Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar). Cells in a 6-well plate were co-transfected with 100 ng of reporter construct, 100 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) as a normalization control, and 800 ng of each eukaryotic expression vector using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dual luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells grown in RPMI complete medium plus HEPES, pH 7.2, were harvested, washed with medium, and resuspended at 1.5 × 107/0.3 ml into electroporation cuvettes. IL-2-pGL3 (15 μg), pRL-TK (5 μg), and each expression vector DNA (5–20 μg) or DNA of its empty vector (to normalize each sample to 40 μg) were added. Following 10 min at room temperature, the DNAs were electroporated (Bio-Rad) at 240 V, 950 microfarads. The samples were left at room temperature for 10 min before being resuspended in 10 ml of Jurkat medium (RPMI with complete medium) and transferred to T25 flasks. 24 h after electroporation, the cells were treated with either phorbal ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (50 nm) and ionomycin (1 μm) (induced) or Me2SO (uninduced). Following an 8-h incubation, whole cell lysates were prepared for dual luciferase assays and Western analysis. Foxp1 Has at Least Four Splice Isoforms That Display Cell/Tissue-specific Expression Patterns—Foxp1A, originally named glutamine-rich factor-1, was first isolated in a search for polyglutamine-containing transcription factors in B cell cDNA libraries (8Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Google Scholar). The cDNA isolated is identical to the reported Foxp1 isoform A (9Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar) except that our cDNA encodes two additional glutamines at positions 172 and 203. The Foxp1 gene, assembled from our genomic clones of the locus and the public data bases, has 16 coding exons (Fig. 1A, top panel). Based on the Foxp1 genomic sequence and several unique Foxp1 expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank™ accession numbers BI649134, BG865862, BB858702, and BI697624), we have identified a novel Foxp1 isoform, Foxp1D (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). The Foxp1D cDNA contains a unique 5′-untranslated exon (exon 2b) and two in-frame stop codons that precede its putative initiating methionine in exon 3 (methionine 131 of Foxp1A). Foxp1D mRNA encodes a 576-amino acid protein that lacks the polyglutamine domain (Fig. 1B). Previously, two additional isoforms, Foxp1B and Foxp1C, were isolated from mouse lung tissues (9Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Although their unique sequences suggest that different Foxp1 isoforms may possess distinct transcription regulatory properties, essentially nothing is known about how each isoform differs in their expression pattern and functional properties. First we attempted to characterize tissue-specific Foxp1 isoform expression in mouse by Northern blotting with a probe (Fig. 1B, 3′ probe) common to all Foxp cDNAs (Fig. 1C). Foxp1 messages of 3.2, 2.4, and 1.6 kb were detected. In brain and thymus, the 3.2- and 2.4-kb transcripts are of similar abundance. In large intestine and testis, the 2.4-kb message is more abundant. The 1.6-kb message appears to be expressed in many tissues at low levels. Although we could not assign each messenger to a specific isoform, the blots demonstrate that tissues contain different relative levels of Foxp1 mRNA species. Northern analyses of a broad range of human tissues also indicated tissue-specific isoform expression for FOXP1 (data not shown). It is of interest that in humans, FOXP1 mRNA accumulated to highest levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the caudate nucleus of the brain. To distinguish different Foxp1 isoform mRNAs, we designed RNase protection assays using two unique probes: 5′ probe and 3′ probe (Fig. 1B). Our approach was most effective in distinguishing Foxp1B (protected band size, 72 nucleotides) from other Foxp1 isoforms (145 nucleotides), because the sequence of the 3′ probe (Fig. 1B) is partially spliced out in Foxp1B. As shown in Fig. 1 (D and E), Foxp1B is weakly expressed in most tissues surveyed, with the highest expression observed in spleen, WEHI 231, and 70Z B cell lines. Based on the known expression level of Foxp1B, we can deduce specific expression of Foxp1A using the 5′ probe. This probe overlaps a region that is shared by Foxp1A and Foxp1B but is missing in Foxp1C and 1D (Fig. 1B). Foxp1A expression can be estimated based on the signal differences of Foxp1A+1B (Fig. 1E, middle panel) and Foxp1B (Fig. 1E, top panel). High levels of Foxp1A were detected in 70Z, BCL1, EL4, C2C12, fibroblasts, brain, and spleen. Finally, although individual expression levels of Foxp1C and Foxp1D cannot be distinguished by our assay, these two isoforms add up to high abundance in WEHI 231 and testis (Fig. 1E). To study Foxp1 protein expression, we generated a monoclonal antibody (1G1) against the Foxp1 forkhead domain. The ability of 1G1 to detect Foxp1 proteins on Western blots was confirmed using a GST-Foxp1 forkhead fusion protein (data not shown) and in vitro translated Foxp1A (Fig. 2A). Both 1G1 and the anti-HA mAb 16B12 recognized the full-length in vitro translated Foxp1A (∼95 kDa) with HA epitope-tagged either on its N-(5′HA) or C-terminal (3′HA) (∼70 kDa). Consistently, in vitro translation of Foxp1A produced a shorter translation product that is in frame with the full-length product (recognizable by 1G1). Because anti-HA mAb recognizes the truncated protein produced by 3′HA but not 5′HA, the truncation must occur at the N terminus. This property was later used in demonstrating that Foxp1 self-associates in vitro (Fig. 3B and discussed below in “Results”). 1G1 showed no reactivity on Western blots toward in vitro translated Foxp2 or Foxp3/JM2 (data not shown), indicating that this reagent could be deemed subfamily-specific.Fig. 3Identification of a self-association domain within Foxp1A.A, alignment of the leucine zipper domains of Foxp1, Foxp2, FOXP3, and human N-myc. Identical and similar residues are boxed in dark gray and light gray, respectively. B, Foxp1A self-associates in vitro. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of in vitro translated C-terminal HA tagged Foxp1A (3′HA), N-terminal HA-tagged Foxp1A (5′HA), or luciferase with anti-HA mAb 16B12 is shown. An N-terminally truncated protein from the 5′HA template co-immunoprecipitates with the full-length protein. A parallel immunoprecipitation with a large excess of in vitro translated luciferase protein did not precipitate significant amounts of protein. C, diagrammatic representation of the β-galactosidase filter assays. Combinations of yeast two-hybrid constructs were co-transformed into Y190 and grown on –His medium. pVA3–1 (P53 fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain) was co-transformed with pTD1-1 (T antigen fused to GAL4 transactivation domain) as a positive control. D, results of Foxp1A deletions from which Foxp1A yeast two-hybrid constructs were made. FL′ (amino acids 145–653) retains all Foxp1A sequences except the N-terminal polyglutamine tract and the C-terminal acid-rich domain. Bar ab corresponds to amino acids 328–426, bar a corresponds to amino acids 328–361, and bar b corresponds to amino acids 361–426. E, GST pull-down indicates direct interaction among Foxp1 and FOXP3 proteins through the leucine zipper domain. The indicated proteins were 35S-labeled by in vitro transcription/translation, and equivalent amounts were either fractionated directly on SDS-PAGE (left panel) or incubated with a GST-Foxp1 fusion protein that contained the leucine zipper and forkhead domains (amino acids 378–578). After incubation, glutathione-agarose beads were washed, and the protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE (right panel). Experiments for each binding reaction were repeated at least twice, and typical results are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In various B and T cell lines (Fig. 2B) and in tissues (Fig. 2C), 1G1 detected at varying intensities three predominant proteins whose sizes (∼95, 70, and 50 kDa) were indistinguishable from those of in vitro translated Foxp1A, D, and C, respectively (Fig. 3E). Foxp1A is widely expressed, with highest levels in lung and B cell line 70Z and with moderate levels in brain, spleen, and other lymphoid lines (J558, WEHI 231, 33BTE, and 70 BET). Foxp1D expression is also tissue- and cell type-specific, with the highest levels in WEHI 231, 70Z, and lung. Moderate Foxp1D levels accumulate in brain, spleen, and testis and lymphoid lines M12.4, 33BTE, and 70 BET. Foxp1C protein is widely expressed in tissues, but its expression is somewhat limited in lymphocytes. Foxp1B was not observed in our Western blotting (with the possible exception of spleen), either because its expression level is low (consistent with our RPA results) or because 1G1 does not recognize its truncated forkhead domain with equivalent sensitivity. Foxp1 Undergoes Self-association via a Zinc Finger and Leucine Zipper-containing Domain—Forkhead transcription factors were not known to self-associate. However, the ability of FOXP3 to form homodimers was anticipated because it contains a leucine zipper domain (5Chatila T.A. Blaeser F. Ho N. Lederman H.M. Voulgaropoulos C. Helms C. Bowcock A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R75-R81Google Scholar). The importance of the leucine zipper domain was highlighted in some of the X-linked autoimmunity-allergic disregulation syndrome patients, who had developed this lethal disease simply because their FOXP3 alleles contained a single amino acid deletion within the leucine zipper domain. The leucine zipper domain is shared by all three members of the Foxp family (Fig. 3A). To test whether Foxp1 self-associates, we took advantage of the previous observation (Fig. 2A) that in vitro translation of HA-tagged Foxp1A consistently produced both a full-length and an N-terminal truncated protein. For 3′HA in vitro translation products, anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 recognized both the full-length protein (95 kDa) and the N-terminal truncation (70 kDa) on Western (Fig. 2A) and efficiently immunoprecipitated both forms of proteins (Fig. 3B). For 5′HA in vitro translation products, the full-length protein (95 kDa) but not the N-terminal truncation (70 kDa) was recognized by 16B12 on Western (Fig. 2A). However, 16B12 immunoprecipitation of full-length 5′HA co-immunoprecipitated the nontagged truncated form (Fig. 3B), indicating that Foxp1A self-associates in vitro. A parallel 16B12 immunoprecipitation with a large excess of in vitro translated luciferase did not precipitate significant amounts of protein (Fig. 3B). We next verified the self-association property of Foxp1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. Foxp1A lacking both its N-terminal polyglutamine and C-terminal acidic-rich domains (termed Foxp1FL′; Fig. 3C) was subcloned into GAL4-based activation and DNA-binding domain vectors. Co-transformation of yeast with pASICYH2-Foxp1FL′ and pACTII-Foxp1FL′ activated reporter expression, both for His complementation and β-galactosidase (Fig. 3D), indicating self-association of the protein. Co-transformation of pASICYH2-Foxp1FL′ and pTD1-1 (large T antigen fused to the GAL4 activation domain) did not activate reporter expression (Fig. 3D), indicating that the observed Foxp1 self-interaction was specific. To map the self-association domain, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain was fused to various Foxp1A deletions (Fig. 3"

Affected children may experience life-threatening high fever resulting from reduced ability to sweat. Mice with the Tabby phenotype share many symptoms with human XLHED patients because both phenotypes are caused by mutations of the syntenic ectodysplasin A gene (Eda) on the X chromosome. Two main splice variants of Eda, encoding EDA1 and EDA2, engage the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptors EDAR and XEDAR, respectively. The EDA1 protein, acting through EDAR, is essential for proper formation of skin appendages; the functions of EDA2 and XEDAR are not known. EDA1 must be proteolytically processed to a soluble form to be active. Here, we show that treatment of pregnant Tabby mice with a recombinant form of EDA1, engineered to cross the placental barrier, permanently rescues the Tabby phenotype in the offspring. Notably, sweat glands can also be induced by EDA1 after birth. This is the first example of a developmental genetic defect that can be permanently corrected by short-term treatment with a recombinant protein."

Nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs through nuclear pore complexes, large proteinaceous structures that penetrate the double lipid layer of the nuclear envelope. Most macromolecules require an active, signal-mediated transport process that enables the passage of particles up to 25 nm in diameter (∼25 MDa). The best characterized nuclear targeting signals are the conventional nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization sequence; Arm repeat, armadillo repeat; Impα, importin-α; Impβ, importin-β; m-Impα, mouse importin-α (residues 70–529); y-Impα, yeast importin-α (residues 88–530); N1N2, X. laevis phosphoprotein N1N2; RB, human retinoblastoma protein; T-Ag, simian virus 40 large T-antigen.1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization sequence; Arm repeat, armadillo repeat; Impα, importin-α; Impβ, importin-β; m-Impα, mouse importin-α (residues 70–529); y-Impα, yeast importin-α (residues 88–530); N1N2, X. laevis phosphoprotein N1N2; RB, human retinoblastoma protein; T-Ag, simian virus 40 large T-antigen. that contain one or more clusters of basic amino acids (1Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The NLSs fall into two distinct classes termed monopartite NLSs, containing a single cluster of basic amino acids, and bipartite NLSs, comprising two basic clusters separated by a spacer. Despite the variability, the conventional basic NLSs are recognized by the same receptor protein termed importin or karyopherin, a heterodimer of α and β subunits (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Conti E.

Importin-α (Impα) contains the NLS-binding site, and importin-β (Impβ) is responsible for the translocation of the importin-substrate complex through the nuclear pore complex. Once inside the nucleus, Ran-GTP binds to Impβ and causes the dissociation of the import complex. Impα becomes autoinhibited, and both importin subunits return to the cytoplasm separately without the import cargo. The directionality of nuclear import is conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This distribution is in turn controlled by various Ran-binding regulatory proteins. Impα consists of two structural and functional domains, a short basic N-terminal Impβ-binding domain (5Gorlich D.

The structural basis of monopartite and bipartite NLS recognition by Impα has been studied crystallographically in yeast and mouse Impα proteins (9Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

The two basic clusters of the bipartite NLSs bind to two separate binding sites on Impα, involving Arm repeats 1–4 and 4–8, respectively. Monopartite NLSs can bind in both sites but primarily use the binding site corresponding to the C-terminal basic cluster of the bipartite NLSs, referred to as the major site (9Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The structure of full-length Impα indicated that the major NLS-binding site is occupied by residues 44–54 from the N-terminal region of the protein (Impβ-binding domain) that resembles an NLS (12Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); Impα is therefore autoinhibited in the absence of Impβ. This observation is supported by the measurements of higher NLS binding affinity by Impα/β as compared with Impα alone (13Rexach M. Blobel G.

In this study, we present the crystal structures of peptides corresponding to the bipartite NLSs from human retinoblastoma protein (RB) and Xenopus laevis chromatin assembly factor N1N2 bound to mouse Impα. These NLSs were chosen to represent diverse sequences and different lengths of the linkers between the clusters, so that some general conclusions can be drawn on NLS binding. The basic clusters of both peptides bind in the expected binding pockets, but the linker regions make specific contacts with the receptor also. Comparisons with other available Impα structures allow us to explain the specificities of monopartite and bipartite NLS binding and help us improve the definition of the consensus sequence of a conventional basic/bipartite NLS. The results will have general implications for recognizing the NLSs in new gene products identified in genome sequences and therefore for functional annotation of new proteins. Peptide Synthesis—The peptides CGKRSAEGSNPPKPLKKLRGY (RB peptide) and CGRKKRKTEEESPLKDKAKKSKGY (N1N2 peptide) were synthesized using the Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer, purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase chromatography, and analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer and electrospray mass spectrometry (Sciex API 111, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (24Michell B.J.

The peptides RB and N1N2 correspond to the NLSs of human retinoblastoma protein, residues 861–877, and X. laevis N1N2 protein (N1N2), residues 535–555, respectively, with two heterologous residues added at each terminus. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—N-terminal truncated mouse importin α (α2 isoform (25Kussel P. Frasch M. Mol. Gen.

For crystallization, m-Impα was concentrated to 18.8 mg/ml (in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) using a Centricon-30 (Millipore) and stored at –20 °C. Crystallization conditions were screened by systematically altering various parameters using the crystallization conditions successful for other peptide complexes (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J.

The crystals of both complexes (rod-shaped, 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm for the RB peptide complex and 0.4 × 0.1 × 0.07 mm for the N1N2 peptide complex) were obtained using co-crystallization by combining 1 μl of protein solution, 0.7 μl of peptide solution (1.7 mg/ml with peptide/protein ratio 3.5), and 1 μl of reservoir solution and suspended over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 0.6 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and 10 mm dithiothreitol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar), through rounds of crystallographic refinement (positional and restrained isotropic individual B-factor refinement with an overall anisotropic temperature factor and bulk solvent correction) and manual rebuilding (program O (29Jones T.A. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Bugg C.E. Ealick S.E. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Crossref Google Scholar)). Solvent molecules were added with the program CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Asn239 is an outlier in the Ramachandran plot as also observed in all other structures of mouse Impα (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

The final models comprise 427 Impα residues (residues 71–497), 20 peptide residues, and 173 water molecules for RB peptide-Impα complex, and 426 Impα residues (residues 72–496), 21 peptide residues, and 123 water molecules for N1N2 peptide-Impα complex (Table I). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank numbers 1PJM and 1PJN for the RB and N1N2 peptide complexes, respectively). Structure Analysis—The quality of the models was assessed with the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The contacts were analyzed with the program CONTACT, and the buried surface areas were calculated using the program CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic Analysis—We used the consensus sequence KRRK to search for NLS-containing proteins using the Quick Matrix option of Scansite (31Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar); the sequence KRXK was entered for the primary preference positions 0 to +3, and R was entered into the secondary preference position +2. The bipartite consensus was too long to use with the current version of Scansite. Testing using proteins with known NLSs showed that there is a high likelihood of detecting a functional NLS at Scansite scores ≤ 0.0408 (corresponding to 0.448% of all yeast proteins) and a reasonable likelihood at Scansite scores ≤ 0.0596 (corresponding to 1.169% of all yeast proteins). To estimate the efficiency of detecting an unknown NLS, we performed a Scansite search with a test set of 50 randomly selected yeast nuclear proteins (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences subcellular catalogue (32Mewes H.W. Frishman D. Guldener U. Mannhaupt G. Mayer K. Mokrejs M. Morgenstern B. Munsterkotter M. Rudd S. Weil B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar)); 9 proteins showed a sequence match to the above motif with Scansite scores ≤ 0.0408, and 23 proteins (46%) showed a match with Scansite scores ≤ 0.0569. For comparison, we searched for NLSs in the same test set of proteins using PredictNLS (33Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar); this method detected an NLS in nine proteins, some of which did not belong to the conventional basic/bipartite group. Structure Determination—The RB and N1N2 NLS peptides were co-crystallized with an N-terminal truncated mouse Impα lacking residues 1–69 (m-Impα); residues 1–69 are responsible for autoinhibition. The co-crystals with both peptides grew in similar conditions and isomorphously to other mouse Impα crystals (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 12Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Electron density maps based on the Impα model, following rigid body refinement, clearly showed electron density corresponding to the peptides (Fig. 1). The structures were refined at 2.5-Å resolution for both complexes (Table I). Residues 859–878 of the peptide RB (residue 879 had no interpretable electron density) and residues 535–555 of the peptide N1N2 (residues 533–534 and 556 had no interpretable electron density) could unambiguously be identified in the electron density maps (Fig. 1). The side chains of Glu543 and Lys549 of N1N2 were poorly ordered; therefore, these residues were modeled as alanines. Structure of Importin-α in the Complexes—Impα forms a single elongated domain built from 10 Arm structural repeats, each containing three α helices (H1, H2, and H3) connected by loops (Fig. 2). The structure of Impα in the complexes is comparable with the crystal structure of the full-length Impα. (r.m.s. deviations of Cα atoms of Impα residues 72–496 are 0.22 Å between the RB and N1N2 peptide-m-Impα complexes; 0.35 and 0.31 Å between full-length Impα and the RB and N1N2 peptide-m-Impα complexes, respectively; and 0.34 and 0.30 Å between nucleoplasmin peptide-m-Impα and the RB and N1N2 peptide-m-Impα complexes, respectively.) Binding of the NLS Peptides to Importin-α—The peptides bind in an extended conformation with the chain running antiparallel to the direction of the Arm repeat superhelix (Fig. 2). The base of the groove that contains the binding sites is formed mainly by the H3 helices of the Arm repeats, which carry some residues conserved among the repeats, including the tryptophans and asparagines at the third and fourth turns in H3 helices of the Arm repeats, respectively (10Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The two basic clusters of the RB and N1N2 peptides bind to two separate well defined binding sites on the surface of the m-Impα molecule, referred to as the minor and major sites (Fig. 2). The minor site specifically binds to the N-terminal basic cluster KR, and the larger, C-terminal basic cluster binds to the major site. The electron density is present for 20 peptide residues in the RB peptide (average B-factor, 63.3 Å2) and for 21 peptide residues of the N1N2 peptide (average B-factor, 72.1 Å2) (Fig. 1). In both complexes, the linker sequences connecting the major and minor sites (residues 863–873 and 539–550 for RB and N1N2, respectively) have B-factors above the average number for the entire peptides (71.1 and 82.8 Å2 for RB and N1N2, respectively). By contrast, the residues bound to the major sites of both complexes have lower B-factors (40.5 and 47.6 Å2 for position P2–P5 of RB and N1N2, respectively), reflecting the strong interaction of these residues with the protein. There is 2573 and 2715 Å2 of surface area buried between m-Impα and the RB and N1N2 peptide, respectively. All residues of the RB peptide, except residues 865 and 869, and of the N1N2 peptide, except residues 542 and 546, make contacts with m-Impα at distances below 4 Å (Fig. 3). The minor and major site portions of the RB and N1N2 peptides have very similar structures (Fig. 4); after superposition of the equivalent Cα atoms, the r.m.s. deviation of the residues in positions P1–P6 is 0.19 Å, and the r.m.s. deviation of the residues in positions P1′–P3′ is 0.03 Å. By contrast, they adopt very different conformations in the linker regions between positions P3′ and P1; the path of the peptide chain is more linear in the case of RB than N1N2. The bipartite NLS linker sequence of both peptides makes favorable interactions with the H3 helices of armadillo repeats 4–7 of Impα. The most important contacts are limited to residues Asn868 and Lys871 of RB and Lys547 of N1N2. Among other interactions, the conserved residues Arg315 (Arm 6) and Tyr277 (Arm 5) of Impα that interrupt the regularity of the Trp-Asn array (11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) make extensive main chain and side chain contacts with the peptides. These residues also interact with nucleoplasmin NLS in mammalian and yeast Impα (10Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, in that case, the interaction involves only the main chain of the peptide. Other important contacts are made with Arg238 (main chain of RB and N1N2), Ser276 (side chain of N1N2), and Ser234 (side chain of RB). Comparison with Other NLS Peptide-Importin-α Complex Structures—Significantly, the work presented here allows us for the first time to perform a detailed comparison of the structural determinants of binding of a number of NLSs to Impα, to align the NLSs with the binding pockets on Impα with some confidence, and to draw some general conclusions on the specificity of NLS binding (Table II). Despite diverse sequences, the binding of both basic clusters (positions P1–P5 and P1′–P2′) is similar in all the available structures, and the major differences occur in the linker regions connecting the basic clusters (Fig. 4). The exceptions are the N- and C-terminal portions of nucleoplasmin NLS bound to m-Impα, where the side chains of Lys155 (position P1′; N terminus of the peptide) and Lys170 (position P5; C terminus of the peptide) follow the direction of the main chain of the other peptides. Because all the other peptides contain at least one additional residue at the N and C termini, the conformation of the nucleoplasmin NLS peptide may be an artifact of the short length of the peptide. The case of nucleoplasmin highlights the importance of residues preceding position P1′ and following position P6.Table IIBinding of NLSs to specific binding pockets of importin-aNLS source proteinMinor NLS binding siteLinkerMajor NLS binding siteP1′P2′P3′P4′P1P2P3P4P5NucleoplasminKRPAATKKAGQAKKKKRBKRSAEGSNPPKPLKKLRN1N2RKKRKTEEESPLKDKAKKSKT-AgPKKKRKVPKKKRKc-MycKRVKLPAAKRVKConsensusKRX10-12KRXK Open table in a new tab The structures of nucleoplasmin NLS bound to y-Impα and m-Impα are significantly different (r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms of residues 155–170 is 2.44 Å). In addition to the differences caused by the different lengths of the peptides discussed above, some differences may be explained by structural differences between the two Impα proteins; the yeast structure is slightly more “open” than the mouse structure (12Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Most of the differences are found in the region comprising residues 159–165 (there is high structural similarity when only the major (r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms for positions P2–P5 is 0.28 Å) and minor (r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms for positions P1′-P3′ is 0.24 Å) sites are superimposed). With the basic clusters binding most tightly, the different curvatures of the two Impα proteins appear to be compensated in the linker region. Although some linker region residues have different conformations, the main contacts of this region with Impα are comparable in both nucleoplasmin structures. The most important interactions occur for the main chain of conserved residues Arg315, Arg238, and Tyr277 of m-Impα (Arg321, Arg244, and Tyr283 of y-Impα). The portions of RB and N1N2 peptides bound in the major and minor sites superimpose closely with the nucleoplasmin NLS (the r.m.s. deviations of Cα atoms of positions P1–P5 and positions P1′–P3′ are 0.34 and 0.42 Å between RB and nucleoplasmin and 0.33 and 0.42 Å between N1N2 and nucleoplasmin, respectively). The structure of the nucleoplasmin linker region is more similar to that of RB than that of N1N2 (r.m.s. deviation of Cα atoms of linker region is 1.70 Å between RB (864–873) and nucleoplasmin (157–165) and 2.20 Å between N1N2 (541–550) and nucleoplasmin (157–165)), mainly in the region closest to the major site (residues 162–165 for nucleoplasmin). The region of the linker closest to the major site is structurally conserved best among the three bipartite NLS peptides. Binding of Bipartite NLS Linker Regions—The nucleoplasmin NLS-Impα complexes (10Conti E. Kuriyan J.

In this study, we examined the role of caveolin in these processes. Electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets shows that the AT1-R is not concentrated in caveolae but is clustered in cholesterol-independent microdomains; upon activation, it partially redistributes to lipid rafts. Despite the lack of AT1-R in caveolae, AT1-R·caveolin complexes are readily detectable in cells co-expressing both proteins. This interaction requires an intact caveolin scaffolding domain because mutant caveolins that lack a functional caveolin scaffolding domain do not interact with AT1-R. Expression of an N-terminally truncated caveolin-3, CavDGV, that localizes to lipid bodies, or a point mutant, Cav3-P104L, that accumulates in the Golgi mislocalizes AT1-R to lipid bodies and Golgi, respectively. Mislocalization results in aberrant maturation and surface expression of AT1-R, effects that are not reversed by supplementing cells with cholesterol. Similarly mutation of aromatic residues in the caveolin-binding site abrogates AT1-R cell surface expression. In cells lacking caveolin-1 or caveolin-3, AT1-R does not traffic to the cell surface unless caveolin is ectopically expressed. This observation is recapitulated in caveolin-1 null mice that have a 55% reduction in renal AT1-R levels compared with controls. Taken together our results indicate that a direct interaction with caveolin is required to traffic the AT1-R through the exocytic pathway, but this does not result in AT1-R sequestration in caveolae. Caveolin therefore acts as a molecular chaperone rather than a plasma membrane scaffold for AT1-R.

Caveolin therefore acts as a molecular chaperone rather than a plasma membrane scaffold for AT1-R. Lipid-based sorting mechanisms play an important role in the organization of the plasma membrane into microdomains (1Brown D. London E. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Google Scholar, 2Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of sphingolipids and cholesterol drive the spontaneous formation of lateral assemblies of liquid-ordered lipid rafts in a sea of liquid-disordered phospho-lipids. The biological importance of lipid rafts follows from the lateral segregation that they impose on membrane proteins. The differential distribution of plasma membrane proteins across raft and nonraft membranes in turn results in the concentration of specific groups of signaling proteins and lipids within discrete areas of the cell membrane (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 4Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Google Scholar, 5Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J.

This increases the efficiency and specificity of signaling events by allowing more efficient interactions between proteins and by preventing cross-talk between different pathways.Caveolae are an abundant surface feature of many mammalian cells and represent a specific subtype of lipid raft. Functionally, caveolae have been implicated in endocytosis (7Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Google Scholar), potocytosis (8Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Google Scholar), transcytosis (9Montesano R. Roth J. Robert A. Orci L. Nature. 1982; 296: 651-653Google Scholar), apical transport (10Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Google Scholar), and cholesterol balance (11Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Google Scholar). Caveolae are identified by their characteristic morphology (flask-shaped, 55–65-nm diameter pits) and the presence of integral membrane proteins, termed caveolins, of which three mammalian isoforms have been characterized (caveolin-1, -2, and -3) (12Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney G.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Google Scholar, 13Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Caveolins show the characteristic biochemical features of raft-associated proteins, being associated with low density detergent-insoluble complexes that are sensitive to cholesterol depletion (15Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Google Scholar). Caveolins are crucial structural components of caveolae. Expression of caveolin-1 in cells lacking caveolae causes de novo formation of caveolae, whereas ablation of caveolin expression causes a loss of caveolae in cultured cells and in vivo (17Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Google Scholar, 18Zhao Y.Y. Liu Y. Stan R.V. Fan L. Gu Y. Dalton N. Chu P.H. Peterson K. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11375-11380Google Scholar). The ability of caveolins to bind cholesterol and to form high molecular weight oligomeric complexes is presumably important in caveolae formation. Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 form hetero-oligomeric complexes and are most prevalent in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal myoblasts, fibroblasts, and adipocytes (19Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Brett S.E. Sessa W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1167-H1177Google Scholar).As well as this structural role, caveolins have also been directly implicated in interactions with signaling proteins. A juxtamembrane region of caveolin, the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) binds in vitro to a consensus sequence of ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ (where Φ is an aromatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) that is found in a large number of signaling proteins including G-proteins, conserved kinase domain IX, and elsewhere in many nonkinases (21Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Google Scholar, 22Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Google Scholar, 23Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Google Scholar). Caveolin has therefore been postulated to act as a protein scaffold for signaling proteins and to sequester them in caveolae (23Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Google Scholar), although such interactions cannot be important in tethering proteins to noncaveolar lipid rafts.The association of lipid-modified peripheral membrane proteins with lipid rafts is determined in part by the biophysical properties of the hydrophobic modification of the membrane anchor. Partitioning into rafts is favored if the lipid anchor is saturated, although in the case of prenylated and palmitoylated H-Ras activation state and additional protein sequences adjacent to the membrane anchor also influence raft association (24Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar). Less clear is how transmembrane proteins are targeted to lipid rafts. A well studied example is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) that is extensively localized to lipid rafts in quiescent cells (25Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Google Scholar). The receptor is not lipid-modified, but recent work has shown that a 60-amino acid region in the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor, contiguous with the transmembrane domain of the receptor, is sufficient for lipid raft targeting (26Yamabhai M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24843-24846Google Scholar). The angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1-R) is a nonpalmitoylated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that in smooth muscle cells co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin and when activated co-fractionates with caveolin on sucrose gradients (27Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Google Scholar). The interaction between the AT1-R and caveolin may be mediated by a CSD-binding sequence at the C terminus of the receptor (28Leclerc P.C. Auger-Messier M. Lanctot P.M. Escher E. Leduc R. Guillemette G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4702-4710Google Scholar). Similar to caveolin, the AT1-R is found in many cell types including smooth and cardiac muscle cells as well as endothelial and epithelial cells (29Dinh D.T. Frauman A.G. Johnston C.I. Fabiani M.E. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2001; 100: 481-492Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that an AT1-R·caveolin complex in caveolae may coordinate AngII-induced signaling (27Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the EGF-R that exits lipid rafts following ligand binding and activation (4Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Google Scholar), activated AT1-R moves into lipid rafts and/or caveolae where it transactivates the EGF-R (31Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Google Scholar).Recent electron microscopic studies have shown that the EGF-R is not concentrated in caveolae (32Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Google Scholar), although similar data on the AT1-R are lacking. In this study we used quantitative electron microscopy to examine the surface distribution of ectopically expressed AT1-R. In addition, we show a physical interaction between the AT1-R and caveolin and use dominant-interfering mutants of caveolin to investigate interactions between caveolin and the AT1-R both at the plasma membrane and during trafficking through the exocytic pathway. We show that inactive AT1-R is found in cyclodextrin-resistant and -sensitive clusters but is not enriched in surface caveolae; treatment with AngII results in the partial relocalization of activated AT1-R into noncaveolar lipid rafts. Nevertheless, expression of mislocalized caveolin mutants, the absence of caveolin, or disrupting the formation of a caveolin·AT1-R complex has a profound effect on the trafficking of AT1-R from the ER to the plasma membrane. In addition, mouse studies indicate that caveolin is required for normal renal AT1-R expression. Together these data suggest an important chaperone role for caveolin in trafficking a transmembrane receptor to the cell surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—N-terminally HA-tagged AT1-R (HA-AT1-R) and C-terminally GFP-tagged AT1-R (GFP-HA-AT1-R) have been described (33Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Google Scholar, 34Holloway A.C. Qian H. Pipolo L. Ziogas J. Miura S. Karnik S. Southwell B.R. Lew M.J. Thomas W.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 768-777Google Scholar). A truncated version of the HA-AT1-R was generated by deleting 34 amino acids C-terminal to Lys325 (AT1-R,TK325) (35Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22153-22159Google Scholar). AT1-R mutants with substitutions of key hydrophobic (Tyr302, Phe304, Phe309, and Tyr312; YFFY/A) and positively charged residues (Lys307, Lys308, Lys310, and Lys311; KKKK/Q) within the proximal C terminus (helix VIII) were generated using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (ExSite). The template for YFFY/A was a HA-tagged version of a previously reported AT1-R mutant (Y302A) (35Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22153-22159Google Scholar), whereas the template for KKKK/Q was HA-AT1-R. The mutant receptors were sequenced to confirm the entire coding region and the relevant nucleotide mutations. HA- and GFP-tagged full-length Cav3 (151 residues), CavDGV (residues 54–151), Cav3-P104L (Pro → Leu substitution at residue 104), HA-tagged CavLLS (residues 75–151), and CavDGV-G55S (residues 54–154 with a Gly → Ser substitution at residue 55) are as described (36Carozzi A.J. Roy S. Morrow I.C. Pol A. Wyse B. Clyde-Smith J. Prior I.A. Nixon S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17944-17949Google Scholar). For GFP-tH, GFP is targeted to the plasma membrane by the minimal H-Ras anchor, which has been described previously (37Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Google Scholar). GFP-Icmt was a kind gift of Dr. Mark Philips (New York University). Caveolin-1-deficient mice have been described previously (38Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 303: 2449-2452Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) and Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. The cells were plated at 60% confluency and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of incubation with transfection mixture, the cells were washed with serum-free medium, and medium containing 10% calf serum was added for overnight incubation. Where indicated cholesterol depletion was performed using 1% cyclodextrin (Sigma) in DMEM for 30 min following 20 h of serum starvation as described (39Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Google Scholar). Cholesterol replenishment was carried out for 1 h using a mix of 16 μg/ml cholesterol in 0.4% cyclodextrin in DMEM as described (39Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Google Scholar). Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum supreme at 37 °C. The cells were electroporated with expression plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were processed for confocal microscopy or biochemical analysis.Cell Fractionation—Transfected BHK cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped on ice into 0.3 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm NaVO4, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and homogenized through a 23-gauge needle. Post-nuclear supernatants obtained by low speed centrifugation were spun at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the soluble fraction (S100) and the sedimented fraction (P100) were collected. The P100 fraction, which contains cellular membranes, was rinsed and resuspended in Buffer A.Western Blotting—Protein content was measured by the Bradford reaction. 20-μg samples of the S100 and P100 fractions were separated on 10, 12, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting protein was performed using anti-HA (Babco) or anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) antibodies. Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (SuperSignal; Pierce) and quantified by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad) as described previously (40Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy—Transfected BHK and FRT cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, BHK cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody in a humidified chamber for 1 h. FRT cells were incubated with an anti-Cav3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and Cy3-coupled anti-mouse secondary antisera used to visualize protein expression. The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol for confocal microscopy (37Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy and Statistics—Flat sheets of plasma membrane prepared from transfected BHK cells were immunogold-labeled with anti-GFP 5-nm gold and processed for image and statistical analysis exactly as described (41Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Google Scholar, 42Prior I.A. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Sci. STKE. 2003; (2003): PL9Google Scholar). Briefly, background was removed from digitized negatives using Adobe Photoshop 5.0, and the gold particle co-ordinates were determined using NIH Image 1.82. Subsequent Ripley's K-function analysis was performed using visual basic programs written into Excel macros (41Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Google Scholar, 42Prior I.A. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Sci. STKE. 2003; (2003): PL9Google Scholar). Positive deflections of the L(r)-r curve outside the 99% confidence interval for complete spatial randomness (standardized to 1 on the figures) indicate significant clustering of the gold pattern at the radius r (measured in nm) at which the deviation occurs (a more detailed explanation of the statistical theory and interpretation is given in Ref. 41Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Google Scholar). The gold patterns were further evaluated using a mathematical model of plasma membrane microdomains essentially as described previously (41Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Google Scholar). Gold particles were allocated to two types of microdomain: lipid rafts with a mean radius of 20 nm or nonrafts with a mean radius of 30 nm; in addition a fraction of particles were allocated randomly over the study area. The two types of microdomain were randomly generated over the model study area and had no fixed relationship to each other. All possible relative allocations of gold particles to raft, nonraft, or the random fraction were evaluated at the gold density achieved experimentally. Twenty Monte Carlo simulations were run for each assignment of particles. The mean K-function was calculated for each model pattern, and goodness-of-fit was evaluated by calculation of the root mean square deviation from the observed data. The model giving the lowest root mean square deviation was accepted as the best fit.Radioligand Binding—BHK cells grown in 6-well plates and HEK cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected 24 and 48 h prior to radioreceptor assay, respectively. BHK cells were incubated in a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.4) containing [125I]Sar1-Ile8-AngII and appropriate levels of unlabeled AngII (0–200 ng/ml) to determine specific and nonspecific binding. After 90 min of incubation, free ligand was removed by washing three times in ice-cold binding buffer. The cells were then solubilized with 0.3 m NaOH and counted on a γ counter. HEK cell surface receptor expression was examined by the receptor binding assay described above, except the radiolabel used was [3H]AngII (40 nm). Kidneys from three caveolin-1 null mice and three age-matched wild type black-6 control mice were excised, and radioreceptor assays were performed as previously described (43Wyse B. Waters M. Sernia C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E332-E339Google Scholar). AT1-R affinity constant and expression levels were determined using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software Inc.). Total protein was determined by the Bradford reaction described and was used to standardize AT1-R expression levels.Immunoprecipitation—Transfected BHK cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.3 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mg/ml n-dodecyl β-maltoside, 0.5 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After 1 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min). The protein content was determined by the Bradford reaction, and 1 mg of lysate was used for immunoprecipitation. After preclearing for 2 h with agarose beads, the lysates were incubated overnight with 20 μl of protein G-agarose and mouse anti-HA antisera (1:150) or 20 μl of protein A-agarose and rabbit anti-GFP antisera (1:150). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin), twice with washing buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), and once with washing buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). The proteins were eluted in 55 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.RESULTSActivated AT1-R Localizes to Lipid Rafts but Not Caveolae— Sucrose gradient fractionation experiments have shown that stimulation with AngII causes AT1-R to shift from dense to light membranes that co-fractionate with caveolin (27Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Google Scholar). These data indicate that activated AT1-R associates with lipid rafts or caveolae or both, because these microdomains have similar biophysical properties. To discriminate between these possibilities, we examined the surface distribution of AT1-R in intact plasma membrane using electron microscopy. BHK cells expressing GFP-tagged AT1-R were stimulated with AngII or left untreated, and apical plasma membrane sheets were ripped off directly onto electron microscopy grids. The sheets were fixed and stained with affinity-purified anti-GFP antisera coupled directly to 5-nm gold. In parallel experiments the cells were also treated with methyl β-cyclodextrin for 30 min to disrupt cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and caveolae. Caveolae are readily identifiable by their morphology, size, and labeling for caveolin. No significant labeling of caveolae for AT1-R was evident in AngII-treated or control cells, although gold labeling was readily apparent in other areas of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Inspection of the noncaveolar AT1-R gold distribution suggested that it was clustered (Fig. 1A); we therefore analyzed the gold patterns further using spatial statistics. K-function analysis reveals that the AT1-R is not randomly distributed over the cell surface but is localized to clusters with a mean radius of 20–30 nm (Fig. 1D). Cyclodextrin treatment decreased but did not cause a complete loss of clustering (Fig. 1, B and D). Stimulation with AngII for 10 min caused a significant increase in AT1-R clustering, an effect that was blocked in the presence of cyclodextrin (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that unstimulated AT1-R is resident in lipid rafts and in cholesterol-independent, nonlipid raft microdomains but that activation is accompanied by a shift of AT1-R into cyclodextrin-sensitive lipid rafts. The extent of this movement can be estimated by mathematical modeling (Fig. 1F); the observed change in AT1-R clustering would be achieved if 40% of the AT1-R in nonraft clusters moved into lipid rafts with AngII stimulation.Formation of Caveolin 3·AT1-R Complexes Is Dependent on an Intact CSD—Previous work has shown that AT1-R co-immunoprecipitates with Cav1 from vascular smooth muscle cell lysates (27Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows identical results for AT1-R and Cav3 ectopically expressed in BHK cells. However, because Fig. 1 shows that the AT1-R is not localized to surface caveolae in these cells, we investigated where else in the cell the AT1-R·caveolin complex may form. The AT1-R protein contains a consensus site for interaction with the CSD; the sequence, Tyr302–Tyr312, is located at the C-terminal extremity of the last transmembrane domain of the receptor and the proximal portion of the C terminus (Fig. 2A). We first examined whether an intact CSD was required to form the Cav3·AT1-R complex using a series of previously characterized Cav3 mutants (Fig. 2B). CavDGV and CavLLS are N-terminal truncations at amino acids 55 and 75, respectively, such that CavDGV but not CavLLS retains the CSD. CavDGV-G55S contains a point mutation within the retained CSD. Cav3-P104L contains a naturally occurring point mutation that has been associated with mild forms of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (44Betz R.C. Schoser B.G. Kasper D. Ricker K. Ramirez A. Stein V. Torbergsen T. Lee Y.A. Nothen M.M. Wienker T.F. Malin J.P. Propping P. Reis A. Mortier W. Jentsch T.J. Vorgerd M. Kubisch C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 218-219Google Scholar). The P104L point mutation does not affect the CSD but rather prevents normal trafficking of caveolin leading to Golgi accumulation (45Galbiati F. Volonte D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25632-25641Google Scholar). Cell lysates from cells co-expressing each HA-tagged Cav3 mutant and GFP-tagged AT1-R were normalized for AT1-R content, immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antiserum, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antisera. Fig. 2C shows that wild type Cav3, CavDGV, and Cav3-P104L all co-immunoprecipitate with the AT1-R. However, deletion of the CSD totally abolishes the ability of CavLLS, and mutation of the CSD significantly reduces the ability of CavDGV-G55S to form stable complexes with the AT1-R (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations show that the AT1-R and Cav3 form a stable complex and that the CSD is critically important for Cav3/AT1-R interaction.Fig. 2Formation of an AT1-R·Cav3 complex requires an intact caveolin scaffolding domain.A, the AT1-R protein sequence reveals a consensus binding site (highlighted) for the CSD between Tyr302 and Tyr312 (302YXFXXXXFXXY312) comprising the C-terminal extremity of the last transmembrane domain of the receptor and the proximal C terminus (helix VIII). B, to determine whether the caveolin scaffolding domain (highlighted) is important in the formation of the Cav3·AT1-R complex, the Cav3 mutants shown were used. C, BHK cells were transfected with GFP-AT1-R (that contains both a N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal GFP tag) alone or in combination with HA-tagged Cav3, Cav3-P104L, CavDGV, and CavDGV-G55S. An anti-GFP (polyclonal) antibody was used to immunoprecipitate (IP) GFP-AT1-R. Because the receptor is also HA-tagged, AT1-R (top panel) and Cav3 or Cav3 mutants (middle panel) are visualized by an anti-HA immunoblot. To ensure that the Cav3 constructs were expressed at detectable levels prior to immunoprecipitation,"
https://openalex.org/W2170344274,"A reduced growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 axis is associated with an extension of lifespan in laboratory rodents. Several phenotypes of such animal models resemble those induced by caloric restriction (CR). Using a transgenic male Wistar rat model whose GH-IGF-1 axis was moderately suppressed by overexpression of the antisense GH transgene (tg), we elucidated a relationship between the effects of a reduced GH-IGF-1 axis and CR for some biomarkers of aging, lifespan, and pathologies. Heterozygous (tg/-) rats fed ad libitum (AL) had a dwarf phenotype similar to that of control nontransgenic (-/-) rats subjected to 30% CR from 6 wk of age. Both the reduced GH-IGF-1 axis and CR extended lifespan to a similar extent, although the effect of CR seemed to be greater. There was an additive effect of CR to lifespan extension when tg/- rats were subjected to CR. Pathologic analyses indicated that the preventive effect of CR on selected diseases was greater than that of the reduced GH-IGF-1 axis. The present study suggests that CR affects aging and longevity by mechanisms other than suppression of the GH-IGF-1 axis, although CR might exhibit its effects partly through the reduced GH-IGF-1 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2139860372,"Plant Tau class glutathione transferases (GSTUs) detoxify diphenylether herbicides such as fluorodifen, determining their selectivity in crops and weeds. Using reconstructive PCR, a series of mutant GSTUs were generated from in vitro recombination and mutagenesis of the maize sequences ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2 (with the prefix Zm designating Zea mays L.). A screen of 5000 mutant GSTUs identified seven enzymes with enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying activity. The best performing enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying mutant (EFD) had activity 19-fold higher than the parent enzymes, with a single point mutation conferring this enhancement. Further mutagenesis of this residue generated an EFD with a 29-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward fluorodifen as compared with the parents but with unaltered catalysis toward other substrates. When expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, the optimized EFD, but not the parent enzymes, conferred enhanced tolerance to fluorodifen. Molecular modeling predicts that the serendipitous mutation giving the improvement in detoxification is due to the removal of an unfavorable interaction together with the introduction of a favorable change in conformation of residues 107–119, which contribute to herbicide binding. Plant Tau class glutathione transferases (GSTUs) detoxify diphenylether herbicides such as fluorodifen, determining their selectivity in crops and weeds.

Molecular modeling predicts that the serendipitous mutation giving the improvement in detoxification is due to the removal of an unfavorable interaction together with the introduction of a favorable change in conformation of residues 107–119, which contribute to herbicide binding. The relative rate of herbicide detoxification in crops and weeds is a primary determinant of their selectivity (1Owen W.J. Roberts T. Metabolism of Agrochemicals in Plants. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., London2000: 211-258Google Scholar). Crops rapidly metabolize herbicides by oxidative or hydrolytic reactions followed by conjugation with sugars or peptides and vacuolar sequestration of the polar products (1Owen W.J. Roberts T. Metabolism of Agrochemicals in Plants. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., London2000: 211-258Google Scholar). In weeds, these detoxification reactions are slower. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSTF, Phi class GST; GSTU, Tau class GST; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; EFD, enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying mutant; Zm, from Z. mays L. 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSTF, Phi class GST; GSTU, Tau class GST; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; EFD, enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying mutant; Zm, from Z. mays L. have a well characterized role in determining the metabolism and selectivity of chloroacetanilide, thiocarbamate, and chloro-s-triazine herbicides in maize (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Cobb A.H. Kirkwood R.C. Herbicides and Their Mechanisms of Action. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK2000: 38-91Google Scholar). GSTs catalyze the conjugation of these herbicides with the tripeptide glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) to form non-toxic S-glutathionylated products (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Cobb A.H. Kirkwood R.C. Herbicides and Their Mechanisms of Action. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK2000: 38-91Google Scholar). In other crops, alternative GST activities determine herbicide selectivity. For example, photobleaching diphenylether herbicides such as fluorodifen are rapidly detoxified by GSTs in legumes (see Fig. 1A) but less efficiently in maize (3Frear D.S. Swanson H.R. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 473-482Google Scholar). Species-dependent GST-mediated detoxification can be explained by differences in the expression of the six distinct families of plant GST genes, classified as the Phi, Zeta, Tau, Theta, Lambda, and dehydroascorbate reductase classes (4McGonigle B. Keeler S.J. Lau S.-M.C. Koeppe M.K. O'Keefe D.P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1105-1120Google Scholar, 5Dixon D.P. Lapthorn A. Edwards R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3Google Scholar, 6Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Google Scholar). The plant-specific Phi and Tau GSTs are primarily responsible for herbicide detoxification, showing class specificity in substrate preference. Phi enzymes (GSTFs) are highly active toward chloroacetanilide and thiocarbamate herbicides, whereas the Tau enzymes (GSTUs) are efficient in detoxifying diphenylethers and aryloxyphenoxypropionates (7Jepson I. Lay V.J. Holt D.C. Bright S.W.J. Greenland A.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1855-1866Google Scholar, 8Thom R. Cummins I. Dixon D.P. Edwards R. Cole D.J. Lapthorn A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7008-7020Google Scholar). In maize, GSTFs are the major class of expressed GST (7Jepson I. Lay V.J. Holt D.C. Bright S.W.J. Greenland A.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1855-1866Google Scholar), whereas in soybean, GSTUs predominate, with this difference accounting for the differential detoxification of different classes of herbicide in the two crops (4McGonigle B. Keeler S.J. Lau S.-M.C. Koeppe M.K. O'Keefe D.P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1105-1120Google Scholar).We have been interested in enhancing the detoxifying potential of plant GSTs using the dual approach of DNA shuffling and directed mutagenesis. In maize (Zea mays L.), ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2 are the major Tau enzymes expressed, although considerably less abundant than the ZmGSTFs (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar, 10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar). With the intention of enhancing their detoxifying activity toward fluorodifen, we have used reconstructive error-prone PCR (11Stemmer W.P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Google Scholar) to randomly generate mutant GSTUs derived from both ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2. After large scale screening of the mutants from this screen, the most improved GST was then subjected to selective mutagenesis to further increase activity. The resulting optimized catalysts were then used to transform Arabidopsis thaliana and tested for their ability to increase herbicide tolerance in planta.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Mutant GSTs—Clones pGSTU1 and pGSTU2, pBluescript SK– vectors containing cDNA sequences for ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2, respectively, were obtained from cDNA expression library antibody screens as detailed previously (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar, 10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar). In the work describing their original isolation, ZmGSTU1 was termed ZmGSTV and ZmGSTU2 was termed ZmGSTVI, the new designations reflecting a unifying change in nomenclature (5Dixon D.P. Lapthorn A. Edwards R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3Google Scholar). For reconstructive PCR, 10 μg of each of the plasmids pGSTU1 and pGSTU2 was digested with DNase I (0.25–2.0 units) in 50 μlof50mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2 at 22 °C for 10 min with the reaction stopped with 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Reactions producing fragments of mainly 0–500 bp were used for reconstructive PCR (11Stemmer W.P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Google Scholar). Using 20 ng/μl digested DNA, after 50 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s + 3 s/cycle), reaction products of 500 bp–20 kb were obtained, and 1 μl of this mixture was used as template for a standard 50-μl PCR reaction using M13 forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s). PCR products of the expected size were recloned into pBluescript.Screening Mutants for GST Activity—Wells of sterile flat-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates, each containing 200 μl of LB medium supplemented with antibiotics, were inoculated with individual mutant bacterial colonies taken from a master plate and grown for 16 h to stationary phase. The plates were centrifuged, and the growth medium was removed by aspiration prior to resuspending the bacteria in 200 μl of 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, containing 0.5 mm fluorodifen and 5 mm glutathione. Plates were incubated at 37 °C (2–4 h), and the release of p-nitrophenol was visually monitored. Mutants showing at least a 5-fold faster accumulation of the yellow p-nitrophenol than the parent ZmGSTU clones were selected for further characterization.Analysis of Recombinant Mutant GSTs—GSTUs cloned in either pBluescript or pET plasmids in Escherichia coli were cultured without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, and the respective recombinant proteins were purified using S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar, 10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar). Purified GSTs were extensively dialyzed to remove S-hexylglutathione and assayed for activity toward CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and fluorodifen (12Edwards R. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 594-604Google Scholar), the latter by following the increase in absorbance at 400 nm after incubation at 30 °C in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, containing 5 mm glutathione and 50 μm fluorodifen. High pressure liquid chromatography-based assays for activity toward herbicides other than fluorodifen were as described (13Andrews C.J. Skipsey M. Townson J.K. Morris C. Jepson I. Edwards R. Pestic. Sci. 1997; 51: 213-222Google Scholar) except that assays with fomesafen were carried out in glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5. The protein concentration of purified recombinant GSTs was measured based on their calculated UV absorbance at 280 nm (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Q115L point mutation in EFD6 (enhanced fluorodifen detoxifying mutant 6), corresponding to the 113th amino acid residue of ZmGSTU2, was subjected to PCR using specific mutagenic primers, together with a primer to the T7 promoter, using pEFD6 as the template. PCR products were subcloned back into pEFD6 to give constructs expressing the mutants EFD6–115E, EFD6–115N, EFD6–115F, EFD6–115A, and EFD6–115Q containing mutations of leucine 115 to glutamic acid, asparagine, phenylalanine, alanine, and glutamine, respectively.Modeling of Fluorodifen Binding to ZmGSTU2—The ZmGSTU2 protein was modeled on the templates of two Tau class enzymes, wheat TaGSTU4 (8Thom R. Cummins I. Dixon D.P. Edwards R. Cole D.J. Lapthorn A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7008-7020Google Scholar) and rice OsGSTU1 (Protein Data Bank accession code 1OYJ), showing 39 and 63% sequence identity to ZmGSTU2, respectively, using the web-based utility SWISSMODEL (www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html). The model obtained was manually analyzed using the graphics program QUANTA (Accelyrs Inc.) for steric clashes and chemical sensibility. The conformation of the side chain of residue Gln-115 resulted in a steric clash with Tyr-170 and therefore was remodeled using water positions from the OsGSTU1 as a guide. A molecular model of fluorodifen was generated using INSIGHTII and CATALYST (Accelyrs Inc.), and a suitable low energy conformation was docked into the active site using QUANTA.Generation and Analysis of Transgenic Plants—GST sequences were subcloned into pRT108 by PCR from the respective pET-vectors and ligated into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the vector (15Töpfer R. Maas C. Höricke-Grandpierre C. Schell J. Steinbiss H.-H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 66-78Google Scholar). This cassette was then digested with HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pCAMBIA 3300 (CAMBIA, Canberra, Australia). The resulting vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C3 and used to transform A. thaliana ecotype Columbia by floral dipping (16Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Google Scholar). Dipped plants were grown to seed set, and T1 plants were grown for 10 days in the greenhouse (16-h photoperiod; 23 °C day; 18 °C night) in a 4:1 mixture of general purpose compost and silver sand prior to spraying with 0.02% (w/v) glufosinate ammonium (1 ml/35 cm2) to select for transformants. Surviving plants were resprayed after 7 days. T1 lines showing good GST expression were selected for propagation after analyzing extracts from individual rosette leaves by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-ZmGSTU1–2 serum (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar). For each line of interest, ∼10 whole T2 seedlings (14 days old) were extracted and assayed for GST activity and immunoreactive polypeptides by Western blotting after normalizing for total protein content. For fluorodifen spray trials, cells containing five 25-day-old T2 seedlings grown in compost, selected previously for the presence of T-DNA insertions by spraying with glufosinate ammonium to kill segregating wild-type plants, were sprayed with 20 μm fluorodifen formulated in 1% (v/v) acetone and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 daily for 14 days with each 23-cm2 cell receiving a 1-ml application.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization of Mutant GSTUs by Reconstructive PCR—ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2, showing 72% sequence identity to one another (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar, 10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar), were employed for reconstructive PCR using equal amounts of DNA fragments of pGSTU2 (pBluescript containing cDNA encoding ZmGSTU2) and pGSTU1 (pBluescript containing cDNA encoding ZmGSTU1). Following in vitro recombination, a single product was amplified by PCR from each reassembled template and cloned into pBluescript SK–. A microtiter plate screening procedure was used to assay 5000 mutant colonies for enhanced GST activity toward the herbicide fluorodifen based on the release of colored p-nitrophenol (Fig. 1, A and B). As compared with the parent ZmGSTUs, a significant proportion of mutants showed moderately enhanced activity, largely due to relatively higher levels of GST expression in the bacteria. Analysis of three such clones showed that they were chimeras of the N-terminal portion of ZmGSTU1 with the remaining sequence composed of ZmGSTU2. In each case, the specific activity of the pure enzyme toward fluorodifen was little affected. However, seven mutants were identified that had at least 5-fold higher enzyme activity (as judged visually) than bacteria expressing either ZmGSTU1 or ZmGSTU2. These EFD mutant clones pEFD1–7, expressing the mutant proteins EFD1–7, were sequenced (see supplementary information). Six of the seven EFDs were highly expressed, containing N termini (between 48 and 62 residues) derived from ZmGSTU1 (Fig. 1C). With the exception of EFD6, the remainder of the coding sequence was derived from ZmGSTU2, interrupted by a region, or regions, of varying size derived from ZmGSTU1 (Fig. 1C). In EFD6, there was no ZmGSTU1 insertion in the C-terminal half of the protein, but instead a single missense mutation corresponding to the substitution of glutamine with leucine at residue 115 (equivalent to residue 113 of ZmGSTU2) was identified.The seven EFD mutants were individually subcloned into the pET-11d plasmid, resulting in the expression of a 28-kDa polypeptide in each case as determined by SDS-PAGE. The kinetics of each EFD was then examined after purifying the enzymes by affinity chromatography, with the exception of EFD7, which was not analyzed further due to the instability of its activity. The recombinant GSTs were assayed with fluorodifen and the related diphenylether herbicides fomesafen and acifluorfen (Fig. 1A). All diphenylether substrates were used at relatively low concentrations (50 μm) due to their limited solubility in water. This made it impossible to directly determine the Km values toward these substrates, which were well above the solubility limit in each case. Instead, a value for enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was calculated in each case (Table I). Of the diphenylethers tested, both parent GSTUs and related EFDs showed a marked substrate preference for fluorodifen. The kcat/Km values for fluorodifen were higher in all the EFDs relative to the parent enzymes. This was in contrast to the results obtained with fomesafen and acifluorfen, with the mutant enzymes EFD1–5 showing similar or slightly reduced values for kcat/Km relative to ZmGSTU1, the only parent showing appreciable activity toward both herbicides. EFD6 did show a modest 4-fold increase in kcat/Km toward acifluorfen relative to ZmGSTU1 as compared with a greater than 18-fold enhancement with fluorodifen as substrate. These results suggested that gene shuffling studies had generated a set of mutant enzymes that had selectively improved activities toward fluorodifen but not toward closely related substrate chemistries. Constrained by their limited solubilities, it was not possible to further investigate the effects of gene shuffling on enzyme binding and turnover of the diphenylethers using kinetic analysis. However, it was possible to determine the effect of mutagenesis on substrate binding and turnover of the model substrate CDNB. Mutants EFD1–5 inclusive had apparent Km values toward GSH and CDNB and associated Vmax values that were within the range determined for the parent GSTUs. This was what would be predicted from mutant enzymes that are effectively chimeras of modular blocks of sequence from the two parents. In contrast, EFD6 had increased Km values toward both CDNB and GSH, coupled with a decreased Vmax. Taken together with the singular changes seen with EFD6 in the cleavage of fluorodifen, these results collectively suggested that this mutant had undergone a more radical change in active site topography than the other EFDs. With the exception of the substitution of residue 115, EFD6 was otherwise a simple chimera of the N-terminal portion of ZmGSTU1 and the remaining sequence of ZmGSTU2 (Fig. 1C). Based on the essentially conserved kinetic characteristics of the other chimeric EFDs in which blocks of sequence had been shuffled, it was concluded that the substitution at residue 115 was a key factor determining the novel detoxifying activities of EFD6. Attention was therefore focused on the selective mutagenesis of this residue.Table IKinetic characteristics of purified mutated and wild-type recombinant GSTUs toward the diphenylethers fluorodifen (Flu), acifluorfen (Aci), and Fomesafen (Fom) and the model spectrophotometric substrate CDNB, as well as GSHEnzymekcat/Km (Flu)kcat/Km (Aci)kcat/Km (Fom)kcat/Km (CDNB)Km (CDNB)aApparent values, calculated at 5 mM glutathione.Vmax (CDNB)aApparent values, calculated at 5 mM glutathione.Km (GSH)bApparent values, calculated at 1 mM CDNB.M-1·S-1M-1·S-1M-1·S-1M-1·S-1μMnanokatal/mgmMZmGSTU12301.636.7018,400101011100.56ZmGSTU2400ND0.42300,00011519101.72EFD152900.770.98219,00020622901.95EFD237001.101.26142,0001369300.76EFD375500.960.84343,00019719501.15EFD423600.621.50185,00020417301.18EFD525000.681.70144,00021215001.05EFD642907.609.10920018007604.75EFD6-115Q220ND0.52193,0001068800.92EFD6-115F50404.203.8047,4005348700.74EFD6-115A11,7004.902.60150,00020010600.78a Apparent values, calculated at 5 mM glutathione.b Apparent values, calculated at 1 mM CDNB. Open table in a new tab Directed Mutagenesis of EFD6 —A side effect of the L115Q substitution in EFD6 was that the mutant enzyme was predominantly expressed in the insoluble fraction in E. coli, unlike the other chimeric EFDs analyzed. Again, this was consistent with this substitution having a major effect on protein structure. Rational site-directed mutagenesis was employed to substitute the mutated residue and determine the effect on enzyme activity with the aim of finding a mutant with both high activity toward fluorodifen and more stable expression as a soluble protein. The original mutation replaced glutamine, a mediumsized neutral residue, with leucine, a smaller hydrophobic residue. This residue was therefore mutated to asparagine (neutral but smaller), glutamic acid (acidic, same size), phenylalanine (hydrophobic, large), or alanine (hydrophobic, small), giving the mutants EFD6–115N, EFD6–115E, EFD6–115F, and EFD6–115A, respectively. Residue 115 was also mutagenized back to glutamine to yield EFD6–115Q, effectively producing the unmutated chimera of ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2. Each of these mutants was expressed in E. coli as a LacZ fusion protein. Lysates from bacteria expressing EFD6–115E or EFD6–115N had negligible GST activity with the misfolded recombinant polypeptides precipitated in the inclusion bodies. In contrast, bacteria expressing EFD6–115F, EFD6–115A, and EFD6–115Q gave good yields of soluble GSTs, which were subjected to kinetic analysis (Table I). EFD6–115Q had characteristics similar to ZmGSTU2 toward both diphenylethers and CDNB, confirming that the point mutation in EFD6 affecting residue 115 was primarily responsible for the enhanced fluorodifen cleaving activity. As determined by comparing kcat/Km values, mutation of residue 115 to phenylalanine to produce EFD6–115F gave an enzyme with similar activity toward fluorodifen, reduced activities toward fomesafen and acifluorfen, and a 5-fold increase with CDNB as substrate. The latter change was effected by decreasing the Km toward CDNB rather than increasing Vmax. The most successful attempt at directed mutagenesis was seen with the substitution of residue 115 of EFD6 to alanine. The resulting mutant EFD6–115A had almost a 3-fold increase in kcat/Km toward fluorodifen relative to EFD6. Overall, the combination of DNA shuffling and directed mutagenesis of key residue 115 had caused a 29-fold increase in detoxifying activity toward fluorodifen relative to the most active parent enzyme ZmGSTU2. As compared with EFD6, the alanine substitution also restored a greater kcat/Km value toward CDNB, again as a result of lowering Km toward the substrate, giving an enzyme with essentially similar kinetic characteristics toward CDNB and glutathione to the parent ZmGSTUs, and suggesting that this mutant did not have the structural problems of EFD6. Similarly, the “optimized” mutant enzyme showed only minor differences in kcat/Km toward acifluorfen and fomesafen, herbicides resembling fluorodifen. When the structurally unrelated chloroacetanilide herbicides acetochlor, alachlor, and metolachlor were assayed as GST substrates, EFD6–115A showed specific activities of 112 picokatal/mg of pure protein, 72 picokatal/mg, and 144 picokatal/mg, respectively. These values were very similar to those determined with the purified ZmGSTUs assayed under identical conditions (ZmGSTU1, 160 picokatal/mg of pure protein 68 picokatal/mg, and 192 picokatal/mg, respectively; ZmGSTU2, 215 picokatal/mg of pure protein, 91 picokatal/mg, and 157 picokatal/mg, respectively).Effect of Expression of EFD Mutants on Tolerance to Fluorodifen in Planta—Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were individually engineered to express the parent ZmGSTUs, EFD6, EFD3, and EFD6–115A under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. This combination of EFDs was selected as EFD6–115A represented the optimized detoxifying enzyme generated through a combination of gene shuffling and directed mutagenesis, whereas EFD3 was the most efficient fluorodifen detoxifying enzyme generated by shuffling alone. None of the resulting T1 or T2 transgenics showed any abnormal phenotype under normal growth conditions. T2 plants were then analyzed for the expression of the introduced GSTUs by Western blotting using an antiserum raised to the ZmGSTU1–2 heterodimer and by assaying for fluorodifen cleaving activity (Fig. 2A). The antiserum recognized 28-kDa polypeptides in all GSTU-transformed lines except those expressing ZmGSTU2, which was due to the weak immunoreactivity of this protein with this antibody (9Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Google Scholar). When assayed for fluorodifen detoxifying activity (Fig. 2A), the only lines showing enhanced GST activity toward the herbicide in in vitro assays were those transformed with EFD3 and EFD6–115A, the latter showing 19-fold greater specific activity than the controls. It was then of interest to determine whether or not the transgenic expression of the herbicide detoxifying GST activity could confer tolerance to fluorodifen in planta.Fig. 2Analysis of T2 transgenic Arabidopsis. As shown in A, pools of plants derived from each construct were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-ZmGSTU1–2 serum.

The GST activities toward fluorodifen determined in duplicate crude extracts are shown as mean values (picokatal/mg total protein). As shown in B, plants transformed with vector alone, ZmGSTU1, ZmGSTU2, or EFD6–115A were treated daily with 20 μm fluorodifen (sprayed) or were left untreated (unsprayed) for 14 days in a glasshouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fluorodifen was originally developed as a selective photobleaching herbicide for use in crops of peanuts, soybean cotton, and rice rather than in the more sensitive Brassica species (17Shimabukuro R.H. Lamoureux G.L. Swanson H.R. Walsh W.C. Stafford L.E. Frear D.S. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 483-494Google Scholar). The selectivity of fluorodifen is associated with its greater rate of detoxification in tolerant crops as compared with susceptible weeds, principally through GST-mediated metabolism (3Frear D.S. Swanson H.R. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 473-482Google Scholar, 17Shimabukuro R.H. Lamoureux G.L. Swanson H.R. Walsh W.C. Stafford L.E. Frear D.S. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 483-494Google Scholar). It would therefore be anticipated that enhanced expression of a detoxifying GST in a normally susceptible species would give visibly greater tolerance to the photobleaching activity of fluorodifen, which is a characteristic feature of diphenylether herbicides even in tolerant crops (13Andrews C.J. Skipsey M. Townson J.K. Morris C. Jepson I. Edwards R. Pestic. Sci. 1997; 51: 213-222Google Scholar). Arabidopsis plants were found to be highly sensitive to fluorodifen when sprayed as an unformulated leaf drench treatment. Careful adjustment of the treatments showed that a repeated spraying of 25-day-old Arabidopsis plants with 20 μm fluorodifen gave a sublethal but severe photobleaching, which largely arrested growth. T2 generation controls and plants expressing ZmGSTU1, ZmGSTU2, or the optimized mutant EFD6–115A were then treated with the fluorodifen dosing regime, and the plants were visually assessed. After a 14-day treatment, the vector control, ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2-expressing plants, were severely stunted with the foliage showing signs of photobleaching and necrosis (Fig. 2B). Similarly treated plants expressing EFD6–115A were much less damaged, and although showing some photobleaching, had continued to grow at a rate similar to that of unsprayed plants.The recent availability of crystal structures of GSTUs from wheat (8Thom R. Cummins I. Dixon D.P. Edwards R. Cole D.J. Lapthorn A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7008-7020Google Scholar) and rice (Protein Data Bank accession number 1OYJ) has permitted molecular modeling of ZmGSTU2 as well as the EFD mutants binding to fluorodifen. EFD1–5 are essentially ZmGSTU2 with two regions of ZmGSTU1 in the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain, respectively (Fig. 3A). These changes in the N-terminal region were correlated with high levels of GST expression and a lower Km toward glutathione as compared with the other parent ZmGSTU1 (Table I).Fig. 3A, a ribbon representation of the structural model of ZmGSTU2 monomer colored to highlight the changes in a representative EFD mutant enzyme (EFD2).

It is increasingly recognized that FAK functions as a point of convergence and integration in the action of multiple signals (33Zachary I. Rozengurt E.

FAK promotes the transmission of downstream signaling by binding and recruiting signaling and adaptor proteins (3Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, located N-terminal to the catalytic domain, creates a binding site for the tyrosine kinase Src (35Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and other downstream signaling effectors. Subsequent Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 is important for the maximal activation of FAK and down-stream signaling events (14Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation at Tyr-925 within the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain creates a binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2-SOS (Ras exchange factor) complex and provides a possible mechanism of activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (36Schlaepfer D.D.

The FAT domain binds paxillin and talin, which are responsible for targeting FAK to the focal adhesions and for promoting downstream signaling (36Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that overexpression of FAK is linked to the invasive properties of cancer cells (46Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1024-1025Abstract PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 47Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to being phosphorylated at multiple tyrosines in response to external stimuli, FAK is also phosphorylated at serine residues (48Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. Fry D. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, Ser-722 and Ser-910, in the COOH-terminal, noncatalytic region of FAK (termed FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK)), have been identified as prominent phosphorylation sites (49Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of FAK in signal transduction, virtually nothing is known about the regulation of these phosphorylation events. In particular, none of the previous studies demonstrated that the phosphorylation of any of these serine residues of FAK can be regulated in response to cell stimulation by either GPCR agonists or ligands of tyrosine kinase receptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin, LPA, PDB, or EGF induces a rapid and dramatic increase in Ser-910 phosphorylation of endogenous FAK. Treatment with the PKC inhibitor GF I or Ro 31-8220 or chronic exposure to PDB to down-regulate PKCs prevented the increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 induced by bombesin or PDB. Since bombesin or PDB induces ERK activation through a PKC-dependent pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells and because the amino acids surrounding Ser-910 conform to a consensus site for mitogen-activated protein kinases, we also examined whether the ERKs mediate FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in response to extracellular stimuli. Our results show that ERK inhibitors prevented FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in response to either bombesin or PDB. Furthermore, LPA, another GPCR agonist that induces ERK via pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive Gi rather than Gq and ligands of tyrosine kinase receptors that induce potent ERK pathway activation through PKC-independent pathways, including EGF, also stimulated a dramatic increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910. In addition, activated ERK2 can directly phosphorylate FAK (or recombinant FRNK) at Ser-910 in vitro. Thus, our results show that stimulation with bombesin, LPA, PDB, or EGF stimulates phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at Ser-910 via an ERK-dependent pathway in Swiss 3T3 cells. Cell Culture—Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6–8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. For assays using suspended cells, confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were washed three times with DMEM and subsequently suspended in 10 ml of DMEM by gentle scraping. The cell suspension was then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before stimulation with the respective agonists. Cell Stimulation with Bombesin and Other Agonists—Confluent and quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM, equilibrated in the same medium at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and then treated with bombesin or other factors for the times indicated. We used 2 × 106 cells grown in 100-mm dishes containing 10 ml of DMEM for each experimental condition. The stimulation was terminated by aspirating the medium and solubilizing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with protein A-agarose linked to polyclonal anti-FAK (C-20) antibody, as previously described. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer and extracted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) by boiling for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Gel electrophoresis was performed with 8% acrylamide in the separating gel, 4% in the staking gel, and 0.1% SDS. Immunoprecipitates with paxillin were resolved with 8 and 12.5% acrylamide in the separating gel. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-Tyr(P) Ab (1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Tyr-397 (0.1 μg/ml), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Ser(P)-722 Ab (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Ser(P)-910 Ab (0.1 μg/ml), anti-ERK2 (0.1 μg/ml), or anti-paxillin (0.1 μg/ml) as indicated. The membranes were washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibody to rabbit (NA 934V) or mouse (NA931V)) (1:5000) for 1 h at 22 °C. After washing three times with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents. Autoradiograms were scanned using the GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the labeled bands were quantified using the Quantity One software program (Bio-Rad). Generation and Overexpression of Mutant FAK—pFLAG-CMV™-2 expression vector (Sigma) containing FAK wild type was used to perform the mutation of Ser-910 to Ala with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). COS-7 cells were cultured to 40–60% confluence on 100-mm plates, and then 6 μg of DNA were transfected with Lipofectin according to the instructions from Invitrogen. Cells were then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfection medium was aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum prior to further treatment. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Confluent Swiss 3T3 100 mm plates were lysed in RIPA buffer, and unstimulated FAK was immunoprecipitated. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and three times with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunocomplexes in 70 μl of kinase buffer or GST-FRNK or GST-FRNKS910A in 100 μl of kinase buffer were incubated with activated ERK2 (Calbiochem) and 10 μm cold ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 490 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-FRNK Fusion Protein—pFLAG-CMV™-2 expression vector containing FAK wild type and FAK-S910A were used to create FRNK (noncatalytic domain of FAK (amino acids 693–1053)) by PCR amplification using specific oligonucleotide primers (forward primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAATCCAGGCGACAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AGTTAGCGGCCGCTTAGTGGGGCCTGGACTG-3′) containing restriction sites for BamHI and NotI, respectively (underlined). The resulting PCR products were subcloned as a BamHI-NotI fragment into the vector pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the bacterial expression constructs pGEX-GST-FRNK and pGEX-GST-FRNKS910A. The 57-kDa GST-FRNK and GST-FRNKS910A were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) for 2 h, induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The GST alone and the two fusion proteins were purified with the B-PER GST fusion protein purification kit from Pierce, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer exchange was performed with an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.) and used immediately in the in vitro kinase assay. Materials—Bombesin, endothelin, and LPA were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies to rabbit (NA 934V) or mouse (NA931V), and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. FAK polyclonal Ab C-20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The phosphospecific polyclonal Abs to Ser-722 and Ser-910 of FAK were obtained from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody 4G10 and anti-FAK 2A7 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). SYPRO RED protein stain was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. Bombesin Induces FAK Phosphorylation at Ser-910 —Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies provide a powerful strategy to analyze site-specific phosphorylations of a variety of proteins. To examine whether the phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at Ser residues is regulated by GPCR agonists, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were incubated with 10 nm bombesin for various times, and lysates of these agonist-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using a site-specific antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated state of FAK at Ser-910. The Western blot analysis illustrated in Fig. 1 (upper panel) shows that prior to stimulation, pS910 immunoreactivity was virtually absent, indicating that Ser-910 of FAK was not phosphorylated in quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells. Upon bombesin stimulation, pS910 immunoreactivity of a single protein band in SDS-PAGE migrating at the expected apparent molecular mass for FAK (120 kDa) increased dramatically in a time-dependent manner. An increase in FAK phosphorylation, as revealed by immunoblotting with the pS910 antibody, was detected 3 min after the addition of the agonist, reached a maximum within 5–10 min, and remained relatively constant for up to 60 min. The maximal increase of FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 induced by bombesin was 13.4 ± 1.2-fold, as compared with the unstimulated level. Bombesin stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells promoted FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, middle panel). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel), the pS910 antibody only very weakly recognized FAK isolated from unstimulated cells. The results presented in Fig. 1 show that bombesin stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells induces a striking increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910. We also examined whether bombesin regulates FAK phosphorylation at Ser-722 by Western blotting using a site-specific antibody that detects the phosphorylated state of this residue in FAK. As shown in Fig. 1 (lower panel), the pS722 antibody recognized FAK isolated from unstimulated cells, indicating that Ser-722 of FAK, in contrast to Ser-910, was phosphorylated in the basal state of Swiss 3T3 cells. Furthermore, the addition of bombesin to these cells caused only small changes in the phosphorylation of Ser-722 as compared with that of Ser-910 (Fig. 1, lower panel). These results indicate that bombesin induces a selective increase in the phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at Ser-910 in Swiss 3T3 cells. Cytochalasin D Dissociates Bombesin-induced FAK Tyrosine Phosphorylation from FAK Phosphorylation at Ser-910 —Previously, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and complex formation between FAK and Src in response to GPCR agonists requires an intact actin cytoskeleton (7Sinnett-Smith J.

Specifically, treatment of the cells with cytochalasin D, which caps the barbed end of actin filaments and promotes their depolymerization, inhibits the increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in response to bombesin and other GPCR agonists. Here, we examined whether cytochalasin d-mediated disruption of the actin cytoskeleton interferes with the increase in the phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-910 induced by bombesin. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were exposed for 2 h to increasing concentrations of cytochalasin D and then stimulated with bombesin for another 30 min. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FAK antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with either a specific anti-Tyr(P) antibody or with the antibody that recognizes phosphorylated FAK at Ser-910. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with cytochalasin D completely blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by bombesin in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal inhibitory effect was achieved at 2.4 μm, a concentration that completely disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and the assembly of focal adhesions (7Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In striking contrast, a similar treatment with cytochalasin D did not induce any significant effect on FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in response to bombesin (Fig. 2B). Dissolution of actin filaments can also be induced by preventing integrin-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton (i.e. by suspending cells in serum-free medium). To substantiate the results obtained with cytochalasin D, we also examined FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in suspended cells. As seen in Fig. 2B (inset), bombesin induced a marked increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 in Swiss 3T3 cells kept in suspension. The findings presented in Fig. 2 indicate that, in striking contrast to the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, bombesin induces a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of FAK at Ser-910 through a pathway that does not require an intact actin organization and the localization of FAK to focal adhesions. Bombesin Induces FAK Phosphorylation at Ser-910 through a PKC-dependent Pathway—Agonist stimulation of the bombesin GPCR activates the α-subunit of Gq, which stimulates the β isoforms of phospholipase C, which catalyze the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that triggers the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, and diacylglycerol that activates the classical and novel isoforms of PKC (reviewed in Ref. 51Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that treatment with cytochalasin D, at concentrations that disrupt the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and completely prevent the increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, does not interfere with agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores, and activation of PKC. These findings prompted us to determine whether the increase in FAK Ser-910 phosphorylation in response to bombesin is mediated through a PKC-dependent pathway. To determine whether direct activation of PKC increases FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with 100 nm PDB for various times and lysed. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using the site-specific antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated state of FAK at Ser-910. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with PDB caused a dramatic, time-dependent increase in FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910. PDB stimulated FAK Ser-910 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner; maximal effect was achieved at 100 nm. Western blotting with anti-FAK antibody showed that the recovery of FAK from cell lysates was not altered by treatment with PDB. In addition, exposure to the membrane-permeant diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, an analog of the endogenous activator of PKC, also increased FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910 (Fig. 3B, inset). Collectively, the results presented in Fig. 3 suggested that PKC activation provides a potential mechanism leading to FAK phosphorylation at Ser-910. Consequently, the following experiments were designed to examine the role of PKC in bombesin-induced FAK Ser-910 phosphorylation. Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with GF I (also known as GF 109203X or bisindolylmaleimide I) or Ro 31-8220, potent inhibitors of phorbol ester-sensitive isoforms of PKC (7Sinnett-Smith J.

However, p63 mutations associated with the ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) syndrome (Hay-Wells syndrome) were found in the p63 carboxyl-terminal region with a sterile α-motif. By two-hybrid screen we identified several proteins that interact with the p63α carboxyl terminus and its sterile α-motif, including the apobec-1-binding protein-1 (ABBP1). AEC-associated mutations completely abolished the physical interaction between ABBP1 and p63α. Moreover the physical association of p63α and ABBP1 led to a specific shift of FGFR-2 alternative splicing toward the K-SAM isoform essential for epithelial differentiation. We thus propose that a p63α-ABBP1 complex differentially regulates FGFR-2 expression by supporting alternative splicing of the K-SAM isoform of FGFR-2. The inability of mutated p63α to support this splicing likely leads to the inhibition of epithelial differentiation and, in turn, accounts for the AEC phenotype. p63, a p53 family member, is required for craniofacial and limb development as well as proper skin differentiation.

The recently discovered p53 homologue, p63, utilizes two promoters and an alternative splicing mechanism to encode six distinct protein isotypes (1Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R.

These isotypes (TAp63α, TAp63β, TAp63γ, ΔNp63α, ΔNp63β, and ΔNp63γ) differ in their ability to transactivate responsive genes, control the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis (1Osada M. Ohba M.

Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 94-95Google Scholar). p63α is the longest isotype that contains a transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domain and a sterile α-motif at the extreme carboxyl terminus (2Trink B. Okami K. Wu L. Sriuranpong V. Jen J. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 747-748Google Scholar). p63 functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in epidermal-mesenchymal interactions during embryonic development where it is required for regenerative proliferation of limb, for craniofacial and epithelial development, and for skin renewal (5Mills A. Zheng B. Wang X. Vogel H. Roop D. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Google Scholar, 6Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Google Scholar). In addition, p63 expression has been closely identified with keratinocyte stem cell proliferation (7Pellegrini G. Dellambra E. Golisano O. Martinelli E. Fantozzi I. Bondanza S. Ponzin D. McKeon F. Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3156-3161Google Scholar). The proliferating cells of stratified squamous epithelia consist of stem cells and transient amplifying cells producing holoclones and paraclones, respectively. While p63 is abundantly expressed by epidermal and limbal holoclones, it is undetectable in paraclones (7Pellegrini G. Dellambra E. Golisano O. Martinelli E. Fantozzi I. Bondanza S. Ponzin D. McKeon F. Luca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3156-3161Google Scholar). Several developmental craniofacial abnormalities (ectodermal dysplasias) are caused by p63 mutations in humans (8Celli J. Duijf P. Hamel B. Bamshad M. Kramer B. Smits A. Newbury-Ecob R. Hennekam R.

Mutations in the p63 DNA binding domain are found in patients with ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate, split hand/foot malformation, and limb-mammary syndrome (8Celli J. Duijf P. Hamel B. Bamshad M. Kramer B. Smits A. Newbury-Ecob R. Hennekam R. Buggenhout G. Haeringen A. Woods C. Essen A. de Waal R. Vriend G. Haber D. Yang A. McKeon F. Brunner H. van Bokhoven H. Cell. 1999; 99: 143-153Google Scholar). Moreover a number of p63 mutations associated with the ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting (AEC) 1The abbreviations used are: AEC, ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting; ABBP1, apobec-1-binding protein-1; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; AD, activation domain; CMV, cytomegalovirus; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; mut, mutant; wt, wild type; CT, carboxyl terminus; BD, binding domain; hnRNP, heteronuclear ribonucleoproteins; KGFR, keratinocyte growth factor receptor; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SD, synthetic dextrose; Ade, adenine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; SAM, sterile α-motif. syndrome (Hay-Wells syndrome) have been mapped inside the sterile α-motif (9McGrath J.

Hamel B. van Bokhoven H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 221-229Google Scholar). Thus, p63 mutations found in the AEC syndrome represent a perfect model to study unique p63 protein-protein interactions (9McGrath J. Duijf P. Doetsch V. Irvine A. de Waal R. Vanmolkot K. Wessagowit V. Kelly A. Atherton D. Griffiths W. Orlow J. van Haeringen A. Ausems M. Yang A. McKeon F. Bamshad M. Brunner H. Hamel B. van Bokhoven H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 221-229Google Scholar). The sterile α-motif is a 65–70-amino acid residue sequence found in many diverse proteins from yeast to humans whose functions range from signal transduction to transcriptional repression. The sterile α-motifs have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions via the formation of homo- and heterotypic oligomers (11Schultz J. Ponting C. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Google Scholar, 12Chi S. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Google Scholar, 13Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct.

We sought to identify protein candidates that interact specifically with p63 via its sterile α-motif and to evaluate the effect of known AEC genetic alterations on this molecular interaction. We found that p63α binds apobec-1-binding protein-1 (ABBP1), a member of the RNA processing machinery, resulting in a shift of FGFR-2 alternative splicing toward the epithelial specific K-SAM isoform. However, mutant p63 harboring AEC-derived mutations failed to bind ABBP1. Thus, mutations mapped to p63 sterile α-motif may result in the AEC syndrome by abolishing the interaction with ABBP1 and modulating the FGFR-2 pathway leading to aberrant differentiation. Antibodies, Reagents, Cells, and Transfections—We used mouse monoclonal antibodies against all p63 isotypes (4A4, 1:200) and against the carboxyl terminus of p63α (H-129, 1:200, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ΔNp63 (Ab-1, 1:200, Oncogene Research Products). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against CBF-A (homologue of ABBP1, 1:250) was obtained from Drs. Tomas Leanderson and Alaitz Aranburu (Lund University, Lund, Sweden). His-tagged p40 protein (residues 1–356, smallest p63 isotype) was obtained from Dr. Keiho Yamaguchi (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and purified as described previously (34Ratovitski E. Patturajan M. Hibi K. Trink B. Yamaguchi K. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1817-1822Google Scholar). The human skin keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT, spontaneously immortalized) and human embryonic retina cell line (911, immortalized by adenovirus E1 expression) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. Both HaCaT and 911 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were isolated by us during 1985–1992 as described previously (33Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W. Caballero O. Hill D. Ratovitski E. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Google Scholar). Skin tissue samples were obtained from p63-null mice (Ref. 5Mills A. Zheng B. Wang X. Vogel H. Roop D. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Google Scholar, Jackson Laboratories). Both p63+/– and –/– mice were bred at The Johns Hopkins University Animal Core Facility. Normal C57Bl6 mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratory. Preparation of Adenoviral Expression Vectors—Recombinant adenoviruses driving expression of wild type or mutant p63α proteins under control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were prepared as described elsewhere (33Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W. Caballero O. Hill D. Ratovitski E. Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Google Scholar). cDNA for wild type or mutant p63α was subcloned into a pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector and then introduced in viral backbone vector pAdEasy1 by homologous recombination in BJ5183 Escherichia coli cells (QBiogene). Resulting constructs were screened by PacI restriction digestion. PacI-linearized constructs for empty pAd, pAd-p40, pAd-TAp63α (wt), pAd-TAp63α (mut, L518F), pAd-ΔNp63α (wt), and pAd-ΔNp63α (mut, L518F) were introduced into 911 cells to generate adenoviruses. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified by propagation in 911 cells. The CsCl-purified final viral preparations displayed a multiplicity of infection of ∼1012 plaque-forming units/ml monitored by titration and expression levels of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfections—Cells (in a six-well plate) were transiently transfected for 24 h with the desired plasmids (5 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (20 μl, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol or by a modified calcium phosphate-mediated protocol (1Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 2× MES buffer, pH 7.05, and 2.5 m CaCl2 for 20 min and then added to 911 cells (in a six-well plate) for 24 h. For transfection of cells grown in a T-25 or T-75 flask, the amount of DNA and reagents was scaled up. The efficiency of transfection was monitored by co-transformation with a pAdTrack-GFP vector. The average transfection efficiency was ∼80–90%. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Brij-50, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2× complete protease inhibitor mixture), sonicated five times for 10-s time intervals, and clarified for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants (designated as total cell lysates) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting (∼30–60 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitation (∼150–200 μg/lane). Proteins transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 10% fat-free milk (Bio-Rad) in 0.5% phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20 for 1 h; then incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted 1:500; washed twice with 0.5% phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20; incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins, both from Sigma) coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000; and finally washed three times with 0.5% phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20. Protein bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation 500 μl of total cell lysates were incubated with 10 μl of normal rabbit serum for 30 min and then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B for 30 min (34Ratovitski E. Patturajan M. Hibi K. Trink B. Yamaguchi K. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1817-1822Google Scholar). Following centrifugation 500 μl of precleared supernatant was incubated for 3 h with primary antibodies, and then with 40 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B (or goat anti-mouse agarose) for 4 h at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were boiled in 4× Laemmli buffer and then fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (34Ratovitski E. Patturajan M. Hibi K. Trink B. Yamaguchi K. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1817-1822Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the Matchmaker Gal4 system 3 using four two-hybrid cDNA libraries from human fetal kidney, human fetal liver, human keratinocytes, and HeLa cells (Clontech). As bait plasmids, we used pGal4-BD-p63CT (containing the complete carboxyl-terminal part, residues 411–642) or pGal4-BD-p63-SAM (containing the sterile α-motif, residues 499–568) of p63α. Appropriate DNA fragments (carboxyl terminus (CT), 1234–1926 base pairs; sterile α-motif (SAM), 1498–1704 base pairs) were amplified by PCR from TAp63α cDNA as a template using the following primers: for CT, sense, 5′-GGTCGCCCGGACCTCAATACAGTCTCCATCTTCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTGTCGACTCACTCCCCCTCCTCTTTGATGCGCTG-3′; for SAM, sense, 5′-GGTCGCCCGGCCCCCACCTCCGTATCCCACAGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTGTCCAGGAGCTGCCGGTGGTCCAGGATGC-3′. PCR fragments were subcloned into a pBD-Gal4-Cm vector (Stratagene) in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain using the SrfI and SalI restriction sites. The resulting pGal4-BD-CT or pGal4-BD-SAM plasmids were used as baits and introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain AH109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ). The resulting transformed yeast strains (CT+ or SAM+) were sequentially transformed with 50–100 μg of each cDNA library constructed into the pACT2 vector in-frame with the Gal4 transcription activation domain Gal4-AD. Transformed clones were selected on 20-cm SD/His–/Trp–/Leu–-agar plates. All clones were verified based on their ability to grow on different selective media, SD/Trp–/Leu–, SD/Trp–/Leu–/His– and SD/Trp–/Leu–/His–/Ade–, in the presence of X-gal to screen for ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1 expression. All positive clones were grown on complete YPAD medium, and total DNA was purified using glass beads (Sigma) and then used for retransformation into E. coli (XL blue strain). DNA from ampicillin-resistant colonies was purified and used for DNA sequencing using Gal4 DNA binding domain 5′- and 3′-specific primers (Clontech). The intermolecular interactions between bait and prey proteins were verified by subsequent transformation of both bait and prey plasmids into the AH109 yeast strain followed by α- and β-galactosidase assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Protein Expression—Two isoforms, ABBP1 and ABBP1Δex1/6, were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion recombinant polypeptides. The full-length cDNA for A/B heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) (MGC 10739) was purchased from ATCC. The A/B hnRNP protein differs from the ABBP1 protein in that it lacks the carboxyl-terminal 47-amino acid residue insert (residues 263–311, see Fig. 3). The ABBP1 cDNA as a GST fusion construct was obtained from Dr. Paul P. Lau (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA has a BamHI deletion in the RNA binding domain at the amino terminus of ABBP1 (residues 101–186). Therefore, this plasmid was designated as pGST-ABBP1ΔBamHI. To restore the full-length ABBP1 sequence, we amplified this DNA fragment by PCR using A/B hnRNP cDNA as a template and the following primers: sense, 5′-GCGGATCCCAACACTGGACGGTCAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGATCCATTGGCAATTCAATGGCCT-3′. Both primers contained putative BamHI restriction sites allowing us to subclone this fragment into the BamHI site in the pGST-ABBP1ΔBamHI plasmid. The resulting construct was verified by sequencing and designated as ABBP1. Using the following PCR primers, sense, 5′-GCGCGAATTCATGTCGGAAGCGGGCGAGGAGCAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGTATGGCTTGTAGTTATTCTG-3′ (containing EcoRI and NotI sites, respectively), we amplified the open reading frames for ABBP1, ABBP1Δex1/6, and ABBP1ΔBamHI and then subcloned them into a pCMV-Sport6 vector for mammalian expression and into a pGEX-4T-1 for E. coli expression of GST fusion proteins. For mammalian expression each pCMV-Sport6 construct was transiently transfected into 911 or HaCaT cells. For bacterial expression, each pGEX-4T-1 construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (Novagen). Overnight cultures of E. coli transformed with recombinant pGEX plasmids were diluted 1:10 in L broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm at 37 °C. After a further 2 h of growth, cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in a 1:5 (v/v) dilution of the original culture volume of NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing proteases inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified from 1-liter cultures using glutathione-agarose column chromatography (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions eluted from glutathione-agarose column were additionally purified by fast performance liquid chromatography on a 5-ml MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 30-ml, 50–800 mm KCl gradient (1 ml/min) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Approximately 1.0–2.0 mg of fusion protein was purified from 3–4 g of bacterial cells. Site-specific Mutagenesis—Plasmid DNA preparations from mammalian (pCMV-Sport6) and yeast (pGal4-BD) expression vectors containing cDNAs for human TAp63α, ΔNp63α, and pGal4-BD-SAM were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To introduce the following point mutations (518, Leu to Phe; 518, Leu to Val; 526, Cys to Gly; 534, Gly to Val; 540, Gln to Leu; and 541, Ile to Thr) into p63-SAM we used the following 5′-phospho-oligonucleotides and their reverse complements: 518 (Leu to Phe), 5′-GTCAGTTTCTTTGCGAGGTTGGGC-3′; 518 (Leu to Val), 5′-GTCAGTTTCGTTGCGAGGTTGGGC-3′; 526 (Cys to Gly), 5′-TGTTCATCAGGTCTGGACTAT-3′; 534 (Gly to Val), 5′-ACGACCCAGGTGCTGACCACC-3′; 540 (Gln to Leu), 5′-ACCATCTATCTGATTGAGCAT-3′; 541 (Ile to Thr), 5′-ATCTATCAGACTGAGCATTAC-3′. The amplification of plasmids with a high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase I was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The resulting mutated constructs were transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells followed by sequencing. RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was used to generate cDNA from each sample using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and custom primers for the FGFR-2 common region or specific primers for either the K-SAM or BEK exons: FGFR-2com, sense, 5′-TGTTGAAAGATGCCGCCGTG-3′; FGFR-2com, antisense, 5′-CGTGTGATTGATGGACCCGTATTC-3′; FGFR-2Bek, antisense, 5′-GCGTCCTCAAAAGTTACATTCCG-3′; KGFRK-Sam, antisense, 5′-CGGTCACATTGAACAGAGCCAG-3′. As an internal loading control we amplified the GAPDH region using the following primers: sense, 5′-GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGTGGGGACACGGAAGG-3′. PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose electrophoresis or 4–20% gradient non-denatured PAGE (Bio-Rad) and visualized with ethidium bromide. For each primer set the number of amplification cycles was predetermined to remain in the exponential phase. To provide a high degree of standardization all experiments including HaCaT and 911 were performed simultaneously using the same reaction mixture, and GAPDH was co-amplified to confirm equal amounts of starting cDNA. RT-PCR amplification results were analyzed digitally by Kodak 1D 3.5 software (Eastman Kodak Co.). The net intensity of PCR bands for the full-length FGFR-2-BEK and K-SAM (KGFR) were measured and normalized to net intensity of the control GAPDH bands. Two-hybrid Screening of p63-interacting Proteins—Previous reports clearly identified germ line mutations of p63 sterile α-motif in the AEC syndrome (9McGrath J. Duijf P. Doetsch V. Irvine A. de Waal R. Vanmolkot K. Wessagowit V. Kelly A. Atherton D. Griffiths W. Orlow J. van Haeringen A. Ausems M. Yang A. McKeon F. Bamshad M. Brunner H. Hamel B. van Bokhoven H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 221-229Google Scholar). We hypothesized that protein interactions mediated by the sterile α-motif of p63α would contribute to the AEC phenotype. We thus sought to identify protein candidates that interact with the p63 sterile α-motif by means of two-hybrid screens. We generated yeast expression constructs containing the CT of p63α (residues 411–642) or the SAM (residues 499–568). Both sequences (CT or SAM) were subcloned in-frame to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD), and resulting bait plasmids were designated as pGal4-BD-p63CT or pGal4-BD-p63-SAM, respectively. Using pGal4-BD-p63CT as bait, we screened four two-hybrid cDNA libraries from human fetal kidney, human fetal liver, human keratinocytes, and HeLa cells. After screening a total 6.9 × 106 yeast transformants, we identified 48 positive clones. All clones were verified to grow on different selective media, SD/Trp–Leu–, SD/His–Trp–Leu–, and SD/Ade–His–Trp–Leu– in the presence of X-gal to screen for ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1 expression. This high stringency screen virtually eliminates false positive interactions but preserves low affinity interactions. As controls, we used yeast expression constructs with a p53/SV40 pair (positive) or a p53/lamin C pair (negative) (data not shown). In addition, the intermolecular interactions between bait and prey proteins were verified by subsequent transformation of both plasmids into the AH109 yeast strain followed by α- and β-galactosidase assays. These individual clones were sequenced and found to encode the following human proteins: RACK1 (G-binding protein, protein kinase C receptor, 16 clones), Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (four clones), ABBP1 (seven clones), Era guanine trinucleotide phosphohydrolase A (five clones), Scaf4/rA4 RNA-splicing protein (nine clones), β-catenin (four clones), and β-microglobulin (three clones). All pGal4-AD plasmids isolated from identified positive yeast colonies were also found to interact with pGal4-BD-SAM (data not shown). Qualitative and quantitative assays showed that the interactions between p63 and RACK1, ABBP1, or Scaf4/rA4 proteins are specific (Fig. 1). To establish whether mutations found in the AEC syndrome affect any of these protein interactions, we generated a bait p63 construct with a mutation in the sterile α-motif at position 518 (Leu to Phe) representing the most common genetic alteration in AEC. Pairs of wild type and mutant pGal4-BD-p63-SAM baits and appropriate prey plasmids were retransformed into the AH109 yeast strain, and protein interactions were monitored by selective growth and α- and β-galactosidase assays. As shown, introduction of the L518F mutation dramatically decreased the association of p63 with ABBP1 and Scaf4/rA4, while interactions with the RACK1 prey plasmid were unaffected (Fig. 1). The interaction of p63 with other prey plasmids (Era, Ral, β-catenin, and β-microglobulin) was also unaffected by this mutation (data not shown). p63-SAM Specifically Associates with ABBP1—We decided to focus our efforts on further study of the ABBP1-p63 interaction. Sequence analysis of the prey cDNA that interacted with the p63 sterile α-motif identified predominantly the carboxyl-terminal domain of human ABBP1 (Fig. 2). Two isoforms of the A/B hnRNP family were identified previously in mammalian cells including humans (ABBP1 and A/B hnRNP, Refs. 15Khan F. Jaiswal A. Szer W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 159-161Google Scholar and 16Lau P. Zhu H. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Google Scholar). They share the same sequence except for a 47-residue region, which is present in ABBP1 but missing in the alternatively spliced isoform A/B hnRNP (17Champion-Arnaud P. Ronsin C. Gilbert E. Gesnel M. Houssaint E. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 979-987Google Scholar, 18Gatto F. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4825-4834Google Scholar, 19Sarig G. Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 617-623Google Scholar). To evaluate the specific region of ABBP1 that mediates its association with the p63 sterile α-motif, we carried out two-hybrid yeast expression studies between pGal4-BD-p63-SAM and either pGal4-AD-ABBP1, ABBP1ΔBamHI, or pGal4-AD-ABBP1Δex1/6 (Fig. 2). We found that only ABBP1 was capable of interacting with p63-SAM, while ABBP1Δex1/6 failed to show binding to the p63 sterile α-motif in yeast (data not shown). Moreover the mutated p63-SAM baits (L518F, L518V, C526G, G534V, Q540L, and I541T) also failed to maintain binding between p63 and ABBP1 (data not shown). These observations suggest that these residues are critical for maintaining the interaction between the p63 sterile α-motif and ABBP1. To confirm the results of two-hybrid screens by independent techniques, we generated pCMV-Sport6 expression cassettes for ABBP1, ABBP1ΔBamHI, and ABBP1Δex1/6 driven by CMV promoter. The resulting constructs were transiently transfected into 911 cells together with the p63 expression constructs (ΔNp63α, wild type or mutant), and expression was monitored by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). Protein levels of recombinant polypeptides were evaluated by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated (Fig. 3, C and D). We observed that p63α exclusively associated with the full-length ABBP1 and ABBP1ΔBamHI, while it failed to associate with ABBP1Δex1/6 (Fig. 3E). However, all ABBP1 isoforms failed to associate with the p63α mutant (L518F) emphasizing the importance of this residue in forming physical complexes between p63α and ABBP1. To further examine the association of p63α and ABBP1, we generated GST fusion polypeptides for ABBP1, ABBP1Δex1/6, and ABBP1ΔBamHI. The BamHI deletion of ABBP1 produces an isoform lacking a major part of the RNA binding domain, and deletions of exons 1 and 6 produce isoforms lacking the p63α binding domain. We also expressed the wild type and mutant p63α using expression constructs and recombinant adenoviruses. Total cell lysates expressing p63 isotypes were mixed with purified GST fusion ABBP1 isoforms, and protein complexes were precipitated with an antibody to CBF-A and blotted with an antibody to p63 (Fig. 4). As a control, we used the His-tagged p40 protein (the smallest p63 isotype lacking the extreme carboxyl-terminal of p63α). Our data demonstrate that p63α forms a physical complex with ABBP1 or ABBP1ΔBamHI but not with ABBP1Δex1/6 (Fig. 4C). As expected, His-p40 failed to bind either of the ABBP1 polypeptides (Fig. 4C). Mixing of total lysates of 911 cells expressing p63 polypeptides with GST fusion ABBP1 protein showed that both TAp63α and ΔNp63α associate with ABBP1, whereas p40 and all tested p63α proteins bearing AEC-derived mutations failed to form complexes with GST-ABBP1 (Fig. 4D). Thus, we propose that the 47-residue insert of ABBP1 (residues 263–311) likely functions as a binding site for the p63 sterile α-motif. The primary structures of the p63 and p73 sterile α-motifs are very similar, and based on p73 (12Chi S. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Google Scholar), a homology model for the p63 sterile α-motif has been proposed (3Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M. Dotsch V. Andrews N. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Google Scholar). According to this model all AEC-a"

Thus, we investigated the involvement of NPY receptors in mediating neuroprotection against excitotoxic insults in organotypic cultures of rat hippocampal slices. Exposure of hippocampal slice cultures to 2 microM AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate) induced neuronal degeneration, monitored by propidium iodide uptake, of granule cells and CA1 pyramidal cells. For dentate granule cells, selective activation of Y1, Y2, or Y5 receptors with 1 microM [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, 300 nM NPY13-36 or 1 microM 500 nM NPY(19-23)-(Gly1,Ser3,Gln4,Thr6,Ala31,Aib32,Gln34)-PP, respectively, had a neuroprotective effect against AMPA, whereas only the activation of Y2 receptors was effective for CA1 pyramidal cells. When the slice cultures were exposed to 6 microM kainate, the CA3 pyramidal cells displayed significant degeneration, and in this case the activation of Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors was neuroprotective. For the kainic acid-induced degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells, it was again found that only the Y2 receptor activation was effective. Based on the present findings, it was concluded that Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors effectively can modify glutamate receptor-mediated neurodegeneration in the hippocampus."

Parkin is inactivated by caspase cleavage, and the major cleavage site is after Asp126. Caspases responsible for parkin cleavage were identified by several experimental paradigms. Transient coexpression of caspases and wild type parkin in HEK-293 cells identified caspase-1, -3, and -8 as efficient inducers of parkin cleavage whereas caspase-2, -7, -9, and -11 did not induce cleavage. A D126A parkin mutation abrogates cleavage induced by caspase-1 and -8, but not by caspase-3. In anti-Fas-treated Jurkat T cells, parkin cleavage was inhibited by caspase inhibitors hFlip and CrmA (but not by X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)), indicating that caspase-8 (but not caspase-3) is responsible for the parkin cleavage in this model. Moreover, induction of apoptosis in caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cells, either by caspase-1 or -8 overexpression or by tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, led to parkin cleavage. These results demonstrate that caspase-1 and -8 can directly cleave parkin and suggest that death receptor activation and inflammatory stress can cause loss of the ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin, thus causing accumulation of toxic parkin substrates and triggering dopaminergic cell death.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by a variety of motor dysfunctions including rigidity, tremor, slowness of movement, and disturbance of balance (1Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Google Scholar). The disease is a consequence of a reduced level of striatal dopamine, which follows the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Lesions in the parkin gene have been reported to be a frequent cause of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson's disease (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S.

The parkin gene encodes an intracellular parkin protein of 465 amino acids that contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and two C-terminal RING finger domains (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Google Scholar).

Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification that involves the ATP-dependent sequential action of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin protein ligase; Chx, cycloheximide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; WT, wild-type; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin protein ligase; Chx, cycloheximide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; WT, wild-type; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). The transfer of a ubiquitin molecule from an E2 onto a substrate is mediated by an E3 that specifies the substrate. Polyubiquitin chains provide a targeting signal for protein degradation by the 26 S proteasome (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). The target proteins range from misfolded proteins to highly controlled regulators of cell cycle progression, e.g. cyclins. Parkin expression is up-regulated during unfolded protein stress and has been shown to be a protecting factor in the response against this kind of stress (5Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Google Scholar, 9Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Google Scholar, 11Ledesma M.D. Galvan C. Hellias B. Dotti C.

A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Google Scholar), indicating that parkin-mediated protein ubiquitination plays a vital role for the survival of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. Apoptosis is a cellular suicide program that is essential for correct development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Caspases comprise a family of intracellular cysteine proteases that are central initiators and executioners of apoptosis (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar). Once activated, the caspases are responsible for cleavage of selective protein substrates that are cleaved after an aspartate residue. It has been reported that in neurodegenerative diseases, the affected neurons enter a degenerative phenotype that displays features associated with apoptosis, e.g. the presence of activated caspases (13Troy C.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 145-150Google Scholar). Apoptosis is generally considered a fast process, where activation of caspases rapidly is followed by cell fragmentation and phagocytosis. However, neurons show a relative resistance toward caspase activity that may allow a low level caspase activity to persist in long term neurodegenerative processes (14Zhang Y. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8384-8389Google Scholar). We have previously shown that parkin is cleaved by hitherto unidentified caspases during apoptotic cell death (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to identify the caspases that cleave parkin. We identified caspase-1 and -8 as being efficient inducers of parkin cleavage after Asp126 in cell cultures. Furthermore, cellular assays showed that activation of endogenous caspase-8 by extrinsic apoptotic inducers leads to parkin cleavage even in caspase-3-deficient cells. Hence, parkin activity may be compromised in neuropathological states with activated caspase-1 or -8, such as sporadic Parkinson's disease. Miscellaneous—All chemicals were of analytical grade if not otherwise stated. DNA Constructs—Plasmids used for the expression of parkin variants were pcDNA3.1-parkin WT and D126A (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). For transient expression of different caspases, we used pCAGGS-caspase-1, -2, -3, -7, -11, (16Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P.

Cell Lines—HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation in six-well culture dishes with the indicated DNA constructs. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and their proteins were extracted for immunoblot analysis as indicated. In the experiments using different caspases, cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of pNLS-EGFP, 300 ng of pcDNA3.1-parkin (WT or D126A mutant) or empty vector, and 600 ng of caspase-containing plasmid or empty vector. In experiments with the caspase-inhibiting proteins, cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of pNLS-EGFP; 100 ng of pcDNA3.1-parkin (WT or its D126A mutant) or empty vector; 200 ng of caspase-containing plasmid or empty vector; and 1000 ng of pEF1A-CrmA, pEF1A-XIAP, pEF1A-hFlip, or empty vector. MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Stable transfected cell lines were selected in 100 μg/ml Zeocin and tested for expression of parkin by immunoblotting. Apoptosis was induced by incubating cells with either 200 nm okadaic acid, 2 μm staurosporine, 14 μm camptothecine, or 30 ng/ml TNF-α and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Chx) for 24 h. For transient co-transfection experiments, MCF7 cells were cotransfected with 400 ng of parkin or D126A construct, 400 ng of caspase construct, and 200 ng of pcDNA3.1 β-galactosidase construct and harvested for immunoblotting after 24 h. Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with DMRIE-C reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml on the day prior to transfection. Each transfection was performed in duplicate using 2 × 106 cells. 2.5 μg of pcDNA3-parkin (WT or D126A mutant) or empty vector were co-transfected with 5 μg of pEF1A-CrmA, pEF1A-XIAP, pEF1A-hFlip or empty vector, and 1 μg of pNLS-EGFP. Liposome-DNA complexes were allowed to form for 30 min at room temperature in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Cells, washed and resuspended in the same medium, were added to the transfection solution and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, and the medium was reconstituted to normal culture conditions by adding 2 ml of 15% fetal bovine serum growth medium. After 24 h, cells transfected with the same DNA combinations were pooled together and re-divided into two wells. The day after, apoptosis was induced in one of each of the transfection sets by treatment with 250 ng/ml CH-11 anti-Fas antibody (BioCheck, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cell death was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. Six h after the addition of anti-Fas antibody, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice with caspase lysis buffer. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice with caspase lysis buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay and 30 μg from each sample were taken for immunoblot analysis. Electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and the T160 antibody specific for parkin was prepared as described previously (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). The antibody recognizing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the antibody against caspase-8 was from BioSource Europe, S.A. (Nivelles, Belgium). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies to mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence substrate (DuPont), and blots were exposed to film (Amersham Biosciences). Coexpression of Parkin with Caspase-1, Caspase-3, or Caspase-8 Induces Parkin Cleavage—To identify caspase(s) responsible for cellular parkin cleavage, we co-transfected parkin cDNA with cDNAs encoding different caspases and a GFP construct in HEK-293T cells. To exclude the possibility that an absent induction of parkin cleavage was caused by inactive caspases, we analyzed the morphology of the GFP-transfected cells by microscopy. All cell cultures co-transfected with caspases showed a high degree of nonattached blebbing cells, whereas no cell death was seen in cells transfected with the inactive caspase-9s mutant or parkin alone (data not shown). A high degree of parkin cleavage was apparent when the protein was coexpressed with caspase-1 or caspase-8, whereas caspase-3 was less efficient (Fig. 1). In contrast, no parkin cleavage was observed when the protein was expressed alone or coexpressed with caspase-2, caspase-7, caspase-11, caspase-9, or the inactive caspase-9s mutant. We, therefore, conclude that overexpression of caspase-1, -3, or -8 induces parkin cleavage, whereas caspase-2, -7, -9, or -11 does not. The Asp126–Ser127 peptide bond represents the major cellular caspase cleavage site in parkin, although some quantitatively minor but significant caspase-mediated degradation does occur at other locations (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). To test caspase-1, -3, and -8 for their specificity for the Asp126–Ser127 peptide bond, we expressed these three caspases in HEK-293T cells either with wild type parkin or with the D126A parkin mutant. Wild type parkin was cleaved when it was coexpressed with any of the three caspases (Fig. 2A). The D126A mutation abrogated parkin cleavage when coexpressed with caspase-1 and caspase-8, whereas some cleavage still occurred with caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). Parkin Cleavage by Caspase-1 or -8 Occurs in MCF7 Cells in a Caspase-3-independent Manner—Caspase-8 can cleave and activate the effector caspase-3 (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar). To assure that the cleavage induced by caspase-1 or -8 in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2) is not because of a secondary activation of caspase-3, we coexpressed wild type and D126A mutant parkin with caspase-1, -3, and -8 in the caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cell line (24Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Google Scholar). As seen for HEK-293T cells (Fig. 2), all three tested caspases induced cleavage of parkin in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3A), and the D126A mutation significantly abrogated the cleavage induced by caspase-1 and -8 (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that the caspase-1- and -8-induced cleavage of parkin after Asp126 is not a cell-specific event and does not require activation of endogenous caspase-3. The role of caspase-1 and -8 was further corroborated by experiments where in vitro translated parkin was cleaved by purified recombinant caspase-1 and caspase-8 (data not shown), demonstrating that the cleavage of parkin induced by co-transfecting parkin with either caspase-1 or -8 can result from a direct action of the co-transfected caspases. Activation of caspase-8 can be mediated through an extrinsic pathway where extracellular ligands bind to plasma membrane receptors, e.g. the TNF-α receptors (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Google Scholar), or through an intrinsic pathway where activated caspase-3 can cleave and activate caspase-8 (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar). To test whether activation of endogenous caspase-8 can cause parkin cleavage independently of endogenous caspase-3, a MCF7 cell line stably transfected with parkin was generated. We have previously shown that stimuli that induce apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosome-mediated cell death pathway, such as okadaic acid (26Leira F. Vieites J.M. Vieytes M.R. Botana L.M. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2001; 15: 199-208Google Scholar), staurosporine (27Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar), and camptothecine (28Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Ault J.G. Khodjakov A. Schneider E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1090-1100Google Scholar), cause parkin cleavage in SHSY5Y and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with intact apoptotic machinery (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). However, okadaic acid, staurosporine, and camptothecine failed to induce cleavage of parkin in the caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cell line where caspase-8 cannot be activated by caspase-3 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, apoptosis initiated by TNF-α and Chx that leads to direct caspase-8 activation through the TNF-α receptors (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Google Scholar) caused cleavage of parkin (Fig. 3C). As a negative control, cells treated with Chx alone did not cause parkin cleavage. The caspase-8 cleavage was dependent on Asp126, as no parkin proteolysis was observed when similar apoptotic stimuli (including TNF-α and Chx) were applied to a stable transfected MCF7 cell line expressing the D126A parkin mutant (Fig. 3D). Induction of apoptosis in all of these experiments was verified by bisbenzimide staining for apoptosis-associated nuclear condensation and fragmentation (data not shown). Moreover, immunoblot analyses showed that pro-caspase-8 is processed specifically in the presence of TNF-α and Chx but not in the presence of any of the stimuli that induce apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosome-mediated cell death pathway (Fig. 3, C and D). This demonstrates that in a caspase-3-deficient cell line, parkin cleavage can be induced specifically through activation of endogenous caspase-8 and occurs after Asp126. Endogenous Caspase-8, but Not Endogenous Caspase-3, Cleaves Parkin in Anti-Fas-mediated Apoptosis in Jurkat T Cells—We used Jurkat T cells expressing the Fas receptor to test how the presence of endogenous caspase-3 and caspase-8 affects parkin cleavage in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Incubation of these cells with an agonistic anti-Fas antibody leads to activation of caspase-8 that cleaves and activates caspase-3 (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar). When Jurkat T cells were transfected with a parkinexpressing plasmid followed by incubation with anti-Fas antibody, parkin cleavage appeared (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no cleavage products were observed in anti-Fas-treated cells transfected with the D126A plasmid or an empty plasmid (Fig. 4A). Cell death monitored by trypan blue exclusion and typical apoptotic morphology was observed in all of the cell populations incubated with the anti-Fas antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoblot analyses with an antibody directed against PARP, a typical caspase-3 substrate (29Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar), showed that the protein was cleaved, and thus caspase-3 was activated in cells that were incubated with anti-Fas (Fig. 4A). CrmA, XIAP, and hFlip are selective protein inhibitors of specific caspases. XIAP inhibits the activity of caspase-3. CrmA and hFlip (but not XIAP) inhibit the activity of caspase-8, whereas hFlip does not inhibit the activation of either caspase-1 or caspase-3 (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar). To verify that caspase-8 (and not caspase-3) cleaves parkin in this system, we co-transfected parkin with either CrmA, XIAP, and hFlip and induced apoptosis with anti-Fas. Cleavage of parkin was inhibited by coexpression with hFlip and CrmA (but not with XIAP) demonstrating that in Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells endogenous caspase-8 (and not endogenous caspase-3) is responsible for parkin cleavage (Fig. 4B). We coexpressed the three caspase inhibitors with parkin and either caspase-1, -3, or -8 in HEK-293T cells to confirm their inhibition selectivity. CrmA and hFlip inhibited parkin cleavage when coexpressed with caspase-8 (Fig. 4C). XIAP inhibited the cleavage of parkin by caspase-3 but failed to prevent cleavage by caspase-8 demonstrating that the inhibitor is functional (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that in anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, it is activated endogenous caspase-8 (and not activated caspase-3) that cleaves parkin. The recessive heritability of Parkinson's disease caused by parkin gene lesions underscores the importance of parkin function for the survival of the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta and suggests that its dysfunction can contribute to the disease progression in sporadic Parkinson's disease. This is corroborated by the detection of cleaved parkin fragments in substantia nigral tissue affected by Parkinson's disease and in Lewy bodies isolated from diseased tissue (30Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Yamamura Y. Shimizu N. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 668-672Google Scholar, 31Schlossmacher M.G. Frosch M.P. Gai W.P. Medina M. Sharma N. Forno L. Ochiishi T. Shimura H. Sharon R. Hattori N. Langston J.W. Mizuno Y. Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1655-1667Google Scholar). Moreover, proteolytic inactivation of parkin may play a broader role in neurodegenerative settings as recently demonstrated by parkin's rapid catabolism upon hypoxia (32Mengesdorf T. Jensen P.H. Mies G. Aufenberg C. Paschen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15042-15047Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that inappropriate activation of apoptotic processes is involved in the pathology of degenerative diseases, including sporadic Parkinson's disease (13Troy C.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 145-150Google Scholar, 33Andersen J.K. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 640-646Google Scholar), and caspase activation could represent a link to parkin dysfunction in sporadic Parkinson's disease. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that parkin is cleaved by caspases after Asp126 (15Kahns S. Lykkebo S. Jakobsen L.D. Nielsen M.S. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15303-15308Google Scholar). Here we show that cellular parkin can be cleaved by caspase-1 and -8. Parkin is cleaved upon coexpression with caspase-1, -3, and -8, but only caspase-1 and -8 cleave parkin selectively after Asp126 (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore, purified recombinant caspase-1 and -8 cleaved in vitro translated parkin (data not shown). The caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cell line allowed us to study parkin cleavage without interference from secondary effects caused by caspase-3. In this model, parkin was cleaved upon overexpression of either caspase-1 or -8 and upon activation of endogenous caspase-8 via the TNF receptor pathway (Fig. 3). Agents that activate the intrinsic cell death pathway through the Apaf-1 apoptosome complex and activation of caspase-9 did not lead to proteolysis of parkin in the MCF7 cell line. Furthermore, the prevention of parkin cleavage by the caspase inhibitors CrmA or hFlip demonstrated that endogenous caspase-8 cleaves parkin in the presence of activated caspase-3 in Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4). This is further corroborated by overexpression of XIAP, which did not affect parkin proteolysis, thus excluding the involvement of caspase-3, -7, and -9 in parkin cleavage in anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. It is unclear how parkin is processed when caspase-3 is overexpressed in cells, as caspase-3 is not specific for the Asp126 (Figs. 2 and 3), but it could be because of secondary activation of downstream caspases. Mounting evidence associates activation of caspase-8, which relays death signals from the death domain receptors for TNF-α and Fas ligand and the proinflammatory caspase-1, with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (13Troy C.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 145-150Google Scholar, 33Andersen J.K. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 640-646Google Scholar, 34Nagatsu T. J. Neural Transm. 2002; 109: 731-745Google Scholar). Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and TNF-α are present in the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson's disease (34Nagatsu T. J. Neural Transm. 2002; 109: 731-745Google Scholar, 35Mogi M. Harada M. Riederer P. Narabayashi H. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 165: 208-210Google Scholar, 36Boka G. Anglade P. Wallach D. Javoy-Agid F. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 172: 151-154Google Scholar). This demonstrates, first, an increase in the activation of the pro-interleukin-1β converting enzyme (caspase-1) and, second, an increased potential for stimulating the caspase-8 activating TNF-α receptors on the dopaminergic neurons. This is corroborated by the increased activity of caspase-1 in substantia nigra from patients with Parkinson's disease as compared with substantia nigra from control patients (37Mogi M. Togari A. Kondo T. Mizuno Y. Komure O. Kuno S. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. J. Neural Transm. 2000; 107: 335-341Google Scholar) and by the demonstration of increased levels of activated caspase-8 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease compared with control patients (38Hartmann A. Troadec J.D. Hunot S. Kikly K. Faucheux B.A. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2247-2255Google Scholar, 39Viswanath V. Wu Y. Boonplueang R. Chen S. Stevenson F.F. Yantiri F. Yang L. Beal M.F. Andersen J.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9519-9528Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is also activated in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (38Hartmann A. Troadec J.D. Hunot S. Kikly K. Faucheux B.A. Mouatt-Prigent A. Ruberg M. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2247-2255Google Scholar, 39Viswanath V. Wu Y. Boonplueang R. Chen S. Stevenson F.F. Yantiri F. Yang L. Beal M.F. Andersen J.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9519-9528Google Scholar). Caspase-1 and -8 are activated as initial events in the process of apoptotic cell death (12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Google Scholar, 40Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Google Scholar, 41Chen M. Ona V.O. Li M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 797-801Google Scholar). Because parkin is a direct substrate of caspase-1 and -8, parkin cleavage might be important for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Caspase-1 and caspase-8 have also been reported to regulate cellular processes other than apoptosis and are activated without causing apoptotic cell death in macrophages and T cells, respectively (42Dinarello C.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Google Scholar, 43Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1896Google Scholar). If similar activation of these caspases occurs in dopaminergic neurons, it may cause parkin cleavage and affect the viability of these cells. We, therefore, hypothesize that caspase-1- and caspase-8-dependent parkin cleavage in sporadic Parkinson's disease may play an important role in the degenerative process by initiating a vicious circle that leads to the accumulation of toxic parkin substrates, e.g. α-synuclein (44Petrucelli L. O'Farrell C. Lockhart P.J. Baptista M. Kehoe K. Vink L. Choi P. Wolozin B. Farrer M. Hardy J. Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Google Scholar). The failure to remove these substrates may lead directly to cell death or lower the cellular threshold to further stressful insults. The process may be long lasting, as neurons are relatively resistant to caspase activity (14Zhang Y. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8384-8389Google Scholar) and thus may remain functionally crippled but viable. Therefore, inhibition of parkin cleavage could represent a potential target for neuroprotective strategies against Parkinson's disease aiming to delay the functional decline of dopaminergic neurons. Such an approach may have a wider applicability when considering that active forms of caspase-1 or -8 were also detected in diseases like Huntington's disease (45Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Google Scholar), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (46Pasinelli P. Borchelt D.R. Houseweart M.K. Cleveland D.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15763-15768Google Scholar), and ischemia (47Northington F.J. Ferriero D.M. Martin L.J. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 23: 186-191Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2057969974,"The Nogo gene encodes an integral membrane protein mainly responsible for the neurite inhibition properties of myelin. Here, we analyzed the expression pattern of Nogo-A, Nogo-B, and Nogo-C and Nogo-66 receptor (Ng66R) mRNA during hippocampal development and lesion-induced axonal sprouting. Nogo-A and Nogo-B and Ng66R transcripts preceded the progress of myelination and were highly expressed at postnatal day zero (P0) in all principal hippocampal cell layers, with the exception of dentate granule cells. Only a slight Nogo-C expression was found at P0 in the principal cell layers of the hippocampus. During adulthood, all Nogo splice variants and their receptor were expressed in the neuronal cell layers of the hippocampus, in contrast to the myelin basic protein mRNA expression pattern, which revealed a neuronal source of Nogo gene expression in addition to oligodendrocytes. After hippocampal denervation, the Nogo genes showed an isoform-specific temporal regulation. All Nogo genes were strongly regulated in the hippocampal cell layers, whereas the Ng66R transcripts showed a significant increase in the contralateral cortex. These data could be confirmed on protein levels. Furthermore, Nogo-A expression was up-regulated after kainate-induced seizures. Our data show that neurons express Nogo genes with a clearly distinguishable pattern during development. This expression is further dynamically and isoform-specifically altered after lesioning during the early phase of structural rearrengements. Thus, our results indicate a role for Nogo-A, -B, and -C during development and during the stabilization phase of hippocampal reorganization. Taken together with these data, the finding that neurons in a highly plastic brain region express Nogo genes supports the hypothesis that Nogo may function beyond its known neuronal growth inhibition activity in shaping neuronal circuits."

Pitx2–/– mice present with severe cardiac malformations and embryonic lethality, demonstrating a role for PITX2 in heart development.

Research on the factors that control heart formation has revealed the complex nature of gene expression during cardiogenesis. The development of the heart, like other organs, is regulated by interactions between signaling molecules and transcription factors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Harvey R.P. Dev.

Much of this information has come from chick and mouse studies, although insight has also come from mapping of genes in human disorders. The human PITX2 gene is a member of the bicoid/paired-like homeobox transcription factor family (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward L.M. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J.

Genes Evol. 1999; 209: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PITX2 contains a lysine at position 50 in the third helix of the homeodomain and binds the DNA sequence 5′-TAATCC-3′ (6Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20066-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PITX2 mutations are causative for Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, which was defined as a genetic disorder in 1935 (7Rieger H. Albrecht von Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1935; 133: 602-635Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is an autosomal dominant human disorder characterized by dental hypoplasia, mild craniofacial dysmorphism, ocular anterior chamber anomalies causing glaucoma, and umbilical stump abnormalities (4Semina E.V. Reiter R. Leysens N.J. Alward L.M. Small K.W. Datson N.A. Siegel-Bartelt J. Bierke-Nelson D. Bitoun P. Zabel B.U. Carey J.C. Murray J.C. Nat.

Abnormal cardiac development associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome can affect outflow tract structures. Specific cardiac defects include cardiac hypertrophy, inter-atrial defect, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonic artery hypoplasia, atrial septal defects, and bicuspid aortic valve (9Mammi I. DeGiorgio P. Clementi M. Tenconi R. Acta Ophthalmol. Scand. 1998; 76: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Cunningham E.T. Eliott D. Miller N.R. Maumenee I.H. Green W.R. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1998; 116: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression studies have shown that Pitx2 is essential for heart development. In the developing chick, asymmetric expression of Pitx2 was first detected in stage 7 embryos on the left-sided lateral mesoderm (11St. Amand T.R. Ra J. Zhang Y. Hu Y. Baber S.I. Qiu M. Chen Y.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 247: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The asymmetric expression of Pitx2 remains in the left-sided lateral mesoderm, including left-sided heart tube as the two primitive heart tubes fuse. Thus, Pitx2 exhibits a left-right asymmetrical expression prior to the appearance of morphological asymmetry (11St. Amand T.R. Ra J. Zhang Y. Hu Y. Baber S.I. Qiu M. Chen Y.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 247: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In early mouse embryos, Pitx2 expression was detected bilaterally in the head fold mesenchyme at 7.5 days postcoitum. Asymmetric expression of Pitx2 was first observed in the left lateral plate mesoderm at 8.0 days postcoitum, extending laterally along the anteroposterior axis, somewhat resembling that of lefty-2 and nodal (12Yoshioka H. Meno C. Koshiba K. Sugihara M. Itoh H. Ishimaru Y. Inoue T. Ohuchi H. Semina E.V. Murray J.C. Hamada H. Noji S.

At 9.5 days postcoitum in addition to the lateral plate mesoderm, asymmetrical expression of Pitx2 can be seen in the left truncus arteriosus, left dorsal part of the common atrium, left common cardinal vein, left side of foregut primodia, and lung buds (12Yoshioka H. Meno C. Koshiba K. Sugihara M. Itoh H. Ishimaru Y. Inoue T. Ohuchi H. Semina E.V. Murray J.C. Hamada H. Noji S.

More importantly to this report, it has recently been shown that differential expression of Pitx2 isoforms is a key mechanism for heart development (13Essner J.J. Branford W.W. Zhang J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schweickert A. Campione M. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Yu X.

Development. 2001; 128: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar). Epigenetic and genetic studies reveal that tissue and organ development are differentially regulated by Pitx2a and Pitx2c isoforms. Eloquent experiments in mice that were defective for Pitx2a and Pitx2b expression demonstrate that different organs have distinct requirements for Pitx2c dosage (16Liu C. Liu W. Lu M. Brown N.A. Martin J.F. Development. 2001; 128: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar). Pitx2 appears to be a key gene for determination of leftness in heart formation, consistent with the fact that cardiac defects are among the associated defects of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. Several laboratories have determined that signaling molecules play a role in Pitx2 gene expression (11St. Amand T.R. Ra J. Zhang Y. Hu Y. Baber S.I. Qiu M. Chen Y.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although the mechanism of these interactions is unknown, several laboratories are currently working on the regulation of Pitx2 expression. However, the downstream targets of PITX2 in heart development are not known, except for our characterization of the procollagen lysyl hydroxylase 1 (PLOD1) gene as a target of PITX2 (18Hjalt T.A. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PLOD genes encode enzymes that hydroxylate lysines in collagens; the hydroxylysine residues act as attachment sites for carbohydrate units and provide stability to intermolecular cross-links. Point mutations and rearrangements in the human PLOD1 gene are causative for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliosis type, type VI, characterized by ocular, muscular, skin, and aortic defects (19Hyland J.

We have now identified the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) 1The abbreviations used are: ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; E, embryonic day; Bic, bicoid; Tk, thymidine kinase; TBE, Tris borate EDTA. promoter as a target of PITX2. The ANF gene is expressed early in embryonic development at the stage when cells are committed to the cardiac phenotype. ANF expression during embryogenesis characterizes both atrial and ventricular cells. Consistent with these observations it has been shown that the ANF gene is regulated by cardiac muscle-specific transcription factors (22Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E.

Moorman A.F.M. Clout D.E.W. van Roon M.A. Lingbeek M. van Lohuizen M. Campione M. Christoffels V.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 25Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V.

A general theme in developmental biology is the use of a combinatorial code of transcription factors to control gene expression. In the heart, Pitx2 is co-expressed with several transcription factors, including Nkx2.5 (23Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M.

Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nkx2.5 is a particularly strong candidate to interact with PITX2 because it has been shown to interact with other proteins expressed in the heart (22Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J.

Sequence analysis of the ANF promoter revealed several PITX2 binding elements. The ANF promoter has been shown to contain NKE elements (CAAGTG) or Nkx2.5 binding sites (23Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 31Durocher D. Chen C. Ardati A. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. Mol. Cell.

Sequence analysis of the PLOD1 promoter has identified several NKE elements, and we demonstrate that Nkx2.5 regulates PLOD1 expression. Our studies reveal that PITX2 isoforms differentially activate the ANF promoter. PITX2C and Nkx2.5 synergistically activate the ANF and PLOD1 promoters, whereas Nkx2.5 negatively regulates PITX2A activation of these promoters in a cell-dependent manner. We provide a molecular mechanism for the regulation of heart development through the activation of the PLOD1 and ANF promoters by PITX2 isoforms and Nkx2.5. Expression and Purification of GST-PITX2 Fusion Proteins—The PITX2 isoforms were PCR-amplified from a cDNA clone as described (6Amendt B.A. Sutherland L.B. Semina E. Russo A.F. J. Biol.

Proteins were cleaved from the GST moiety using 80 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) per ml of glutathione-Sepharose. The cleaved proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides containing the PLOD1 promoter sequence (–1120 to –1092) with flanking partial BamHI ends were annealed and filled with Klenow polymerase to generate 32P-labeled probes for EMSAs, as described (33Green P.D.

Western Blot Assays—Purified bacteria-expressed PITX2 isoform proteins and PITX2 isoform-transfected cell lysates were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Approximately, 200 ng of purified PITX2 proteins and 20 μg of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots.

Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11635-11642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The TK-Bic/NKE promoter contains three NKE oligonucleotides and one bicoid oligonucleotide. The ANF-638 promoter has been previously described (22Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J.

Mutation of the PITX2 binding site (bicoid site) in the ANF promoter was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The 5′-GAATCC-3′ bicoid site was changed to 5′-GAACTT-3′ using the following sense primer (5′-GGGAGAAGGAACTTTGAGGCGAGCGC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GCGCTCGCCTCAAAG TTCCTTCTCCC-3′). The mutations are underlined, and the new promoter was named ANF-638 ΔBic. Construction of the PLOD1 promoter plasmids has been previously described (18Hjalt T.A. Amendt B.A. Murray J.C. J.

The TK-PLOD1 promoter was constructed by ligation of the PLOD1 oligonucleotide containing a bicoid and NKE element (same as used for EMSA) into the BamH1 site upstream of the TK promoter in the TK-luc plasmid. This new promoter (TK-PLOD1) contains two PLOD1 oligonucleotide sequences. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A CMV β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (Clontech) was co-transfected in all experiments as a control for transfection efficiency. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, Luciferase, and β-Galactosidase Assays—CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 60-mm dishes and transfected by electroporation. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 60-mm dishes and transfected by electroporation. CHO and C3H10T1/2 cells were mixed with 2.5 μg of expression plasmids, 5 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of CMV or SV-40 β-galactosidase plasmid plated in 60-mm culture dishes and fed with 5% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Electroporation of CHO cells was at 360 V and 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad) and C3H10T1/2 cells at 380 V and 950 microfarads; cells were fed 24 h prior to transfection. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h, lysed, and assayed for reporter activities and protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase was measured using reagents from Promega. β-Galactosidase was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents (Tropix Inc.). All luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Expression of transiently expressed PITX2 proteins in CHO cells has been previously demonstrated (32Cox C.J. Espinoza H.M.

RT-PCR Assays—C3H10T1/2 and CHO cells were harvested, and the polyadenylated mRNA was extracted from tissue culture cells using the PolyATract System 1000 (Promega, Madison, WI). RT-PCR was performed using the TAKARA RNA PCR kit (Panvera/Takara, Madison, WI) utilizing avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo dTs as the primers. Samples of RNA were added to the system per protocol parameters. The RT and PCR cycles were performed on an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient thermocycler. PCR of the cDNA product was performed using primers specific to Pitx2 isoforms. The antisense primer used in these studies was (5′-GATTTCTTCGCGTGTGGAC-3′) and was complementary to the homeodomain of Pitx2. The sense primer for Pitx2a was (5′-GGAGAGGAGCAGAAAGAAAC-3′) located in the 5′-untranslated region, the sense primer for Pitx2b was (5′-GCAGCCGTTGAATGTCTCT-3′), and the sense primer for Pitx2c was (5′-GACTCCTCCAAACATAGACT-3′). All of these sense primers are specific to the unique N terminus of each isoform. PCR products were evaluated on a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE for appropriate size. CHO cells provided a negative control. Sequencing reactions were performed on samples, and sequences were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All RT-PCR products were sequenced to confirm their identity. PITX2C and Nkx2.5 Synergistically Regulate the ANF Promoter in CHO Cells—Sequence analysis revealed one PITX2 binding site (bicoid sequence) and two NKE sites in the ANF-638 promoter construct (Fig. 1A). This promoter has been shown to be regulated by Nkx2.5 and GATA4 (22Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Because atrial cells express ANF and Pitx2–/– mice and Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome patients harbor atrial defects, we asked whether PITX2 isoforms could specifically activate the ANF-638 promoter. Surprisingly, the PITX2A isoform activates the ANF promoter at higher levels (22-fold) than either PITX2B (10-fold) or PITX2C (8-fold) (Fig. 1B). Because PITX2C is the major PITX2 isoform expressed in the heart, this was unexpected and PITX2B although not expressed in the heart was shown to activate the ANF-638 promoter in CHO cells. Similar to previous studies using a proximal ANF promoter in HeLa cells (23Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we observe low activation of the ANF-638 promoter by Nkx2.5 at 3-fold (Fig. 1B). Co-transfection of Nkx2.5 with PITX2A and PITX2B did not result in synergistic activation. However, expression of Nkx2.5 and PITX2C resulted in a 45-fold synergistic activation of the ANF-638 promoter in CHO cells (Fig. 1B). The PITX2 isoforms differ only in their N termini, and it appears from these data that the N terminus of PITX2C may facilitate the synergistic effect in combination with Nkx2.5. All PITX2 isoforms have been previously shown to be stable and equally expressed in CHO cells (32Cox C.J. Espinoza H.M. McWilliams B. Chappell K. Morton L. Hjalt T.A. Semina E.V. Amendt B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25001-25010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The PITX2 Binding Site in the ANF-638 Promoter Is Required for Activation and Synergism with Nkx2.5—The PITX2 binding sequence 5′-GAATCC-3′ was changed to 5′-GAACTT-3′ to determine whether it was functional and required for PITX2 activation (Fig. 2A). As expected, all three major PITX2 isoforms were unable to activate the ANF-638 ΔBic promoter in transfected CHO cells (Fig. 2B, data not shown for PITX2B). Although Nkx2.5 activation of this promoter was unaffected, co-expression with PITX2C did not result in synergism (Fig. 2B). Nkx2.5 Regulates the PLOD1 Promoter in CHO Cells— PLOD1 expression has been implicated in heart development, and we have previously shown that PITX2 regulates PLOD1 expression (9Mammi I. DeGiorgio P.

Ophthalmol. 1994; 118: 255-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the PLOD1 261 full-length promoter revealed seven NKE elements. Because it is expressed in the heart we asked whether Nkx2.5 regulated PLOD1 expression (Fig. 3A). Transfection of CHO cells with the PLOD1 261 promoter and Nkx2.5 resulted in a modest 3-fold activation (Fig. 3B). We observed only additive transcriptional activation of the PLOD1 261 promoter upon co-transfection of PITX2A and PITX2B isoforms with Nkx2.5 (Fig. 3B). However, as observed with the ANF promoter, PITX2C and Nkx2.5 synergistically activated the PLOD1 full-length promoter (compare 33- to 12-fold for PITX2C alone; Fig. 3B). As controls we show that the minimal PLOD1 2561 promoter is not activated by each PITX2 isoform and Nkx2.5 and only slightly activated by co-transfection experiments (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the minimal PLOD1 2561 promoter contains two NKE elements but is not activated by Nkx2.5. Because the full-length PLOD1 promoter demonstrates only a 3-fold activation, it appears that the location of the two NKE sites in the proximal promoter are not sufficient for activation by Nkx2.5. Sequence analysis of the PLOD1 2561 promoter reveals few other factor binding sites. Thus, the lack of other factors binding in this region may affect Nkx2.5 activation of the proximal promoter. PITX2 Isoforms and Nkx2.5 Form a Ternary Complex with the PLOD1 Bicoid NKE—EMSA experiments were used to determine whether a physical interaction occurred between PITX2C and Nkx2.5 dependent upon one or the other binding to DNA. We first tested whether bound PITX2 isoforms could interact with Nkx2.5. Addition of 80 ng of PITX2 isoforms with 80 and 160 ng of Nkx2.5 to the labeled bicoid probe did not reveal a slower migrating band indicative of a PITX2/Nkx2.5 protein complex on the gel (data not shown). Thus, bound PITX2 is not capable of interacting with Nkx2.5. We next asked whether PITX2 could interact with Nkx2.5 when it was bound to DNA. Addition of 80 ng of Nkx2.5 and 40, 80, and 160 ng of PITX2 isoforms to the labeled NKE probe did not produce a slower migrating band (data not shown). Thus, bound Nkx2.5 was unable to interact with PITX2 isoforms. We have performed GST-Nkx2.5 and GST-PITX2C pull-down experiments using pure PITX2 and Nkx2.5 proteins and were unable to demonstrate a specific physical interaction between Nkx2.5 and PITX2C (data not shown). These data and transfection results with the ANF-638 ΔBic promoter suggest that the PITX2C and Nkx2.5 synergistic effect on the ANF and PLOD1 promoters was because of the independent binding of each factor to its preferred DNA element. Using a DNA probe derived from the PLOD1 promoter with a bicoid site (TAATCC) on one strand and, 3 base pairs flanking this element, a NKE site (AAAGTG) on the opposite strand we demonstrate independent binding by PITX2 and Nkx2.5 (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, these proteins can bind independent of each other and in close proximity to form a ternary complex. Most of the bicoid and NKE"

We tested the hypothesis whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) gene transfer is an appropriate way to enhance bone formation and recruitment of osteoblasts in vivo. Adenovirus vectors containing VEGF-A or lacZ cDNAs (1.4x10(10) pfu) were injected locally into right distal femurs of New Zealand White rabbits. Saline was injected into all contralateral distal femurs. One and three weeks after the gene transfers femurs were collected for analyses. X-Gal staining showed that up to 20% of the bone marrow cells were transfected although gene transfer also resulted in biodistribution of the vector and expression of the transgene in liver and spleen. Trabecular bone hard tissue histomorphometry of the distal femurs was performed to analyze the effect of gene transfer on bone turnover. When compared with unilateral lacZ transfected trabecular bone at one-week and three-week time points, VEGF-A gene transfer significantly increased bone formation parameters, such as osteoblast number, osteoid volume, and bone volume. Also, bone resorption surface was greatly reduced. It is concluded that injection of adenovirus vector can transfect bone marrow cells in vivo with a relatively high efficiency. Our results suggest that adenovirus-mediated VEGF-A gene transfer induces bone formation via increasing osteoblast activity and may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis and other diseases that require efficient osteogenic therapy."

Scorpion neurotoxins targeting voltage-gated sodium channels are single chain polypeptides composed of 60–70 amino acids cross-linked by four disulfide bridges. They have been divided into two major classes, α- and β-toxins. Scorpion α-toxins, the most extensively studied group, can prolong the action potential by slowing the inactivation of Na+ currents with no direct effect on activation (1Couraud F. Jover E. Dobois J.M. Rochat H. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 9-16Google Scholar, 2Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Google Scholar, 3Goudet C. Chi C. Tytgat J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Google Scholar). According to their different pharmacological properties, the α-toxins can be further divided into three subgroups, classical α-, α-like, and insect α-toxins (4Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.F.

The more recently characterized α-like toxins (e.g. Lqh III and BmK M1) act on both mammals and insects, but are unique in their inability to bind to rat synaptosomes despite a high toxicity by intravenous injection.

BmK M1 is a toxin from the venom of the scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch, which resides in eastern Asia, and is composed of 64 amino acids cross-linked by four disulfide bridges (3Goudet C. Chi C.

J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 125-135Google Scholar); the pharmacological properties of Na+ channels have recently been investigated (13Goudet C. Huys I. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Wang D.-C Waelkens E.

Alignment of the amino acid sequences of several α-toxins shows that seven aromatic residues, including Tyr5, Tyr14, Tyr21, Tyr35, Tyr42, Trp38/Tyr38, and Trp47/Tyr47, are notably conserved (Fig. 1A) (5Gordon D.

Zhao T. Jin L. Wang M. Zhang Y. Wang D.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 341-344Google Scholar, 17Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Rochat H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7443-7447Google Scholar). Tyr5, Tyr35, and Trp47 are located on the so-called Face A surface of the toxin (CHS). Tyr14 and Tyr21 are situated on the surface opposite to Face A, called Face B. Trp38 and Tyr42 are located in the β2-sheet and in the loop between the β2- and β3-sheets, respectively (Fig. 1B). Seven of the 15 residues conserved in scorpion toxins (5Gordon D. Savarin P. Gurevitz M. Zinn-Justin S. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1998; 17: 131-159Google Scholar) are aromatic residues and have been studied in this work. Based on an efficient yeast expression system (15Shao F. Xiong Y.-M. Zhu R.-H. Ling M.H. Chi C.W. Wang D.-C. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 358-365Google Scholar), the importance of the above-mentioned aromatic residues in the scorpion toxin BmK M1 was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. The results from mutagenesis and expression, characterization, bioassays, and electrophysiological analysis of the mutants are reported here. Based on these findings, the important role of these conserved aromatic residues is discussed. Strains, Materials, and Animals—Plasmid pVT102U/α, Escherichia coli strain TG1, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S-78 (Leu2, Ura3, Rep4) were used. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim Germany). Primers were synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China). Taq DNA polymerase and Klenow fragment were obtained from MBI. CM32-cellulose cation-exchange and Sephasil® peptide C18 reversed-phase (12-μm ST4.6/250) columns were from Whatman and Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden), respectively. All other chemicals were at least analytical grade and were purchased from Merck or Sigma. The mice used for the bioassay were ICR mice from the Beijing Center for Experimental Animals. Site-directed Mutagenesis of BmK M1—The cDNA of BmK M1 was previously cloned (14Xiong Y.-M. Ling M.H. Wang D.-C. Chi C.W. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1025-1031Google Scholar) and inserted into pVT102U/α (15Shao F. Xiong Y.-M. Zhu R.-H. Ling M.H. Chi C.W. Wang D.-C. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 358-365Google Scholar). According to the sequence of pVT102U/α-BmK M1, two primers were designed: primer 1 (5′-CGTCTAGATAAAAGAAATTCTGTTCGG-3′, including a KEX2 protease linker and an XbaI restriction site) and primer 2 (5′-CGAAGCTTTTAATGGCATTTTCCTGGTAC-3′, with a HindIII site). The substitute residue for all aromatic residues was glycine. In addition, the more conservative substitutions of phenylalanine for Tyr5, Tyr14, Tyr35, and Trp47 were carried out. The mutagenic primers used to generate the desired mutations were as follows: Y5G, 5′-CGTCTAGATAAAAGAAATTCTGTTCGGGATGCTGGTATTGCCAAGCCCCATAACTGT; Y5F, 5′-CGTCTAGATAAAAGAAATTCTGTTCGGGATGCTTTCATTGCCAAGCCCCATAACTGT; Y14G, 5′-AACTGTGTAGGTGAATGTGCT (positive strand) and 5′-AGCACATTCACCTACACAGTT (negative strand); Y14F, 5′-AACTGTGTATTCGAATGTGCT (positive strand) and 5′-AGCACATTCGAATACACAGTT (negative strand); Y21G, 5′-AGAAATGAAGGTTGCAACGATTTATGT (positive strand) and 5′-ACATAAATCGTTGCAACCTTCATTTCT (negative strand); Y35G, 5′-AAGAGTGGCGGTTGCCAATGG (positive strand) and 5′-CCATTGGCAACCGCCACTCTT (negative strand); Y35F, 5′-AAGAGTGGCTTCTGCCAATGG (positive strand) and 5′-CCATTGGCAGAAGCCACTCTT (negative strand); W38G, 5′-TATTGCCAAGGTGTAGGTAAA (positive strand) and 5′-TTTACCTACACCTTGGCAATA (negative strand); Y42G, 5′-GTAGGTAAAGGTGGAAATGGC (positive strand) and 5′-GCCATTTCCACCTTTACCTAC (negative strand); W47G, 5′-AATGGCTGCGGTTGCATAGAG (positive strand) and 5′-CTCTATGCAACCGCAGCCATT (negative strand); and W47F, 5′-AATGGCTGCTTCTGCATAGAG (positive strand) and 5′-CTCTATGCAGAAGCAGCCATT (negative strand). Using pVT102U/α-BmK M1 (recombinant BmK (rBmK) M1) as template along with primer 2 and the mutagenic primer, mutants Y5G and Y5F were created by one-step PCR. Other mutants (Y14G, Y14F, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, W38G, Y42G, W47G, and W47F) were obtained by three-step PCR. A pair of mutagenic primers was applied in the first or second PCR with primer 1 or 2, respectively, to create two intermediate products, which shared an identical sequence. After treatment with Klenow fragment, two intermediate products acted as primers for each other, and extension of this overlap by DNA polymerase created the full-length mutant, which had the mutation at the desired position. All PCR products were purified by gel excision. Expression and Purification of Mutants—After digestion with XbaI and HindIII, the mutated cDNA gene was inserted into plasmid pVT102U/α and transformed into E. coli TG1 competent cells. The recombinant plasmid pVT102U/α-mutant was extracted, sequenced, and transformed into S. cerevisiae S-78 using the LiCl method (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). The expression of the mutants was carried out using a described previously procedure (15Shao F. Xiong Y.-M. Zhu R.-H. Ling M.H. Chi C.W. Wang D.-C. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 358-365Google Scholar). After fermentation, the supernatant of the culture was adjusted to pH 4.2 with acetic acid. The sample was directly applied to a CM32-cellulose cation-exchange column (2.8 × 14 cm), which was equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Upon reaching a steady base line, the column was washed by stepwise elution with 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 n NaCl equilibration buffer. The 0.5 n NaCl fraction was directly applied to a Sephasil® peptide C18 reversed-phase column. Buffer A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The C18 column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% buffer B for 15 column volumes. Reversed-phase chromatography was carried out using an ÄKTA purifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences AB). Molecular Mass Determination—The molecular masses of the purified mutants were obtained using a Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The spray voltage was 4.50 kV. Calculations were performed using the program provided by the manufacturer. Bioassay—Using 0.9% NaCl as a negative control and rBmK M1 as a positive control, the toxicity of the mutants was determined in mice (male, specified pathogen free level, 18–20 g of body weight). Each group consisted of 10 mice. Various doses of toxin mutants were dissolved in 0.9% NaCl and injected into the mice through the tail vein. Survival times (times between injection and death), reaction, and doses were recorded. Evaluation of toxicity was based on the determination of LD50 (the dose capable of statistically killing 50% of the mice) according to the method of Meier and Theakston (19Meier J. Theakston R.D.G. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 395-401Google Scholar). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes, Electrophysiological Recordings, and Analysis—The human Nav1.5 gene was subcloned into pSP64T (20Gellens M.E. George Jr., A.L. Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, pSP64T/Nav1.5 was first linearized by XbaI. Using the large-scale SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE transcription kit (Ambion Inc.), capped cRNAs were synthesized from the linearized plasmids. The in vitro synthesis of cRNA encoding histone H1 and the isolation of Xenopus oocytes were done as described previously (21Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of Nav1.5 cRNA solution at a concentration of 1 ng/nl using a Drummond microinjector. Whole cell currents from oocytes were recorded using the two-micro-electrode voltage clamp technique between 1 and 3 days after injection. Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. Resistances of both electrodes were kept as low as possible (∼0.1–0.2 megaohms). Experiments were performed using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) controlled by a pClamp data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz using a four-pole low-pass Bessel filter. Digital leak subtraction of the current records was carried out using a P/2 protocol. The bath solution composition was 96 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter KCl, 1.8 mmol/liter CaCl2, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 5 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4). This solution was supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin sulfate for incubation of the oocytes. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Samples used for analyses were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were run at 25 °C from 250 to 200 nm using a quartz cell 0.5 mm in length. Data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals with a scan rate of 50 nm/min. All CD spectra resulted from averaging four scans. The final spectrum was corrected by subtracting the corresponding base-line spectrum obtained under identical conditions. Spectra were smoothed by the instrument's software. The secondary structure content was estimated by standard Jasco CD analysis. Mutation, Expression, and Purification—Single point mutants Y14G, Y14F, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, W38G, Y42G, W47G, and W47F were created by three-step PCR. Mutants Y5G and Y5F were produced by one-step PCR. The target gene was expressed using the pVT102U/α vector. Tricine/SDS-PAGE analyses of yeast cultures demonstrated that mutants Y5G, Y5F, Y14G, Y14F, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, W38G, Y42G, and W47F were expressed and secreted into the medium. Mutant Y5G could not be used in the following characterization because its expression level was in a trace amount. Mutant W47G could not be expressed at all. The expression levels of the five glycine mutants Y14G, Y21G, Y35G, W38G, and Y42G were ∼1–2 mg/liter of culture medium. For three of the mutants with the conservative phenylalanine substitution (Y5F, Y14F, and Y35F), the expression levels were ∼3 mg/liter, comparable to that of unmodified rBmK M1 (∼3 mg/liter). Remarkably, the amount of W47F in the culture medium was 9–10 mg/liter, which is about three times the value of rBmK M1 (Table I). Apparently, the conservative phenylalanine mutations of Tyr5 and Trp47 changed the expression levels of mutants Y5G and W47G from a trace or nothing at all to the normal level or to even a high level.Table IOverview of the results for the 11 BmK M1 mutantsToxinExpressionToxicity (LD50)Relative toxicityEC50mg/litermg/kg%μMWild-type rBmK M1∼30.531000.50Y5GTraceW47GNoneY21G1-21.01521.0Y35G1-216.0435.0W38G1-2>25<2>100Y42G1-2>25<2>100Y14G1-2>25<2>100Y14F≈30.75713.4Y35F≈30.97550.7W47F9-102.34233.1Y5F≈313.444>100 Open table in a new tab Expressed mutants were purified by a simple and efficient protocol. One liter of culture (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter bacteriological peptone, 20 g/liter glucose, pH after sterilization of 6.5) was harvested and initially purified by chromatography on a CM32 cation-exchange column. The next step of purification was carried out on a C18 column. The elution peaks corresponding to target mutants were pooled and lyophilized. The Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the mass spectra showed a high purity of the final products. As an example, the entire purification process of Y42G is shown at the following stages: Tricine/SDS-PAGE before and after purification (Fig. 2A), reversed-phase chromatography (Fig. 2B), mass spectrometry (Fig. 2C). Molecular Mass—The molecular masses of the purified variants were measured with the Finnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. The individual peaks showed that the molecular masses of mutants Y5F, Y14G, Y14F, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, W38G, Y42G, and W47F were 7403, 7312, 7403, 7315, 7312, 7403, 7289, 7312, and 7380 Da, respectively (Y42G is shown as an example in Fig. 2C). This corresponded well with the estimated molecular masses of the mutants: 7404, 7313, 7404, 7313, 7313, 7404, 7290, 7313, and 7380 Da, respectively. Conformational Analysis—The CD spectra of rBmK M1 and its mutants in the UV range of 250–200 nm are shown in Fig. 3. Compared with native BmK M1, the CD spectra of Y14G and Y35G dramatically changed (Fig. 3A), indicating that there are apparent changes in the secondary structures of these two mutants. The secondary structure estimation (J-700 for Windows Secondary Structure Estimation, Version 1.10.00) indicates that mutation Y14G interrupts both the α-helix and β-sheet, whereas mutation Y35G interrupts only the β-sheet. In both cases, the estimated random coils show a significant increase. For Y21G, W38G, and Y42G, the CD spectra show that the secondary structures have almost not changed compared with the native toxin (Fig. 3A). It seems that the loss of the aromatic side chains in these mutants does not alter the general structure of the toxin. Regarding mutants with the conservative phenylalanine substitution, the CD spectra show small alterations for Y5F, Y14F, and Y35F, but large changes for W47F compared with wild-type BmK M1 (Fig. 3B). Bioassay—The mice showed typical symptoms of envenomation after injection with rBmK M1. The LD50 determined by the method of Meier and Theakston (19Meier J. Theakston R.D.G. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 395-401Google Scholar) was ∼0.53 mg/kg, which is consistent with that of native BmK M1 (16Li H.M. Zhao T. Jin L. Wang M. Zhang Y. Wang D.-C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 341-344Google Scholar). Excluding W47G and Y5G, which were not expressed and expressed only in trace amounts, respectively, the other nine mutants (Y5F, Y14G, Y14F, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, W38G, Y42G, and W47F) were used for bioassays. Each purified mutant was injected into the mice through the tail vein at different doses to determine the LD50 value (Fig. 4 and Table I). Mutants Y14G, W38G, and Y42G showed no detectable toxicity even at a dose of 25 mg/kg, which is 47 times the LD50 of rBmK M1 (Table I). Mutant Y35G lost most of its toxicity (LD50 = 16.04 mg/kg, which is 30 times the LD50 of rBmK M1). In contrast, the LD50 of Y21G was only twice that of rBmK M1 (Fig. 4 and Table I). For the phenylalanine mutants, the toxicities of Y14F (71%) and Y35F (55%) were in the same order as that of unmodified rBmK M1. The toxicity of W47F displayed a certain decrease (23%). The toxicity of Y5F was dramatically reduced to 4% in comparison with unmodified rBmK M1 (Fig. 4 and Table I). Effect of rBmK M1 and Its Aromatic Amino Acid Mutants on Voltage-gated Na+Channels—Fig. 5 displays the effects of rBmK M1 and mutants Y14G, Y35G, W38G, Y42G, Y21G, Y14F, Y35F, Y5F, and W47F on Nav1.5 Na+ channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The currents displayed were evoked by a depolarization step to –20 mV from a holding potential of –90 mV. The current traces recorded after the addition of the toxin reveal that rBmK M1 induced a slowing of the inactivation process of Na+ currents. This effect appeared a few seconds after the addition of the toxin and continued until reaching a steady state after 4–5 min. Under control conditions, the inactivation kinetics of Nav1.5 currents were rapid, and almost no remaining currents were visible at the end of the traces, after 25 ms. The toxin-induced slowing of inactivation was evaluated by a single exponential fit (pClamp Version 8) of the current decay after the peak. The time window for each fit was manually set from the peak current to the end of the trace (25 ms). Under steady-state conditions, the time constant of inactivation (τ) calculated by a single exponential fit increased from 1.4 ± 0.2 ms (n = 33) under control conditions to 4.4 ± 1.2 ms (n = 6) after the addition of 1 μm rBmK M1 and to 5.8 ± 0.8 ms (n = 3) after the addition of 5 μm rBmK M1. This represents an increase of ∼414% in the time constant τ in the presence of 5 μm rBmK M1. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the glycine mutants except Y21G were less efficient even at high concentrations (30 and 50 μm) in slowing the inactivation kinetics of Nav1.5 channels compared with the wild-type toxin. Mutants Y14G and Y42G of rBmK M1 were the least effective in slowing the inactivation of the channel. The time constants of inactivation were 2.1 ± 0.3 ms (n = 3) and 1.7 ± 0.3 ms (n = 4) after the addition of 30 μm Y14G and 50 μm Y42G, respectively, corresponding to 150 and 121% of the time constants under control conditions, respectively. The addition of 30 μm W38G increased the time constant of inactivation to 2.6 ± 0.4 ms (n = 3), corresponding to 186% of the control value. Y35G was the second most effective mutant, increasing the τ value to 4.2 ± 1.3 ms (n = 3) at a concentration of 30 μm, corresponding to 300% of the control value. Y21G was the most effective mutant, increasing the τ value to 4.7 ± 0.4 ms (n = 3) at a concentration of 5 μm, corresponding to 335% of the control value. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the phenylalanine mutants except Y5F had about the same efficacy in Nav1.5 as rBmK M1. The time constants of inactivation were 5.4 ± 0.6 ms (n = 4), 7.1 ± 0.4 ms (n = 4), and 5.8 ± 0.6 ms (n = 3) after the addition of 10 μm W47F, 7.5 μm Y35F, and 10 μm Y14F, respectively, corresponding to 385, 507, and 414% of the time constants under control conditions, respectively. Y5F was the least effective in slowing the inactivation of the Na+ channel. The time constant of inactivation was only 2.3 ± 0.6 ms (n = 3) after the addition of 100 μm, corresponding to 165% of the control value. The effects of rBmK M1 and some of its mutants on the peak Na+ current and time to peak were somewhat variable (oocyte-dependent) and not further analyzed. The slowing of inactivation induced by rBmK M1 and its mutants was concentration-dependent (Fig. 6). The EC50 values of rBmK M1, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, Y14F, and W47F were determined by a sigmoidal fit of the τ-V relationship as displayed in Fig. 6. The EC50 values determined for rBmK M1, Y21G, Y35G, Y35F, Y14F, and W47F were 0.50 ± 0.03, 1.02 ± 0.15, 5.05 ± 0.36, 0.71 ± 0.09, 3.36 ± 0.48, and 3.1 ± 0.3 μm, respectively. The EC50 value determined in this study for rBmK M1 is slightly higher than the EC50 value determined for the native BmK M1 toxin (0.2 μm) in one of our previous studies (13Goudet C. Huys I. Clynen E. Schoofs L. Wang D.-C Waelkens E. Tytgat J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 61-65Google Scholar). Y21G was comparable to native rBmK M1. Y35G was ∼30% less efficient in slowing the inactivation kinetics of Nav1.5 channels compared with wild-type rBmK M1. The EC50 value of Y35G was at least 10 times higher than that of rBmK M1. The EC50 values of the phenylalanine mutants were comparable to that of rBmK M1, except Y5F. As shown in Fig. 6, the EC50 values of Y14G, Y42G, W38G, and Y5F could not be determined because the highest concentrations used did not reach a maximal effect in the dose-response curve. When the three-dimensional structures of the scorpion toxins CsE V3 and AaH II were elucidated ∼20 years ago, the CHS, mainly including Tyr5, Tyr35, and Trp47/Tyr47, was proposed to be responsible for the pharmacological effect of these toxins (17Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Rochat H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7443-7447Google Scholar, 22Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Alamassy R.J. Suddath F.L. Watt D.D. Bugg C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6496-6500Google Scholar, 23Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Almassy R.J. Suddath F.L. Bugg C.E. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 1-7Google Scholar). Although the CHS is found in all scorpion toxin structures known today, this assumption required experimental identification. The individual residues in this cluster (e.g. Trp45 in AaH II and Tyr49 in Lqh α insect toxin) have been assessed by chemical modification (24Kharrat R. Darbon H. Rochat H. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 381-390Google Scholar) and mutagenesis analysis (11Zilberberg N. Froy O. Loret E. Cestele S. Arad D. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14810-14816Google Scholar, 25Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Pelhate M. Adams M.E. Norris T. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10215-10222Google Scholar) and shown to play an important role in bioactivity. In this study, seven aromatic residues, including three amino acids of this cluster, were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. Correlating the high impact substitution of glycine to the more conservative mutation of phenylalanine, our results clearly indicate that these conserved aromatic residues are specifically involved in either or both pharmacological function and structural stability. Aromatic Residues Possibly Involved in Pharmacological Function—The bioassay showed that the toxicity of W38G and Y42G was dramatically reduced (Table I). In concordance, electrophysiological analysis showed that W38G and Y42G were the least effective in slowing the inactivation of the sodium channel. The EC50 could not be determined because the highest concentration available could not induce a maximal effect in the dose-response curves (Figs. 5 and 6). Simultaneously, the CD spectra of these two mutants show the least alteration in comparison with that of unmodified BmK M1 (Fig. 3A). These results can be used to speculate that the conserved aromatic residues Trp38 and Tyr42 are involved in the functional performance of the toxin. Tyr42 is located in the loop between the β2- and β3-sheets (Fig. 7). Considering that this loop is remarkably different in sequence and structure between α- and β-toxins (7Li H.M. Wang D.-C. Zeng Z.H. Jin L. Hu R.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 415-431Google Scholar, 17Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Rochat H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7443-7447Google Scholar), this aromatic residue may be related to the preference for the distinct target site of α-toxins. Aromatic Residues Possibly Involved in Structural Stability—The non-expression of W47G and the extremely unstable expression of Y5G indicate that these two residues are essential for the general structure of the toxin. The polypeptide chain of the toxin cannot be folded correctly without these aromatic side chains. Y35G could be expressed in an amount comparable to the wild type, but its toxicity was reduced dramatically (Table I). In agreement with the obtained LD50 value in mice, the corresponding EC50 value of Y35G in Nav1.5 was 10 times higher than that of rBmK M1. The CD spectrum also changed dramatically (Fig. 3A), indicating an alteration of the secondary structure of Y35G. Interestingly, the conservative phenylalanine substitution mutants were expressed very well. Y5F and Y35F were present in the culture medium in an amount of ∼3 mg/liter, comparable to rBmK M1. The expression level of W47F was high (9–10 mg/liter) in comparison with rBmK M1 (Table I). Compared with rBmK M1, alterations in the CD spectra were milder for Y5F and Y35F, but severe for W47F (Fig. 3B). In addition, the bioassay, in concordance with the electrophysiological characterization, showed that the bioactivities of all of the phenylalanine mutants (although in different degrees) were significantly higher than those of the mutants that lost their aromatic side chains by substitution with glycine (Table I). Hence, by constructing and thoroughly comparing glycine and phenylalanine mutants of conserved aromatic residues in BmK M1, we have shown that the aromatic side chains of W47F and Y35F are indispensable for maintaining the structure and pharmacological function of the toxin. Interestingly, these residues do not have to be Trp47 or Tyr35 because the aromatic side chain is the primordial component. Also indicated by this study is the fact that residue 5 has to be a tyrosine because the phenylalanine mutant displayed a very low bioactivity. The three-dimensional structures of BmK M1 and other α-toxins reveal that Tyr5, Tyr35, and Trp47 are located on the three-stranded β-sheet: β1-, β2-, and β3-strands, respectively. The aromatic rings of these residues are positioned orthogonally one to the other in a so-called “herringbone” arrangement (Fig. 7), which was identified as the lowest energy configuration of relatively solvent-exposed aromatic rings (26Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 125-189Google Scholar). In this way, this aromatic cluster plays an important role in the stabilization of the three-stranded β-sheet. It is plausible to infer that, due to the loss of the interactions between these aromatic rings, the β-sheet will be interrupted and maybe even disintegrated. Trp47 is situated at the center of the cluster (Fig. 7), and its aromatic ring resides in the vicinity of the side chains of both Tyr5 and Tyr35 (distances of 3.5–4 Å). It can be hypothesized that the disruption of the herringbone arrangement due to the loss of the aromatic side chains in W47G and Y5G makes the mutants unable to express. This conclusion is supported by the fact that all of the phenylalanine mutants were very well expressed. W47F, Y35F, and Y14F also displayed the essential bioactivity (Table I). Instead of the non-expression for W47G, mutant W47F was expressed at a high level with a relative toxicity of 23%. However, the CD spectrum reveals a severe conformational change (Fig. 3B). In short, the glycine and phenylalanine mutants clearly indicate that, with the exception of Tyr5, the presence of the aromatic side chain is sufficient and important for the unique structure and the pharmacological function. Tyr5 seems to be a unique and irreplaceable amino acid. The CD spectrum shows a milder alteration for this mutant. Inspecting the three-dimensional structure, there is a contact through a hydrogen bond between the functional -OH group of Tyr5 and the side chain of Lys58/Arg58, which can be found in all long chain scorpion toxins (6Housset D. Habersetzer-Rochat C. Astier J.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 88-103Google Scholar, 8He X.L. Li H.M. Zeng Z.H. Liu X.Q. Wang M. Wang D.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 125-135Google Scholar). By consequence, an aromatic ring without that -OH group cannot maintain the general structure as shown by the CD spectrum and can interrupt the subtle tertiary arrangement between the N-terminal part and the C-terminal segment, which in turn affects the pharmacological function. Therefore, the importance of Tyr5 is not only in the aromatic ring, but also in the functional -OH group; and as a consequence, Tyr5 is highly conserved among α-toxins. Aromatic Residues in Other Sites—Tyr14 and Tyr21 are located on Face B (Fig. 1B), which is roughly opposite to Face A, where the CHS is situated. Y14G was almost nontoxic compared with rBmK M1 (Table I). In agreement, its effect on voltage-gated sodium channels was also the least (Figs. 5 and 6). The CD spectrum was seriously altered compared with that of unmodified BmK M1 (Fig. 3A), indicating a conformational change due to the loss of the aromatic side chain in this position. The results show that Tyr14 is essential for stabilizing the unique conformation of the toxin and is involved in the interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel. To obtain a more thorough insight in this matter, a more conservative phenylalanine substitution for Tyr14 was constructed. Y14F was expressed in an amount comparable to that of Y14G. However, in contrast to Y14G (no detectable toxicity and EC50 > 100 μm), Y14F possesses a high bioactivity (71% relative toxicity and EC50 = 3.36 ± 0.48 μm) (Table I). These data reveal that it is the aromatic side chain of Tyr14 that mainly contributes to the proper conformation and in turn affects the pharmacological function of the toxin. This residue protrudes from the loop between the β1-sheet and the α-helix (Fig. 7). The structure shows that its aromatic ring interacts with the side chain of Ile6, which is also a crucial conserved residue in α-toxins. The hydrophobic interactions between these two residues on the surface may play an important role in stabilizing the unique conformation of this loop so as to influence the β-sheet and the α-helix of the toxin. The effect of mutation Y21G was milder on bioactivity, on the EC50 in Nav1.5, and on the CD spectrum (Fig. 3A and Table I), indicating that the aromatic residue Tyr21 is putatively not a crucial determinant for the structure and pharmacological function of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2067175122,"The developmental emergence of learning has traditionally been attributed to the maturation of single brain regions necessary for learning in adults, rather than to the maturation of synaptic interactions within neural systems. Acquisition and retention of a simple form of motor learning, classical conditioning of the eyeblink reflex, depends on the cerebellum and interconnected brainstem structures, including the inferior olive. Here, we combined unit recordings from Purkinje cells in eye regions of the cerebellar cortex and quantitative electron microscopy of the inferior olive to show that the developmental emergence of eyeblink conditioning in rats is associated with the maturation of inhibitory feedback from the cerebellum to the inferior olive. The results are consistent with previous work in adult animals and indicate that the maturation of cerebellar inhibition within the inferior olive may be a critical factor for the formation and retention of learning-specific cerebellar plasticity and eyeblink conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2135876398,"Indirect evidence suggests that an abnormal increase in reducing power (reductive stress) may be associated with abnormal clinical states. We have recently proposed that under such conditions biomolecules with electrophilic methyl groups (EMGs) bound to positively charged nitrogen or sulfur moieties may act as electron acceptors and that this poising mechanism may entail the generation of methane gas. Here we report for the first time the generation of methane by rat liver mitochondria. We also report the formation of methane from choline in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, catalytic iron, and ascorbic acid. In this system, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are formed from the ascorbate molecule in parallel with methane generation. In view of these findings, we try to explain the essential role of biomolecules with EMG moiety. We hypothesize that this concerted reaction may be a defensive response to reductive stress and may provide the protection needed against redox imbalance in living systems."
https://openalex.org/W2145162853,"To define the role of the plasminogen activators (PAs) urokinase PA (uPA) and tissue PA (tPA) as well as the uPA receptor (uPAR) in arteriogenesis, we investigated their impact in a rabbit and mouse model of adaptive collateral artery growth. Collateral artery growth was induced by occlusion of the femoral artery in rabbit and wild-type (WT) mice and in mice with targeted inactivation of uPA (uPA-/-), tPA (tPA-/-), or uPAR (uPAR-/-). Northern blot results revealed a significant up-regulation of uPA but not uPAR or tPA in the early phase of arteriogenesis in rabbit and WT mice. This up-regulation on RNA level was followed by an increased protein level and enzymatic activity. Impaired perfusion recovery upon femoral artery ligation was observed by laser Doppler analysis in vivo in uPA-deficient mice but not in uPAR or tPA deficiency compared with WT mice. Immunohistochemical studies revealed an association of leukocyte infiltration with arteriogenesis in WT mice that was strongly reduced in uPA-/- but not in uPAR- or tPA-deficient mice. We conclude that arteriogenesis is promoted by an uPA-mediated infiltration of leukocytes that is not dependent on uPAR."
https://openalex.org/W2079854279,"Primary neuronal destruction in the central nervous system triggers rapid changes in glial morphology and function, after which activated glial cells contribute to secondary neuronal changes. Here we show that, after entorhinal cortex lesion, activation of microglia, but not other glial cells, leads to massive secondary dendritic changes of deafferentiated hippocampal neurons. Blocking of microglial activation in vivo reduced this secondary neuronal damage and enhanced regenerative axonal sprouting. In contrast, abolishing astrocytes or oligodendroglia did not result in specific neuronal changes. Furthermore, primary damage leads to an interleukin 1beta up-regulation, which is attenuated by the immuno-modulator transforming growth factor beta1, whereas tumor necrosis factor alpha is not affected. Modification of microglial activity following denervation of the hippocampus protects neurons from secondary dendritic alterations and therefore enables their reinnervation. These data render activated microglia a putative therapeutic target during the course of axonal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2128764291,"The search for new pharmaceuticals that are specific for diseased rather than normal cells in the case of cancer and viral disease has raised interest in locally acting drugs that act over short distances within the cell and for which different cell compartments have distinct sensitivities. Thus, photosensitizers (PSs) used in anti-cancer therapy should ideally be transported to the most sensitive subcellular compartments in order for their action to be most pronounced. Here we describe the design, production, and characterization of the effects of bacterially expressed modular recombinant transporters for PSs comprising 1) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone as an internalizable, cell-specific ligand; 2) an optimized nuclear localization sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen; 3) an Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein as a carrier; and 4) an endosomolytic amphipathic polypeptide, the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin. These modular transporters delivered PSs into the nuclei, the most vulnerable sites for the action of PSs, of murine melanoma cells, but not non-MSH receptor-overexpressing cells, to result in cytotoxic effects several orders of magnitude greater than those of nonmodified PSs. The modular fusion proteins described here for the first time, capable of cell-specific targeting to particular subcellular compartments to increase drug efficacy, represent new pharmaceuticals with general application."
https://openalex.org/W1964261920,"In neurons the phosphorylation of neurofilament (NF) proteins NF-M and NF-H is topographically regulated. Although kinases and NF subunits are synthesized in cell bodies, extensive phosphorylation of the KSP repeats in tail domains of NF-M and NF-H occurs primarily in axons. The nature of this regulation, however, is not understood. As obligate heteropolymers, NF assembly requires interactions between the core NF-L with NF-M or NF-H subunits, a process inhibited by NF head domain phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of head domains at protein kinase A (PKA)-specific sites seems to occur transiently in cell bodies after NF subunit synthesis. We have proposed that transient phosphorylation of head domains prevents NF assembly in the soma and inhibits tail domain phosphorylation; i.e. assembly and KSP phosphorylation in axons depends on prior dephosphorylation of head domain sites. Deregulation of this process leads to pathological accumulations of phosphorylated NFs in the soma as seen in some neurodegenerative disorders. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of PKA phosphorylation of the NF-M head domain on phosphorylation of tail domain KSP sites. In rat cortical neurons we showed that head domain phosphorylation of endogenous NF-M by forskolin-activated PKA inhibits NF-M tail domain phosphorylation. To demonstrate the site specificity of PKA phosphorylation and its effect on tail domain phosphorylation, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with NF-M mutated at PKA-specific head domain serine residues. Epidermal growth factor stimulation of cells with mutant NF-M in the presence of forskolin exhibited no inhibition of NF-tail domain phosphorylation compared with the wild type NF-M-transfected cells.

Neurofilaments consist of three protein subunits, high (NF-H), middle (NF-M), and low (NF-L) molecular weight, each composed of three domains, an N-terminal head domain, an a-helix rich central rod domain, and C-terminal tail domains (1Shaw G. Burgoyne R.D. Neuronal Cytoskeleton. John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York1991: 185-214Google Scholar). NFs are obligate heteropolymers in vivo, with assembly depending on a core NF-L subunit interacting with NF-M or NF-H subunits (2Ching G.Y. Liem R.K. J.

NF protein phosphorylation plays a key role in the dynamic remodeling of cytoskeletal architecture during axonal growth, guidance, and synaptogenesis (6Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W.

N-terminal head domains are phosphorylated by second messenger-dependent protein kinases, the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC) (9Sihag R.K.

NF phosphorylation is topographically regulated within neurons. N-terminal head domain phosphorylation by PKA at Ser55 in NFL or Ser46 in NF-M inhibits assembly into a heteropolymer in vitro and in vivo (3Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Mol.

It has been suggested that this transient head domain phosphorylation in cell bodies inhibits NF polymerization and filament formation (4Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J.

More recent studies, however, of NF-H null mice, or mice transfected with a NF-H tailless mutant, suggest that neither NF-H nor its phosphorylated tail are essential to the above neuronal properties (27Rao M.V. Garcia M.L. Miyazaki Y. Gotow T. Yuan A. Mattina S. Ward C.M. Calcutt N.A. Uchiyama Y. Nixon R.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 681-693Google Scholar, 28Rao M.V. Houseweart M.K. Williamson T.L. Crawford T.O. Folmer J. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 171-181Google Scholar). Nevertheless, deregulation of NF-M and NF-H tail domain phosphorylation is correlated with some pathologies seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in which tail domain phosphorylation occurs abnormally in perikarya (29Manetto V. Sternberger N.H. Perry G. Sternberger L.A. Gambetti P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1988; 47: 642-653Google Scholar, 30Sobue G. Hashizume Y. Yasuda T. Mukai E. Kumagai T. Mitsuma T. Trojanowski J.Q.

In a model of the dynamics of neurofilament phosphorylation, we postulated that the transient phosphorylation of head domains in cell bodies prevented neurofilament assembly and tail domain phosphorylation (32Pant H.C. Veeranna Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 575-592Google Scholar). Only after dephosphorylation of the head domain in the axon hillock, as NFs assembled into filaments for transport in the axon, do tail domain KSP repeats become accessible to phosphorylation. The hypothesis predicts that phosphorylation of head domain sites of NF-M, for example by PKA, should inhibit phosphorylation of the tail domain KSP repeats. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated PKA phosphorylation of NF-M head domain sites with forskolin in primary cortical neurons and in NIH3T3 cells transfected with NF-M mutated in PKA-specific head domain sites to prevent phosphorylation. We showed that activation of PKA in cortical neurons inhibited growth factor-induced tail domain phosphorylation of endogenous NF-M by Erk1/2, despite significant activation of the MAPK cascade. The results of the transfection experiment were more compelling, because they showed that tail domain phosphorylation of transfected wild type NF-M was inhibited by forskolin and EGF stimulation of the MAPK cascade, whereas tail domain phosphorylation was not inhibited in cells transfected with the mutant NF-M. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation of specific serine sites in the head domain of NF-M by PKA inhibits phosphorylation of KSP sites in the NF-M tail domain and poses a mechanism for topographic regulation of cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation in neurons. Reagents—The phospho-Erk1 and -Erk2 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (prepared against a peptide phosphorylated at threonine 202 and tyrosine 204, Thr202/Tyr204 Erk1 and Erk2), and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). An antibody to NF-M phospho form (RMO-281) was from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). SMI31 and SMI32 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. (Lutherville, MD). Anti-NF-M C-terminal polyclonal antibody (phospho-independent) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The pcDNA/Amp eukaryotic expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). NGF, EGF, dibutyryl-cAMP, and H89 were obtained from Sigma (Louis, MO); forskolin and KT5720 were purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem). Plasmids and Constructs—The full-length pcNDA-NF-M (wild type) construct was prepared as described previously (17Li B.S. Veeranna Gu J. Grant P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 211-217Google Scholar). The head domain phosphorylation sites of NF-M were mutated by site-directed substitution of Ser1, Ser23, and Ser46 with alanine according to the methods described previously (33Philpott A. Porro E.B. Kirschner M.W. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1409-1421Google Scholar, 34Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Google Scholar). First, NF-M S23A was generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. 5′ and 3′ NF-M primers were used in combination with the mutagenic primers acccggtccgccttcagtcgtggtg and cacacgactgaaggcggcccgggt, respectively. The wild type NF-M was used as a template. Then, the NF-M mutant S1A/S23A was produced by using mutagenic primers S1A, aagatggaattcgcctacacgctg, and mutant NF-M S23A as a template. Finally, the NF-M S1A/S23A/S46A mutant was made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using NF-M S1A/S23A as a template. 5′ and 3′ NF-M primers were used in combination with the mutagenic primers S46A, ggctcgcccgccaccgtgtcctcc, and ggaggacacggtggcgggcgagcc, respectively. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI and inserted into a pGEM-T vector. After confirming the sequence by DNA sequencing, the triple substitution NF-M mutant was made by cloning the EcoRI/NotI fragment of the pGEM-T NF-M S1A/S23A/S46A mutant into the EcoRI/NotI site of CMV (pCDNA3.1) vector. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. Primary Cultures of Cortical Neurons—Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared from E18 rat fetuses. Brains were dissected and dissociated with papain and DNase I. For immunohistochemistry, cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105/cells per cm2 on glass coverslips precoated with 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. For Western blot or immunoprecipitation, cells were plated at 5 × 106 per each six wells on Nunc multiwell plates precoated with 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. Cells were maintained in B27/neurobasal medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 7 days. Under these conditions the contamination of glial cells, measured by staining with glial fibrillary protein antibody, was less than 10%. After 7 days cells were starved in the presence of 0.2% B27/neurobasal medium overnight (to reduce any background stimulation by serum factors) and treated with 20 μm forskolin or 100 μm dibutyryl-cAMP, 50 ng/ml NGF, 2.5 μm KT5720, or 10 μm H89 (PKA inhibitors) and 50 μm PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with wild type NF-M (wtNF-M) or mutant (serines 1, 23, and 46 and alanines 1, 23, and 46) NF-M (mtNF-M) expression constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved in the presence of 0.2% calf serum overnight (to reduce any background stimulation by serum factors) and then treated with 25 ng/ml EGF, 20 μm forskolin, or 100 μm dibutyryl-cAMP, 2.5 μm KT5720, or 10 μm H89 (PKA inhibitors) and 50 μm PD98059. Immunoblotting—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Amin N.D. Albers W. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4427-4434Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested by scraping from dishes and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 2.5 mm Navo4, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by passing though a 21-gauge needle several times and incubating for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using BCA protein reagent. An equal amount of total protein (25 μg of protein/lane) was resolved on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This membrane was incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS) plus 5% dry milk (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C in primary antibodies: anti-SMI-31 (phospho-NF-H and phospho-NF-M antibodies, 1:5000), RMO-281, a specific antibody to NF-M phospho-epitopes (1:3000), anti-NF-M C-terminal polyclonal antibody (phospho-independent, 1:5000), and phospho- or phospho-independent Erk1/2 antibodies (1:2000 and 1:1000). The membranes were then washed four times in TTBS (5 min/each). This was followed by incubation in secondary antibody (goat- anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at a dilution of 1: 3000) for 2 h at room temperature. Western blots were analyzed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—After NIH3T3 cells were transfected on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine, cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS, and 10 mm EGTA and permeabilized (with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 15 min. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, RMO-281, a specific antibody to NF-M phospho form (1:250). Antibody was diluted in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. After a wash in PBS (three times, 15 min each) the coverslips were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three PBS washes, and mounted in aqueous medium. Fluorescent images were observed with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed and merged by using Adobe Photoshop software. Protein Kinase A Assay—PKA was assayed by using Promega's SignaTECT™ cAMP-dependent PKA assay system that uses biotinylated Kemptide (LRRASLG), a peptide substrate derived from pyruvate kinase. This substrate is highly specific for PKA. A total reaction volume of 25 μl of kinase assay mixture was used, containing 5× PKA assay buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 100 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mg/ml BSA), PKA biotinylated peptide substrate, [γ-32P]ATP mix, and enzyme sample in the presence or absence of 0.025 mm cAMP. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of the enzyme extract and incubated at 30 °C for 5min. The reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of termination buffer (7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride), and 10 μl from each tube was spotted onto a pre-numbered SAM2TM membrane square. The membranes were washed four times in 2 m NaCl, four times in 2 m NaCl 1% H3PO4, and one time in de-ionized water then rinsed with 95% ethanol. The radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. PKA-specific activity was expressed in picomoles of ATP/min/μg of protein and calculated using the formula, enzyme-specific activity in picomoles of ATP/min/μg of protein = [(cpmreaction with substrate – cpmreaction without substrate) × 37.5]/(10 × timemin × amount of protein in reactionpg × specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP). In this formula 37.5 is the sum of the reaction volume (25 μl) plus the termination buffer volume (12.5 μl). 10 is the volume in microliters of the sample spotted onto SAM2TM membranes. Specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP = ((37.5/5) X)/2500 (5 is the volume in microliters of the samples spotted onto SAM2TM membranes without washing; X is the average cpm of the 5-μl samples spotted onto SAM2TM membranes without washing; and 2500 is the number of ATP in the reaction). In Vitro Phosphorylation of NF-M—The NF-M expression vector was obtained from Dr. R. K. H. Liem (Columbia University, NY). The bacterially expressed full-length NF-M was purified as described previously (36Veeranna Shetty K.T. Amin N. Grant P. Albers R.W. Pant H.C. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 629-636Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of NF-M was performed basically as described previously (16Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Google Scholar, 37Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6844-6848Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation was performed in a total volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each of sodium vanadate, EGTA, EDTA, dithiothreitol, and [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of NF-M, plus 0.1 μm okadaic acid or microcystin. 10 μl of enzyme was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After washing 2× with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2× with 90% alcohol, the pellet was dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer. Phosphorylation was assayed by autoradiography. The phosphorylation of NF-M by PKA was induced in the presence of 10 μl of catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Phosphorylation of the NF-M Head Domain by PKA in Vitro Inhibits NF-M Tail Domain Phosphorylation—To investigate the effect of PKA phosphorylation of the NF-M head domain on phosphorylation of the KSP repeats in the tail domain, we first studied NF-M phosphorylation by PKA and MAPK; i.e. constitutively active MEK/Erk1/2 in vitro. The kinases were used either alone or together in a standard kinase assay system using bacterial expressed NF-M protein as substrate (36Veeranna Shetty K.T. Amin N. Grant P. Albers R.W. Pant H.C. Neurochem. Res. 1996; 21: 629-636Google Scholar). An autoradiograph of the assay is shown in Fig. 1A with a corresponding histogram showing quantitation, Fig. 1C. Incubation of NF-M in the presence of the catalytic subunit of PKA showed head domain phosphorylation of NF-M (Fig. 1A and 1C, lane 2). Phosphorylation of NF-M in the presence of both MEK-activated MAPK and PKA showed elevated phosphorylation due to head and tail domain phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and 1C, lane 3). Significantly increased NF-M phosphorylation was obtained in the presence of MAPK/constitutively active MEK without PKA, due to more extensive tail domain phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and C, lane 4). A comparison of lane 3 with lane 4 shows almost a 2-fold inhibition of MAPK tail domain phosphorylation by PKA. It is important to note that the order of head and tail domain phosphorylation has an important effect on the outcome of tail domain phosphorylation. When the NF-M was phosphorylated first by MAPK then by PKA there was an increase in total NF-M phosphorylation (data not shown), a result consistent with earlier studies (16Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Google Scholar). On the other hand, when NF-M was first phosphorylated by PKA then by active MAPK, a significant reduction in phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that PKA phosphorylation of the NF-M head domain inhibits subsequent phosphorylation of the tail domain by a proline-directed kinase. Head Domain Phosphorylation of NF-M Inhibits the Tail Domain Phosphorylation of NF-M in Primary Cortical Neurons—To determine whether PKA activation and phosphorylation of the NF-M head domain in neuronal cells affects tail domain phosphorylation, we cultured E18 primary cortical neurons in the presence and absence of forskolin. After 7 days of culture, cells were starved and some were then treated with forskolin (20 μm), whereas others were treated with forskolin plus KT5720 (2.5 μm), a PKA inhibitor. The cell lysates were assayed for PKA kinase activity and showed that forskolin stimulated activity 6-fold (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the addition of the specific inhibitor restored activity to the control level (lane 3). The same cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibody specific for NF-M phospho-epitopes in the tail domain (RMO-281) and anti NF-M antibody (for total NF-M). We found that activation of PKA decreases the tail domain phosphorylation of NF-M (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The PKA inhibitor (Fig. 2B, lane 3) reversed this inhibitory effect. Because it is well established that forskolin activation of PKA activity affects the MAPK pathway in most cells, including neurons (up-regulation or down-regulation, depending on specific neuron type) (38Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Google Scholar, 39Vogt Weisenhorn D.M. Roback L.J. Kwon J.H. Wainer B.H. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 169: 44-55Google Scholar), it was essential to determine how the MAPK pathway was affected by forskolin in these cortical neurons. In Fig. 2C the data show that forskolin significantly activates Erk1/2 activity more than 2-fold (lane 2), which is inhibited by the PKA inhibitor (lane 3). This suggests that, despite forskolin activation of the MAPKs, known to phosphorylate KSP repeats in rat NF-M (16Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Google Scholar), PKA phosphorylation of the head domain of NF-M did inhibit tail domain phosphorylation. NGF Stimulation of MAPK Phosphorylation of the NF-M Tail Domain Was Inhibited by Activation of PKA in Primary Cultured Cortical Neurons—Studies on PC12 and neuroblastoma cells showed that NGF induces the MAPK cascade via receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ras-Raf pathway (40Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar, 41Svensson B. Ekstrom P.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 453-457Google Scholar, 42Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that the activated MAPK cascade induced tail domain phosphorylation of NF-M in transfected NIH3T3 cells (17Li B.S. Veeranna Gu J. Grant P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 211-217Google Scholar). We assumed that, if the MAPK cascade can be induced in cortical neurons as in PC12 cells, it may result in elevated NF-M tail domain phosphorylation. This activated system could then be used to study the effect of forskolin stimulation of PKA phosphorylation on NF-M tail domain phosphorylation. We first treated neurons with NGF and showed a significant activation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the MAPK cascade had indeed been stimulated (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Use of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 eliminated this activation (lane 3), suggesting that NGF could induce MAPK activity in primary cortical neurons. Moreover, activation of Erk1/2 by NGF resulted in increased phosphorylation of NF-M as seen in the Western blots of the same lysates using NF-M phospho-specific antibody RMO-281 (Fig. 3B, lane 2), and this also could be inhibited by the MEK1 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). These results confirmed that the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway was involved in mediating endogenous NF-M tail domain phosphorylation in primary cortical neurons (16Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Google Scholar, 17Li B.S. Veeranna Gu J. Grant P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 211-217Google Scholar). To determine whether the activation of PKA inhibits tail domain phosphorylation of NF-M induced by NGF stimulation of MAPK, we treated neurons with NGF only, forskolin plus NGF, or forskolin, NGF, and KT5720. With this regimen, it was evident that forskolin plus NGF significantly enhanced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (lane 2, Fig. 3C), which was restored to basal levels by the PKA inhibitor KT5720 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Western blot analysis of these same lysates was performed using RMO-281, SMI31, SMI32, and anti-NF-M antibodies to detect the tail domain phospho-NF-M, dephospho-NF-M and total NF-M, respectively. Results showed that the induced tail domain phosphorylation of NF-M by NGF (Fig. 3D, lane 1) was markedly inhibited by forskolin (Fig. 3D, lane 2, compared with lane 1), but it was reversed by the PKA inhibitor, KT5720 (Fig. 3D, lane 3, compared with lane 2). In vitro PKA kinase assay was performed in same cell lysates to show the activity of PKA (Fig. 3E). Here again, as in the previous experiment, despite the stimulated activity of Erk1/2, tail domain phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of activated PKA. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that head domain phosphorylation of NF-M by PKA inhibits the tail domain phosphorylation of NF-M induced by NGF via the MAPK cascade. Although the activity of MAPK (Erk1/2) was elevated by PKA activation in these experiments, NF-M tail domain phosphorylation was reduced suggesting that a conformational change induced by PKA phosphorylation limits KSP domain phosphorylation.

The expressed inhibitory peptide was highly concentrated in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. This resulted in a 59.7 and 73.6% decrease in phospholamban phosphorylation at threonine 17 under basal and β-adrenergic stimulated conditions without changing phospholamban phosphorylation at serine 16. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake assays showed that the Vmax was decreased by ∼30% although the apparent affinity for Ca2+ was unchanged in heterozygous hearts. The in vivo measurement of cardiac function showed no significant reductions in positive and negative dP/dt, but a moderate 18% decrease in dP/dt40, indicative of isovolumic contractility, and a 26.1% increase in the time constant of relaxation (τ) under basal conditions. The changes in these parameters indicate a moderate cardiac dysfunction in transgenic mice. Although the 3and 4-month-old transgenic mice displayed no overt signs of cardiac disease, when stressed by gestation and parturition, the 7-month-old female mice develop dilated heart failure, suggesting the important role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II pathway in the development of cardiac disease.

Calcium plays a central role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; SERCA, SR Ca2+-ATPase; TG, transgenic; NTG, non-transgenic; PLB, phospholamban; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AIP, autocamitide inhibitory peptide; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; RyR, ryanodine receptor; LV, left ventricle; LVEDP, LV end-diastolic pressure; PP, protein phosphatases. 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; SERCA, SR Ca2+-ATPase; TG, transgenic; NTG, non-transgenic; PLB, phospholamban; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; AIP, autocamitide inhibitory peptide; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; RyR, ryanodine receptor; LV, left ventricle; LVEDP, LV end-diastolic pressure; PP, protein phosphatases. releases Ca2+ to trigger contraction and uptakes Ca2+ to initiate relaxation. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release occurs via ryanodine-sensitive SR Ca2+ release channels located mainly at junctional SR (“foot” structure), whereas Ca2+ uptake is mediated principally by the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) which is located in the longitudinal SR. Both Ca2+ release and uptake are proposed to be regulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (1Maier L.S. Bers D.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 919-939Google Scholar). CaMKII is a member of a family of Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated enzymes. Four CaMKII isoforms are derived from four closely related genes, α, β, γ, and δ (2Schuman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Google Scholar). The δ and γ are the primary cardiac CaMKII isoforms expressed in the adult heart (3Tobimatsu T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17907-17912Google Scholar, 4Mayer P. Mohlig M. Idlibe D. Pfeiffer A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1995; 90: 372-379Google Scholar, 5Hagemann D. Hoch B. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 202-210Google Scholar). CaMKII distributes in distinct compartments of the cardiomyocytes including sarcolemma, cytosol, SR, and nucleus (6Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar), which may represent its functional relevance in the heart. The link between specific isoforms of CaMKII with particular regulatory properties, intracellular localization, and cellular substrates is not established. The activity of SERCA is primarily regulated by an SR intrinsic protein, phospholamban (PLB). PLB physically interacts with SERCA to inhibit pump activity (7Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Repke D.L. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6174-6180Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of PLB disrupts the interaction of PLB with the SERCA pump, relieving its inhibitory effect and resulting in an increase in the apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca2+ (7Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Repke D.L. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6174-6180Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) mediates PLB phosphorylation at serine 16 (7Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Repke D.L. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6174-6180Google Scholar, 8Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 258: 13587-13591Google Scholar), whereas CaMKII mediates phosphorylation of PLB at threonine 17 (8Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 258: 13587-13591Google Scholar, 9Lepeuch C.J. Haiech J. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5150-5157Google Scholar). In the intact heart, both PLB serine 16 and threonine 17 are phosphorylated by PKA and CaMKII, respectively, in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (10Wegener A.D. Simmermann H.K.B. Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11469-11474Google Scholar, 11Talosi L. Edes I. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797Google Scholar). In vitro studies have indicated that SERCA is also phosphorylated by CaMKII at Ser38, which may enhance the maximal velocity (Vmax) of calcium uptake (12Hawkins C. Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31198-31206Google Scholar, 13Toyofuku T. Kurzydloski K. Narayanan N. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26492-26496Google Scholar, 14Xu A. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4407-4416Google Scholar). However, this pathway remains controversial (15Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Pace R.C. Stockes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14964-14970Google Scholar, 16Odermatt A. Kazimieez K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14206-14213Google Scholar), due to a lack of in vivo evidence. In addition to Ca2+ uptake, CaMKII may also play a role in regulating Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release by phosphorylation of serine 2809 of the cardiac SR calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR) which can also be a target for PKA (17Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11144-11152Google Scholar, 18Hain J. Onoue H. Mayrleitner M. Fleischer S. Schindler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2074-2081Google Scholar). However, whether the phosphorylation of RyR leads to opening or closing the Ca2+ release channel remains undefined (17Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11144-11152Google Scholar, 18Hain J. Onoue H. Mayrleitner M. Fleischer S. Schindler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2074-2081Google Scholar, 19Lokuta A.J. Roger T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 609-622Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of CaMKII in the regulation of RyR in intact heart is not clear. Recently, several studies (20Hoch B. Meyer R. Hetzer R. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 713-721Google Scholar) have shown that the level of cardiac isoform CaMKII δ3 is significantly increased in dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Currie (21Currie S. Smith G.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 244-248Google Scholar) and Kirchhefer et al. (22Kirchhefer U. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Neumann J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 254-261Google Scholar) have independently reported that the activity of CaMKII is significantly increased in hypertrophied animal models as well as in human heart failure. However, Netticadan et al. (23Netticadan T. Temsah R. Osada M. Dhallar N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C384-C391Google Scholar, 24Netticadan T. Temsah R. Kawabata K. Dhalla N.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 596-605Google Scholar) showed that the endogenous SR-associated CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of SR Ca2+-handling proteins is depressed in heart failure due to either ischemia-reperfusion or myocardial infarction. These data, taken together, suggest that SR CaMKII is associated with the abnormal Ca2+ handling of the SR in cardiomyocytes. However, the role of CaMKII in the regulation of SR Ca2+-handling proteins under pathophysiological conditions is not clear. In order to investigate the role of SR-associated CaMKII in the regulation of SR Ca2+ transport, as well as in regulating cardiac function, transgenic mice were generated to target specifically the expression of CaMKII inhibitory peptide to cardiac longitudinal SR. The SR targeting sequence is defined by the transmembrane portion of the PLB protein, encoding a double mutant that obviates PLB function. We demonstrate that targeted inhibition of SR CaMKII activity results in a significant decrease in PLB phosphorylation at threonine 17. When stressed, the transgenic mice develop dilated heart failure, suggesting the important role of CaMKII pathway in the development of cardiac disease. Generation of CaMKII-AIP4Transgenic Mice—A synthetic gene expression unit was engineered to encode three functional domains using oligonucleotides produced by the DNA Core Facility at the University of Cincinnati. Starting at the amino terminus, the expression unit contains nucleotides that will encode a CaMKII inhibitor, a FLAG epitope, and an SR localization signal. The CaMKII inhibitor domain consisted of sequences encoding a tetramer of the CaMKII autocamitide inhibitory peptide (AIP4), this 13-amino acid sequence (KKALRRQEAVDAL) is known to be a highly specific and potent inhibitor of CaMKII (25Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Google Scholar). Sequences encoding a FLAG epitope (amino acids DYKDDDDK) (Eastman Kodak Co.) were placed 3′ of the AIP tetramer. In addition, a synthetic gene encoding a truncated PLB transmembrane domain (amino acids 23–52) was inserted to serve as SR localization signal with mutations at Leu31 (L31A) and Asn34 (N34A) (Genomatix, Ltd., patent pending). Previous studies have shown that mutants L31A and N34A result in loss of the PLB inhibition to SERCA activity (26Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Google Scholar). This expression unit was subsequently subcloned into a pBluescript-based vector between the 5.5-kb murine α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter (a gift from J. Robbins, Children's hospital, Cincinnati, OH) and an SV40 polyadenylation signal. The linear transgene fragments were released from SalI sites and were purified by gel purification kit (Qiagen). The transgene was injected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes by the Transgenic Core at University of Cincinnati. The resultant pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR, using an α-MHC-specific primer (5′-GCCCACACCAGAAATGACAGA-3′) and an AIP-specific primer (5′-ACTCGAGCAGGAGCATGACGATA-3′). The founder mice were confirmed by Southern blot analyses. Founder mice were bred with FVB/N wild type mice. Heterozygous animals from at least the third generation were used for all studies, with their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates serving as controls. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Southern Blotting Analysis—Southern blotting analysis was performed to determine the copy number. According to the formula, 1 copy of transgene = 6 × 109 bp (genomic DNA/copy) × μg of transgene DNA loaded/bp of transgene, different amounts of transgene DNA was loaded to estimate the different copy number that served as control. Ten μg of genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies was digested with KpnI and electrophoresed. The blots were hybridized with the SalI to SalI fragment of the released transgene. The TG samples produce 5.8and 1-kb bands. Intensities of the TG band were measured using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were compared with the control bands to estimate copy number. Preparation of Cardiac Homogenates, SR-enriched Microsomes, and Cytosol Fraction—Cardiac homogenates, SR-enriched membrane fractions, as well as cytosol fractions were prepared as described previously with a slight modification (27Ji Y. Loukianov E. Periasamy M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 236-244Google Scholar). In brief, an individual mouse heart was used for preparation of cardiac homogenates with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing (mm) 10 imidazole, pH 7.0, 300 sucrose, 10 NaF, 1 EDTA, 0.3 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitors. For SR isolation, 10–15 pooled mouse hearts were homogenized. Cardiac homogenates were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was collected, and the resulting pellet (first pellet) was homogenized in buffer A and re-centrifuged as above. The supernatant from two spins were pooled, mixed with buffer B (same as buffer A except that 300 mm sucrose was substituted by NaCl to obtain the final concentration of 600 mm), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was concentrated through Centriprep (Millipore) and was treated as a cytosol fraction. The resulting pellet (second pellet) was washed in buffer A and re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for an additional 60 min. The final pellet was used as an SR membrane. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Quantitative Immunoblotting Analysis—The antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: mouse anti-FLAG M2 and anti-PP1 α-subunit antibodies (Sigma), polyclonal anti-calsequestrin and monoclonal anti-PLB, anti-RyR antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), mouse anti-PP2A antibody and rabbit anti-CaMKII-δ antibody (Calbiochem). The appropriate secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG, were obtained from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed using the Super-Signal Chemiluminescent Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Calsequestrin protein was used as internal control. The data were analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 (Media Cybernetics). Immunocytochemical Staining—Whole hearts were taken from NTG and TG mice. Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound was added to merge the hearts into a chamber, and then the hearts were immediately frozen in liquid N2. Frozen tissue sections (4 μm) were stained as described previously (28Wang Y. Takashi E. Xu M. Ayub A. Ashraf M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 85-90Google Scholar). The FLAG expression was detected using mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:10 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel, 1:200 dilution). The same tissue section was used to detect SERCA2a protein using polyclonal anti-SERCA2a antibody (a gift from Dr. Frank Wyutack in Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, 1:200 dilution) followed by fluorescein Cy-3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel, 1:200 dilution). The tissue sections were observed by a Nikon 135 optiphot fluorescence microscope. Immunodetection of Site-specific Phosphorylation of PLB and RyR—To determine the basal phosphorylation level of PLB and RyR, polyclonal antibodies raised against a PLB peptide phosphorylated at Ser16 (PLB-phosphoserine 16) or at Thr17 (PLB-phosphothreonine 17) (Cyclacel, Dundee, UK) and polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated RyR-2809 (Badrilla, Leeds, UK) were used. The mouse hearts were excised and immediately freeze-clamped using instruments pre-cooled with liquid N2 to ensure complete and rapid freezing of the cardiac tissues. Homogenates were prepared, and the following procedures were performed according to the methods described previously (29Ji Y. Lalli M.J. Babu G.J. Xu Y. Kirkpatrick D.L. Liu L.H. Chiamvimonvat N. Walsh R.A. Shull G.E. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38073-38080Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation was performed using cardiac homogenates from mouse heart, as described previously (30Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Google Scholar). For endogenous CaMKII phosphorylation, 10 μl (25 μg) of the cardiac homogenates was added to 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2,10mm NaF, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP. Additionally, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 μm calmodulin, and 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor peptide 5–24 amide (Sigma) were included. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C. PKA phosphorylation of the cardiac homogenates was carried out in the above-described reaction mixture with 20 units of the PKA catalytic subunit. Reactions were terminated with 4 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer after a 5-(CaMKII) and 2-min (PKA) incubation, which was associated with optimal phosphate incorporation in PLB. Twenty μg of protein was subject to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by the detection of PLB Ser16 and PLB Thr17 using the appropriate phosphorylated PLB antibodies as described above. In vivo phosphorylation was carried out by perfusion with increments from 1 to 32 ng/g/min dobutamine only or followed by 50 mg/ml Ca2+ via left jugular vein. The hearts were rapidly freeze-clamped with liquid N2 and homogenized. Twenty μg of cardiac homogenate protein was used for the detection of PLB Ser16 and PLB Thr17 as described above. To detect phosphorylated RyR, 20 μg of homogenate protein was subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE followed by probing with anti-phosphorylated RyR-2809 antibody. After stripping the membrane, the same blot was used to probe with anti-RyR antibody to confirm the right location of the protein on the membrane. Ca2+Transport Assays—Oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake into SR vesicles in cardiac homogenates was determined by the Millipore filtration technique following an established method (31Ji Y. Loukianov E. Loukianova T. Jones L.R. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H89-H97Google Scholar). Cardiac homogenates (100 μg/ml) were incubated (37 °C) in uptake medium containing various concentrations of CaCl2 to yield 0.03–3 μm free Ca2+ (containing 1 μCi/μmol 45Ca2+), as determined by the computer program (32Robertson S. Potter J.D. Schwartz A. Methods in Pharmacology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 63-75Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP. The rate of Ca2+ uptake was calculated by least squares linear regression analysis of uptake at 30, 60, and 90 s. Data were analyzed by Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software). SR Protein Phosphatase Activity Assay—The SR protein phosphatase activity was determined with the Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology. The reaction was initiated by adding SR (10 μg) or cytosol (5 μg) proteins prepared as described above to microtiter wells with and without the synthetic substrate (200 μm) in a total assay volume of 25 μl for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of Malachite Green solution. The absorbance was read at 630 nm to determine the inorganic phosphate released. The phosphatase activity was calculated by subtracting the OD values in the absence of the substrate from those in its presence (24Netticadan T. Temsah R. Kawabata K. Dhalla N.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 596-605Google Scholar). Hemodynamic Measurements—Hemodynamic function was measured as described previously (33Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 50 μg/g body weight ketamine and 100 μg/g body weight thiobutabarbital (Inactin, Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) and placed on a thermally controlled surgical table. Following tracheostomy, the right femoral artery and vein were cannulated with polyethylene tubing (OD 0.3–0.5 mm). The arterial catheter was connected to a COBE CDXIII fixed dome pressure transducer (Cobe Cardiovascular, Arvada, CO) for measurement of arterial blood pressure, and the venous catheter was connected to a syringe pump for the infusion of experimental drugs. A high fidelity, 1.4 French (0.5 mm) micromanometer (SPR-671, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) was then inserted into the right carotid artery and advanced across the aortic valve and into the left ventricle. After completion of the surgery animals were allowed to stabilize for 30–45 min. Cardiovascular responses to separate doses of dobutamine, delivered as a constant infusion (0.1 μl/min/g body weight) over a 3-min period, were then determined; animals were allowed to recover to base line for 5–10 min between doses. After completion of the dose-response protocol, 50 mg/ml CaCl2 was infused at a rate of 0.2 μl/min/g body weight, and measurements of heart function were repeated after 5 min. To evaluate left ventricular function, the following measurements and calculations were made: the maximal positive first derivation of LV pressure (peak + dP/dt), an indicator of myocardial contractility; the rate of LV pressure increase determined at an LV pressure of 40 mm Hg (dP/dt40), an indicative of isovolumic contractility (34Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 334-343Google Scholar, 35Tang W. Weil M.H. Sun S. Noc M. Yang L.Y. Gazmuri R.J. Circulation. 1995; 92: 3089-3093Google Scholar); the time constant of relaxation (τ), a measure of LV relaxation, calculated from the exponential decay of the LV pressure trace to a zero asymptote LV; end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), an index of LV pre-load and compliance (36Stefanadis C. Manolis A. Dernellis J. Tsioufis C. Tsiamis E. Gavras I. Gavras H. Toutouzas P. J. Hum. Hypertens. 2001; 15: 635-642Google Scholar). Pressure signals were recorded and analyzed using a PowerLab 4/s data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Average values and each variable were determined for 20–30-s periods at the end of each 3-min dose. Analytical and Statistical Procedures—Data are reported as the means ± S.E. The statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test or one factor (within) or mixed, two-factor analysis of variance (for cardiac function data). A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Design, Generation, and Identification of CaMKII-AIP4Transgenic Mice—Autocamtide, a 13-amino acid peptide (KKALRRQETVDAL), is an ideal substrate for CaMKII. Autocamtide inhibitor peptide, AIP, based on the autocamtide sequence (KKALRRQEAVDAL) is a potent and specific substrate competitive inhibitor for CaMKII (25Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 806-812Google Scholar). In this study the cardiac specific α-MHC promoter was used to direct the concatemer AIP4 genes to the heart. In order to target the expression of AIP4 to the longitudinal SR, a truncated PLB transmembrane domain was used as SR localization signal. To prevent the inhibition of PLB transmembrane domain on SERCA activity, mutations were made at Leu31 (L31A) and Asn34 (N34A) (26Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Google Scholar). Furthermore, the FLAG epitope was included to identify the targeted expression of AIP4 in cardiac SR. The design for the transgene is shown in Fig. 1A. TG mice expressing FLAG-tagged CaMKII-AIP4 were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six transgenic founders were identified by Southern blotting and PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). Out of six transgenic founders, three lines (lines 35, 36, and 46) transmitted the transgene to offspring; lines 32 and 45 did not transmit the transgene to offspring, and line 42 failed to generate litters. Line 46 carried an estimated two copies of transgene, and line 35 carried one copy (Fig. 1B). To compare the AIP4 protein expression, cardiac homogenates were subjected to quantitative immunoblotting by using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, the FLAG protein is only expressed in TG hearts. Quantitation of the FLAG protein levels revealed that the expression level in line 46 is 2–3-fold higher than in line 35. Line 46 was chosen for the following functional experiments. To confirm the localization of AIP4 expression on cardiac SR, immunofluorescent staining was performed. The tissue sections from TG hearts using both anti-FLAG and anti-SERCA2a antibody showed the similar striated pattern of staining (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that the AIP4 protein was, as predicted based on its SR localization signal, present and highly concentrated in the SR. Furthermore, by using isolated SR and cytosolic fractions, Western blot analysis showed the FLAG epitope was exclusively expressed in cardiac SR in transgenic mice (Fig. 2B). To determine whether AIP4 expression affects CaMKII expression in cardiac SR, isolated SR proteins were electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with anti-CaMKII antibody. There is no significant difference in CaMKII protein level between NTG and TG mice (arbitrary units: 0.983 ± 0.002 in NTG versus 1.017 ± 0.015 in TG, n = 5, p = 0.287) (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 3CaMKII protein levels in isolated SR and cytosolic fraction from NTG and AIP4 TG hearts.A, CaMKII protein levels were measured in cardiac homogenates, isolated SR, and cytosolic fractions from NTG and TG mice by Western blot. With this anti-CaMKII antibody (mainly against δ isoform, Calbiochem) two bands were detected which may represent δ (upper band) and γ (lower band) isoforms. B, the data are presented as the mean ± S.E., n = 4 for each group, p > 0.05 versus NTG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 12–16 week-old TG mice were capable of producing healthy litters that exhibited no overt manifestations of a diseased phenotype. There was no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy in the TG mice. The heart weight/body weight ratio (mg/g) of the 12–16-week-old mice used below for the analysis of hemodynamic function, PLB phosphorylation, and SR Ca2+ uptake was 5.35 ± 0.03 for NTG and 5.33 ± 0.11 for TG in line 46 (n = 10, p > 0.05). Cardiac Expression of AIP4Results in Decreased Phosphorylation of Phospholamban—PLB is regulated by phosphorylation of Thr17 by CaMKII and of Ser16 by PKA (7Tada M. Kirchberger M.A. Repke D.L. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6174-6180Google Scholar, 8Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 258: 13587-13591Google Scholar, 9Lepeuch C.J. Haiech J. Demaille J.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5150-5157Google Scholar). To determine the effect of SR-targeted expression of AIP4 on PLB phosphorylation, the PLB phosphorylation levels under either basal or stimulated conditions were examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, the basal levels of both high and low molecular forms of Thr17-phosphorylated PLB were significantly decreased by 59.7% in extracts prepared from 14to 16-week-old TG mouse hearts (arbitrary units: 1.426 ± 0.075 in NTG versus 0.574 ± 0.094 in TG, n = 6, p < 0.01). However, Ser16-phosphorylated PLB in TG mice was not significantly altered (1.041 ± 0.024 in NTG versus 0.959 ± 0.052 in TG, n = 4, p = 0.104). Our results indicate that functional expression of AIP4 is evidenced by exclusively blocking the CaMKII pathway. Furthermore, we examined the PLB phosphorylation under in vitro stimulated conditions. Cardiac homogenates from NTG and TG hearts were incubated with calmodulin (CaM) in the presence of Ca2+ under optimal conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using PT-17 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, in the absence and presence of calmodulin and Ca2+, Thr17-phosphorylated PLB, were decreased by 63.9 (1.469 ± 0.060 in NTG versus 0.530 ± 0.017 in TG, n = 3, p < 0.01) and 47.8% (1.315 ± 0.039 in NTG versus 0.686 ± 0.096 in TG, n = 3, p < 0.01), respectively, in TG hearts compared with NTG controls, indicating the endogenous CaMKII activity in TG hearts is dramatically decreased. On the other hand, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB was not significantly altered as represented by the similar pattern of Ser16-phosphorylated PLB in the presence of PKA catalytic subunit between NTG (increased by 48.4%, n = 4) and TG (increased by 50.4%, n = 4) hearts (Fig. 4B). This result suggested that the PKA pathway is not affected by AIP expression on SR. It has been reported that β-adrenergic stimulation was associated with significant PLB phosphorylation at both Ser16 and Thr17 sites. To observe the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on phosphorylation of PLB, the NTG and TG mouse hearts were perfu"
https://openalex.org/W2147039012,"We investigated the role of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) during fasting and examined the effect of triiodothyronine (T3) administration in such a condition. The possible involvement of mitochondrial thioesterase (MTE I) and the role of putative cofactors, such as coenzyme Q (CoQ), was also examined. Here, we report that fasting induced a more than twofold elevation in the expression and activity of MTE I, and an increase in UCP3 expression, without any associated uncoupling activity. Administration of T3 to fasting rats further up-regulated UCP3 as well as MTE I expression, markedly enhanced MTE I enzyme activity and prevented the impairment of the uncoupling activity of UCP3 normally seen during fasting. Indeed, T3-treatment induced an UCP3-dependent decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was abolished by the addition of either GDP or superoxide dismutase (SOD). T3 administration also prevented the marked decrease of CoQ levels observed in fasting rats and this provides evidence that also, in vivo, CoQ represents an essential cofactor for the UCP3-mediated uncoupling. The data also show that MTE I and UCP3 are likely involved in the same biochemical mechanism and that UCP3 postulated functions, such as lipid handling and uncoupling, are not mutually exclusive but may coexist in vivo."

The core members of the RBCC family possess a B30.2 domain at their C terminus in addition to the RBCC motif (3Henry J. Mather I. McDermott M. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Google Scholar). However, despite their structural similarity, RBCC proteins show varied subcellular localization and diverse cellular function (4Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Google Scholar). Some members are known to be putative transcription factors and are developmentally regulated or expressed in a tissue-specific manner (5Torok M. Etkin L.D. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 63-71Google Scholar). Xnf7 was first detected in the Xenopus oocyte nucleus and is released to the cytoplasm during oocyte maturation (6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Google Scholar). At the mid-blastula stage, Xnf7 re-enters the nuclei and is involved in regulating the expression of genes required for axial patterning (7El-Hodiri H.M. Shou W. Etkin L.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 190: 1-17Google Scholar). PwA33 was cloned as a nuclear protein on the loops of amphibian lampbrush chromosomes and is suggested to have a role in the synthesis or processing of pre-mRNA during oogenesis (8Bellini M.

Transcriptional intermediary factor-1α and -1β (KAP-1/KRIP-1) bind to the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain of human zinc finger factors and enhance transcriptional repression exerted by the KRAB domain (9Friedman J.R.

HERF1 was cloned as a downstream target of the acute myeloid leukemia 1/core-binding factor-β transcription factor and is required for the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells, although the precise localization of HERF1 remains to be elucidated (19Harada H.

In contrast to the RBCC proteins localized in the nucleus, the exact function of most cytoplasmic RBCC proteins remains unknown. The RBCC domain was found to be involved in protein-protein interaction, and some RBCC proteins were discovered in macromolecular complexes, suggesting a role of the RBCC domain in connecting other proteins to form large multiprotein complexes. Borden (4Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Google Scholar) reported that RING proteins have a common characteristic in that they mediate protein-protein interactions involved in forming large molecular scaffolds. Apoptosis is a physiological cell suicide process that is indispensable in development, and its malfunction is involved in tumorigenesis. Two RBCC proteins, the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML and the ret finger protein RFP, form PML nuclear bodies, which play crucial roles in apoptosis (20Matera A.G.

Indeed, the overexpression of PML induces apoptosis, and analysis of PML knockout mice has shown that PML is essential in the induction of apoptosis by various stimuli such as DNA damage, Fas, tumor necrosis factor, ceramide, and interferons (25Quignon F.

In this work, we report on the identification of a novel member of the RBCC group of RING finger proteins, referred to as MAIR for macrophage-derived apoptosis-inducing RBCC protein. This gene was identified by cDNA library subtraction in which we screened genes up-regulated in bone marrow macrophages by a hematopoietic growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). We also show the subcellular localization of the novel RBCC protein and its apoptosis-inducing function. Library Subtraction and Cloning of MAIR—Library subtraction was performed as reported previously (27Suzu S. Tanaka-Douzono M. Nomaguchi K. Yamada M. Hayasawa H. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5114-5122Google Scholar). Briefly, murine bone marrow macrophages were prepared by culturing femoral bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan) with 100 ng/ml M-CSF for 7 days (28Suzu S. Kimura F. Ota J. Motoyoshi K. Itoh T. Mishima Y. Yamada M. Shimamura S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1860-1867Google Scholar). Cells were factor-depleted for 12 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and then treated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF for 3 h. Poly(A) RNA from untreated cells or from those treated with M-CSF was prepared using an mRNA separator kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA library construction and library subtraction were performed with a PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech). The cDNA fragments of the subtracted cDNA library were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Randomly isolated clones were further analyzed by direct sequencing and by Northern hybridization using total RNA from unstimulated and M-CSF-stimulated bone marrow macrophages. A 3.4-kbp cDNA as a cDNA probe for mouse MAIR was isolated by screening a peritoneal macrophage cDNA library with the cDNA fragment obtained by the subtraction approach. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using a Marathon-Ready cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). 5′-RACE products were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. The following primer was used to amplify the 5′-region: 5′-GCCTCGGTCTGTTCTGCTGCTGCTTCA-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs from bone marrow macrophages were isolated using RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), electrophoresed on agarose gels, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with a radiolabeled MAIR cDNA probe or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (Clontech) (29Suzu S. Hatake K. Ota J. Mishima Y. Yamada M. Shimamura S. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 120-126Google Scholar). A probe for MAIR was prepared by PCR using primers 5′-CCTTCGCGCTCCTTCAAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGACACGCAGGTGGCAGAT-3′. Mouse multiple-tissue Northern blots (OriGene, Rockville, MD) were hybridized with the radiolabeled MAIR cDNA or actin cDNA (Clontech). Expression Constructs—MAIR cDNA was subcloned into an epitope tag expression vector, pHM6 or pMH (Roche Applied Science, Mann-heim, Germany), to introduce a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N or C terminus of MAIR, respectively. The cDNA was also cloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech) to express a fusion protein of MAIR with the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP). In selected experiments, the HA-tagged or GFP-fused MAIR cDNA was subsequently inserted into the zinc-inducible expression vector pMEP4 (Invitrogen). The RING finger and B-box zinc finger domains were deleted by a PCR-based technique using the following primer pairs: 5′-GAACGAGCGGTGCCCGGGGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCCTCTTTGAAGGAGCG-3′ for deletion of the RING finger domain and 5′-CGTGTGCAGCCCATCAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGCGCGGGGACCGGCGACC-3′ for deletion of the B-box domain. The C-terminal region-deleted mutants were generated using the ApaI or BamHI restriction enzyme. Cell Culture and Transfection—The GM-CSF-dependent TF-1 cells (gift from T. Kitamura, Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 ng/ml GM-CSF (30Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The plasmid vectors described above were transfected into TF-1 cells using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were selected in 96-well plates with medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and GM-CSF and were screened by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (F-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-GFP antibody (1E4; Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). Transfection into NIH3T3 cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Assays for Apoptosis—Harvested cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after zinc exposure for the indicated times. The parental cells without zinc exposure were also analyzed to set the live cell gate on the forward and side light scatter. The cell number in the gate was counted for cell viability. To measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), MitoTracker CMX-Ros (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) dissolved in Me2SO was added to the culture to a final concentration of 100 nm (31Poot M. Gibson L.L. Singer V.L. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 358-364Google Scholar). After a 15-min incubation, the cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide for dye exclusion analysis (32Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Google Scholar). For cell cycle analysis, cells were prepared in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 50 mg/ml propidium iodide) (33Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The broad-range caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Z-Asp-CH2-DCB as well as the specific caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-IETD-CHO, Ac-YVAD-CHO, and Ac-LEHD-CHO were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka). The caspase inhibitors were added 30 min prior to ZnCl2 treatment. Immunoblotting—The cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and then completely lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing (34Ohnishi T. Wang X. Ohnishi K. Matsumoto H. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14510-14513Google Scholar). The protein contents of the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The cleared cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was probed with anti-HA tag antibody F-7 or antibody to caspase-3 (Pharmingen), caspase-7 (Transduction Laboratories), caspase-8 (Immunotech, Marseilles, France), caspase-9 (Millennium Biotechnology, Romana, CA), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Pharmingen), or actin (Roche Applied Science). The antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-immunoglobulin antibody (Bio-Rad) using Western blot chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of MAIR—To identify M-CSF-inducible genes, we prepared a cDNA library of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages cultured in cytokine-free medium and subtracted this cDNA library from that of cells stimulated with M-CSF (27Suzu S. Tanaka-Douzono M. Nomaguchi K. Yamada M. Hayasawa H. Kimura F. Motoyoshi K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5114-5122Google Scholar). A number of genes induced by M-CSF stimulation were obtained. 2F. Kimura, S. Suzu, Y. Nakamura, Y. Nakata, M. Yamada, N. Kuwada, T. Matsumura, T. Yamashita, T. Ikeda, K. Sato, and K. Motoyoshi, unpublished data. Among them, we found a novel cDNA fragment encoding a RING finger domain. A 3.4-kb cDNA was isolated by screening a murine peritoneal macrophage cDNA library with the cDNA fragment obtained by the subtraction approach as a probe (Fig. 1A). The cDNA encodes a 501-amino acid protein, which was designated MAIR for macrophage-derived apoptosis-inducing RBCC protein (see below). The MAIR protein consists of an N-terminal cysteine-rich C3HC4 zinc finger (Fig. 1A, solid line a) (35Freemont P.S. Hanson I.M. Trowsdale J. Cell. 1991; 64: 483-484Google Scholar), followed by a B-box zinc finger (solid line b) (36Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6330Google Scholar), a coiled-coil domain (solid line c), and a C-terminal region referred to as the B30.2 domain (dashed lines d–f) (3Henry J. Mather I. McDermott M. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Google Scholar). Accordingly, MAIR is a new member of the family of RBCC proteins. There are three putative nuclear localization sequences (Fig. 1A, boxes). Other members of this RBCC family are Xnf7 of Xenopus (6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Google Scholar), PwA33 (8Bellini M. Lacroix J.C. Gall J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 107-114Google Scholar), human 52-kDa SS-A/Ro autoantigen (11Chan E.K. Hamel J.C. Buyon J.P. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 68-76Google Scholar, 12Itoh K. Itoh Y. Frank M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 177-186Google Scholar), acid finger protein (AFP) (37Chu T.W. Capossela A. Coleman R. Goei V.L. Nallur G. Gruen J.R. Genomics. 1995; 29: 229-239Google Scholar), human RFP (38Takahashi M. Inaguma Y. Hiai H. Hirose F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1853-1856Google Scholar), and HERF1 (19Harada H. Harada Y. O'Brien D.P. Rice D.S. Naeve C.W. Downing J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3808-3815Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The MAIR protein shows 24–29% identity and 40–47% similarity to these RBCC proteins. Among these proteins, Xnf7 has a cytoplasmic retention domain that controls its subcellular localization and that precedes the RING finger domain (6Li X. Shou W. Kloc M. Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 7-17Google Scholar). The open reading frame of MAIR cDNA is preceded by a 19-bp upstream sequence, although we were unable to identify an in-frame and upstream stop codon (Fig. 1A). However, analysis of 5′-RACE products suggested that the cDNA has no missing 5′-end (data not shown). That the designated ATG codon is the true translated initiation codon is supported by its context within a Kozak consensus sequence (39Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar) and alignment of the MAIR protein with SS-A/Ro, RFP, acid finger protein, and HERF1 (Fig. 1B). After our cloning, a cDNA sequence of the putative human homolog of MAIR was submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KIAA1098, accession no. AB029021) as a new cDNA clone (40Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Google Scholar). These molecules are 78% identical and 85% similar at the amino acid level (Fig. 1B). Tissue Distribution and M-CSF-induced Expression of MAIR—Northern analysis showed that the MAIR mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the mouse tissues examined (Fig. 1C). The mRNA was 3.4–3.6 kb, suggesting that our clone (3.4 kb) was a nearly full-length cDNA. It was relatively highly expressed in the brain, lung, spleen, thymus, heart, and muscle (Fig. 1C). According to the HUGE Database provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, 3Available at www.kazusa.or.jp/huge. the human homolog (KIAA1098) is relatively highly expressed in the brain, liver, spleen, ovary, testis, and heart. MAIR cDNA was originally isolated from M-CSF-stimulated macrophages, but there was a relatively low level of MAIR expression in bone marrow cells. We therefore certified MAIR expression in primary macrophages and several macrophage cell lines. Bone marrow macrophages expressed the MAIR transcript at a level detectable by Northern blotting (Fig. 1D). Of note, MAIR expression decreased after M-CSF starvation, and M-CSF stimulation resulted in an increase in MAIR expression with a peak at 1.5 h (Fig. 1D). We also observed M-CSF-elevated MAIR expression in the M-CSF-dependent cell line M-NFS-60 and in the M-CSF-responsive macrophage cell line J774A.1 (data not shown). Transient MAIR Expression Promotes Cell Death—To analyze the function of MAIR, we initially attempted to express HA-tagged MAIR in mouse NIH3T3 cells. When we transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells with the HA-tagged MAIR expression vector, we could easily detect the HA-tagged protein by immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody as a band with a molecular mass of 55 kDa (data not shown). However, none of the G418-resistant stable clones showed a detectable level of HA-tagged MAIR protein (data not shown). To investigate the fate of MAIR-transfected cells and the subcellular localization of MAIR, we transiently expressed MAIR as a GFP fusion protein in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of putative nuclear localization signals (Fig. 1A), fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed a granular distribution of GFP-MAIR predominantly in the cytoplasm at 12 h post-transfection (Fig. 2A, panel a). The fact that MAIR localized in the cytoplasm was confirmed using HeLa cells (data not shown). Confocal microscopic examination showed partial colocalization of MAIR with mitochondria (Fig. 2B). At 24 h post-transfection, GFP-MAIR-expressing NIH3T3 cells shrunk and began to detach from the dish (Fig. 1A, panel b). Some cells appeared to be fragmented (Fig. 1A, panel b, arrowheads). Consistent with the results, flow cytometric analysis showed that propidium iodide-positive dead cells increased in number 72 h after transfection of GFP-MAIR compared with mock transfection (Fig. 2C). Zinc-inducible Expression of MAIR in GM-CSF-dependent TF-1 Cells—To demonstrate more clearly that the expression of MAIR promotes cell death, we transfected TF-1 cells with a zinc-inducible pMEP4-HA-MAIR construct, in which a metallothionein promoter directs MAIR expression. TF-1 cells are leukemic cells of human origin whose proliferation is dependent on the presence of GM-CSF (30Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Google Scholar). Three independent clones (clones 18, 19, and 24) that expressed HA-tagged MAIR after zinc treatment were established (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the addition of 75 or 100 μm ZnCl2 to the culture medium induced cell death in the three clones, whereas the treatment did not affect the viability of mock-transfected TF-1 cells. Among MAIR transfectants, clone 24, which expressed more HA-tagged MAIR compared with clones 18 and 19 (Fig. 3A), showed markedly reduced viability after zinc treatment (Fig. 3B). Phase-contrast microscopic examination revealed the presence of particles of fragmented TF-1-HA-MAIR cells after zinc induction (Fig. 3C). Next, we made a pMEP4-GFP-MAIR construct, in which GFP fused to the N terminus of MAIR could be monitored by flow cytometry, and introduced the construct into TF-1 cells. GFP-MAIR was dose-dependently expressed after exposure to ZnCl2 in a stable transfectant (clone 12) (Fig. 4A). A low but detectable level of MAIR expression could be found even if the cells were not treated with ZnCl2 (Fig. 4A, upper panel). ZnCl2 addition to the medium induced cell death in the transfectants (clones 12 and 25) (Fig. 4B), as shown in experiments in which HA-tagged MAIR was expressed (Fig. 3B). Using this clone (clone 12), we analyzed the time course relationship between the expression of MAIR and ΔΨm. GFP-MAIR expression (fluorescent intensity of GFP) could be detected within 2 h after zinc treatment (Fig. 5A, lower panels). The amount of MAIR increased until 8 h. The increase in the side scatter could be detected at 4 h, which was followed by a decrease in the forward scatter (Fig. 5A, upper panels). This change is consistent with certain characteristics of early apoptosis (41Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Google Scholar). Simultaneously, the uptake of MitoTracker CMX-Ros, which indicates mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased in response to zinc treatment (Fig. 5A, lower panels). Dye exclusion was conserved at 12 h, but membrane-damaged cells increased over 24 h (data not shown). We then analyzed the DNA content of TF-1 cells expressing GFP-MAIR by flow cytometry after culturing for 24 h in the presence of zinc. A large proportion of TF-1-GFP-MAIR cells (67%) contained degraded DNA, a characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 5B). There was no increase in hypodiploid DNA in the control cell line and untreated TF-1-GFP-MAIR cells (Fig. 5B). These features in inducible MAIR overexpression suggested that the cell death observed was apoptosis. The emerging view of apoptosis is that this complex biochemical event is carried out by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (42Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar). To address the role of caspases, we used several kinds of caspase inhibitors. The addition of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, but not Z-VAD-fmk, completely prevented a reduction in MitoTracker CMX-Ros in TF-1-GFP-MAIR cells (Fig. 6A). However, the percentage of membrane-damaged cells with Z-Asp-CH2-DCB was not greater than that without inhibitors even after 24 h of ZnCl2 induction (data not shown). These observations suggest that the inhibitor Z-Asp-CH2-DCB did not induce necrotic cell death in addition to preventing apoptotic cell death. The specific inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO (for caspase-1 and -4), Ac-DEVD-CHO (for caspase-3 and -7), Ac-IETD-CHO (for caspase-8 and -6), and Ac-LEHD-CHO (for caspase-9) could not effectively impede the decrease in ΔΨm when used alone (data not shown). We then performed immunoblot analysis for caspases to detect their activation. When TF-1-GFP-MAIR cells were treated with zinc (Fig. 6B), it was obvious that caspase-7, -8, and -9 were cleaved, whereas no processing of caspase-2 or -3 was observed (Fig. 6B) (data not shown for caspase-2). Caspase-9 is activated by binding to Apaf1 in the presence of cytochrome c released from the mitochondria (43Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Google Scholar). Consistent with the decrease in ΔΨm as mentioned above, this pattern of caspase activation suggests that the mitochondria are involved in MAIR-induced apoptosis. We also detected a cleaved form of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a substrate of executioner caspases (Fig. 6B). The RING Finger and Coiled-coil Domains Are Important for the Apoptosis-inducing Activity of MAIR—To examine which domain of MAIR is responsible for its apoptosis-inducing activity, we generated a series of MAIR truncation mutants (Fig. 7A), performed transient transfections into NIH3T3 cells, and screened for cell death by determining the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 7B). The expression of the mutant with the B-box domain deleted (ΔBB) or with the B30.2 domain deleted (ΔB30.2) was comparable to that of the wild type (Fig. 7B, left panels). However, for unknown reasons, the expression of the mutant with the RING finger domain deleted (ΔRF) or with the C-terminal region containing the coiled-coil and B30.2 domains deleted (ΔCC-B30.2) was somewhat higher than that of the wild type (Fig. 7B, left panels). The B30.2 domain-deleted and B-box-deleted mutants induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential at a comparable level to the wild type (Fig. 7B, right panels). Thus, these domains might not be involved in the apoptosis-inducing function of MAIR. In contrast, the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential by the RING finger domain-deleted MAIR mutant or the mutant in which the C-terminal region containing the coiled-coil and B30.2 domains was deleted was less severe than that of the wild type (Fig. 7B, right panels), despite the higher expression of these mutants in transfected cells (see left panels). These data indicate that the RING finger and coiled-coil domains are required for the apoptosis-inducing activity of MAIR. Finally, we investigated how the difference in the apoptotic activity of the mutants corresponds to their subcellular localization (Fig. 7C). The B-box-deleted (ΔBB panel) and B30.2 domain-deleted (ΔB30.2 panel) mutants showed a similar cellular distribution to the wild type (MAIR panel). In contrast, the less potent mutants, i.e. the RING finger domain-deleted MAIR mutant (ΔRF panel) and the mutant in which the C-terminal region containing the coiled-coil domain was deleted (ΔCC-B30.2 panel), showed a distinct distribution pattern from the wild type. The RING finger domain-deleted mutant showed a filamentous appearance in the cytoplasm, and the C-terminal region-deleted mutant spread throughout the cytoplasm. Thus, the change in"

Bypass of many of these impediments is facilitated by elongation factor TFIIS through a mechanism that involves cleavage of the nascent transcript by the RNA polymerase II/TFIIS elongation complex. Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The “intrinsic” cleavage activity is greatly stimulated at mildly basic pH and requires divalent cations. Both arrested and stalled complexes can carry out the intrinsic cleavage reaction, although not all stalled complexes are equally efficient at this reaction. Arrested complexes in which the nascent transcript was cleaved in the absence of TFIIS were reactivated to readthrough blocks to elongation. Thus, cleavage of the nascent transcript is sufficient for reactivating some arrested complexes. Small RNA products released following transcript cleavage in stalled ternary complexes differ depending upon whether the cleavage has been induced by TFIIS or has occurred in mildly alkaline conditions. In contrast, both intrinsic and TFIIS-induced small RNA cleavage products are very similar when produced from an arrested ternary complex. Although α-amanitin interferes with the transcript cleavage stimulated by TFIIS, it has little effect on the intrinsic cleavage reaction. A mutant RNA polymerase previously shown to be refractory to TFIIS-induced transcript cleavage is essentially identical to the wild type polymerase in all tested aspects of intrinsic cleavage.

A mutant RNA polymerase previously shown to be refractory to TFIIS-induced transcript cleavage is essentially identical to the wild type polymerase in all tested aspects of intrinsic cleavage. Gene expression can be controlled by regulating any step of the transcription cycle: promoter binding, initiation, promoter escape, elongation, or termination. After transcript synthesis begins, the ability to suppress or complete the synthesis of an RNA transcript is vital to the cell, and a substantial and growing number of genes have been reported to be regulated during transcript elongation (1Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Google Scholar). The ternary elongation complex consists of the RNA polymerase, the template DNA, and the nascent RNA transcript. Surratt et al. (2Surratt C.K. Milan S.C. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7983-7987Google Scholar) discovered that bacterial RNA polymerase ternary complexes have a mechanism for transcript shortening, endonucleolytic cleavage near the 3′-end of the transcript. After transcript cleavage, the 3′-fragment is released while the 5′-fragment is retained in an active ternary complex.

Cell. 1994; 77: 217-224Google Scholar). Remarkably, transcription accurately resumes from the site of transcript cleavage to re-synthesize the excised RNA. Transcript cleavage activity is conserved in many DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, including bacterial RNA polymerases, vaccinia virus RNA polymerase (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Google Scholar), RNA polymerase I (8Kuhn A. Bartsch I. Grummt I. Nature. 1990; 344: 559-562Google Scholar, 9Schnapp G. Graveley B.R. Grummt I. Mol. Gen.

Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Google Scholar). Accessory factors that stimulate transcript cleavage in ternary complexes have been identified in both prokaryotes (GreA and GreB) and eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 3Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. 3. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 9Schnapp G. Graveley B.R. Grummt I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 412-419Google Scholar, 16Fish R.N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9055-9061Google Scholar). A subunit of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase, rpo30, is 25% similar to one such elongation factor, TFIIS (19Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Jones E.V. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5433-5441Google Scholar), and this vaccinia subunit is thought to affect the transcript cleavage reaction of the vaccinia polymerase. Several observations suggest that the catalytic site for this transcript hydrolysis resides within the polymerase. First, RNA polymerase III complexes catalyze transcript cleavage, but a separate cleavage-stimulating factor has not been reported for RNA polymerase III. Second, ternary complexes of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase purified from a greA–greB– strain retain a low level of transcript cleavage activity (20Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Google Scholar), an activity stimulated by basic pH. Third, mammalian RNA polymerase II pyrophosphorylizes its transcript to give products identical to those induced by treatment with TFIIS (21Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Google Scholar). However, how TFIIS or the prokaryotic Gre factors stimulate this intrinsic cleavage remains unknown. For yeast RNA polymerase II (RPII), the Rpb9p subunit has been shown to mediate the signal between TFIIS and the polymerase catalytic center for stimulating transcript cleavage (22Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Google Scholar). Arrested ternary complexes formed with yeast RNA polymerase II lacking Rpb9 (RPIIΔ9) are much less responsive to TFIIS, and yet they can carry out the intrinsic cleavage reaction. These results led us to characterize the transcript cleavage reaction of RPII in more detail, particularly to compare the intrinsic cleavage in stalled and arrested complexes. Furthermore, we compared the wild type and the RPIIΔ9 polymerases in their intrinsic cleavage properties. The analysis of intrinsic transcript cleavage activity in several discrete elongation complexes suggests extensive structural and/or functional heterogeneity during transcript elongation. The results provide insights for how TFIIS might influence the properties of an elongation complex, aside from accelerating transcript cleavage.

A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Google Scholar, 25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar), except that 10 μm ZnCl2 was included in all buffers. The polymerase preparations were stored at –80 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm DTT, 100 mm EDTA, and 10 μm ZnCl2. Recombinant yeast TFIIS was purified as previously described (25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar). Plasmid pRW102 was constructed by inserting the “AGC cassette” from pGR220 (26Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Google Scholar) isolated on a SacI-KpnI fragment into the same sites of pTK242A:Δ8 (27Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Google Scholar), respectively. This plasmid pRW102 has two SmaI sites. The pRW102 plasmid was digested completely with SmaI and re-recircularized, generating pRW104 with a single SmaI site. Plasmid pRW106 was constructed by digesting pRW104 with NsiI, treating with T4 DNA polymerase to trim the overhangs, then digesting with HindIII to isolate the T1a-containing insert. This fragment was inserted into the HincII and HindIII sites of pN2Δ17. pN2Δ17 is a derivative of pN2 (28Lorch Y. LaPointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1987; 49: 203-210Google Scholar) in which 17 bp were deleted by digesting with EcoRI and BamHI, treating these ends with Klenow, and finally re-ligation. Transcription templates from pRW106 were generated by digestion with SmaI, then 3′-deoxycytidine extensions were added with terminal nucleotidyl transferase (29Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Google Scholar). Templates constructed with such 3′ tails are referred to as pCpRW106 templates. For 3′-biotinylated templates, unincorporated dCTP was removed by using two consecutive Biospin-30 columns (blocked with 20 μg/ml tRNA), followed by incorporation of biotin-14-dCTP with terminal nucleotidyl transferase. Unincorporated biotin-14-dCTP was again removed by centrifugal gel filtration. Finally, pCpRW106 templates were restricted with NdeI and EcoRI to generate a run-off transcript and to disable transcription from the undesired end of the template. The pCpGEMTERM template preparation was as described previously (14Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar); this template harbors a series of arrest sites in the first intron of the human histone H3.3 gene (30Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar). All transcription reactions were initiated using standard transcription buffer (70 mm Tris-OAc, pH 8, 60 mm NH4OAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Alkaline intrinsic transcript cleavage buffer contained 70 mm CAPS, pH 9.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. Manganese intrinsic transcript cleavage buffer contained 70 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. Control transcript cleavage buffer contained 70 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT. 2× SDS/urea stop mix contained 10 m urea, 0.5% SDS, 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol. 1× TBE gel buffer contained 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8, and 25 mm EDTA. The 135-, 138-, 143-, 152-, and 158-nt transcripts formed on pCpRW106 were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide (38% acrylamide:2% bisacrylamide) gels containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE. The T1a (∼200 nt), C1, and C2 transcripts (25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar) formed on pCpGEMTERM were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide (38% acrylamide:2% bisacrylamide) gels containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE. RNA oligomers released during transcript cleavage were resolved on either 15% (38% acrylamide:2% bisacrylamide) or 23% (40% acrylamide:6% bisacrylamide) gels containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE. Biotinylated DNA templates (prepared as described above) were coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic Dynabeads prior to transcription. 5 pmol of biotinylated DNA template was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, and 25 μg/ml BSA-OAc in a volume of 25 μl. Then, 25 μg of streptavidin-coated magnetic Dynabeads was added to the solution, and incubation proceeded for 30–60 min at room temperature with slow rotation. The Dynabead-conjugated DNA templates were collected by magnetic precipitation (45 s), washed twice with 50 μl of a high salt solution (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 25 μg/ml BSA-OAc), washed twice with 50 μl of a low salt solution (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 20 mm NaCl, 25 μg/ml BSA-OAc), and washed twice with 50 μl of 1× transcription buffer. G135 ternary complexes were formed by incubating 1 pmol of RNA polymerase II with 5 pmol of Dynabead-conjugated pCpRW106 in 1× transcription buffer containing 1 μm [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 800 μm GTP and ATP, and 1 unit of InhibitAce, in a final volume of 25 μl for 1.5 min at 30 °C. At this time, ternary complexes containing short transcripts (∼13 nucleotides) predominate (data not shown). After this 5′-end-labeling step, 175 μl of 1× yeast transcription buffer containing 100 μm CTP and 0.1 mg/ml heparin was added, and incubation continued for 1.5 min at 30 °C. Acetylated BSA at 25 μg/ml was included in all transcription buffers to inhibit the nonspecific adsorption of streptavidin to the microcentrifuge tubes. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by collecting the ternary complexes via magnetic precipitation and washing three times with 50 μl of transcription buffer. G135 ternary complexes were “walked” to form U138 ternary complexes by addition of transcription buffer containing 10 μm UTP followed by incubation for 3 min at 30 °C. U138 ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated UTP by magnetic precipitation, and two washes with 50 μl of transcription buffer. U138 ternary complexes were walked to form G143 ternary complexes by addition of transcription buffer containing 10 μm CTP and GTP followed by incubation for 3 min at 30 °C. G143 ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs by magnetic precipitation and two washes with 50 μl of transcription buffer. G143 ternary complexes were walked to form G152 ternary complexes by addition of transcription buffer containing 10 μm ATP and GTP followed by incubation for 3 min at 30 °C. G152 ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs by magnetic precipitation and two washes with 50 μl of transcription buffer. These were walked to C158 upon addition of 10 μm CTP and ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Ternary complexes halted on pCpGEMTERM, containing the T1a block to elongation (31Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar), were formed by incubating 1 pmol of RNA polymerase II with 5 pmol of Dynabead-conjugated pCpGEMTERM in 1× transcription buffer containing 1 unit of InhibitAce, 1 μm [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 800 μm UTP, GTP, and ATP, in a volume of 25 μl for 1.5 min at 30 °C. After the addition of CTP to 100 μm, heparin to 0.1 mg/ml, and BSA-OAc to 25 μg/ml, reactions were incubated for 1.5 min at 30 °C to generate ternary complexes halted at T1a, T1b, and TII. Ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs by magnetic precipitation and three washes with 50 μl of transcription buffer. 3′-End-labeled U138 Complexes—Unlabeled G135 complexes were formed on immobilized pCpRW106 as described above with the exception that unlabeled CTP was substituted for [α-32P]CTP. The unlabeled G135 complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs by magnetic precipitation and washed three times with 50 μl of 1× standard transcription buffer. 3′-End-labeled U138 complexes were generated by addition of 3 μm [α-32P]UTP for 5 min at 30 °C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed as above. 3′-End-labeled T1a Complexes—Unlabeled T1a complexes were formed on immobilized pCpGEMTERM as described above with the exception that unlabeled CTP was substituted for [α-32P]CTP. The unlabeled T1a complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs by magnetic precipitation and washed three times with 50 μl of 1× standard transcription buffer. 1 nm TFIIS and 25 μm GTP and CTP in 1× standard transcription buffer were added to the unlabeled elongation complex, and incubation was continued for 5 min at room temperature to stimulate limited transcript cleavage in T1a-arrested elongation complexes. TFIIS and unincorporated NTPs were removed by three washes with 50 μl of transcription buffer. 3′-End-labeled T1a complexes were generated by addition of 3 μm [α-32P]UTP in 1× standard transcription buffer and incubating at 30 °C for 10 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed as above. Ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated NTPs either by centrifugal gel filtration with Biospin-30 columns or through use of magnetic precipitation, as indicated in the figure legends. The method of ternary complex purification did not qualitatively influence results. However, all transcript-shortening reactions were more efficient when magnetic precipitation was used to isolate the ternary complexes (i.e. the overall level of transcript cleavage by T1a or U138 complexes was greater). Transcript shortening induced by TFIIS, pyrophosphate, or manganese, was performed in 70 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (or MnCl2), 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Alkaline-stimulated transcript shortening was performed in 70 mm CAPS, K+ (pH 9.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were incubated for the times indicated in the figures or figure legends. Transcript Cleavage in Arrested Complexes—Purified RNA polymerase II stops and arrests in vitro at several sites within the human histone H3.3 first intron (T1a, T1b, and TII (30Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar)). The strongest block, T1a, has frequently been used to study the elongation properties of RNA polymerase II from yeast and mammalian cells (27Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Google Scholar, 31Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar, 32SivaRaman L. Reines D. Kane C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of yeast or mammalian RNA polymerase II elongation complexes stop within the first tract of nontemplate thymidines at the T1a site (14Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 27Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Google Scholar, 35Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15375-15380Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) and do not efficiently resume elongation in the absence of elongation factor TFIIS. Thus, they are “arrested” (16Fish R.N. Kane C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 287-307Google Scholar, 36Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 419-436Google Scholar) at the T1a site. RNA polymerase II arrested at T1a requires a transcript cleavage event, stimulated by TFIIS, to promote readthrough of the elongation block (37Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Google Scholar). Thus the T1a site has been used to investigate the mechanism of transcription arrest as well as the relief of arrest in the presence of TFIIS. Biochemical Properties of the Intrinsic Cleavage Reaction— The addition of TFIIS to yeast RNA polymerase II elongation complexes arrested at T1a in the absence of NTPs generates a characteristic pattern of shortened transcripts (Fig. 2, lane 7) (see also Ref. 25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar). Two major cleavage products, C1 and C2, remain associated with active ternary complexes; the C1 cleavage product is generated prior to C2 (25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar). A low but detectable level of these cleaved transcripts was observed in the absence of TFIIS (Fig. 2, lane 2). This transcript cleavage intrinsic to RNA polymerase II was accelerated in mildly alkaline solutions (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4), as has been seen with E. coli RNA polymerase (20Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Google Scholar). Like the TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage, this intrinsic transcript cleavage yielded shortened transcripts associated with active ternary complexes that resumed elongation upon the addition of NTPs (Fig. 2, lane 5). Intrinsic Cleavage Requires Metal Cofactors—The intrinsic cleavage reaction was dependent on the addition of a divalent cation (Fig. 3). A survey of divalent cations revealed that 0.5 mm Mn2+ or Co2+ (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) facilitated substantially higher levels of intrinsic transcript cleavage than did Mg2+ (Fig. 3, lane 2) at pH 8. Concomitant addition of 5 mm MgCl2 did not reduce the level of intrinsic transcript cleavage supported by 0.5 mm MnCl2 or CoCl2 (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8). Shortened transcripts were elongated upon the addition of NTPs and thus were associated with active ternary complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 9). Other divalent cations such as Zn2+ and Ca2+ did not support TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage or intrinsic transcript cleavage at pH 8 (data not shown). The effects of monovalent anions (Cl– and OAc–) and cations (K+, Na+, and NH4+) on the rate of intrinsic transcript cleavage also were examined. In contrast to the pronounced stimulation of transcript cleavage by mild alkaline or certain divalent cations, the overall effects of salts (100 mm) were generally subtle and did not resolve into cation-specific or anion-specific effects. However, 100 mm KCl was optimal for intrinsic transcript cleavage at pH 9.5 or with manganese at pH 8.0. Curiously, 100 mm NH4OAc was least effective in supporting intrinsic transcript cleavage (data not shown), despite the fact that ammonium is capable of stimulating the overall elongation reaction of RNA polymerase II (38Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Google Scholar, 39Chen Y. Chafin D. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5993-5999Google Scholar). Apparently, the stimulation of elongation by ammonium is not mediated by an increase in transcript cleavage at sites blocking elongation by RNA polymerase. The Effect of NTPs and Pyrophosphate on the Intrinsic Cleavage Reaction—The addition of NTPs stimulates the transcript cleavage activity of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase (7Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Google Scholar) and RNA polymerase III (15Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Google Scholar). Thus, we also tested whether the intrinsic cleavage reaction of yeast RNA polymerase II was stimulated by the addition of NTPs. In contrast to the results with the viral polymerase and RNA polymerase III, NTPs did not stimulate the intrinsic transcript cleavage activity (data not shown) of two different yeast RNA polymerase II elongation complexes halted at either T1a or U138 (Fig. 1B, and see below). The TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II ternary complexes also is not stimulated by NTPs (data not shown and Ref. 13Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Google Scholar). Pyrophosphate stimulates an endolytic event in an arrested complex containing mammalian RNA polymerase II (21Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Google Scholar). When yeast RNA polymerase II complexes arrested at the T1a site were treated with 2 mm pyrophosphate at pH 8, only a small number of shortened transcripts with mobility similar to C1 were observed (data not shown). Significantly higher levels of shortened transcript accumulated when the reaction was performed at pH 7 (Fig. 4, lane 1). The lack of stimulation under basic conditions is more consistent with a pyrophosphorolytic than a hydrolytic mechanism. Pyrophosphate-shortened transcripts were associated with active ternary complexes as evidenced by their ability to resume elongation upon addition of NTPs (Fig. 4, lane 2). However, these results suggest that pyrophosphorolysis does not account for the observed intrinsic cleavage activity. Intrinsic Cleavage Is Sufficient to Promote Readthrough— Transcript cleavage is a necessary prerequisite for reading through the T1a block to elongation (13Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Google Scholar, 33Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 37Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Google Scholar). However, some TFIIS mutants (25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar, 35Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15375-15380Google Scholar, 40Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Google Scholar) and at least one RNA polymerase II mutant (RPIIΔ9 (25Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar, 41Hemming S.A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2288-2294Google Scholar)) are able to stimulate the formation of cleavage products but not reactivate elongation complexes arrested at the T1a site. TFIIS is clearly necessary to stimulate the transcript cleavage reaction in elongation complexes containing RNA polymerase II at physiological pH, but the additional TFIIS-dependent step required for readthrough still is not clear. The ability to generate cleaved transcripts in the absence of TFIIS allowed us to assess the role of TFIIS in promoting transcript cleavage and in any additional step in the reactivation process. We also could determine if intrinsic cleavage itself could be sufficient to promote readthrough. RPII complexes stopped at T1a were purified from unincorporated NTPs and resuspended in buffers optimized for stimulating either intrinsic cleavage or TFIIS-stimulated cleavage. After transcript cleavage (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), the ternary complexes were washed and resuspended in standard transcription buffer containing 800 μm CTP, UTP, and GTP. This subset of nucleotide substrates permits active elongation complexes to move beyond the T1a site, generating readthrough products halted downstream of T1a where the next ATP substrate would be required. In four separate experiments, the level of readthrough products (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) generated in this assay was roughly the same, regardless of whether alkali, manganese, or TFIIS was used to stimulate transcript cleavage. These results indicate that intrinsic cleavage can be sufficient to promote readthrough for the T1a complex. Intrinsic Cleavage in Complexes Stalled by Withholding Nucleotides—Elongation complexes stopped at T1a represent naturally arrested ternary complexes that inefficiently resume elongation in the presence of optimal NTPs; the TFIIS cofactor is essential to rescue the complexes from ar"
https://openalex.org/W2129287962,"The colonic epithelium undergoes a continuous cycle of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. To characterize factors important for colonic homeostasis and its dysregulation, human fetal colonic epithelial cells were isolated and seeded on a collagen type I matrix with embedded colonic fibroblasts. The epithelial cells rapidly spread from clusters and proliferated, and within 3 days, a columnar layer of polarized epithelium surrounded the surface of the constricted collagen matrix. The polarized enterocytes developed brush borders, tight junctions and desmosomes, and goblet and enteroendocrine cells were present. A balance of growth and differentiation was maintained for several weeks in the presence of collagen-embedded fibroblasts and a complex mixture of growth factors. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was critical for proliferation of enterocytes and inhibited expression of the differentiation marker carbonic anhydrase II. In the presence of LIF, the relative number of goblet cells remained stable, whereas enteroendocrine relative cell number declined. LIF-stimulated epithelial cells remained dependent on the presence of fibroblasts in the matrix. In combination with stem cell factor and endothelin 3, LIF induced formation of disorganized structures of stratified and semi-stratified cells, suggesting that the homeostatic balance in the normal human colon requires cooperation with differentiation-inducing factors."

Here we report that, in cerebrocortical nerve terminals of adult rats, the inhibition of glutamate release is mediated by mGluR7.

However, mGluR7 selectively reduced the release component that is associated with N-type Ca2+ channels (29.9%). Inhibition of P/Q channels by mGluR7 is not masked by the higher efficiency of these channels in driving glutamate release when compared with N-type channels. Thus, activation of mGluR7 failed to reduce the release associated with P/Q channels when the extracellular calcium concentration, ([Ca2+]o), was reduced from 1.3 to 0.5 mm. Through Ca2+ imaging, we show that Ca2+ channels are distributed in a heterogeneous manner in individual nerve terminals. Indeed, in this preparation, nerve terminals were observed that contain N-type (31.1%; conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) or P/Q-type (64.3%; agatoxin IVA-sensitive) channels or that were insensitive to these two toxins (4.6%). Interestingly, the great majority of the responses to l-AP4 (95.4%) were observed in nerve terminals containing N-type channels. This specific co-localization of mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+-channels could explain the failure of the receptor to inhibit the P/Q channel-associated release component and also reveal the existence of specific targeting mechanisms to localize the two proteins in the same nerve terminal subset.

Through their coupling to Gi/o proteins, activation of these receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase (6Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of evoked glutamate release has primarily been associated with a reduction in the activity of the Ca2+ channels that govern the exocytotic process (7Trombley P.Q. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2043-2050Google Scholar, 8Sahara Y. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3041-3050Google Scholar, 9Takahashi T. Forsythe I.D. Tsujimoto T. Barnes-Davies M.

In cerebrocortical nerve terminals, the release of glutamate is predominantly controlled by P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, although a significant but less important contribution comes from N-type Ca2+ channels. However, we have recently found that the activation of mGluR7 only inhibits the N-type Ca2+ channel coupled release (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). A number of factors might influence the specific coupling between mGluR7 and the Ca2+ channels that control glutamate release. These include structural determinants in the mGluRs (13Perroy J. Gutierrez G.J. Coulon V.R. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Fagni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45800-45805Google Scholar), the G proteins (14García D.E. Li B. García-Ferreiro R.E. Hernández-Ochoa E.O. Yan K. Gautam N. Caterall W.A. Macki K. Hille B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9163-9170Google Scholar), or the Ca2+ channels (15Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 991-1003Google Scholar, 16Simen A.A. Lee C.C. Simen B.B. Bindokas V.P. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7587-7597Google Scholar) as well as the differential coupling of the Ca2+ channels to the release process (17Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar, 18Millán C. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 330: 29-32Google Scholar). An additional factor that should also be considered when contemplating the selective inhibition of the N-type Ca2+ channel by mGluR7 is that of the co-localization of the receptor and target Ca2+ channel at nerve terminals. In synapses of the central nervous system, the release of glutamate is supported by the P/Q- and N-types of Ca2+ channels (17Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar, 19Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Turner T.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 895-902Google Scholar, 20Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 675-688Google Scholar, 21Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar, 22Reid C.A. Clements J.D. Bekkers J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2738-2745Google Scholar). Thus, in view of the heterogeneous distribution of Ca2+ channels in these terminals that may express Ca2+ channels of the N-type, P/Q-type, or a combination of both types (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar, 22Reid C.A. Clements J.D. Bekkers J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2738-2745Google Scholar, 23Reuter H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 773-779Google Scholar), the specific co-expression of mGluR7 and N-type channels in the same nerve terminal is a distinct possibility. In this paper we have used Ca2+ imaging in single nerve terminals from the cerebral cortex of adult rats to analyze the effects of Ca2+ channel toxins that specifically inhibit the N- and P/Q-types of Ca2+ channels. As a result, we found that the nerve terminals in this preparation contain either P/Q-(64.3% agatoxin IVA-sensitive) or N-type Ca2+ channels (31.1% conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive) or Ca2+ channels resistant to both toxins (4.6%). Interestingly, the responses to mGluR7 activation with high concentrations of the agonist l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4) were almost exclusively found in terminals containing N-type Ca2+ channels (95.4%). The remaining responses (4.6%) were located in terminals that express P/Q-type channels. The highly specific distribution of mGluR7 in nerve terminals that express N-type Ca2+ channels explains the absence of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel modulation associated with mGluR7-mediated inhibition of glutamate release in this preparation. Furthermore, these results reveal the existence of specific targeting mechanisms that ensure that mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+ channels co-exist in the same subset of nerve terminals. Synaptosomal Preparation—The cerebral cortex was isolated from adult male Wistar rats (2–3 months), and the synaptosomes were purified on discontinuous Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradients as described previously (24Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J.E. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Google Scholar, 25Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Google Scholar). Following the last centrifugation step at 22,000 × g for 10 min, the synaptosomes were resuspended in 8 ml of HEPES buffer medium (HBM; 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and the protein content was determined by the Biuret method. Finally, 1 mg of the synaptosomal suspension was diluted in 8 ml of HBM and spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the synaptosomes was stored on ice. Under these conditions, the synaptosomes remain fully viable for at least 4–6 h as judged by the extent of KCl- and 4-aminopyridine (4AP)-evoked glutamate release. Glutamate Release—Glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorometry. Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in HBM (0.67 mg/ml) and preincubated at 37 °Cfor1hinthe presence of 16 μm bovine serum albumin that served to bind any free fatty acids released from synaptosomes during the preincubation. A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette, and the release of glutamate was measured as described previously (26Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent release was calculated by subtracting the release obtained during a 5-min period of depolarization at 200 nm free [Ca2+] from the release at 1.33 mm CaCl2. Ca2+Imaging Showing Ca2+Responses in Single Synaptosomes— Synaptosomes in HBM (2 mg/ml) with 16 μm bovine serum albumin were preincubated with 5 μm fura-2 AM and 1.33 mm CaCl2 for 40 min. The synaptosomal suspension was attached to a polylysine-coated coverslip for another hour. Synaptosomes were illuminated alternately at 340 and 380 nm for 0.8 s through a 100× objective with the aid of a monochromator (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Brombrough, UK), and the fluorescence emitted from the nerve terminals was collected through a band-pass filter centered at 510 nm. The video images were obtained using a slow scan CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4880) operating at 12-bit digitalization (4096 levels), and the output from the camera was stored by the computerized imaging system Lucida 3.0 (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.). Ca2+ images were analyzed as described previously (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar, 12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). For [Ca2+]cyt measurements, synaptosomes were stimulated by 10-s pulses (indicated in each graph by a bar) of 30 mm KCl or 1 mm 4AP in the absence and presence of pharmacological agonists or Ca2+ channel toxins. Antibody Controls—The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against mGluR7a and the affinity-purified guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against mGluR4a, mGluR7a, and mGluR8a used here have been described elsewhere (27Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor J.P. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody is commercially available (Sigma), and the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2) were obtained from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). The rabbit anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD-65) polyclonal antisera were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The rabbit anti-α1B (Cav2.2, N-type) and anti-α1A (Cav2.1, P/Q-type) subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels were from (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). As control for the immunochemical reactions, primary antibodies were omitted from the staining procedure, whereupon no immunoreactivity resembling that obtained using the specific antibodies was detected. Immunohistochemical Procedures—The synaptosomes were allowed to attach to polylysine-coated coverslips for an hour and then fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Following several washes with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the synaptosomes were pre-incubated in 10% normal goat serum diluted in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl (TBS) with 0.2% Triton X-100, for 1 h. They were then incubated for 24 h with the appropriate primary antisera diluted in TBS with 1% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 as follows: mGluR7a (1 μg/ml); mGluR4a (1 μg/ml); mGluR8a (1 μg/ml); VGLUT1 (1:1000); VGLUT2 (1:1000); GAD-65 (1:1000); synaptophysin (1:1000); α 1B (Cav2.2, N-type) (1:200); and α 1A (Cav 2.1, P/Q-type) (1:200). After washing in TBS, the synaptosomes were incubated for2hina goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to the cyanine-derived fluorochrome Cy2, a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to the cyanine-derived fluorochrome Cy3, a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy3, or a donkey anti-guinea pig antibody coupled to fluorescein. The secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in TBS (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). After several washes in TBS, the coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount (Serva, Germany) and the synaptosomes were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 100× objective, a mercury lamp light source, and fluorescein-rhodamine Nikon filter sets. Chemicals—ω-Conotoxin-GVIA (ω-CgT-GVIA) and ω-agatoxin-IVA (ω-Aga-IVA) were supplied by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). l-AP4 was from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). Fura-AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NADP+, glutamate dehydrogenase, and all other reagents were from Sigma. The Actions of l-AP4 in Cerebrocortical Nerve Terminals from Adult Rats Are Mediated by mGluR7—We have reported previously that the preparation of cerebrocortical nerve terminals from young rats is highly enriched in markers of glutamatergic terminals such as VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). To determine whether a change in neurotransmitter content occurs with development, we have also characterized the preparation of nerve terminals from adult rats. Thus, in this preparation, immunochemistry was performed with antisera against VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 to label glutamatergic terminals against GAD-65, used as a marker of the GABAergic terminals, and against the vesicular protein synaptophysin. Among the particles that contained synaptophysin (2,405 particles from eight fields), 59.5 ± 4.5% and 20.3 ± 2.4% (mean ± S.E.; n = 8) were immunoreactive for VGLUT1 (Fig. 1, A–C) and VGLUT2 (Fig. 1, D–F), respectively. In this preparation, the GABAergic terminals amounted to 23.8 ± 2.0% (n = 7) (Fig. 1, G–I). Therefore, it appears that, in a similar manner to the preparation from young rats, ∼80% of the nerve terminals of the cerebrocortical preparation from adult rats are glutamatergic. We demonstrated previously that the cerebrocortical nerve terminals from adult rats express mGluR7 (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). To establish whether other l-AP4-sensitive mGluRs are also present in this preparation, nerve terminals were double-labeled with antisera against synaptophysin and the l-AP4 sensitive mGluRs (subtypes 4, 7, and 8) expressed in the brain. Among the particles that contained synaptophysin (1,312 particles from eight fields), 29.1 ± 3.5% were immunopositive to mGluR7a (mean ± S.E.; Fig. 2, A–C), whereas only 1.2 ± 0.6% (2,017 particles from 10 fields) and 1.7 ± 0.6% (1,229 particles from 10 fields) were immunoreactive for mGluR4a and mGluR8a, respectively (Fig. 2, D–I). These data indicate that the responses to l-AP4 in the preparation of cerebrocortical nerve terminals from adult rats are almost exclusively mediated by mGluR7. l-AP4 Only Inhibits the N-type Ca2+Channel-coupled Release Component in Adult Rats—The Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate from isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) can be evoked by the addition of the K+-channel blocker 4AP, which induces tetrodotoxin-sensitive depolarizations (28Tibbs G.R. Barrie A.P. Van-Mieghem F.J.E. McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1693-1699Google Scholar). In the adult rat preparation of cerebrocortical nerve terminals, this release was inhibited by high concentrations of the group III mGluR agonist l-AP4 through the activation of mGluR7 (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). Because this inhibition of release is the result of a reduced influx of Ca2+ into the nerve terminals (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar), we sought to determine which type of Ca2+ channel was being inhibited by the receptor. To this end, glutamate release was measured in the presence of toxins that specifically inhibited the different Ca2+ channel types. The Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate after 5 min of depolarization with 4-aminopyridine was 3.90 ± 0.14 nmol of glutamate/mg (±S.E.; n = 5). Blocking N-type Ca2+ channels with ω-CgT-GVIA and P/Q type Ca2+ channels with ω-Aga-IVA reduced this release to 2.73 ± 0.15 (n = 4) and 1.06 ± 0.21 (n = 4) nmol/mg, respectively (Fig. 3A). In the absence of toxins, l-AP4 reduced the release to 2.93 ± 0.10 (n = 5) nmol/mg. The presence of this mGluR agonist did not further reduce the release when co-applied with ω-CgT-GVIA (2.65 ± 0.11, n = 4, nmol/mg). However, in the presence of ω-Aga-IVA, l-AP4 produced an additional decrease in glutamate release to 0.33 ± 0.15 nmol/mg (n = 4, Fig. 3B), indicating that the mGluR agonist only acted upon the component of glutamate release coupled to N-type Ca2+ channels. Thus, l-AP4 and ω-CgT-GVIA inhibited release to a similar extent as did the two Ca2+ channel toxins added together (Fig. 3B). l-AP4 Does Not Inhibit the P/Q-type Ca2+Channel-coupled Release Component Even at Low [Ca2+]o—In other preparations, it has been shown that l-AP4-sensitive mGluRs can inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ currents (9Takahashi T. Forsythe I.D. Tsujimoto T. Barnes-Davies M. Onodera K. Science. 1996; 274: 594-597Google Scholar, 29Perroy J. Prezeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). Thus, it seems unlikely that the failure of l-AP4 to inhibit the P/Q-type channel-coupled release is due to the inability of the receptor to modulate this type of Ca2+ channel. Alternatively, it is possible that the inhibition of P/Q channel-coupled release is being masked by the high efficiency with which P/Q channels drive glutamate release (17Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar, 18Millán C. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 330: 29-32Google Scholar). If this were the case, although depressed, the Ca2+ current at the release site controlled by P/Q channels would still be sufficient to support the release of the vesicular pool associated with this channel population. The existence of a differential coupling of release to P/Q- and N-type channels was revealed by the different sensitivity of the release components to changes in the extracellular concentration of Ca2+, [Ca2+]o. Thus, Fig. 4 shows how the relative contribution of N-type channels to glutamate release is reduced by decreasing [Ca2+]o and that it is virtually abolished at 0.5 mm [Ca2+]o. Indeed, at such low [Ca2+]o, the release of glutamate is fully governed by P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. However, at 0.5 mm [Ca2+]o, the mGluR agonist l-AP4 failed to significantly reduce the release of glutamate (2.84 ± 0.16 and 2.78 ± 0.19 in the presence and absence of l-AP4, respectively; n = 3; Fig. 5, A and B). This suggests that the high efficiency coupling of P/Q channels to glutamate release is not responsible for the inability of l-AP4 to inhibit this release component.Fig. 5l-AP4 fails to reduce the release component associated to P/Q-type Ca2+ channels at low [Ca2+]o.A, the Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate evoked by 1 mm 4AP was determined in the absence (control) and presence of 1 mm l-AP4 at 0.5 mm [Ca2+]o. B, bar diagrams show the glutamate release after 5 min of depolarization with 1 mm 4AP in the presence and absence of 1 mm l-AP4. Results are means ± S.E. of three experiments obtained from the same number of synaptosomal preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nerve Terminals from the Cerebral Cortex of Adult Rats Contain Either N- or P/Q-type Ca2+Channels—The Ca2+ channels that control glutamate release are distributed heterogeneously in nerve terminals (17Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar, 21Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar, 22Reid C.A. Clements J.D. Bekkers J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2738-2745Google Scholar). These terminals may contain N-type, P/Q-type, or a combination of both types of Ca2+ channels (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). Thus, another possible explanation of the inability of l-AP4-sensitive mGluRs to modulate the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel is that these two proteins do not co-localize in the same nerve terminal. To determine whether or not this may be the case, we analyzed the Ca2+ images obtained from single terminals loaded with fura-2. In a typical field (as shown in Fig. 6A), individual particles were abundant, although clusters were also observed. The particles ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 μm in diameter and were typically circular, displaying strong fluorescence when loaded with fura-2 (Fig. 6A). A total of 1,060 fura-2-load particles that responded to 4AP and KCl from four fields similar to that shown in Fig. 6A were analyzed, and the basal [Ca2+]cyt was seen to be 110.4 ± 1.1 nm (n = 30). More than 95% of the fura-2-loaded particles responded to a 10-s application of 4AP at 1 mm or 30 mm KCl. The Ca2+ responses provoked by depolarization with 4AP and KCl were transient, ranging from 600 to 800 nm, but the responses to 4AP lasted far longer than those by KCl. In addition, the Ca2+ responses evoked by 4AP were completely abolished by the Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTx), whereas those induced by KCl were insensitive to TTx (Fig. 6B). The sensitivity of the 4AP-induced Ca2+ responses to TTx indicates the existence of Na+ channels that mediate repetitive firing in synaptosomes, consistent with data showing that the great majority of the particles obtained in the Percoll-purified synaptosomal preparation are nerve terminals (24Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J.E. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Google Scholar). To determine the type of Ca2+ channels involved in the Ca2+ responses in this preparation, the intensity of the fura-2 signals was determined in the presence of toxins that specifically block the different Ca2+ channel subtypes. For these experiments, ω-CgT-GVIA was used to block N-type channels, ω-Aga-IVA to block P/Q type channels, and both toxins together were also applied. A total of 3,803 nerve terminals from seven fields were analyzed. In a subpopulation of nerve terminals (31.1 ± 1.4%), the Ca2+ responses were largely reduced by ω-CgTGVIA but not ω-Aga-IVA (Fig. 7A), indicating that these nerve terminals contain N-type channels. In another subpopulation of nerve terminals (64.3 ± 2.4%), the Ca2+ responses were inhibited by ω-Aga-IVA but not ω-CgT-GVIA, indicating the presence of P/Q-type channels (Fig. 7B). Finally, a minor subpopulation of terminals (4.6 ± 1.3%) showed responses that were largely insensitive to both toxins (Fig. 7C). No Ca2+ responses mediated by a combination of N and P/Q channels were found in this preparation, in contrast to that reported in young rats where a large subpopulation of nerve terminals (42.6%) contained a mix of both types of Ca2+ channels (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). mGluRs with Low Affinity for l-AP4 Are Exclusively Located in Terminals That Express N-type Ca2+Channels—To determine which type of Ca2+ channels are expressed in the nerve terminals where l-AP4 reduces the Ca2+ response, we analyzed the effect of this mGluR agonist on fura-2-loaded particles in the presence of the Ca2+ channels toxins. A total of 4,323 fura-2-loaded particles obtained from six fields were analyzed. Interestingly, it was found that in the great majority of the nerve terminals (95.4 ± 1.0%) wherein a reduced Ca2+ response in the presence of l-AP4 was exhibited, the Ca2+ response was also blocked by ω-CgT-GVIA but not ω-Aga-IVA (Fig. 8A). Only in a minority of the nerve terminals that responded to l-AP4 (4.6 ± 0.6%) were the Ca2+ responses blocked by ω-Aga-IVA (Fig. 8B). To further assess the preferential localization of mGlu7 receptors in nerve terminals expressing N-type Ca2+ channels, nerve terminals were double-labeled with antisera against mGluR7 and the α1B (Cav2.2, N-type) and α1A (Cav2.1, P/Q-type) subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Among the nerve terminals immunopositive to mGluR7 (351 terminals from seven fields) 94.1 ± 1.5% also expressed N-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 9, A–C), whereas only 5.5 ± 0.8% expressed mGluR7 and the P/Q-type of Ca2+ channels (384 terminals from seven fields) (Fig. 9, D–F). These results indicate that mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+ channels coexist in the same nerve terminals, therefore providing an explanation for the absence of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel modulation by this receptor in glutamate release. By using Ca2+ imaging and immunocytochemistry in single nerve terminals from the cerebral cortex of adult rats, we have characterized the mGluRs that control the release of glutamate in this preparation and the Ca2+ channel subtypes modulated by these receptors. Here we show that, although the major component of Ca2+ influx and glutamate release is associated with P/Q-type channel activation, mGluR7 is selectively expressed in N-type Ca2+-channels containing nerve terminals wherein it inhibits the release component associated with these channels. Ca2+Channels in Nerve Terminals Change with Development—In nerve terminals from adult animals, the role that Ca2+ channels play in the control of Ca2+ entry matches that which they play in glutamate release, suggesting that most of the Ca2+ channels are coupled to the release process. Thus, N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels mediate Ca2+ entry in 31.1 ± 1.4 and 64.3 ± 2.4% of the nerve terminals, respectively, and these same Ca2+ channels support 29.9 ± 3.8 and 72.7 ± 5.4% of total glutamate release. These data are consistent with the predominant influence of P/Q channels in supporting glutamate release when compared with that of N-type Ca2+ channels in several regions from the brain (17Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar, 19Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Turner T.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 895-902Google Scholar). However, this parallel between the role of Ca2+ channels in Ca2+ influx and in glutamate release does not exist in young rats. In preparations from young rats, Ca2+ entry is controlled by N-type, P/Q-type, or both types of Ca2+ channels in 47.5, 3.9, and 42.6% of the nerve terminals, respectively (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). In contrast, in these terminals N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels support 33.6 ± 2.1 and 62.1 ± 2.5% of the total glutamate release, respectively (18Millán C. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 330: 29-32Google Scholar). These data indicate that, during development, there is an important redistribution of the Ca2+ channel subtypes in nerve terminals. The first developmental change we have observed is the disappearance in adult animals of the subpopulation of terminals with a mix of N and P/Q channels that is seen in young animals. The second developmental change is that, despite the prominent role of N-type channels in the control of Ca2+ entry in young rats, their contribution to glutamate release is similar to that found in adult animals. These last data are also consistent with observations from studies of synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons from the visual cortex wherein no changes are observed in the contribution of N-type channels to glutamate release during development (30Iwasaki S. Momiyama A. Uchitel O.D. Takahashi T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 59-65Google Scholar). Therefore, the general decline in the contribution of N-type channels to synaptic transmission during development observed at many synapses (30Iwasaki S. Momiyama A. Uchitel O.D. Takahashi T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 59-65Google Scholar, 31Scholtz K.P. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4612-4617Google Scholar) does not seem to apply to cortical synapses. Because Ca2+ imaging detects Ca2+ influx in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, the marked decline in the contribution of N channels to GABAergic neurotransmission during development (30Iwasaki S. Momiyama A. Uchitel O.D. Takahashi T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 59-65Google Scholar) may explain, at least in part, the differences in the role exerted by N-type channels on Ca2+ entry and glutamate release in young animals. Alternatively, the lack of parallelism between Ca2+ entry and glutamate release during early developmental stages may reflect the fact that some N-type Ca2+ channels are not coupled to glutamate release but rather to other processes such as cell migration (32Komuro H. Rakic P. Science. 1993; 260: 95-97Google Scholar) or synaptogenesis (33Vigers A.J. Pfenninger K H. Dev. Brain. Res. 1991; 60: 197-203Google Scholar). Interestingly, these same channels seem to be lost in mature animals. A similar developmental change has been observed in the Calyx of Held. In this study, synaptic transmission was supported by P/Q-, N- and R-type Ca2+ channels in young animals (34Wu L.-P. Westenbroek R.E. Borst J.G.G. Caterall W.A. Sakmann B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 726-736Google Scholar); however, the contribution of the Ca2+ channels that are less efficient in driving release (N- and R-type channels) was lost during development. Consequently, in older animals synaptic transmission was only supported by P/Q channels (30Iwasaki S. Momiyama A. Uchitel O.D. Takahashi T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 59-65Google Scholar). The Group III mGluRs That Control Glutamate Release Also Change with Development—In addition to the redistribution of Ca2+ channels in nerve terminals, developmental changes in the function of group III mGluRs also occurs. Thus, whereas the inhibition of glutamate release in cerebrocortical nerve terminals from young rats is mediated by mGluR4 and mGluR7, (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar), release inhibition in adult terminals is primarily mediated by the low affinity, l-AP4-sensitive mGluR7 (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). This is consistent with immunocytochemical studies wherein a restricted expression of mGluR4 in the cerebral cortex of adult animals has been described (35Corti C. Aldegheri L. Somogyi P. Ferraguti F. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 403-420Google Scholar). Moreover, functional studies in CA1 from the hippocampus have shown that the robust inhibition of synaptic transmission by low concentrations of l-AP4 found in young animals virtually disappears in adult animals (36Baskys A. Malenka R.C. J. Physiol. 1991; 444: 687-701Google Scholar). During development, a profound remodeling in presynaptic terminals occurs. This remodeling affects the population of nerve terminals co-expressing N and P/Q type channels and harboring the majority of the mGluR4 receptors (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar). In addition, mGluR7, which is largely distributed in N (70%) and in N and PQ termini (30%), becomes almost exclusively restricted to N termini (96%) in adult animals. Thus, the redistribution of Ca2+ channels in terminals together with developmental changes in group III mGluR expression may contribute to a remodeling of presynaptic modulation. Co-localization of mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+Channels—The glutamate receptor, mGluR7, has been shown to reduce the P/Q-type Ca2+ currents in cerebellar granule cells (29Perroy J. Prezeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Google Scholar). In cerebrocortical nerve terminals from young rats, mGluR7 also inhibits P/Q Ca2+ currents (12Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47796-47803Google Scholar) as well as the release component associated with these channels (18Millán C. Sánchez-Prieto J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 330: 29-32Google Scholar). However, activating mGluR7 failed to modulate the release coupled to P/Q channels in terminals from adult animals, because the receptor rarely (4%) co-localizes with this type of Ca2+ channel. In fact, mGluR7 was almost exclusively found in nerve terminals expressing N-type Ca2+ channels (96%), consistent with the ability of this receptor to reduce N-type Ca2+ currents and, consequently, the associated glutamate release (11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). The localization of mGluR7 in nerve terminals containing N-type Ca2+ channels does not seem to be the result of a random distribution of the receptor. Terminals with N-type Ca2+ channels represent only a minor subset of the nerve endings in the cerebrocortical preparation from adult rats. In fact, the majority of the terminals in this preparation contain P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, as seen both by imaging Ca2+ and the predominant role of these Ca2+ channels in the control of glutamate release (4Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Google Scholar, 11Millán C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar). The specific co-localization of mGluR7 and N-type channels therefore requires the existence of precise mechanisms of targeting to place both proteins in the same nerve terminal. The correct localization of synaptic proteins seems to be the result of a two-step process, i.e. an initial targeting to an axonal or somatodendritic domain based on intrinsic sorting signals followed by clustering at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites that depend on cell-to-cell contacts (37Craig A.M. Banker G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Google Scholar). In this context, molecular determinants involved in axonal targeting have been identified in the C-terminal of mGluR7 (38Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Google Scholar), which might explain the presynaptic location of mGluR7 seen in vivo (27Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor J.P. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar). However, additional mechanisms would be required to explain the nearly exclusive localization of mGluR7 in N-type Ca2+ channel-containing nerve terminals. The target cell also contributes to a specific expression of synaptic proteins. Thus, in the hippocampal CA1 region, pyramidal cell terminals presynaptic to mGluR1a-expressing interneurons have at least a 10-fold higher level of presynaptic mGluR7 than terminals making synapses with pyramidal cells and other types of interneurons (39Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Robert J.D.B. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogy P. Nature. 1996; 381: 523-525Google Scholar). Similarly, in hippocampal slices it has been found that a mGluR sensitive to l-AP4 reduces synaptic transmission only at nerve terminals contacting CA1 interneurons (40Scanziani M. Gahwiler B. Charpak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12004-12009Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the specific colocalization of mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+ channels is the result of the axonal distribution of mGluR7 (38Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Google Scholar) in conjunction with a target cell-mediated stabilization of the receptor in the subset of terminals bearing N-type Ca2+ channels. A similar mechanism of targeting seems to control the distribution of the N-type Ca2+ channel subunits at nerve terminals. Recently, it has been shown that the final distribution of presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures depends on neuronal contacts and synapse formation (41Maximov A. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6939-6952Google Scholar). Thus, in immature neurons the α1B-1 (Cav2.2a) splice variant of the N-type Ca2+ channel is diffusely distributed, but in mature neurons it is exclusively recruited to a presynaptic location by means of interactions with the modular adaptor proteins Mint1 and CASK in mature neurons (41Maximov A. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6939-6952Google Scholar). When analyzing the distribution of mGluR7 and Ca2+ channels within nerve terminals, we not only found that most mGluR7 (96%) is in terminals that contain N-type Ca2+ channels, but also that most nerve terminals that contain N-type Ca2+ (>85%) also express mGluR7. It is therefore likely that the synaptic targeting of the two proteins is coordinated or shares a common mechanism. In this respect, C-terminal mediated interactions with PDZ domain adaptor proteins are involved in the targeting of mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+ channels at presynaptic terminals. The interaction of mGluR7 with the adaptor protein PICK1 has been shown to be important both for clustering of this receptor at presynaptic terminals (42Boudin H. Doan A. Xia J. Shigemoto R. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Craig A.M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Google Scholar) and for receptor function (43Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Google Scholar, 44Perroy J. El Far O. Pin J.-P. Betz H. Bockaert J. Fagni L. EMBO J. 2002; 17: 2990-2999Google Scholar). Synaptic clustering of N-type Ca2+ channels also depends on interactions with PDZ and SH3 domain binding motifs of the adaptor proteins Mint1 and CASK, respectively, (45Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Google Scholar). In addition, protein kinase C phosphorylates mGluR7 (46Nakajima Y. Yamamoto T. Nakayama T. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 24: 27573-27577Google Scholar) and N-type Ca2+ channels (47Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Google Scholar). Finally, because both mGluR7 (38Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Google Scholar) and N-type Ca2+ channels (48Bennet M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Google Scholar) are located at the active zone, and, given the functional coupling between mGluR7 and N-type Ca2+ channels, it seems likely that these two proteins form part of the same presynaptic multiprotein complex.

https://openalex.org/W2005520678,"The cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cPG) 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (dPGJ2) and PGA1 can inhibit multiple steps in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling and can induce cell death. Here we characterized the effects of dPGJ2 and PGA1 on the inflammatory induction of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM). Pretreatment of endothelial cells with dPGJ2 or PGA1 at low concentrations dose dependently inhibited the up-regulation of CAM expression and monocyte arrest by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha but not expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Only at high concentrations, cPG enhanced TNF-alpha-induced cell death and inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB-alpha kinase (IKK) activation, IkappaB-alpha degradation, and NF-kappaB/p65 translocation, while promoting AP-1/c-jun phosphorylation. Expression of an IKK-beta mutant (C179A) resistant to interaction with cPG impaired cell death induction but not inhibition of CAM up-regulation by cPG. Gel shift and reporter gene analysis revealed that cPG at low concentrations directly impaired DNA binding of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation. The synthetic analogs dPGA1 or dPGA2 were ineffective, indicating structural specificity of cPG. Thus, the suppression of endothelial CAM up-regulation with cPG is dissociated from cell death sensitization and IKK inhibition above threshold concentrations and related to interference with NF-kappaB binding. Our findings define distinct mechanisms for anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects of cPG in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136406488,"Ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) of the HECT family share a conserved catalytic region that is homologous to the E6-AP Cterminus. The HECT domain defines a large E3 family, but only a handful of these enzymes have been defined with respect to substrate specificity or biological function. We showed previously that the C-terminal domain of one family member, KIAA10, catalyzes the assembly of polyubiquitin chains, whereas the N-terminal domain binds to proteasomes in vitro (You, J., and Pickart, C. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 19871–19878). We show here that KIAA10 also associates with proteasomes within cells but that this association probably involves additional contacts with proteasome subunits other than the one (S2/Rpn1) identified in our previous work. We report that the N-domain of KIAA10 also mediates an association with TIP120B (TATA-binding protein-interacting protein 120B), a putative transcriptional regulator. Biochemical and co-transfection studies revealed that TIP120B, but not the closely related protein TIP120A, is a specific substrate of KIAA10 in vitro and within C2C12 myoblasts but not in Cos-1 cells. KIAA10 and TIP120B are both highly expressed in human skeletal muscle, suggesting that KIAA10 may regulate TIP120B homeostasis specifically in this tissue.

Many important intracellular proteins, including cell-cycle regulators, tumor suppressors, oncoproteins, and transcription factors, are targeted for degradation by 26 S proteasomes through conjugation to Ub, 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; polyUb, polyubiquitin (refers to a branched, isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chain); CD, C-terminal domain of KIAA10; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitinconjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; HECT, homologous to the E6-AP Cterminus; ND, N-terminal domain of KIAA10; RING, really interesting new gene; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TIP, TBP-interacting protein; FL, full-length; GST, glutathione S-transferase. a highly conserved protein of 76 amino acids (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). This proteolytic targeting function underlies the role of ubiquitin in such processes as cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, antigen presentation, and cell death (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). A single Ub is an inefficient signal for degradation by proteasomes (2Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar). Proteasome-bound substrates are rather marked with a polyUb chain in which successive Ubs are joined by Lys48-Gly76 isopeptide bonds (3Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Google Scholar, 4Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Google Scholar). This modification is accomplished through the sequential actions of three classes of enzymes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 5Pickart C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). Ub-activating enzyme (E1) uses ATP to drive the formation of a thiol ester bond between an E1 active-site Cys and the C-terminal carboxyl of Ub (Gly76). The activated Ub is then transferred to the active site Cys of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Ub is finally transferred from the E2 to an ϵ-amino group of the substrate in a reaction that requires a specific Ub-protein ligase (E3). In many cases, the polyUb chain is probably assembled by the same E3 that recognizes the substrate, but in some cases chain assembly may require specialized, Ub-dedicated E3s (6Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Google Scholar, 7Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Google Scholar). The substrate-linked chain is ultimately recognized by the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome (2Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar, 3Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Google Scholar, 4Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P.

Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar), resulting in the unfolding, translocation, and hydrolysis of the substrate polypeptide chain (9Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Google Scholar). PolyUb chains linked through other lysine residues of Ub also occur within cells and in some cases may represent functionally distinct signals (for review, see Ref. 10Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Google Scholar). The Ub conjugation system features multiple E2 and E3 enzymes, with a large array of combinatorial E2-E3 pairings allowing for the selective targeting of diverse substrates (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). Substrate recognition usually reflects a direct interaction between the E3 enzyme and a specific ubiquitination signal or degron of the substrate (for review, see Ref. 11Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Google Scholar). E3 enzymes display a modular construction, with unique domains/subunits mediating substrate interaction and conserved domains/subunits responsible for catalysis. A small number of distinctive catalytic domains defines the known E3 families (for review, see Ref. 5Pickart C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). One family, known as the HECT E3s, employs a covalent catalytic mechanism (12Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). A second family, known as the RING E3s, recruits a specific E2 enzyme by means of a globular zinc binding domain (13Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Google Scholar). A subset of the RING E3s, known as SCF E3s, consists of multisubunit enzymes in which the RING and substrate-binding domains are localized to distinct subunits (13Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Google Scholar). HECT E3s share a conserved ∼350-amino acid region that is defined by its homology to the C terminus of E6-AP. This HECT domain harbors the Cys residue that forms a catalytic thiol ester with Ub (14Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). The prototypic family member, E6-AP, is a 100-kDa host cell protein that forms a complex with the E6 protein of oncogenic human papilloma viruses, thereby acquiring the ability to bind and ubiquitinate the p53 tumor suppressor (15Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Google Scholar). In contrast to the conserved catalytic module, HECT E3s display highly variable N-terminal domains. The recognition of p53 is mediated principally by the N terminus of E6-AP in conjunction with the viral E6 protein (16Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Google Scholar). The current model for HECT E3 structure-function postulates that the divergent N termini of these E3s mediate specific substrate binding, whereas the conserved HECT domain supplies catalytic activity in ubiquitination (14Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar). In principle, independent substrate binding and catalytic motifs can ensure the selective and efficient ubiquitination of different substrates. However, although databases reveal a large family of mammalian HECT E3s (14Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar), only a handful of these enzymes has been defined with respect to substrate specificity or biological function. In previous work we used a cognate E2 affinity approach to purify and identify a rabbit E3 enzyme that uses free Ub as the substrate for assembly of unanchored polyUb chains linked through Lys29 or Lys48. This enzyme corresponded to the HECT domain E3 encoded by the human KIAA10 cDNA (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). The C-terminal 420 amino acids of KIAA10, called the C-domain (CD), are necessary and sufficient for assembly of both types of polyUb chains, indicating that the N-terminal domain (ND) is responsible for another function(s). We found that the ND bound proteasomes in vitro (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar), suggesting that KIAA10 belongs to the small group of conjugating factors known to associate with proteasomes (18Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Google Scholar, 19Tongaonkar P. Chen L. Lambertson D. Ko B. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4691-4698Google Scholar, 20Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Google Scholar). Among these factors is the HUL5-encoded HECT E3 (21Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Plough H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Google Scholar), an apparent ortholog of KIAA10 in budding yeast (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). The purpose of E3-proteasome interactions is uncertain, but one possibility is that they provide an independent mechanism (besides the substrate-linked chain) for targeting certain substrates to proteasomes. In the case of KIAA10, we demonstrated a robust interaction with the purified S2/Rpn1 subunit of the 19 S complex of the proteasome (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). However, it was uncertain whether KIAA10 associates with proteasomes in vivo. Nor could we exclude that the ND mediated other functionally significant interactions. Here we report experiments probing the function of the KIAA10-ND. We show that KIAA10 indeed associates with 26 S proteasomes in mammalian cells but that this interaction is likely to depend on contacts with a subunit(s) besides S2/Rpn1. Most importantly, we provide strong evidence that TIP120B (TBP-interacting protein 120B (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar)) is a specific substrate that is targeted for degradation in skeletal muscle through KIAA10-catalyzed polyubiquitination. Our results confirm the utility of affinity capture methods for the identification of E3 substrates and set the stage for achieving a fuller understanding of the functions of TIP120B and KIAA10. Proteins—E1 (23Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar), UbcH5A (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar), several versions of KIAA10 (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar), and GST-S2 (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as in previous work. Bovine Ub and GSH beads were from Sigma. Sources of other reagents are given below. Plasmids and Cloning—pGEX* plasmids encoding full-length (FL), 655-residue N-terminal domain (ND), and 428-residue C-terminal domain (CD) of KIAA10 have been described (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). We made pET3a-KIAA10 a template for in vitro transcription/translation and full-length enzyme expression in Escherichia coli. The KIAA10 open reading frame was amplified by PCR to introduce flanking NdeI sites and ligated into pET3a. The C1051A mutation was introduced into this plasmid by standard PCR methods. Plasmids pBluescript-TIP120A, pCDNATIP120B, and pCDNA-FLAG-TIP120B have been described (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar). For mammalian cell expression, the KIAA10 and KIAA10-C1051A coding sequences were amplified by PCR to introduce 5′-SalI and 3′-NotI sites and subcloned in-frame with the Myc tag in pCMV-MYC (Clontech). The sequences of all PCR-derived cDNA constructs were verified. For Northern blotting we probed a human MTN blot (Clontech) with a 32P-labeled probe complementary to the ND coding region. KIAA10-Proteasome Interaction—A series of N-terminal truncation mutants of KIAA10-ND (see Fig. 1 and “Results”) were constructed in pET3a-KIAA10 by standard PCR methods. [35S]Met-labeled in vitro translation products were produced in wheat germ extract (Promega). A 10-μl aliquot of translation mixture was mixed with 10 μl of immobilized GST-S2 or control immobilized GST (∼0.2 mg of protein/ml beads). Binding buffer (0.18 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the beads followed by 4 h of incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed with 4 × 0.3 ml of binding buffer and eluted with 20 μl of sample buffer. Aliquots of 8 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To assess if KIAA10 interacts with proteasomes in Cos-1 cells, pCMV-MYC vector specifying wild type or Δ132-KIAA10 was transfected into Cos-1 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (plasmids used in mammalian cell transfection were purified using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit from Qiagen). In all cases, 3 μg of plasmid was used to transfect 106 cells on a 10-cm dish. After 48 h, cells were harvested by scraping into 0.9 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) per dish. Cells were lysed by passing the suspension through a 21-gauge needle 2 or 3 times. The lysate was incubated on ice for 60 min and then clarified by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). Soluble extract protein (1 ml, ∼0.5 mg of protein) was mixed with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) and 2 μl of antibody against the human S8/Rpt6 (p45) 19 S subunit or 5 μl of antibody against the S10a/Rpn7 subunit (Affiniti) and then rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with 4 × 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of sample buffer. Aliquots (10 μl) were resolved on a 10% gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) and blotted with c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz A-14) to detect Myc-KIAA10 and Myc-Δ132-KIAA10 (ECL detection). Partial Purification of Full-length KIAA10—To maximize the specific activity of the recombinant E3, we partially purified the small fraction of soluble enzyme produced from pET3a-KIAA10 in E. coli. Expression in BL21(DE3)pJY2 cells (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar) at 30 °C was as described (6Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Google Scholar). Cell lysis and DNA digestion followed established procedures (23Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (32 ml, from 2 liters of cell suspension) was passed through a 30-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-equilibrated with base buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The column was washed with three column volumes of base buffer and then eluted with a 200-ml gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Fractions of 5 ml were collected and assayed for activity in K29-Ub2 synthesis (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with base buffer. The column was eluted with a 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient. The pooled active fractions from this column were used as an E3 source after desalting by repeated dilution with base buffer and reconcentration (final volume, ∼1.7 ml). Characterization of C1051A-KIAA10—[35S]Met-labeled wild-type and C1051A-KIAA10 proteins were expressed by in vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysate (Promega). An aliquot of each translation mixture was assayed for thiol ester formation by incubating for several min with Ub2 in the presence of E1 and UbcH5A under established conditions (23Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar). Wild type, but not mutant, E3 formed a labeled band that was upshifted by ∼18 kDa and was detected only when the reaction was quenched in non-reducing sample buffer (use of Ub2 rather than Ub1 facilitated detection of the molecular mass shift). We attribute the upshifted band to formation of a thiol ester with Ub2 that is abolished after mutation of the HECT Cys residue (Cys1051) to Ala. In Vitro Binding of TIP120 to KIAA10—[35S]Met-labeled TIP120A and TIP120B proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation in wheat germ extract (Promega) using plasmids pBluescript-TIP120A and pCDNA-TIP120B, respectively. GST-KIAA10-FL, ND, and CD fusion proteins were produced in E. coli using the respective pGEX* plasmids (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). A 20-μl aliquot of each translation mixture was mixed with 10 μl of immobilized GST-KIAA10-FL, -ND, -CD, or GST alone (∼0.5 mg of protein/ml beads). Binding buffer (0.17 ml, see “KIAA10-proteasome interaction,” above) was added to the beads followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed with 0.3 ml of binding buffer and eluted with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. An aliquot of each eluate (8 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro Ubiquitination of TIP120B—[35S]Met-labeled TIP120B was produced by in vitro transcription/translation in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) using pCDNA-TIP120B. The translation product, 1 μl, was incubated in a total volume of 20 μl with 0.1 μm E1, 0.3 μm UbcH5A, and 146 μm Ub under established conditions (pH 7.6, 37 °C) (6Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Google Scholar) with or without 1 μl of partially purified recombinant KIAA10 (above). At 0 and 4 h, 8-μl aliquots were quenched with sample buffer and resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. TIP120B and its ubiquitination products were detected by autoradiography. Intracellular Interaction of TIP120B and KIAA10—Cos-1 cells were co-transfected with pCDNA-FLAG-TIP120B and pCMV-MYC vector specifying wild type or C1051A-KIAA10, harvested, and lysed as described (see “KIAA10-proteasome interaction,” above). Soluble extract protein (∼0.5 mg) was mixed with 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with 4 × 0.5 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of sample buffer. Aliquots (10 μl) were resolved on an 8% gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) and blotted with anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz A-14) to detect the Myctagged E3 (ECL detection). Intracellular Ubiquitination of TIP120B—Myoblast C2C12 cells were from ATCC. C2C12 cells (106 cells) were co-transfected using FuGENE 6 (above) with pCDNA-FLAG-TIP120B together with pCMVMYC-KIAA10 or pCMV-MYC-KIAA10-C1051A (or an empty vector control). Each transfection employed 3 μg of each vector and was done in duplicate. After 40 h, 50 μm MG-132 (Peptides International) was added to one set of transfections. Cells were harvested 6 h later and lysed (above). TIP120B was immunoprecipitated (above), and the immunoprecipitates were screened by immunoblotting with affinity-purified Ub antibodies (produced by us according to procedures described in Haas and Bright (24Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar)). Intracellular Destabilization of TIP120B—C2C12 cells (105 cells) were co-transfected with pCDNA-FLAG-TIP120B and pCMV-MYCKIAA10 or pCMV-MYC-KIAA10 mutant (or vector control) as described above using a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA (1 μg of each) per transfection. After 40 h, 50 μm MG-132 was added to the indicated transfections. After 6 h more, cells were harvested and lysed (above). Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or affinity-purified anti-TIP120B antibody (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar). Studies of the ND-Proteasome Interaction—We have shown that KIAA10 (Fig. 1A) associates via its ND with purified 26 S proteasomes (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). This interaction might be explained by binding of the ND to S2/Rpn1, one of the two largest subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex of the proteasome (Fig. 1B and Ref. 17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). As a first step in evaluating the biological significance of this interaction, we carried out deletion mutagenesis to map the region of the ND responsible for its interaction with S2/Rpn1. N-terminally truncated versions of the ND were labeled by in vitro transcription/translation and tested for binding in pull-down assays with a GST-S2 fusion protein (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). Removal of the first 88 residues of the ND had a minimal effect on the S2-ND interaction (Fig. 1, B and C), but mutants truncated by ≥132 residues displayed strongly diminished binding (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 10, 12, and 14, with 6 and 8). Versions of the ND lacking ≥132 N-terminal residues did, however, retain weak binding activity (∼18% of the intact ND, Fig. 1C). Thus, a second, minor S2 binding determinant is located elsewhere in the ND. In all cases, minimal binding to GST alone (Fig. 1B) confirmed the specificity of the ND-S2 interaction. Several considerations suggest that reduced binding of Δ132-ND to S2/Rpn1 reflects the presence of a binding epitope in the first 132 residues of the ND versus improper folding of truncated ND molecules. First, in vitro transcription/translation frequently produces folded proteins. For example, full-length KIAA10 produced by this method quantitatively forms a thiol ester with Ub, indicating full activity (see “Experimental Procedures”) even though full-length KIAA10 produced in bacteria is largely insoluble (17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). Second, a GST-Δ132-ND fusion protein binds purified 26 S proteasomes (see the next paragraph) as well as a KIAA10-specific substrate (TIP120B, see Fig. 2 below). These findings show that N-terminal truncation is compatible with proper folding. This conclusion is confirmed by the behavior of Δ132-KIAA10 expressed in Cos-1 cells (see the next paragraph). Finally, the results of a complementary C-terminal deletion study are fully consistent with the result shown in Fig. 1B. In these experiments the ND was successively truncated at its C terminus, and a fragment consisting of residues 1–222 was found to bind efficiently to GST-S2. 2J. Blum and C. Pickart, unpublished experiments. If the S2-ND interaction is responsible for the binding of KIAA10 to 26 S proteasomes, then Δ132-KIAA10 should exhibit reduced binding to proteasomes. We used two approaches to determine if this prediction was met. First, GST-fused versions of intact or truncated (Δ132) ND were used to pull down purified 26 S proteasomes in vitro. Surprisingly, there was no detectable inhibition of the ND-proteasome interaction as a result of the truncation (data not shown). In a more physiological experiment, we transfected Myc-tagged versions of WTKIAA10 and Δ132-KIAA10 into Cos-1 cells, immunoprecipitated proteasomes with an antibody against the S8/Rpt6 ATPase subunit of the 19 S complex, and screened the immunoprecipitates for the presence of KIAA10 by Western blotting. Full-length KIAA10 was co-precipitated by the S8 antibody (Fig. 1D, middle panel). Although this interaction seemed to be more pronounced with the truncated E3, this effect could be explained by higher expression of the truncated protein (upper panel). A similar result was obtained when we used antibody against a non-ATPase 19 S subunit, S10a/Rpn7, to precipitate proteasomes (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). The agreement between the results of intracellular and in vitro interaction assays strongly suggests that KIAA10 interacts directly with proteasomes. Direct interaction also applies in the case of yeast Ufd4 (18Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Google Scholar, 25Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1003-1007Google Scholar), whereas E6-AP interacts with proteasomes through an accessory factor (20Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Google Scholar). These findings show for the first time that KIAA10 associates with proteasomes within cells. The in vitro and intracellular results concur in suggesting that the extreme N terminus of the E3 is not the only determinant of its interaction with proteasomes. We cannot exclude that the residual interaction between Δ132-KIAA10 and S2/Rpn1 (Fig. 1C) is sufficient for interaction with cellular proteasomes, but we consider it more likely that a distal region of the ND (beyond residue 132) also binds to a different, unidentified subunit of the 19 S complex. There is precedent for a given E3 interacting with more than one subunit of the 19 S complex (18Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Google Scholar, 25Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1003-1007Google Scholar). Interaction of TIP120B with KIAA10—We next addressed whether the KIAA10-ND might be responsible for interacting with a specific substrate. To gain insight into the likely properties of cognate substrates, we conducted Northern blot analysis of KIAA10 mRNA levels in human tissues (data not shown). The results confirmed a previous report that KIAA10 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (26Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Google Scholar). Levels of KIAA10 mRNA in kidney and pancreas were <1% that of the level in muscle, whereas expression in heart, brain, placenta, lung, and liver was nearly undetectable (data not shown). Based on this expression pattern we speculated that KIAA10 might target a muscle protein(s) for degradation in the Ub-proteasome pathway. In earlier work we found that an affinity-purified preparation of KIAA10 also contained low levels of peptides conserved among members of the TIP120 family (data not shown and Ref. 17You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these proteins interact with UbcH5A or KIAA10. TIP120A, the original family member, was identified during a search for proteins that bound to TBP in vitro (27Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 612-617Google Scholar). TIP120B was later cloned by virtue of its similarity to TIP120A (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar). In humans, TIP120B is expressed most highly in skeletal muscle, whereas TIP120A is ubiquitously expressed (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar, 28Aoki T. Okada N. Wakamatsu T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1097-1103Google Scholar). The two TIP120 proteins are 60% identical to one another (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar), and both contain multiple copies of a proposed protein interaction module, the HEAT repeat (29Neuwald A.F. Hirano T. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1445-1452Google Scholar), whose significance for TIP120 function is unknown. Both isoforms interact with TBP under physiological conditions in vitro and associate with TBP in nuclear extracts (22Aoki T. Okada N. Ishida M. Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 911-916Google Scholar, 27Yogosawa S. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Muramatsu M. Tamu"
https://openalex.org/W2076712334,"Covalent antithrombin-heparin (ATH) complexes, formed spontaneously between antithrombin (AT) and unfractionated standard heparin (H), have a potent ability to catalyze the inhibition of factor Xa (or thrombin) by added AT. Although ≈30% of ATH molecules contain two AT-binding sites on their heparin chains, the secondary site does not solely account for the increased activity of ATH. We studied the possibility that all pentasaccharide AT-binding sequences in ATH may catalyze factor Xa inhibition. Chromatography of ATH on Sepharose-AT resulted in >80% binding of the load. Similar chromatographies of non-covalent AT + H mixtures lead to a lack of binding for AT and fractionation of H into unbound (separate from AT) or bound material. Gradient elution of ATH from Sepharose-AT gave 2 peaks, a peak containing higher affinity material that had greater anti-factor Xa catalytic activity (708 units/mg heparin) compared with the peak containing lower affinity material (112 units/mg). Sepharose-AT chromatography of the ATH component with short heparin chains (≤12 monosaccharides) resulted in active unbound (40%) and bound fractions (190 and 560 units/mg, respectively). Factor Xa-ATH or thrombin-ATH inhibitor complexes gave chromatograms on Sepharose-AT with more unbound material compared with that of free ATH. Also, ATH did not bind to Sepharose-heparin, and the intrinsic fluorescence due to activation of AT in ATH by its heparin chain was reversed at higher [NaCl] than that required to dissociate non-covalent AT·H complexes. Thus, exogenous AT can compete with the AT moiety of ATH for binding to the covalently linked heparin chain, leading to catalytic inhibition of factor Xa or thrombin. These data may suggest that access to pentasaccharide units in non-covalent AT·H complexes by free AT may be facile.

Reaction occurs via the allosteric activation of AT, due to H binding, followed by attack of the enzyme on the reactive center of the inhibitor (4Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). In the case of thrombin, binding to the heparin chain by the enzyme must also occur for efficient reaction to take place (3Andersson L.O. Barrowcliffe T.W. Holmer E. Thromb. Res. 1979; 15: 531-541Google Scholar). After formation of thrombin-AT or factor Xa-AT inhibitor complexes, affinity of the AT moiety for the heparin chain decreases, leading to release of the catalyst for further reactions with AT and enzyme (5Byun Y. Jacobs H.A. Kim S.W. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1996; 30: 423-427Google Scholar, 6Hatton M.W.C. Rollason G. Sefton M.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1983; 50: 873-877Google Scholar). Although binding to thrombin is through non-selective interaction of negative charges on the GAG with the anion-binding exosite of the enzyme (7Petersen L.C. Jorgensen M. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 91-97Google Scholar, 8Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Google Scholar), AT binding to H occurs through high affinity to a specific pentasaccharide sequence on the heparin chain (2Desai U.R. Petitou M. Bjork I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13033-13041Google Scholar, 9Desai U.R. Petitou M. Bjork I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7478-7487Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the rate-determining step for catalysis of thrombin (or factor Xa) inhibition involves the initial binding of AT and H (10Pletcher C.H. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5342-5345Google Scholar).Previously, we produced a covalent AT-heparin complex (ATH) to further study the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by H-activated AT (11Chan A.K. Berry L.

(Tokyo). 1998; 124: 434-439Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although serpin and GAG cannot dissociate, it was observed that ATH could catalyze the inactivation of thrombin (or factor Xa) by added AT (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). In fact, the specific catalytic activity of ATH was ∼4-fold greater than that measured for reaction of factor Xa/thrombin + AT with starting H (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). Confirmation that inhibitory activity of ATH against either factor Xa or thrombin (in the presence of exogenous AT) was catalytic in nature became apparent from the fact that many-fold more molecules of enzyme were inactivated in the presence of excess added AT compared with that of ATH alone (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). Furthermore, plasma thrombin generation on fetal distal lung epithelial cells was inhibited more effectively in the presence of ATH than H due, in part, to the formation of thrombin-AT inhibitor complexes from plasma AT (13Chan A.K. Berry L. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. O'Brodovich H. Andrew M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L914-L921Google Scholar).Investigations were carried out to determine components of the mechanisms involved in ATH catalysis of the AT + factor Xa (or thrombin) reactions. AT in the ATH complex has been shown to exist in the activated form due to direct interaction with a high affinity (pentasaccharide) sequence on the covalently attached heparin chain (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). Thus, one possible mode for ATH catalysis of factor Xa/thrombin inhibition would be via the activation of added AT molecules by the pentasaccharide site proximal to the AT component of ATH. However, because of the rapid velocity of the direct thrombin (factor Xa) + ATH reaction (second order rate constants for thrombin + ATH and factor Xa + ATH are 3.0 × 109 and 2.4 × 108m–1 min–1, respectively (14Berry L. Stafford A. Fredenburgh J. O'Brodovich H. Mitchell L. Weitz J. Andrew M. Chan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34730-34736Google Scholar)), thrombin-ATH (or factor Xa-ATH), inhibitor complexes might be generated before several cycles of the catalytic reaction could take place. Once factor Xa or thrombin had formed a covalent bond with the AT portion of ATH, approach by free serpin and enzyme to the inhibited ATH may be restricted due to steric reasons. Another explanation for the potent catalytic activity of ATH is the possibility that during conjugate synthesis, AT may have selected for a small subpopulation of H molecules that have more than one pentasaccharide (15Rosenberg R.D. Jordan R.E. Favreau L.V. Lam L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 1319-1324Google Scholar). There is strong evidence from a number of experiments that ATH preparations contain multipentasaccharide GAGs. First, titration of ATH by AT resulted in a 30–40% increase in intrinsic fluorescence, which is characteristic of AT activation by pentasaccharide binding (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar, 14Berry L. Stafford A. Fredenburgh J. O'Brodovich H. Mitchell L. Weitz J. Andrew M. Chan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34730-34736Google Scholar). Second, gel filtration of the non-covalent complexes formed between the heparin released from ATH by protease treatment and excess free AT showed that ∼30% of the heparin molecules were capable of binding ≥2 AT molecules (14Berry L. Stafford A. Fredenburgh J. O'Brodovich H. Mitchell L. Weitz J. Andrew M. Chan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34730-34736Google Scholar). However, assays of ATH preparations have consistently shown that both anti-factor Xa and anti-thrombin catalytic activities are ∼2-fold greater than that of H with high affinity for AT (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). Thus, it would appear that ATH molecules that have a single pentasaccharide (∼70%) may also contribute to the observed catalytic potency.We decided to study the possibility that all pentasaccharide units on ATH heparin chains may be available to activate added AT molecules for factor Xa (or thrombin) inhibition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—All reagents were of analytical grade. Standard heparin (H) was from Sigma (grade I-A, sodium salt, 15-kDa average molecular mass, from porcine intestinal mucosa (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada)). Human antithrombin (AT) was from Bayer (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Ninhydrin was from Fisher, and SnCl2·2H2O and 2-methoxyethanol were from Sigma. Stachrom heparin kits (containing the CBS 31.39 substrate for factor Xa) were obtained from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France) and anti-IIa kits were from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Protamine sulfate was obtained as the solid from ICN (Cleveland, OH), and arginine was purchased from Sigma. Sephadex G-200 beads, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and heparin-Sepharose CL6B were all from Amersham Biosciences. Molecular weight standards used to characterize Sephadex G-200 chromatograms are as follows: dextran 70,000 (Amersham Biosciences, catalogue number T-70), dextran 42,000 (Sigma, catalogue number d-4133), dextran 10 (Amersham Biosciences, catalogue number dextran 10, lot number To 5400), and dextran sulfate 8,000 (Sigma, sodium salt, catalogue number d-4911). Bio-Gel P-6 was from Bio-Rad. Purified heparin oligosaccharides, used as standards for characterizing heparin chains isolated from ATH fractions, were kindly provided by Dr. John Gallagher. Heparinase was from ICN. Human factor Xa and human thrombin were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN), and the S-2238 chromagenic substrate for thrombin titrations was from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH). ATH was prepared as described previously (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar, 16Chan A.K. Berry L. Klement P. Julian J. Mitchell M. Weitz J. Hirsh J. Andrew M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: 587-595Google Scholar). Briefly, AT was incubated with H at 40 °C in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, for 14 days, followed by purification of the covalent product by sequential chromatographies on butyl-agarose (Sigma) and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions) of the ATH produced showed that <5% of free unreacted AT or H were present in the final preparation. In order to ascertain the AT and H present in the conjugate, detailed chemical analyses were carried out (see below). Heparin chains from ATH were prepared according to a procedure similar to that described previously (14Berry L. Stafford A. Fredenburgh J. O'Brodovich H. Mitchell L. Weitz J. Andrew M. Chan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34730-34736Google Scholar). In brief, ATH (equivalent to 8.66 mg of AT) + 2 mg of protease P-5147 (Sigma) in 1 ml of 0.5 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, were heated at 37 °C for 24 h. The incubate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Dialyzed product was loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (3 ml of packed beads) that was pre-equilibrated with 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. After washing the column with 0.25 m NaCl in 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, heparin chains were eluted with 2 m NaCl in 0.01 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. The eluted heparin (∼2 mg) was dialyzed exhaustively versus H2O and either stored at 4 °C or freeze-dried. Heparin isolated from protease-treated ATH was designated as H′.Physicochemical Analyses of ATH—The AT and heparin content in ATH was measured using several methods in order to rigorously determine the AT:heparin mole ratio as a confirmation of earlier studies. ATH was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 100 °C for 20 h and, after evacuation under vacuum, analyzed for amino acid content (Beckman System 6300 High Performance Analyzer) against an amino acid reference that had been added as an internal standard. Given the known protein sequence and N-linked glycan content for human antithrombin (17Manson H.E. Austin R.C. Fernandez-Rachubinski F. Rachubinski R.A. Blajchman M.A. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1989; 3: 264-281Google Scholar, 18Miller-Andersson J. Borg H. Andersson L.O. Thromb. Res. 1974; 5: 439-452Google Scholar), the molecular weight of AT was calculated to be 57,769. Analysis of results for amino acids that are stable to acid hydrolysis (i.e. alanine and arginine) was used to determine the number of moles of AT in the original sample (31 alanine residues and 22 arginine residues per AT molecule) and, thus, the number of milligrams of AT per unit volume of original ATH solution. Measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm of ATH stock solution and use of the milligram of AT/ml determined by amino acid analysis allowed for calculation of an extinction coefficient for ATH in terms of AT concentration. Three different methods were used to evaluate the heparin content in ATH. Heparin mass concentration in stock ATH solution was analyzed using the carbazole (19Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar), Azure A (20Grant A. Linhardt R.J. Fitzgerald G.L. Park J.J. Langer R. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 25-32Google Scholar), and Alcian blue (21Gold E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 183-188Google Scholar) techniques. In each case, background measured in samples containing a similar concentration of purified AT was subtracted from values calculated for ATH. Standards were prepared from solid commercial Sigma heparin. Moles of heparin in ATH was derived by dividing the mass of heparin in ATH samples by the ATH heparin chain molecular weight. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of heparin released from ATH by exhaustive protease treatment was determined by end group analysis of the α-amino group on the remaining amino acid or short peptide linked to the heparin chains. In brief, ATH was incubated with protease P-5147 and the heparin chains (H′) isolated as described above. H′ chains were dialyzed exhaustively against H2O and freeze-dried. Analysis of acid-hydrolyzed H′ on the Beckman System 6300 High Performance Analyzer showed only a large free glucosamine peak and one unidentified peak (likely the lysyl-uronic acid linkage group reported previously (12Berry L. Chan A.K.C. Andrew M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 434-439Google Scholar)). To quantitate the H′ amino acid end group, weighed out samples of H′ (in 2 ml of H2O) were incubated with ninhydrin reagent (0.2 ml of a solution prepared from 0.2 g of ninhydrin + 7.5 ml of 2-methoxyethanol + 2.5 ml of 4 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, + 10 mg of SnCl2·2H2O with constant stirring and bubbling of a stream of commercial grade N2) at 100 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 23 °C, the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. Absorbance resulting from any primary amino groups present on intrachain glucosamine residues was determined by analysis of similar amounts of freeze-dried samples of disaccharides recovered outside dialysis bags containing reaction mixtures of ATH + heparinase. Subtraction of the ninhydrin-glucosamine absorbance (a small proportion of the total) from the data gave results with absorbance exclusively due to reaction with the aldose-terminal amino acid. Results were compared with that of reactions with alanine standard to determine moles of terminal α-amino group. Division of the weight of sample by the moles of terminal amino groups gave the number average molecular weight per mol of H′. Heparin chains released from ATH by protease were also gel-filtered on a Sephadex G-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) to assess the polydispersity relative to commercial heparin. Finally, the number of moles of AT and heparin in ATH stock solutions was used to calculate the heparin:AT mole ratio in ATH.Anti-Factor Xa and Anti-Factor IIa Assays—Anti-factor Xa activities were determined using the commercially available Stachrom heparin kit. Heparin standards (0, 0.4, and 0.8 anti-factor Xa IU/ml), controls, or samples (50 μl), diluted in the presence (for catalytic activity) or the absence (for checking non-catalytic activity) of AT, were incubated with purified bovine factor Xa for 120 s at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 is added, mixed, and incubated for 90 s before reading the absorbance at 405 nm. Control and unknown sample values were determined by interpolation from the linear heparin standard curve. The anti-factor IIa assay was determined chromogenically by commercially available kits called Actichrom heparin anti-IIa. Heparin standards (0.0–0.6 USP units/ml), controls (1:16 dilution), or samples (1:16 dilution) were added to AT-containing reagent, followed by mixing and incubation at 37 °C for 2 min. Thrombin reagent was then added, followed by mixing and incubation for a further 2 min at 37 °C. Finally, Spectrozyme TH substrate was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 min before reading the absorbance at 405 nm. Similar to the anti-Xa assay, control and unknown sample absorbance values were interpolated from the heparin standard curve. All assays were performed on an automated ACL 300+ machine (Instrumentation Laboratories, Milano, Italy). The heparin values were converted from units/ml to units/mg by dividing the heparin activity values by the heparin mass concentrations (mg/ml), as determined by protamine sulfate assay (see below).Protamine Sulfate Assay—The protamine sulfate assay is an aggregation assay used to determine the heparin mass concentration in a sample (22Hatton M.W. Berry L.R. Kaur H. Koj A. Regoeczi E. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 57: 1183-1190Google Scholar, 23Hatton M.W.C. Berry L.R. Machovich R. Regoeczi E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 417-426Google Scholar, 24Hatton M.W. Berry L.R. Regoeczi E. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 655-670Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 ml of 1.0 mg/ml protamine sulfate solution in H2O was added to 0.5 ml of H standards, ATH standards, or unknown samples, followed by immediate vortexing. After 10 min at room temperature, 1.0 ml of 0.1 ml-arginine was added to the mixture and vortexed, followed immediately by the addition of 2.3 ml of 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, and further vortexing. Absorbances of H standards, ATH standards, or unknown samples were read at 470 nm within 1 h, and unknown samples were read from the appropriate H or ATH standard curve.Sepharose-AT Chromatography—Lyophilized AT powder was reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile H2O from the kit. It was then dialyzed against coupling buffer before conjugation to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. Conjugation of AT to the beads was done according to the manufacturer's instructions and resulted in affinity matrix material containing 9.84 mg of AT/ml. Sepharose-AT columns (10 ml, pre-equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.01 m phosphate, pH 7.3 buffer) were loaded with either ATH (equivalent to 2 mg of AT and 0.6 mg of H), H, AT + H, H′, HMWATHF, LMWATHF, HMWH, or LMWH at similar loading levels (33.9 nmol of each species). After loading, the column was washed with 3 column volumes of 0.15 m NaCl buffer before elution of any bound material with a linear gradient (25 ml of 0.15 m NaCl buffer in the mixing chamber and 25 ml of 2 m NaCl buffer as limit solution). Finally the column was treated with 2 column volumes of 2 m NaCl buffer to ensure equilibration of the column with high salt. NaCl concentrations in the eluate were determined using a conductivity meter (E C Meter, Amber Science Inc., Eugene, OR). Fractions were analyzed for either protein or heparin by measuring absorbance (280 or 215 nm) or taking samples for assay with protamine (as described above), respectively. AT or heparin peaks were dialyzed against H2O, freeze-dried, and resuspended in 0.15 m NaCl for further assays for activity (anti-factor Xa or anti-IIa, described above). Smaller columns of Sepharose-AT (1.5 ml) were constructed for chromatographies of factor Xa-ATH or thrombin-ATH complexes using the same washing and elution protocols as those for the larger columns.Fractionation of ATH or H into High and Low Molecular Weight Fractions—Fractionation of ATH by molecular weight was performed on a Sephadex G-200 column. The Sephadex G-200 column was prepared swollen and poured according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column (300 ml) was equilibrated with 2 m NaCl, and 20 mg of ATH was loaded, with elution at 2 m NaCl. Fractions were collected (≈3.9 ml/fraction) and analyzed for protein concentration (A280). The column fractions of high (the first to be eluted from the column) and low molecular weight species were designated high molecular weight ATH fraction HMWATHF and low molecular weight ATH fraction LMWATHF, respectively. The first 2–9% (HMWATHF) and the last 2–9% (LMWATHF) of the eluted fractions were separately pooled and then dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, before further fractionation on Sepharose-AT. To confirm the molecular weight of LMWATHF, the chain length of heparin released from LMWATHF was assessed. LMWATHF was incubated for up to 24 h at 37 °C with catalytic amounts of protease (<10% by mass) in 0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-6 column (1 × 49 cm), with elution at 0.15 m NaCl (1-ml fractions) and detection by a refractive index detector (Jasco RI-1531, Tokyo, Japan). The peak containing LMWATHF heparin chains was pooled and freeze-dried. Freeze-dried material was resuspended in a small volume of H2O, followed by precipitation of LMWATH heparin chains with 10 volumes of absolute ethanol and recovery of the precipitate pellet by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in H2O and reprecipitated in ethanol two more times to complete the removal of any remaining NaCl. The isolated amino acid capped LMWATHF heparin chains (along with commercial heparin and heparin oligosaccharide standards) were subjected to fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (25Calabro A. Midura R. Wang A. West L. Plaas A. Hascall V.C. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2001; 9: S16-S22Google Scholar), with staining by Safranin O. Comparison of the lane containing LMWATHF heparin chains to that of oligosaccharide standards allowed for definition of chain length in terms of number of saccharide units. The HMWATHF (equivalent to 1.4 mg of AT) and LMWATHF (equivalent to 1.6 mg of AT) samples were subjected to Sepharose-AT chromatography (10 ml column) that was pre-equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl buffer at pH 7.3. After loading, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of 0.15 m NaCl buffer before elution of any bound material, using a linear NaCl gradient and a 2 column volume of 2 m NaCl wash as described above. Fractions were analyzed for protein by measuring absorbances at 280 and 215 nm. Sepharose-AT chromatographic peaks were pooled and then dialyzed against H2O, freeze-dried, and resuspended in 0.15 m NaCl for further activity assays (anti-factor Xa or anti-IIa, described above). HMWH and LMWH were prepared in the same way as described for HMWATHF and LMWATHF, except that 5 mg of heparin was gel-filtered, and heparin analyses were by the protamine sulfate assay.Sepharose-AT Chromatography of Serine Protease-ATH Inhibitor Complexes—Factor Xa-ATH or thrombin-ATH inhibitor complexes were prepared as follows. Each serine protease was used to titrate ATH to ≈100% equivalence, as determined by the presence of a small amount of activity against its chromogenic substrate (CBS 31.39 substrate from the Stachrom heparin kit for factor Xa; S-2238 substrate for thrombin). Factor Xa or thrombin was added to 0.25 mg of ATH (in terms of AT) and, after adjusting the total volume to 1 ml, immediately loaded onto a 1.5-ml Sepharose-AT column. Identical washing and elution protocols were used as those for the larger (10 ml) columns. The various eluted peaks, as well as preformed factor Xa-ATH and thrombin-ATH complexes, were assayed for anti-factor Xa activity as described above. In order to investigate the possibility that excess free AT may actually protect the AT of ATH from attack by protease, competition experiments were carried out. Either factor Xa or thrombin was reacted for various periods with ATH ±100-fold molar excess of added AT at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and the ATH-containing material was purified from free thrombin, factor Xa, or AT by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose using the same method as that for ATH purification given above (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). ATH + enzyme-ATH inhibitor complexes were treated with heparinase for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by SDS-PAGE and staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue R-250 for protein as described previously (11Chan A.K. Berry L. O'Brodovich H. Klement P. Mitchell M. Baranowski B. Monagle P. Andrew M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22111-22117Google Scholar). Laser densitometry of bands on dried gels was carried out to determine the proportion of free ATH (as AT) compared with enzyme complexed ATH (as either factor Xa-AT or thrombin-AT). Comparison of results from lanes of experiments that had no added AT to those with added AT revealed the effect of added AT on direct reaction of ATH with either factor Xa or thrombin.Determination of Binding Affinities Using Intrinsic Fluorescence— All fluorometric determinations were made with stirring in a 1 × 1-cm quartz fluorescence cuvette placed in a cuvette holder heated at 25 °C and using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Experiments were carried out by adding either 1 ml of 100 nm AT, 100 nm AT + 234 nm H, 100 nm ATH, or 100 nm LMWATHF in 0.02 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, to the cuvette, followed by titration with 5 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, containing either 100 nm AT, 100 nm AT + 234 nm H, 100 nm ATH, or 100 nm LMWATHF, respectively. Thus, the NaCl concentration of AT, AT + H, ATH, or LMWATHF was increased from 0 to 2.25 m. Protein intrinsic fluorescence was measured (after each high salt solution addition (added in 10–100-μl increments)) with an excitation at 280 nm and emission detected at 340 nm (with a 290 nm cut-off filter). Excitation and emission slit widths were 5 and 7 nm, respectively. The effect of NaCl on intrinsic fluorescence was determined as the fluorescence intensity after each high salt addition minus the value at equilibrium end point (2.25 m NaCl) and calculated as a percentage of the difference in fluorescence intensity at 0 and 2.25 m NaCl. Values for the percent difference in fluorescence for AT + H, ATH, and LMWATHF were corrected for change in fluorescence of AT alone at similar NaCl c"

The gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex (gp5/trx) polymerizes thousands of nucleotides before dissociating from a primer-template. We have engineered a disulfide linkage between the gene 5 protein and thioredoxin within the binding surface of the two proteins. The polymerase activity of the covalently linked complex (gp5-S-S-trx) is similar to that of gp5/trx on poly(dA)/oligo(dT). However, gp5-S-S-trx has only one third the polymerase activity of gp5/trx on single-stranded M13 DNA. gp5-S-S-trx has difficulty polymerizing nucleotides through sites of secondary structure on M13 DNA and stalls at these sites, resulting in lower processivity. However, gp5-S-S-trx has an identical processivity and rate of elongation when E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB protein) is used to remove secondary structure from M13 DNA. Upon completing synthesis on a DNA template lacking secondary structure, both complexes recycle intact, without dissociation of the processivity factor, to initiate synthesis on a new DNA template. However, a complex stalled at secondary structure becomes unstable, and both subunits dissociate from each other as the polymerase prematurely releases from M13 DNA.

DNA polymerases responsible for copying genomic DNA require high processivity to incorporate thousands of nucleotides without dissociating from the DNA (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 494-496Google Scholar, 2Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Google Scholar, 3Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Google Scholar). In most cases, a DNA polymerase achieves high processivity by utilizing accessory proteins that act as a sliding clamp that encirles the DNA to tether the polymerase to a primed DNA template (4Stukenberg P.T.

For example, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III must have its processivity factor, the β-clamp, pre-assembled on the primer-template before the polymerase can productively bind to the DNA to initiate DNA synthesis. In contrast, several viruses utilize a different mechanism to achieve high processivity. For example, the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 adopts the host protein E. coli thioredoxin (trx) 1The abbreviations used are: trx, thioredoxin; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; nt, nucleotide; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: trx, thioredoxin; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; nt, nucleotide; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding; wt, wild type. as a processivity factor.After infecting its host, E. coli, bacteriophage T7 induces the synthesis of a replicative DNA polymerase, the product of gene 5 (7Grippo P.

Gene 5 protein alone is a distributive enzyme, dissociating from a primed DNA template after incorporation of only a few nucleotides (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1975; 250: 5515-5522Google Scholar, 11Mark D. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 780-784Google Scholar). The complex of T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase and thioredoxin is designated as gp5/trx, also known as T7 DNA polymerase. Thioredoxin allows the gene 5 protein to incorporate thousands of nucleotides per polymerization cycle, a result of an 80-fold increase in the affinity of gp5/trx for the 3′-terminus of the primer-template (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Google Scholar, 9Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Google Scholar). Thioredoxin also markedly increases the 3′-5′ double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity of the polymerase, but does not affect the single-stranded DNA exonuclease activity (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Google Scholar, 12Adler S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11605-11614Google Scholar, 13Hori K. Mark D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11598-11604Google Scholar).The crystal structure of gp5/trx has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution with the polymerase captured in a polymerization mode (Ref. 17Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 157-166Google Scholar and Fig. 1). T7 gene 5 protein is a member of the pol I family of DNA polymerases with three subdomains: palm, fingers, and thumb. The three subdomains together form a DNA binding groove with the palm forming the base of a cleft, and the fingers and thumb creating a wall on each side. In this structure thioredoxin is bound to the polymerase at a flexible loop extending from the thumb and is rotated slightly up and away from the cleft in which the primer-template lies. Previous biochemical studies have characterized the domain in gene 5 protein that is responsible for binding thioredoxin. An amino acid alignment of gene 5 protein with homologous regions of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I revealed a 71 amino acid extension between α-helices H and H1 of the thumb that is absent from the Klenow fragment (18Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Google Scholar). Mutations within this domain affect the ability of the polymerase to bind thioredoxin (19Yang X.-M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6599-6606Google Scholar). Furthermore, insertion of this domain into the corresponding region of the thumb in the Klenow fragment results in a chimeric DNA polymerase that can bind thioredoxin and achieve higher processivity (20Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 479-484Google Scholar).The precise molecular mechanism by which thioredoxin increases the processivity of gp5 is not known. However, unlike the processivity factor of E. coli DNA polymerase III, thioredoxin does not appear to encircle the DNA as a clamp. It is likely that in the crystal structure the polymerase-DNA complex has been captured in a non-processive mode. In a processive mode the thumb and bound thioredoxin is postulated to swing down onto the duplex portion of the primer-template to prevent the DNA from dissociation prior to the next polymerization cycle. Suppressor analysis of a genetically altered thioredoxin supports this scenario (21Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19999-20008Google Scholar). Amino acids in gp5 that restore the ability of the altered thioredoxin to confer processivity on the polymerase reside within the thioredoxin binding segment while another is located within the exonuclease domain. The latter site is interesting since it raises the possibility that the extended loop of the thioredoxin binding segment might swing down and dock on the lip of the crevice located within the exonuclease domain, thus encircling gp5/trx around the DNA within a structure similar to a sliding clamp. Alternatively, thioredoxin could be increasing the electrostatic interactions between the polymerase and the DNA template.At a replication fork, gp5/trx interacts with the T7 gene 4 helicase-primase (14Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Google Scholar) and the T7 gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (40Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Google Scholar) to mediate coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar, 16Lee J. Chastain II, P.D. Kuskabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Google Scholar). Like E. coli DNA polymerase III, gp5/trx synthesizes both strands processively (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar, 16Lee J. Chastain II, P.D. Kuskabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Google Scholar). The leading strand polymerase synthesizes DNA at the replication fork in a continuous manner, while the lagging strand polymerase replicates Okazaki fragments in a discontinuous manner. It is postulated that DNA polymerase III must rapidly recycle from the DNA and β-clamp upon completion of an Okazaki fragment to associate with another pre-assembled β-clamp for processive synthesis of the next Okazaki fragment (3Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Google Scholar). During coordinated DNA synthesis by the T7 replisome, the lagging strand gp5/trx also recycles from a completed Okazaki fragment to a new primer (15Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Google Scholar, 16Lee J. Chastain II, P.D. Kuskabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether gp5 dissociates from thioredoxin as the polymerase recycles. In this study, we have examined the fate of thioredoxin during recycling by forming a covalent linkage between the polymerase and thioredoxin.Thioredoxin is a versatile protein found in all species, serving as a cofactor to reduce disulfide bonds in many proteins (22Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 23Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar). Among its many functions it acts as a hydrogen donor for the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. The activities of thioredoxin have been attributed to two active site cysteines that can form a disulfide linkage between their sulfhydryl groups or can participate in reversible oxidation-reductions with other proteins. The thioredoxin active site cysteines are part of a conserved sequence, Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (residues 32–35) located in a loop that is partially exposed to the surface of the protein (24Holmgren A. Soderberg B.-O. Eklund H. Branden C.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2305-2309Google Scholar, 25Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Google Scholar). This loop participates in a hydrophobic surface that is responsible for binding to protein substrate (26Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Google Scholar). Once bound to a protein having a disulfide bond, residues Cys-32 and Cys-35 of thioredoxin act together to reduce their target substrate. Cys-32 acts as a nucleophile to form a covalently mixed disulfide with the target protein in the transition state (22Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Google Scholar, 23Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Google Scholar, 27Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Google Scholar). Cys-35 then resolves this intermediate mixed disulfide to yield the reduced target protein (27Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Google Scholar).The structure of reduced thioredoxin in gp5/trx is very similar to that of oxidized thioredoxin (17Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 157-166Google Scholar), yet only reduced thioredoxin binds to gene 5 protein (12Adler S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11605-11614Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of gp5/trx the thioredoxin binding loop of gp5 wraps around the base of thioredoxin, burying the active site cysteines (17Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 157-166Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that the active site cysteines are not required for their reducing power when thioredoxin binds gp5 (29Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Google Scholar). Both Cys-32 and Cys-35 can be replaced with residues that abolish the ability of thioredoxin to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions, but these altered forms of thioredoxin can form functional polymerase-thioredoxin complexes in vitro, albeit with a reduced binding affinity. These results show that the active site residues of thioredoxin only function in binding thioredoxin to the polymerase. The three-dimensional structure of gp5/trx supports these findings, revealing that thioredoxin Cys-32 is exposed to the protein-protein interface and hydrogen bonds with Thr-327 of the polymerase thumb (17Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 157-166Google Scholar). Thr-327 of the polymerase selects for reduced thioredoxin through its hydrogen bond with the sulfhydryl group of Cys-32. 2D. Johnson, S. Tabor, T. Ellenberger, and C. C. Richardson, unpublished results. 2D. Johnson, S. Tabor, T. Ellenberger, and C. C. Richardson, unpublished results. This interaction effectively decreases the polarity of Thr-327 within the hydrophobic subunit interface and thus explains the requirement for reduced thioredoxin for binding. Cys-32 of oxidized thioredoxin cannot participate in a hydrogen bond with Thr-327 of gp5 because it forms a disulfide linkage with Cys-35. In the present study we have substituted Thr-327 of the polymerase thumb with cysteine (gp5(T327C)) so that it can react with Cys-32 of thioredoxin to facilitate a mixed disulfide between the two proteins. We have used the covalently linked complex (gp5-S-S-trx) to examine processivity and to determine if there is a requirement for thioredoxin to dissociate when the polymerase recycles from one template to another.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBacterial Strains and DNA—Bacterial strain BL21(DE3), used to express wild-type thioredoxin, was purchased from Invitrogen. E. coli A307 (HrfC, ΔtrxA307) was a gift from Stan Tabor (Harvard Medical School). E. coli A307(DE3) was constructed from E. coli A307 using a DE3 lysogenization kit from Novagen. Using this kit, E. coli A307(DE3) was infected with a λDE3 prophage carrying the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5 control so that expression of cloned genes having a T7 promoter could be induced in the presence of IPTG. T7Δ5 phage, lacking gene 5, were a gift from Stan Tabor. M13 mp18 bacteriophage were a gift from Kajal Chowdhury (Harvard Medical School). M13 phage were grown and purified as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.20-6.21Google Scholar). Single-stranded M13 DNA was purified using a Lambda Maxi kit purchased from Qiagen, Inc. Poly(dA)350-oligo(dT)25 and oligonucleotide primers for M13 DNA were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. Plasmids pGP5-3, pTrx-3, and pGP1-2, vectors having wild-type T7 gene 5, E. coli trxA, and T7 gene 1, respectively, were gifts from Stan Tabor. Plasmid pT7-7, the parent vector of pGP5-3 and pTrx(C35S)-1, was a gift from Stan Tabor. Plasmid pET-24a, the parent vector of pTrxA and pTrx(C35S)-2, was purchased from Novagen.Mutagenesis of T7 Gene 5—Plasmid pGP5(T327C) was constructed by mutagenesis of T7 gene 5 within pGP5-3 using an “overlap extension” method (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The mutagenesis required three separate PCR reactions using using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The first PCR reaction used the primers DJ4 (5′-GAAGGGTTAAACACAACATGTTCAACTGGGCAGTAAGGAGCACCAGCAACGTACT-3′) and BCMP97 (5′-GCATTGACCAAACTGGCAAAG-3′) to generate a 5′ fragment of T7 gene 5 that contains a codon that corresponds to a Thr-327 to Cys alteration. The altered codon of primer DJ4 is underlined. A 3′ fragment containing the same codon was generated in a second PCR reaction using primers DJ3 (5′-AGTACGTTGCTGGTGCTCCTTACTGCCCAGTTGAACATGTTGTGTTTAACCC-3′) and JH8 (5′-GCGAGCCATGAAGTGAGCC-3′). The 5′ and 3′ fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then used in a final PCR reaction. These fragments overlap and generate a longer fragment when amplified with primers BCMP97 and JH8. The final PCR product was purified on an agarose gel, digested with StyI and MfeI, and ligated into corresponding sites on plasmid pGP5-3 to create pGP5(T327C). The desired clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Mutagenesis of E. coli trxA—Plasmid pTrx(C35S) was constructed by mutagenesis of E. coli trxA of plasmid pTrx-3 using a “Megaprimer” method (35Sarker G. Sommer S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). Plasmid pTrx-3 contains a copy of wild-type E. coli trxA. The mutagenesis required two separate PCR reactions using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The first PCR reaction used primer A (5′-GAGTGGTGCGGTCCGTCCAAAATGATCGCCCCGATT-3′) and primer B (5′-GCTTCTAAGCTTCCCTTACGCCAGGTT-3′) to generate a 5′ fragment of the trxA gene having a codon that corresponds to a Cys-35 to Ser alteration. The altered codon of primer A is underlined. This 5′-fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then used in a final PCR reaction with the primer C (5′-GTTGGTAGCGGCCATATGAGCGATAAAATTATTCAC-3′) to generate a full-length copy of the trxA gene with the desired mutation. The final PCR product was purified on an agarose gel, digested with NdeI and HindIII, and ligated into corresponding sites on plasmid pT7-7 to create pTrx (C35S)-1, the plasmid used to express trx(C35S) in the presence of ampicillin for purification. The restricted fragment containing the mutated trxA gene was also ligated into corresponding sites on plasmid pET-24a to create pTrx(C35S)-2, the plasmid used for determining plating efficiencies in the presence of kanamycin. Plasmid pTrxA was used to express wild-type thioredoxin in the presence of kanamycin. It was created by PCR of trxA of plasmid pTrx-3 using primer A and primer C, followed by digestion with NdeI and HindIII, and then ligation into corresponding sites on plasmid pET-24a. The desired clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Other Materials—PfuTurbo DNA polymerase or AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were used for standard PCR reactions. Unlabeled nucleotides (HPLC grade) and [methyl-3H]TTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes NdeI, HindIII, StyI, and MfeI were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ThermoSequenase were from Amersham Biosciences. IPTG, DTT, kanamycin, and ampicillin were obtained from American Bioanalytical. DEAE-cellulose (DE52), phosphocellulose (P11), and DE81 filter papers were obtained from Whatman Paper Ltd. Sephadex G-50, HiTrap heparin columns (5-ml bed volume), HiTrap Q Sepharose HP columns (5-ml bed volume), and agarose-HE were from Amersham Biosciences. Ceramic hydroxyapatite columns (5-ml Econo-PacCHT-II cartridges) and bovine serum albumin were from Bio-Rad.MethodsPlating Efficiencies—Plating efficiencies of T7Δ5 phage were measured on E. coli A307(ΔtrxA) harboring either plasmid pT7-7, pGP5-3, pGP5(T327C), pET-24a, pTrxA, pTrx(C35S)-2, or a combination of two of these plasmids (Table II). Cells having plasmids pT7-7, pGP5-3, and pGP5(T327C) were selected for ampicillin resistance. Cells harboring plasmids pET-24a, pTrxA, and pTrx(C35S)-2 were selected for kanamycin resistance. 10-fold serial dilutions of T7Δ5 phage (100 μl) were mixed with a 100-μl plating culture and 3 ml of top agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.7% agar, pH 7.0) that was preincubated at 48 °C. Mixtures were plated on TB plates at room temperature (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 1.5% agar, pH 7.0) having appropriate antibiotics. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The efficiency of plating was determined by dividing the number of plaque-forming units by the amount of plaque-forming units observed for cells having pTrxA and pGP5-3 and represents an average of at least two experiments.Table IIAbility of gene 5 and trxA mutants to complement phage growthPlasmidMutationEfficiency of platingaPlating efficiencies for wild-type T7Δ5 phage were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” T7Δ5 refers to T7Δ5 phage.

Open table in a new tab Protein Purification—gp5/trx, gene 5 protein, and gp5(T327C) were overexpressed in E. coli A307(DE3) using plasmids pGP5-3/pTrxA, pGP5-3, and pGP5(T327C), respectively and then purified using procedures described previously (3Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Google Scholar). However, hydroxyapatite chromatography was omitted from the purification procedures of gene 5 protein and gp5(T327C). Wild-type thioredoxin was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using plasmid pTrxA and purified as described (20Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 479-484Google Scholar). trx(C35S) is toxic to growth of E. coli BL21(DE3) (data not shown), so this protein was overexpressed in E. coli A307 using a heat shock system as described (36Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar). The heat shock system is a two-plasmid system that maintains toxic proteins under tight transcriptional control. One plasmid, pGP1-2, has the gene for T7 RNA polymerase controlled by the λ PL promoter, the gene for the temperature-sensitive λ repressor cI857, and the gene for kanamycin resistance. The second plasmid is pTrx(C35S)-1, which has the gene for trx(C35S) under control of a T7 promoter and carrying the gene for ampicillin resistance. The λ repressor cI857 tightly represses expression of T7 RNA polymerase at 25 °C, but exclusive expression of trx(C35S) is achieved after heat induction of T7 RNA polymerase at 42 °C. Thus, E. coli A307 was transformed with both plasmids pGP1-2 and pTrx(C35S)-1 in the presence of kanamycin and ampicillin, and then initially grown at 25 °C until an OD600 of 1. The cells were heat-induced at 42 °C for 1 h followed by protein synthesis for 3 h at 37 °C. trx(C35S) was then purified from cells using procedures previously described for wild-type thioredoxin (36Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Google Scholar).The covalently linked gp5-S-S-trx was formed by mixing 20 μm purified gp5(T327C) and 150 μm trx(C35S) overnight at 0 °C in 4 ml of buffer containing 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol. gp5-S-S-trx was purified from both free gp5(T327C) and trx(C35S) on a HiTrap heparin column (5-ml bed volume) at 4 °C after diluting the mixture 10-fold with Buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). After loading the diluted mixture on the HiTrap heparin column using a BioCad Sprint System (Perseptive BioSystems Inc.), the column was washed with 200 mm NaCl in Buffer H to remove free trx(C35S). gp5-S-S-trx was separated from free gp5(T327C) using a 200–800 mm NaCl continuous gradient in Buffer H over 60 min. Under these conditions, gp5-S-S-trx eluted at 610 mm NaCl and was determined to be greater than 95% pure by analysis on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel. Purified gp5-S-S-trx was stored at –12 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as a standard.DNA Polymerase Assays—DNA polymerase activity was measured by procedures modified from those previously described (3Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Structure. 1998; 6: 121-125Google Scholar, 37Kumar J.K. Kremsdorf R. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 82: 46151-46159Google Scholar, 38Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Google Scholar). The DNA polymerase assay (300 μl) for M13 DNA contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 250 μm each dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and [3H]TTP (10 cpm/pmol). Reactions also had 14 nm single-stranded M13 mp8 DNA primed with a 17-nt oligonucleotide (–40 primer) and 4 nm of either gp5/trx or gp5-S-S-trx. The polymerase assays were carried out at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were removed at the times indicated and stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. Aliquots were spotted on DE81 ion exchange filters, and unincorporated radiolabeled nucleotides were washed away with three successive 10-min washes in 300 mm ammonium formate (pH 8.0). Filters were dried under a heat lamp, and the amount of [3H]dTMP incorporated was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Assays to study the effect of E. coli SSB protein on polymerase activity contained 60 μg of SSB protein per 300 μl of reaction mixture. Reactions to monitor polymerase activity on poly(dA)350-oligo(dT)25 were similar for those with single-stranded M13 DNA except poly(dA)350-oligo(dT)25 was added at a concentration of 200 nm, resulting in a 50-fold molar excess of DNA over polymerase. Reactions involving poly(dA)350-oligo(dT)25 were incubated at 25 °C.M13 DNA (100 nm) was primed for polymerase assays by annealing with a 17-nt primer (–40 primer) in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. Annealing reactions were incubated at 75 °C for 5 min followed by 30 min at room temperature. For polymerase assays using linear DNA templates, poly(dA)350 (2 μm) was annealed to an oligo(dT)25 primer in a 1:1 molar ratio at 0 °C for 30 min.Exonuclease Activity—The 3′ to 5′ single- and double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity of gp5/trx and gp5-S-S-trx were assayed using procedures modified from those previously described (37Kumar J.K. Kremsdorf R. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 82: 46151-46159Google Scholar, 39Chowdhury K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12469-12474Google Scholar). Uniformly 3H-labeled double-stranded M13 DNA was prepared by annealing a 17-nt primer (–40 primer) to M13 mp8 DNA. The primer was partially extended by 8 nm gp5/trx in a DNA polymerase reaction containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 20 μm each dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and [3H]TTP (10 cpm/pmol). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and stopped by heating at 75 °C for 5 min, followed by re-annealing at room temperature for 30 min. The labeled DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and then purified by passing through Biospin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) to remove free nucleotides. Radiolabeled single-stranded M13 DNA was prepared by alkali denaturation of 3H-labeled double-stranded M13 DNA by treatment with 50 mm NaOH at room temperature for 15 min followed by neutralization with HCl.The double-stranded DNA exonuclease assays (200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 16 nm gp5/trx or gp5-S-S-trx, and 8 nm3H-labeled, double-stranded M13 mp8 DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 20 μl aliquots were removed at 1-min intervals from 1 to 10 min and stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm. Aliquots were spotted on DE81 ion exchange filters and washed with three successive 10-min washes of 300 mm ammonium formate (pH 8.0).

https://openalex.org/W2005981194,"The nick-directed DNA repair efficiency of a set of M13mp18-derived heteroduplexes containing 8-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 27-, 45-, and 429-nucleotide loops was determined by in vitro assay. Unpaired nucleotides of each heteroduplex reside within overlapping recognition sites for two restriction endonucleases, permitting independent evaluation of repair occurring on either DNA strand. Our results show that a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the loop is sufficient to direct heterology repair to the nicked strand in Escherichia coli extracts. Strand-specific repair by this system requires Mg2+ and the four dNTPs and is equally efficient on insertions and deletions. This activity is distinct from the MutHLS mismatch repair pathway. Strand specificity and repair efficiency are largely independent of the GATC methylation state of the DNA and presence of the products of mismatch repair genes mutH, mutL, and mutS.

This study provides evidence for a loop repair pathway in E. coli that is distinct from conventional mismatch repair. DNA mispairs can occur within the DNA helix as a consequence of DNA biosynthetic errors or as a result of recombinational strand transfer between nonidentical sequences (1Streisinger G. Okada Y.

Such pairing errors may take the form of base-base mismatches or loops, in which one strand contains one or more unpaired nucleotides. Strand-specific correction of base-base and loop mismatches produced during DNA biosynthesis plays an important role in mutation avoidance (2Meselson M. Low K.B.

Base-base mispairs are subject to strand-specific correction by the mismatch repair system of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (5Kolodner R.

The Escherichia coli mismatch repair pathway will correct loops up to about 7 unpaired nucleotides, but larger heterologies are poorly processed by this system (11Dohet C. Dzidic S. Wagner R.

A similar specificity is characteristic of the human mismatch repair system, which can correct loops up to about 10 unpaired nucleotides (15Parsons R. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Fang W.-H. Papadopoulos N.

There is evidence that eukaryotes can rectify large unpaired heterologies by a pathway distinct from the mismatch repair system. Available evidence suggests that specificities of the eukaryotic mismatch repair and large loop repair systems partially overlap. When transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plasmids harboring 8- or 12-base heterologies undergo loop correction (18Bishop D.K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and repair is partially reduced but not eliminated by inactivation in the mismatch repair gene PMS1 (19Bishop D.K. Williamson M.S.

Transformation of monkey cells with heteroduplex DNAs containing unpaired single-stranded loops has indicated that mammalian cells can rectify such structures (22Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Somat. Cell Mol.

In vitro experiments have also indicated that human cells possess a system distinct from the mismatch repair for processing heteroduplexes with large heterologies. Umar et al. (16Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) found that incised heteroduplexes containing 8- and 16-nucleotide loops were repaired in nick-directed fashion in extracts of a mismatch repair-deficient cell line. Littman et al. (26Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that nicked heteroduplexes containing 12-, 27-, 62- and 216-nucleotide loops are processed in a strand-specific manner and are independent of the mismatch repair system. Prokaryotes also possess a mechanism that mediates repair of large loops. Using transfection assay, Dohet et al. (11Dohet C. Dzidic S. Wagner R. Radman M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated repair of a bacteriophage λ heteroduplex containing an 800-nucleotide unpaired insertion heterology by a pathway that was independent of mutH, mutL, and mutS gene function. By contrast, Carraway and Marinus (13Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to detect repair of large heterologies upon transformation of covalently closed circular plasmid heteroduplexes into E. coli. However, if repair is elicited by a nearby mismatch, large loops will undergo correction. Although strand breaks are known to be sufficient for efficient correction by conventional mismatch repair systems (6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), a potential activating role for strand discontinuities in large heterology repair in E. coli has not been reported. To test this possibility, we have constructed a set of heteroduplexes containing unpaired loops of 8–429 nucleotides, evaluated the dependence of repair on presence and placement of a single-strand break, and tested the possibility that strand placement of a genetic heterology may confer asymmetry on the rectification process. Materials—E. coli strains NM522, RS5033, GM3773 (mutH471::Tn5), GM2931 (mutL25), RK1517 (mutS201::Tn5), and bacteriophage M13mp18 were as described (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E. coli DNA ligase, ATP-dependent DNase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs or Amersham Biosciences. M13 Mutants—Bacteriophages M13LR1, LR3, LR8, LR10, and LR12 have been described previously (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phage M13LR2 was constructed by insertion of 5′-CTAGAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGCA-3′ annealed with 3′-TCGTCGTCGTCGTCGTCGTGATC-5′ into M13LR1 that had been digested with NheI. Phage M13LR4 was constructed by insertion of an NheI-SalI restriction fragment derived from plasmid pBR322 (coordinates 229–651) into NheI, XhoI-cleaved M13LR1. Phage M13LR15 was constructed by mutagenizing gapped duplex (27Kramer W. Drutsa V. Jansen H.W. Kramer B. Pflugfelder M. Fritz H.J.

Mutant M13LR phages were identified by restriction analysis of replicative form minipreparation and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. The set of M13LR derivatives produced in this manner allowed preparation of G-T mismatch and 8-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 27-, 45-, and 429-nucleotide insertion/deletion heteroduplexes (see Table I). Unmethylated phage DNAs were isolated from RS5033, whereas fully methylated phage replicative form DNAs were isolated from NM522.Table IM13LR heteroduplex substratesDNAVMarkersCGTLR1XhoILR3HindIIIC8LR12XhoILR10NcoIC12LR8XhoILR15EcoRVV12LR15EcoRVLR8XhoIC16LR12XhoILR15EcoRVV16LR15EcoRVLR12XhoIC22mp18HindIIILR1XhoIV22LR1XhoImp18HindIIIV27LR10NcoImp18HindIIIC45mp18HindIIILR2XhoIV45LR2XhoImp18HindIIIV429LR4NheImp18HindIII Open table in a new tab Construction of Heteroduplex DNA—Heteroduplex DNA substrates were constructed essentially under the conditions of Lu et al. (28Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GATC-methylated M13LR derivative replicative form DNA (1 mg) was linearized with BglI or EcoRI and mixed with a 4-fold molar excess of unmethylated viral DNA, followed by alkaline denaturation and annealing. After isolation by hydroxyapatite chromatography, double strand linear homoduplex DNA was removed by treatment with ATP-dependent DNase as described (29Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The open circular heteroduplex was purified by Sephadex G-200 (Sigma) chromatography and benzoylated naphthylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) chromatography in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The strand break generated by EcoRI was about 49 bp 3′ to the heterology for the loop size greater than 22 nucleotides and about 70 bases 3′ to the smaller loops. A nick generated by BglI was about 150 bp 5′ to the loops. The several-bp variation in the nick heterology distance for the different heteroduplexes is a consequence of the presence of different restriction site markers in the different heterologies. Covalently closed DNA was ligated with E. coli DNA ligase in the presence of ethidium bromide (96 mmol of dye/mol of nucleotide) and isolated by equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl/ethidium bromide (28Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Substrates containing fully methylated GATC sites were prepared by treatment of hemimethylated heteroduplex with Dam methylase as described (28Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Substrates used in this study are summarized in Table I and Fig. 1. By pairing different M13LR insertion derivatives, heteroduplexes containing base-base mismatch or distinct site-specific insertions/deletions were constructed. Extrahelical segments can be located within either viral or complementary strand. Repair Assays—Growth of cells and preparation of cell extracts were as described by Lu et al. (28Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Repair in concentrated E. coli lysate was carried out in 10-μl reactions containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 5 mm MgCl2; bovine serum albumin at 50 μg/ml; 1 mm ATP; 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP; and 0.1 μg (21 fmol) of heteroduplex DNA. The optimal concentration of E. coli extracts was 7.5–10 mg of protein/ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, reactions were terminated by adding 30 μl of 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA products were quantitated after ethidium stain using a gel documentation CCD camera (UVP Ltd.) (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Heteroduplexes in Which the Large DNA Heterologies Reside in a Similar Sequence Environment— Starting from phage M13mp18, we have prepared a set of M13LR derivatives (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that contain extra nucleotides within the polylinker region located between the single EcoRI and HindIII sites of M13mp18. This set of M13LR derivatives permits construction of heteroduplexes representing base pair mismatches and 8-, 12-, 16-, 22-, 27-, 45-, and 429-nucleotide insertion/deletion heterologies (Fig. 1 and Table I). The heterology in each of these heteroduplexes is located within a similar environment. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, each insertion/deletion mispair is located within overlapping restriction endonuclease recognition sites, permitting independent evaluation of correction on either DNA strand. Digestion of the heteroduplex DNA with AlwNI (Fig. 1) and the indicator restriction endonuclease, whose recognition site is blocked by the presence of the heterology (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), will yield a 7.2-kb fragment only. Similar digestion of DNA in which the recognition sequence has been restored by repair will yield 4.1- and 3.1-kb fragments. All substrates used here were refractory to the digestion by the indicator restriction endonucleases in the absence of repair (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (data not shown). GATC methylation state dictates the strand specificity of E. coli MutHLS dependent mismatch repair pathway (6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Thus, we also constructed large loop substrates of different methylation states to evaluate the effect of this system. The M13mp18 DNA contains six d(GATC) sequences, which are targets for Dam methylation (Fig. 1). The level of methylation is more difficult to determine for single-strand viral DNA than for double-strand replicative form DNA, which can be analyzed by digestion with DpnI and MboI. Hence, in this study, the unmethylated V-strand of hemimethylated heteroduplex was prepared from the purified phage grown in dam– E. coli strain, and the methylated C+ strand was prepared from the RF DNA grown in Dam methylase-proficient strain. The fully methylated substrates were also prepared and analyzed. Although the E. coli mismatch repair system is able to repair small insertion/deletion mismatches in a methyl-directed, strand-specific manner (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the activity of this system on such structures appears to be restricted to heterologies containing less than about seven unpaired nucleotides (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although strand breaks are known to be required for efficient correction by eukaryotic loop repair systems (6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), a potential activation role for strand discontinuities in large heterology repair in E. coli has not been tested. In order to clarify the nature of this reaction, we have constructed a set of circular heteroduplexes in which the nick was located at different positions to evaluate the potential role of strand-specific single-strand breaks in the processing of such structures. We designate these heteroduplexes according to the DNA strand containing the unpaired segment, the number of unpaired nucleotides in the heterology, and placement of the strand break 3′ or 5′ to the heterology as viewed along the shorter path joining the two DNA sites in the circular DNA. Nick-directed Repair of Large DNA Heterologies in Vitro— Heteroduplexes containing large insertion/deletion heterologies and a site-specific strand break were tested for repair in E. coli cell-free extracts. Table II compares the efficiency of correction of all heteroduplexes as scored by restriction endonuclease digestion, and Fig. 2 illustrates typical results obtained with the restriction assay.Table IIEfficiency of loop repair in E. coli extractsRepairSubstratesRK1517NM522C+V-C+V-fmolCC-CircleC-220.54 ± 0.330.31 ± 0.060.58 ± 0.081.0 ± 0.14V-220.86 ± 0.231.3 ± 0.171.0 ± 0.271.6 ± 0.323′-CircleC-82.7 ± 0.230.5 ± 0.192.9 ± 0.201.7 ± 0.28C-126.1 ± 0.680.16 ± 0.146.0 ± 0.520.60 ± 0.13C-168.4 ± 0.130.16 ± 0.059.8 ± 0.310.96 ± 0.36V-165.6 ± 0.240.60 ± 0.104.6 ± 0.170.37 ± 0.16C-222.9 ± 0.730.67 ± 0.413.0 ± 0.311.1 ± 0.06V-225.4 ± 0.370.53 ± 0.015.3 ± 0.560.97 ± 0.04C-279.4 ± 0.690.89 ± 0.629.7 ± 0.301.4 ± 0.45V-275.4 ± 0.251.1 ± 0.216.0 ± 0.502.2 ± 0.18C-455.7 ± 0.700.72 ± 0.126.2 ± 0.333.3 ± 0.32V-454.8 ± 0.120.67 ± 0.464.8 ± 0.314.1 ± 0.23V-4296.1 ± 1.01.7 ± 0.387.6 ± 0.352.7 ± 0.38G-T0.99 ± 0.300.09 ± 0.151.7 ± 0.155.2 ± 0.315′-CircleC-85.5 ± 0.250.73 ± 0.176.5 ± 0.791.0 ± 0.96C-126.5 ± 1.10.27 ± 0.246.6 ± 0.480.67 ± 0.15C-163.4 ± 0.20.38 ± 0.243.4 ± 0.230.51 ± 0.14V-163.4 ± 0.40.46 ± 0.204.2 ± 0.260.75 ± 0.25C-223.6 ± 0.330.24 ± 0.154.0 ± 0.250.20 ± 0.06V-226.3 ± 0.600.41 ± 0.367.2 ± 0.631.0 ± 0.31V-273.2 ± 0.540.90 ± 0.263.2 ± 0.251.5 ± 0.16C-453.3 ± 0.120.77 ± 0.123.9 ± 0.251.5 ± 0.21V-453.1 ± 0.121.1 ± 0.083.4 ± 0.122.5 ± 0.13V-4296.5 ± 0.501.7 ± 0.507.8 ± 0.602.5 ± 0.26G-T3.6 ± 0.560.48 ± 0.174.4 ± 0.353.5 ± 0.44 Open table in a new tab It is known that a single-strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to a mispair is sufficient to provide strand specificity for MutHLS-dependent mismatch repair (6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). In order to avoid MutHLS-dependent activity complicating our analysis, we choose to test extracts from a mismatch repair-deficient RK1517 mutS strain. As shown in Table II, unpaired heterologies of 22 nucleotides located in the complementary strand or viral strand of a covalently closed circular heteroduplexes were subject to limited processing in both mismatch-proficient and -deficient cell extracts (Table II, CC-circle). By contrast, unpaired heterologies of various size ranges were efficiently rectified in open circular DNAs containing a nick about 49 or 70 base pairs 3′ to the loop, or about 150 base pairs 5′ to the unpaired region in the 7.2-kilobase pair circular heteroduplexes (Fig. 2 and Table II). In reactions containing the MutS-deficient extract, repair of these DNAs displayed a substantial bias (4–40-fold) toward the incised DNA strand, although significant repair was detected on the closed DNA strand in some cases (Table II; 3′-V27, 3′-V429, 5′-V45, and 5′-V429). A G-T mismatch was used as a positive control for methyl-directed mismatch repair. As shown in Table II, the efficiency of nick-directed correction of these large heterologies was 50–180% of that observed for a 3′-G-T mismatch on the unmethylated strand when extracts were derived from the methyl-directed repair-proficient NM522 cells. Whereas all of the 3′- and 5′-heteroduplexes used in this study contained the strand break in the complementary strand, the substrates included several with the unpaired heterology present in either the complementary or viral strand (Table II). When the loop was present in the C strand, processing of the 3′- or 5′-heteroduplex produced the deletion repair product, whereas the presence of the loop in the V strand yielded the insertion repair product. Consequently, the strand-specific asymmetry observed for repair of 5′-heteroduplexes cannot be attributed to the simple presence of an unpaired segment in a particular DNA strand. Rather, this effect must be due to the strand break. This conclusion is also consistent with the finding that unpaired heterologies of C22 and V22 are processed only at a basal level and without evident strand bias when present in closed circular DNAs (Table II). Thus, although basal processing of unpaired heterologies does occur, the presence of a nick substantially increases the efficiency of the reaction and confers strand specificity on the process. These results clearly indicated that loop heterologies can be processed by a pathway distinct from MutHLS methyl-directed system. Unpaired heterologies of different sizes were corrected in mutS cells with efficiencies that varied up to 3-fold (Table II; III′C-8 versus 3′C-27). In order to clarify the nature of this substrate specificity, we further tested this set in mismatch repair-proficient NM522 cells. As shown in Table II, nick-directed repair of these heterologies in NM522 extracts occurred at levels similar to those observed with extracts of mutS cells (Table II, compare C+ entries of NM522 and RK1517). However, significant repair was detected on the unmethylated closed DNA strand in some cases (Table II, V– entries of NM522). The variable level of repair observed on the unmethylated strand with NM522 could be due in part to the methyl-directed reaction. Additional evidence supporting this view is described below. Low Level in Vitro Correction of Large Loops Is MutS- and Methylation State-dependent—Although repair of these large loop DNAs displayed a substantial bias (up to 12-fold) toward the incised DNA strand, significant repair was detected on the unmethylated closed DNA strand, in some cases with NM522 extracts (see Table II, V– entries of V45 and V429). Moreover, almost all the loop repair that occurred on the unmethylated closed strand in NM522 extracts was slightly higher than that observed with extracts derived from mutS cells (Table II, V– entries of NM522 and RK1517). This observation suggested that a heteroduplex containing a large loop may provoke some level of methyl-directed repair. To ascertain that part of large loop repair was truly methyl-directed, we tested a subset of heteroduplex substrates in the fully methylated state (Table III). Since methylated d(GATC) sequences are resistant to nicking by MutH endonucleases (31Welsh K.M. Lu A.L. Clark S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15624-15629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), methyl-directed correction of mismatched bases and loops should be greatly reduced under these conditions. The results obtained with fully methylated V+/C+ heteroduplexes (Table III) are consistent with this prediction. The repair levels of G-T mismatch on methylated viral strands in wild-type extracts were much lower than unmethylated counterparts in Table II. Repair on methylated viral strands of C45, V45, and V429 heteroduplexes by NM522 extracts were also reduced to the levels observed with hemimethylated DNAs in MutS-deficient extracts. Thus, we attribute the low, but detectable, level of repair that occurs on the unmethylated strand of substrates containing a large heterology to the methyl-directed pathway.Table IIIMethylation and nick dependence in loop repairRepairSubstratesRK1517NM522C+V+C+V+fmol3′-CircleG-T1.0 ± 0.170.21 ± 0.191.1 ± 0.330.33 ± 0.15C454.4 ± 0.250.48 ± 0.173.8 ± 0.591.0 ± 0.10V455.2 ± 0.291.1 ± 0.083.9 ± 0.480.70 ± 0.24V4296.1 ± 0.342.9 ± 0.485.8 ± 0.252.4 ± 0.185′-CircleG-T6.2 ± 0.271.1 ± 0.035.5 ± 0.340.61 ± 0.34C453.0 ± 0.301.2 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.250.56 ± 0.08V453.9 ± 0.400.94 ± 0.262.1 ± 0.190.53 ± 0.17V4296.5 ± 0.602.4 ± 0.376.4 ± 0.172.2 ± 0.42 Open table in a new tab Requirements for Nick-directed Loop Repair in E. coli Extracts—The only exogenous cofactors required for in vitro loop repair by E. coli extracts are Mg2+ and four dNTPs. Omission of any of these components resulted in substantial decrease in repair of the several 3′-heteroduplexes tested (Table IV). The addition of exogenous ATP was not required in loop repair (Table IV). This observation further distinguishes large loop repair from the conventional mismatch repair system, since ATP is essential for the MutHLS pathway (6Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the dATP used for repair resynthesis may substitute for ATP required in the reaction.Table IVReaction requirements of nick-directed loop repairReaction conditions3′-C163′-V273′-C453′-V429Complete100100100100Without Mg<1<1<1<1Without ATP10098117115Without dNTPs22333839 Open table in a new tab Genetic Independence of Nick-directed Loop Repair from Mismatch Repair—Methyl-directed mismatch repair is dependent on the product of mutH, mutL, and mutS genes. In addition, MutHLS have been implicated in the repair of 1–7-base deletion heteroduplexes (12Parker B.O. Marinus M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consequently, cell extracts were prepared from E. coli strains that were defective in each of these gene products and were assayed with large nucleotide insertion/deletion heteroduplexes described above. As shown in Table II, correction of large nucleotide heterologies is independent of the presence of the mutS gene product in crude extracts. Large loop repair is also independent of the mismatch genes mutL and mutH, as deduced from assays using extracts from a mutant strain (Table V). Correction was assayed using the nicked C12, V22, C45, and V429 substrates. Loop repair on nicked strand occurred at similar levels in extracts from mutL and mutH mutants and the wild-type control. Thus, in our system there is no defect in nick-directed loop repair activity associated with mutH, mutL, or mutS mutations.Table VMismatch repair-deficient cell extracts are capable of in vitro large loop repair in nick-directed fashionRepairSubstratesGM2931 (mutL)GM3773 (mutH)C+V-C+V-fmol3′-CircleG-T0.66 ± 0.210.52 ± 0.162.1 ± 0.441.5 ± 0.14C125.4 ± 0.410.27 ± 0.116.2 ± 0.190.37 ± 0.10V224.9 ± 0.650.41 ± 0.125.4 ± 0.160.53 ± 0.10C455.9 ± 0.321.2 ± 0.256.1 ± 0.511.5 ± 0.37V4296.0 ± 0.311.6 ± 0.406.5 ± 0.252.4 ± 0.315′-CircleG-T6.0 ± 0.071.4 ± 0.286.1 ± 0.640.68 ± 0.05C126.6 ± 0.510.13 ± 0.136.2 ± 0.170.35 ± 0.22V227.0 ± 0.500.47 ± 0.277.4 ± 0.200.68 ± 0.36C454.0 ± 0.330.63 ± 0.033.6 ± 0.570.45 ± 0.11V4296.8 ± 0.301.6 ± 0.306.9 ± 0.302.2 ± 0.32 Open table in a new tab Nick-stimulated Repair Efficiency Is Independent of the Distance Separating the Loop and the Strand Break—If a nick is used as an entry point for helicase and/or nucleases involved in nick-stimulated loop repair, then the location of the nick relative to the loop may provide information about the length of repair patches associated with loop correction. In order to assess dependence of the reaction on location of the strand break, we further prepared modified C22, V22, and C45 substrates in which a single-strand break was placed 655 or 3154 bp 5′ to the loop. Heteroduplexes in the covalently closed circular form were also prepared as controls. As summarized in Fig. 3, unpaired heterologies of 22 or 45 nucleotides were subjected to only low level processing in E. coli extracts when present in a covalently closed circular DNA. A strand break located as far as 3154 bp 5′ to a mispair is sufficient to provoke the loop repair (Fig. 3, V22 and C45). This observation suggests that E. coli loop repair can function even under conditions of large nick heterology separation distance. Thus, although basal processing of unpaired heterologies does occur (Table II and Fig. 3, ccc entries), the presence of a strand break substantially increases the efficiency of the reaction and confers strand specificity on the process. The low levels of strand-independent reaction that we observe with covalently closed circular heteroduplexes could be the consequence of events directed by a strand break produced by endogenous endonucleases present in the extracts. The same activity may produce the low level of nick-independent repair on the closed strand of the mutS reaction (Table II). However, with increasing length of heterology, we have occasionally observed higher levels of reaction on heteroduplexes that are independent of MutS and strand break (Table II, V– entries of V27, C45, V45, and V429 in RK1517). Consequently, it is possible that large loops may be directly recognized and processed in a nick-independent fashion by other activities. Repair in these cases may be mediated by mechanisms such as the pathway described by Fishel et al. (32Fishel R. Kolodner R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3046-3052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major finding of this study is that repair of loops in E. coli extracts can be very efficient. In vitro assays with loops of 8, 12, 16, 22, 27, 45, and 429 nucleotides show a high level of correction for all substrates. Under these assay conditions, the efficiency of loop repair was comparable with that of methyl-directed mismatch repair. This extent of correction indicates that bacteria have substantial capacity to correct loop size well beyond the range of mismatch repair (14Fang W.-H. Wu J.-Y. Su M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22714-22720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The other significant conclusion from this study is that in vitro loop repair in bacteria shows close similarity to loop repair activities identified in extracts of yeast (20Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17605-17611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (16Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the independence these systems with respect to mismatch repair components suggest conservation of function, although the activities responsible for large heterology repair have not been established in any organism. Large heterologies were subject to limited processing when present in covalently closed circular heteroduplexes, but repair was enhanced substantially by a strand break placed 3′ or 5′ to the loop, and in this case, rectification was highly biased to the incised strand. This dependence on nick but not Dam methylation state also distinguishes the reaction from mismatch repair, which can be directed to the unmethylated strand by a hemimethylated d(GATC) site. The two pathways are also dissimilar, as judged by the nature of reaction requirement (Table IV). Transformation of E. coli cells with plasmid heteroduplexes by Carraway and Marinus (13Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has previously indicated that large loops are not rectified in E. coli cells. In contrast, we have observed a significant degree of nick-dependent processing of large loops in cell extracts of E. coli. There are several potential explanations for the different observations. Whereas our heteroduplexes contained a strand break that activates large heterology repair, the transformation studies relied on covalently closed, circular DNAs, which we have found to be relatively weak substrates for large loop repair. The results of Carraway and Marinus may also have been complicated by strand loss effects that have been observed during transformation of E. coli with heteroduplex DNAs (13Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments in eukaryotic cells clearly indicate that a 5′ nick can be utilized to direct loop repair to the discontinuous strand. This preference is strong in human cell extracts (26Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and also occurs to a lesser extent in yeast extracts (20Corrette-Bennett S.E. Parker B.O. Mohlman N.L. Lahue R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17605-17611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The loop repair activity in E. coli extracts demonstrates a similar preference. However, the interpretation of 5′-substrate reaction in E. coli extracts may be complicated by DNA polymerase I-mediated nick translation activity (Tables II and V, C+ reactions of 5′-G-T). Although we cannot exclude this possibility, it is important to note that we have observed variable repair efficiencies for different heterologies under conditions where each is directed by the same 5′-strand break. Furthermore, we have demonstrated effective heterology repair when the nick directing the reaction is located 3′ to the loop. This observation excludes the possibility of nick translation activity, since such an activity would depend on a 5′ nick location. It therefore seems highly unlikely that the correction events described above are a mere consequence of nonspecific nick translation. Effective correction of 3′-circles in E. coli cells also suggests that bacterial nick-directed loop repair has broader substrate specificity than that observed in the human pathway (26Littman S.J. Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The demonstration of strand-specific repair of loops in E. coli extracts raises questions concerning the function of this reaction. Although such a system may function in the processing of recombination heteroduplexes, the strand specificity of the reaction suggests a role in correction of insertion/deletion heterologies that arise by DNA misalignment events during replication (1Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harber Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 33Kunkel T.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The observation of Fig. 3 that the efficiency of E. coli loop repair is independent of the distance separating the loop and the strand break suggests that the nick may act as a strand signal and not as a free end for excision and resynthesis. A nick as a strand signal and activator in heteroduplex corrections is not without precedent. Varlet et al. (34Varlet I. Canard B. Brooks P. Cerovic G. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10156-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DNA strand breaks act as signals rather than excision points in Xenopus mismatch repair. Furthermore, the experiments on the mechanism of lagging strand replication by E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme demonstrated that the replicase cycles from one DNA site to another via preassembled DNA sliding clamps. It was suggested that the clamp, left on the DNA at the internal DNA termini (e.g. those of the Okazaki fragments) may be harnessed by other machineries coordinated with chromosome replication (e.g. the repair and recombination systems) and used as a signal for the newly synthesized strand (35Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 36Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, editing of DNA replication and recombination processes by the loop repair components could be accomplished using strand discontinuities as strand discrimination signals. Together, mismatch repair and loop repair provide complementary correction of loops that range from one to hundreds of nucleotides. There appears to be overlap between pathways for certain loops. Since we have found that repair of 45- and 429-nucleotide loops are partially dependent on MutS and methylation state, we propose that the sequence of the loop may adopt a configuration suitable for MutS recognition. These results imply that mismatch repair has, under certain circumstances, some activity on loops as large as 429 bases. The overlapping substrate specificities of mismatch and loop repair systems may serve to ensure coverage of a wide spectrum of possible insertion/deletion heterologies. Isolation of the activities involved in the pathway and the identification of the corresponding structural genes should serve to further clarify the roles of this system. We are grateful to Dr. Paul Modrich for critically reviewing the manuscript."
