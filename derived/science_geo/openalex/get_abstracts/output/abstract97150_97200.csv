https://openalex.org/W1988747931,"By sucking on a nonnutritive nipple in different ways, a newborn human could produce either its mother's voice or the voice of another female. Infants learned how to produce the mother's voice and produced it more often than the other voice. The neonate's preference for the maternal voice suggests that the period shortly after birth may be important for initiating infant bonding to the mother."

His performance on other memory tests with digits equaled that of memory experts with lifelong training. With an appropriate mnemonic system, there is seemingly no limit to memory performance with practice."
https://openalex.org/W2166376385,Platelet activating factor obtained from antigen-stimulated rabbit buffy coat leukocytes containing 10% IgE-sensitized basophils was shown by gas-liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis of products after acetolysis and by base and acid hydrolysis to be acetyl-alkylglyceryl phosphorylcholine. The alkyl side chains were composed of octadecyl (greater than 90%) and hexadecyl (less than 10%) residues.
https://openalex.org/W2017602527,"The expression of human esterase D was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively in five persons with partial deletions or duplications of chromosome 13. The results showed that the locus of this enzyme is at band 13q14. Deletion of this same band in other subjects has been found previously to indicate a predisposition to the development of retinoblastoma, which was present in the four individuals in this study who had partial deletions of chromosome 13. Because of this close synteny, esterase D evaluation should aid in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of retinoblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1971538017,"We have measured the extent to which structural gene expression is regulated in an entire tobacco plant. Using a sensitive RNA-excess/single-copy DNA hybridization strategy (Galau et al., 1976), our studies reveal that 3.0–3.4 × 107 nucleotides of single-copy transcript, or 24,000–27,000 average-sized mRNAs, are present in the polysomes of each organ system (leaf, root, stem, petal, anther and ovary). These mRNA sets are transcribed individually from 4.7-5.2% of the single-copy DNA. Approximately 1 × 107 nucleotides of single-copy transcript, or 8000 diverse mRNAs, were shown to be shared by the polysomes of all organs. The sequence composition of the remaining polysomal mRNAs was found to be highly regulated, each organ having at least 8 × 106 nucleotides of mRNA complexity, or 6000 diverse gene transcripts, which are not present in the polysomes of other organs. Hybridization experiments with nuclear RNA revealed that structural genes not utilized for the production of functional mRNAs in a given were nevertheless transcribed, and were represented by transcripts in the hnRNA. This suggests that post-transcriptional selection mechanisms may play an important role in the regulation of plant gene expression. Collectively, our measurements demonstrate that at least 11% of the single-copy DNA, or 60,000 diverse structural genes, are expressed in the entire plant during the dominant phase of its life cycle. This amount of genetic information constitutes only 4.6% of the tobacco genome."
https://openalex.org/W2067066858,"Three-month-old infants learned to activate a crib mobile by means of operant footkicks. Retention of the conditioned response was assessed during a cued recall test with the nonmoving mobile. Although forgetting is typically complete after an 8-day retention interval, infants who received a reactivation treatment--a brief exposure to the reinforcer 24 hours before retention testing--showed no forgetting after retention intervals of either 2 or 4 weeks. Further, the forgetting function after a reactivation treatment did not differ from the original forgetting function. These experiments demonstrate that (i) ""reactivation"" or ""reinstatement"" is an effective mechanism by which early experiences can continue to influence behavior over lengthy intervals and (ii) memory deficits in young infants are best viewed as retrieval deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1986208323,Quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography and diaminobenzidine cytochemistry provide evidence for an uptake and vesicular transport mechanism for iodine-125-labeled immunoglobulin A from plasma to bile by hepatocytes in vivo. The data confirm the existence of a hepatobiliary pathway for secretion of immunoglobulin A into the intestine and are consistent with a vesicular transport mechanism for biliary proteins within liver parenchymal cells.
https://openalex.org/W1988871512,"In a dye-sensitized photooxidation system, lens crystallin polypeptides become cross-linked, and a blue fluorescence that is associated with the proteins is produced. These changes are similar to those seen in vivo in the aging human lens. Evidence implicating singlet oxygen as the causative agent of the effects in vitro is presented, and the possibility that this species may play a role in aging and cataractogenesis in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2054003754,"Feeding induced by food deprivation is accompanied by an increased production of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the brains of rats. This neurochemical change occurs in the nucleus accumbens, the posterior hypothalamus, and the amygdala but not in other dopaminergic nerve terminal fields such as the corpus striatum. These results indicate that the release of dopamine from particular groups of central neurons is increased during feeding and suggest that anatomically distinct subgroups of central dopaminergic neurons serve different roles in the regulation of food intake."

https://openalex.org/W2055221691,"The tumor promoter 20-3H-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate bound in a specific manner to particulate preparations from both whole mouse skin and mouse epidermis. The binding, which was comparable in both whole skin and epidermal preparations, occurred rapidly, was reversible upon addition of non-radioactive ligand and showed high affinity (KD = 2.4 × 10−8 M). The potencies of phorbol esters for inhibiting binding of 3H-PDBu corresponded to their biological and tumor-promoting activities: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, KI = 0.74 nM; phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, KI = 16 nM; phorbol 12,13-dibenzoate, KI = 82 nM; mezerein, KI = 98 nM; phorbol 12,13-diacetate, KI = 3 μM; phorbol 12,13,20-triacetate, KI = 5.6 μM; phorbol 13-acetate, KI = 64 μM. The biologically inactive derivatives phorbol (0.88 mM) and 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (15 μM) did not inhibit binding. Likewise, 3H-PDBu binding was only weakly inhibited by phorbol-related diterpenes which are highly inflammatory but nonpromoting. These structure-activity relationships suggest that the 3H-PDBu binding activity mediates phorbol ester tumor promotion. 3H-PDBu binding was not inhibited by the nonphorbol promoters examined. Similarly, it was not blocked by compounds which antagonize (dexamethasone acetate, 2 μM; retinoic acid, 10 μM) or mimic (epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml; melittin, 25 μg/ml; PGE2, 1 μM) some of the effects of the phorbol esters in vivo or in vitro."

Excision of one of the metastatic tumors located by this method indicated a tumor/nontumor ration of 39.29. The method appears to offer a new clinical tool for precisely locating hCG-producing tumors in the body, even when tumor identification by other clinical methods has failed."

https://openalex.org/W2063834218,"Teacher interactions with hyperactive and comparison boys were observed during classroom activities. A double-blind, methylphenidate-placebo cross-over design was used within the hyperactive group. With no knowledge of any child's diagnosis or drug status, the teacher was more intense and controlling toward hyperactive boys taking placebo than toward either medicated hyperactive boys or comparison boys; her behavior did not differ toward the latter two groups. Discussion focused on the need to consider the broad social ramifications of pharmacologic treatment programs."

Unlike recordings made from outside the intact amnion in human subjects, sounds produced at levels similar to normal conversation from outside the ewe were picked up without masking by maternal cardiovascular sounds. Noises from inside the mother were intermittent and linked to her activity."

The synthesized waveforms match closely the actual contingent negative variation, suggesting that it is constituted largely of separate, noncontingent elements related to sensory and motor processes."

https://openalex.org/W1997373688,"Neurons in deep laminae of the rabbit cingulate cortex develop discriminative activity at an early stage of behavioral discrimination learning, whereas neurons in the anteroventral nucleus of thalamus and neurons in the superficial cortical laminae develop such activity in a late stage of behavioral learning. It is hypothesized that early-forming discriminative neuronal activity, relayed to anteroventral neurons via the corticothalamic pathway, contributes to the construction of changes underlying the late-forming neuronal discrimination in the anteroventral nucleus. The resultant late discriminative activity in the anteroventral nucleus is then relayed via the thalamocortical pathway back to the superficial cortical laminae, promoting disengagement of cortex from further task-processing."
https://openalex.org/W1586879847,"A hemoglobin hybrid (alpha 2c beta 2 Prov) in which the alpha chains have NH2-terminal residues that have been blocked specifically by carbamylation and beta chains that have been derived from hemoglobin Providence I (beta 82 Lys leads to Asn) was prepared. This derivative shows a small but significant dependence of its oxygen equilibrium curve on the concentration of chloride, phosphate, or nitrate. These data were compared with oxygen-linked anion binding to hemoglobins A and Providence, and to the carbamylated hybrid, alpha 2c beta 2, by fitting equations to the data with the use of MULTIFIT II, a nonlinear curve-fitting program. Dependence of the anion dissociation constants from deoxygenated (KD) and fully oxygenated (Ko) hemoglobins upon the mathematical model is described. The data provide further support that Val-1 (alpha) and Lys-82 (beta) of hemoglobin are major, oxygen-linked binding sites for small inorganic anions and suggested that a third oxygen-linked site may also be present."
https://openalex.org/W2058510199,Thirty-four population samples representing the worldwide distribution of the mosquito Aedes aegypti were analyzed for variation at 19 to 22 enzyme-coding genes. A multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that the genetic differences among populations in six geographic regions and between two subspecies enable one to determine the regional origin of a population. Such studies of population genetics may have quite general applicability in studying vector-borne diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2133858901,"Microorganisms are capable of producing natural products with widely divergent chemical structures. Greatest attention in the past has been paid to natural products that have antibiotic properties. Natural products accumulate in fermentation broths during secondary metabolism, a characteristic of the incomplete metabolic control operative in growth-inhibited microorganisms. With this general mechanism of biosynthesis, the natural products synthesized by microorganisms would be expected to have a broad range of pharmacological activities. The directed screening for nonantibiotic natural products has been of limited scope. The expectation that new compounds of interest would be found has been validated. The pharmacologically active natural products provide previously unrecognized structures as tools for fundamental research programs, as well as offering the possibility of direct use in medicine or in industrial processes."

https://openalex.org/W2063699818,"We have studied the mode of transcription of the three double-stranded RNA segments found in bacteriophage phi 6. Stable transcription intermediates, isolated following in vitro incorporation of nucleoside triphosphates by phi 6 nucleocapsids, were examined by electron microscopy. Specimens were either spread and shadowed or deposited on polylysine film and stained. In either case, branched molecules with one or more single-stranded arms were seen. The single-stranded arm, in all molecules observed, has about half the contour length of one double-stranded arm. The branched molecules are stable in high salt or hot phenol, resistant to proteinase K, but sensitive to RNAase A in high salt, yielding fragments of double-stranded RNA. These results are consistent with a transcription mechanism in which each new transcript displaces one of the parental RNA strands. From the rate of movement of the branch point, we found transcription rates in vitro of similar to or approximately 25 nucleotides per sec at 30 degrees C and 19 nucleotides per sec at 25 degrees C. Based on the spacing between branches in multiply branched molecules, initiation occurs approximately once every 40 sec at 30 degrees C on M or S RNA templates and about 6 times less frequently on L RNA."

In this report we describe (a) a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for fibroblast adenosine deaminase and its binding protein, (b) the importance of various tissue culture media on the expression of fibroblast adenosine deaminase, and (c) the levels of immunoreactive adenosine deaminase compared to its binding protein in normal and homozygous adenosine deaminase-deficient fibroblast cell strains."
https://openalex.org/W1481624548,"By (32P)orthophosphate pulse-labeling in vivo, we have identified a class of phosphoproteins in Halobacterium halobium. Exposing labeled whole cells to light results in a rapid dephosphorylation of two of the proteins, which are rapidly rephosphorylated upon darkening of the cells. The light sensitivity of these two proteins is abolished by the retinal synthesis inhibitor nicotine and is restored upon addition of exogenous retinal to the cells. This indicates that the dephosphorylation depends on the rhodopsin-like (retinal-containing) photoreceptors of this organism. Retinal pigments, one of which is the retinyldene protein bacteriorhodopsin, are responsible for both photoenergy and photosensory transduction by Halobacterium. The light-regulated phosphoproteins are of molecular weights of approximately 80,000 and 100,000. Acid and hydroxylamine resistance of the phosphate bonds in both proteins suggests phosphoserine or phosphothreonine linkages."
https://openalex.org/W2052241540,"The cellular mechanisms underlying picrotoxin-induced convulsive activity were studied by using mouse spinal neurons growing in tissue culture. Picrotoxin-induced convulsive activity in most but not all of the cells studied. The activity could be inverted by polarizing to positive potentials and eliminated either by decreasing the ratio of calcium to magnesium or by applying tetrodotoxin. When applied locally to individual cells, picrotoxin lowered spike threshold and induced spontaneous firing in some but not all cells tested. The results suggest that picrotoxin-induced convulsive activity involves rapidly summating synaptic activity which may be evoked by high-frequency repetitive firing."

https://openalex.org/W1971500658,"The cellular basis of kindling was studied electrophysiologically with slices of guinea pig hippocampus. Normally, epileptiform activity can be induced in the slices only by combined exposure to elevated potassium levels and a chemical convulsant such as penicillin. In hippocampal slices from pentylenetetrazole-kindled animals, however, elevated potassium alone can induce seizures. These data suggest that kindling elicits long-term changes in neuronal excitability that may involve ionic mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1596065070,"Corynebacterium sp. synthesizes pteroylpolyglutamates which are excreted into its growth medium. The major intracellular folates were identified as 10-formyltetrahydro-, 5-formyltetrahydro-, tetrahydro-, and 10-formylpteroyltetraglutamates. The major folates in the medium were identified as 10-formylpteroyltri- and tetraglutamates. p-Aminobenzoic was metabolized to these compounds without any appreciable buildup of pteroylmono- or diglutamate derivatives. The rate-limiting steps in the elongation of the glutamate chain of folate derivatives appear to be at the level of formation of a pteroate derivative and at the pteroyltetraglutamate level."
https://openalex.org/W1591805165,"Rat central nervous system binding sites for ..cap alpha..-bungarotoxin display considerable biochemical homology with characterized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from the periphery. They possess a critical disulfide residue(s), which is susceptible to chemical modification and consequent specific alteration in the affinity of the binding site for cholinergic agonists. After reaction with Na/sub 2/S/sub 2/O/sub 5/, as with reaction with dithiothreitol and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), the binding site is frozen in a high affinity state toward acetylcholine. After reduction with dithiothreitol and alkylation with a variety of compounds of different molecular configuration or electrical charge, or both, the binding site is frozen in a low affinity state toward acetylcholine. Thus, effects of disulfide/sulfhydryl modification on agonist binding affinity appear to be attributable to the nature of the covalent modification rather than charge or steric alteration at the receptor active site brought about by chemical modification."

https://openalex.org/W1586740696,"The precipitation of a monoclonal IgG2 crystalline cryoglobulin (WEB) is shown to occur via a nucleation mechanism. The kinetics of precipitation fits the empirical equation 1n(t2/t1) = nu(c1/c2), where t is the time to reach half-maximum turbidity for concentration c. The effect of mild reduction of interchain disulfides on the kinetics and extent of precipitation have also been determined. Cleavage of only one or two inter heavy-heavy chain disulfide bonds appears to abolish cryoprecipitation. The extent of reduction at high reductant levels suggests that there is an extra inter heavy-heavy chain disulfide in IgG-WEB. Laser Raman spectroscopy detects no structural change between reduced (noncryoprecipitable) and native (cryoprecipitable) WEB, suggesting that perturbation of a local site is responsible for loss of cryoprecipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2086902603,"A protein that binds spermine specifically was separated from normal rabbit serum by affinity chromatography. Immunoelectrophoresis, the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test, and gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that this protein has immunoglobulin characteristics and consists of several populations of antibodies to spermine. These were sequentially released from Sepharose-spermine gel by step-wise elution with solutions ranging in pH from 4 to 1. The binding constants varied from 5.0 x 10(8) to 11.1 x 10(8) liters per mole. These globulins did not react with monoacetylputrescine, L-ornithine, L-lysine, and histamine. Negligible cross-reactivity was detected with spermidine, putrescine, N8-monoacetylspermidine, cadaverine, and diaminopropane. Since perturbations in polyamine metabolism have been identified in several diseases, the study of extracellular polyamine homeostasis may reveal an important regulatory function for this protein."

Antibody to the cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital has relatively little or no effect on the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity of the same human cells.
https://openalex.org/W2131937307,"Following division of HeLa-3T3 heterokaryons, human and mouse chromosomes occupy distinct regions within the resulting hybrid nuclei. This favorable orientation of genomes has allowed us to determine whether histones exchange between chromosomes in vivo. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins from HeLa cells labeled with 3H-arginine during S phase showed that the core histones were labeled preferentially, constituting 30% of the total cellular tritium and 50% of the label in a crude nuclear fraction. Autoradiographic analysis of cells formed by fusion of 3H-arginine-labeled HeLa cells and 3T3-4E cells showed that 3H-arginine-labeled proteins did not migrate between nuclei in heterokaryons; hybrid cells formed from such heterokaryons contained nuclei in which 3H proteins occupied a sector within the nucleus; “sectored nuclei” could persist for at least 4 days; and the unequal distribution of 3H proteins did not change during DNA synthesis. Electron microscopic examination of hybrid nuclei failed to reveal a physical partition between human and mouse chromosome sets. Sectored nuclei were also observed in synkaryons derived from 3H-arginine-labeled HeLa and unlabeled HeLa cells, indicating that the unequal distribution of 3H-arginine-labeled proteins in HeLa-3T3 hybrid cells did not result from species-specific binding of proteins and DNA. The persistent unequal distribution of 3H-arginine-labeled proteins within hybrid nuclei in the apparent absence of a barrier between mouse and human chromosomes indicates that histones, the principal 3H-arginine-labeled proteins, do not dissociate from DNA in vivo."
