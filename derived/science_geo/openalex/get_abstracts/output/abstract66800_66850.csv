https://openalex.org/W1484115349,"The preparation of a number of agarose and polyacrylamide bead derivatives useful in the purification of proteins by affinity chromatography is described. These techniques permit (a) the attachment of ligands to the gel through extended hydrocarbon chains which place the ligand at varying distances from the gel matrix backbone; (b) the covalent attachment of ligands to agarose or polyacrylamide gels through amino, carboxyl, phenolic, or imidazole groups of the ligand; and (c) the preparation of adsorbents containing ligands attached by bonds which are susceptible to specific chemical cleavage, thus providing means of removing the intact protein-ligand complex from the affinity adsorbent. It is demonstrated that successful application of affinity chromatography in many cases will critically depend on placing the ligand at a considerable distance from the matrix backbone. Techniques are also described which provide important approaches and considerations in the insolubilization of peptides and proteins to agarose and polyacrylamide."

https://openalex.org/W2090720333,A small volume of an erythrocyte suspension was subjected to the action of a manipulated gas bubble set into stable oscillation at 20 kilohertz. Release of hemoglobin occurred when the oscillation amplitude exceeded a critical threshold. Hydrodynamic stresses resulting from acoustically induced small-scale eddying motion near the bubble may be the mechanism of hemolysis.
https://openalex.org/W1512862543,"Abstract The substrates for chloroperoxidase can be divided into three groups. Group 1 substrates react with chloroperoxidase in the presence of peroxide and a halogen anion (chloride, bromide, or iodide) to form stable halogenated products. Group 2 substrates are oxidized in a halogen anion-dependent reaction. The pH optima for the reactions of chloroperoxidase with both Groups 1 and 2 substrates are below 4. Group 3 substrates are oxidized in the absence of a halogen anion. This category includes classical peroxidase substrates such as guaiacol, pyrogallol, and leucomalachite green. The pH optima for Group 3 reactions extend over a broad range from pH 4 to 7, depending on the particular substrate being tested. Chloroperoxidase also catalyzes reactions previously thought to be peculiar to catalase. In the absence of donors, chloroperoxidase reacts catalatically with hydrogen peroxide to form oxygen. At pH 4.5, the second order rate constant for this reaction is 2 x 105 m-1 sec-1. Although this represents only about 2% of the rate observed with catalases, it is several hundred times more effective than horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme also oxidizes ethanol to form acetaldehyde, a reaction not catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase. Evidently the four-subunit structure of catalase is not required for these activities since chloroperoxidase exists as a monomeric protein with one heme group per molecule. Chloroperoxidase also has the ability to form oxygen from ethyl hydrogen peroxide and from m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Neither catalase nor horseradish peroxidase will catalyze these reactions. By analogy with organic mechanisms for the decomposition of peracids, these results indicate that Compound I of chloroperoxidase may contain a reactive oxygen atom."

https://openalex.org/W158131043,"Abstract Monoacylglycerophosphate was identified as the major product of sn-glycerol-3-P esterification by a rat liver particulate preparation in the presence of CoA thioesters of long chain fatty acids, sn-glycerol-3-P, bovine serum albumin, and Tris buffer (pH 6.5). The product was identified by thin layer and silicic acid column chromatography in comparison with known standards. An equimolar incorporation of fatty acid and sn-glycerol-3-P into the product was shown. Monoacylglycerophosphate was isolated from the incubation mixture and further esterified to diacylglycerophosphate and neutral lipids by an identical particulate preparation under different incubation conditions. A comparison of five acyl CoA thioesters at pH 6.5 showed that palmitoyl-CoA was the most active substrate. Analysis of the monoacylglycerophosphate formed at pH 6.5 suggests that the 1 isomer is the primary product when palmitoyl-CoA is the substrate and that the 2 isomer is the predominant product formed from oleoyl-CoA. Therefore, this reaction may contribute to the specific distribution of fatty acids found in the glycerolipids."

https://openalex.org/W1509142077,"Abstract Adenylosuccinase activity was demonstrated in lysates prepared from mature human and rabbit erythrocytes by investigating both reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. The conversion of adenylosuccinate to adenosine 5'-phosphate was observed spectrophotometrically. The conversion of N-(5-amino-1-ribosyl-4-imidazolecarbonyl)-l-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate to 5-amino-1-ribosyl-4-imidazolecarboxamide 5'-phosphate was studied by measuring the incorporation of sodium (14C)-formate into the hypoxanthine of inosine 5'-phosphate when lysates were incubated with N-(5-amino-1-ribosyl-4-imidazolecarbonyl)-l-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate. The presence of adenylosuccinase in the erythrocytes of both species suggests that the human erythrocyte, which cannot effect significant conversion of inosine 5'-phosphate to adenosine 5'-phosphate, lacks adenylosuccinate synthetase activity, an enzymatic capacity possessed by the rabbit erythrocyte. The data also suggest that the inability of the erythrocytes of both species to synthesize the purine ring by the de novo pathway results from the loss of one or more steps prior to the formation of N-(5-amino-1-ribosyl-4-imidazolecarbonyl)-l-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate."

The sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme play a role in catalysis as well as in polymerization.

https://openalex.org/W1915407216,"Abstract Kinetic studies indicated that glucose-6-P inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase b was partially competitive with respect to AMP, an activator. This observation supports the view that the interaction between the activator and the inhibitor in phosphorylase b is allosteric in nature, a negative heterotropic interaction. Such interaction is believed to arise from alterations at the activator binding site as a result of an inhibitor-induced conformational change of the enzyme. In order to characterize the nature of alterations at the AMP site, the effect of glucose-6-P on interactions between the enzyme and several AMP analogues were examined kinetically. Since a glutaraldehyde-modified phosphorylase b did not exhibit homotropic cooperativity, yet retained all the other kinetic properties of native phosphorylase b, the interactions between glucose-6-P and AMP analogues in this derived enzyme were also investigated to facilitate the kinetic analysis. Among the AMP analogues used in this study IMP, UMP, GMP, CMP, dAMP, and adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate were activators. Their activation of the enzyme could be competitively inhibited by glucose-6-P. In the presence of 20 mm glucose-6-P, the enzyme affinity toward these activators decreased 10- to 18-fold. The other nucleotide analogues used in this study were competitive inhibitors of phosphorylase b with respect to AMP. Their interactions with the allosteric inhibitor were analyzed by multiple inhibition kinetics. Results indicated that the mode of interaction between glucose-6-P and the inhibitory analogues depended upon the structure of the analogues. The interaction between phosphorylase b and adenosine, adenosine-3'-P, adenosine-2'-P, cyclic 2',3'-AMP or cyclic 3',5'-AMP was essentially independent of glucose-6-P, whereas the interaction of dCMP or dGMP with the enzyme was greatly impeded by the allosteric inhibitor. The results suggested that alterations at the AMP site of the enzyme during the allosteric transition involved primarily the subsite which interacted with the phosphate moiety of this nucleotide."

Split-brain cats were trained in a variety of discriminations, and the success or failure of interhemispheric transfer was evaluated with regard to rate of learning. When interhemispheric transfer succeeds, learning time is normal; when interhemispheric transfer fails, learning time is prolonged, becoming at least twice that of normal. Retention is also poor in those animals that exhibit prolonged learning. A normal learning curve appears to be the product of interaction between both cerebral hemispheres during learning."
https://openalex.org/W1483711063,"Abstract Histidine-ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.3) from rat liver became inactivated and incorporated radioactivity upon incubation with 14C-nitromethane.

Therefore, the two enzymes must possess an identical, or at least very similar electrophilic center at the active site. Injection of nitromethane into adult mice caused the inactivation of liver histidase. If the effect of nitromethane in vivo is specific, it will provide a model for the human genetic disorder, histidinemia."

In contrast, the effectiveness of unilateral stimulation at very short intervals was limited by neuronal refractory periods. The results support the notion that there is convergence of the medial forebrain bundle self-stimulation system from the two sides of the brain and suggest ways of studying the degree of convergence.

https://openalex.org/W2413498879,"An assay procedure was devised for obtaining quantitative estimates of deacylated transfer RNA binding to ribosomes. With this assay, the codon responses of several tRNA species were examined, and the results indicated that binding of tRNA is codon-specific. Extensive studies were carried out on the binding of tRNA which accepts phenylalanine (tRNA p he) in response to polyuridylic acid (poly U). With limiting concentrations of tRNA, poly U directed the binding of approximately 80 to 90% of the available tRNA p he. Binding of tRNA p he was dependent upon ribosomes, Mg++, poly U, and tRNA. Tetracycline reduced poly U-directed binding of tRNA p he by approximately 50%. This suggests that, in the absence of the drug, some of the ribosome-bound tRNA p he is at the aminoacyl binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1663423968,The cooperativity of oxygen binding by different subunits in human hemoglobin is greatly reduced by partial deuteration. The effect depends on the time of exposure: n in Hill's equation decreases from 2.8 to about 1.9 after the hemoglobin has been in D2O for 20 hours at 4°. Further incubation results in a gradual return to normal cooperativity: n≅ 2.8 after 240 hours. These effects could be explained if the rates of deuteration of certain parts of the α and β-chains differed. The normal alkaline Bohr effect is unchanged by deuteration. Molecules in which most of the exchangeable hydrogen has been replaced with deuterium are more resistant to denaturation by heat and to autoxidation.
https://openalex.org/W1505861421,"Abstract Extracts of Micrococcus aerogenes, an anaerobe capable of fermenting purines, contain two enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of 2-oxypurine. These have been purified and separated from one another. One has the broad substrate specificity typical of xanthine dehydrogenase; the other is very specific with regard to the substrates oxidized and will only oxidize 2-oxypurine and closely related compounds. This new enzyme, 2-oxypurine dehydrogenase, catalyzes the oxidation of purines exclusively at position 6; other compounds are oxidized at the equivalent position. The following compounds, listed in order of decreasing reactivity when tested at 1 mm concentration, have been shown to serve as substrates: 2-oxypurine, 2-oxy-8-azaxanthine, 2,8-dioxypurine, 2-oxypyrimidine, and 2-oxypteridine. Compounds which are methylated at either of the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the required oxy group will neither serve as substrates nor inhibit the action of the enzyme. These and other results have been invoked to relate the activities observed with 2-oxypurine dehydrogenase to indices of chemical reactivity and to mechanisms proposed from studies of the substrate specificity of xanthine oxidase. In contrast to the marked specificity observed with electron donors, the enzyme uses a wide variety of artificial electron acceptors. However, molecular oxygen is very poorly utilized. The enzyme contains iron but not flavin or molybdenum. The protein has a visible absorption spectrum characteristic of certain non-heme iron proteins; the absorbance in the visible regions is decreased by incubation of the enzyme with 2-oxypurine. The enzyme displays cooperative saturation curves with substrates, suggesting the possibility of an allosteric response. The presence of a number of subunits in the protein is indicated by the observation that in acidic sucrose gradients the enzyme sediments at approximately one-fifth the rate found under alkaline conditions. Addition of substrate to the gradient specifically reverses the effect of an acid pH. Kinetic experiments suggest that the disaggregated enzyme is inactive but is capable of being activated by the substrate."

No other radioactive, low molecular weight derivatives could be detected, and no radioactive carbon dioxide was produced. Incorporation of radioactivity into macromolecules did not occur. Mannosamine and mannosamine 6-phosphate accumulated in ascites cells exposed to high concentrations of mannosamine (5 to 100 m m ). However, very little N-acetylmannosamine entered the cells under these conditions. Radioactive mannosamine administered intraperitoneally to rats was rapidly excreted, and by 24 hours most of the mannosamine was recovered unaltered in the urine. Considerable radioactivity was observed in the trichloracetic acid-soluble fraction of liver and kidney within 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of 1-14C- d -mannosamine to rats. The radioactivity decreased with time in these tissues, and little remained after 24 hours. Essentially all the trichloracetic acid-soluble radioactivity in these tissues was free mannosamine, with less than 1% as mannosamine 6-phosphate.

An enzyme catalyzing the formation of ribose 1,5-diphosphate from ribose 5-phosphate and ATP has been purified 40-fold from sonic extracts of Pseudomonas saccharophila. This preparation is free of both phosphoribomutase and phosphoglucomutase activity. It is specific for ribose 5-phosphate as substrate; ribose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate fail to react. 2. The apparent Km for both ribose 5-phosphate and ATP is about 1 mm. Inhibition is observed at higher concentrations of either substrate. The pH optimum is 9.1. 3. The ribose diphosphate formed was identified by the following characteristics: ability to stimulate the phosphoglucomutase reaction; chromatography on Dowex 1 (Cl-); mobility identical with that of authentic ribose diphosphate on paper electrophoresis; and acid lability, yielding a material which corresponds electrophoretically with ribose 5-phosphate and which no longer stimulates the mutase reaction. 4. It is suggested that the function of the ribose diphosphate formed is to serve as a cofactor in the conversion of ribose 5-phosphate to ribose 1-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoribomutase. The availability of ribose diphosphate could serve as a means for controlling this reaction."
