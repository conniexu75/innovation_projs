https://openalex.org/W3198689144,"SARS-CoV-2 infection-which involves both cell attachment and membrane fusion-relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is paradoxically found at low levels in the respiratory tract1-3, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms facilitating infection. Here we show that C-type lectin receptors, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 1 (SIGLEC1) function as attachment receptors by enhancing ACE2-mediated infection and modulating the neutralizing activity of different classes of spike-specific antibodies. Antibodies to the amino-terminal domain or to the conserved site at the base of the receptor-binding domain, while poorly neutralizing infection of ACE2-overexpressing cells, effectively block lectin-facilitated infection. Conversely, antibodies to the receptor binding motif, while potently neutralizing infection of ACE2-overexpressing cells, poorly neutralize infection of cells expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN and trigger fusogenic rearrangement of the spike, promoting cell-to-cell fusion. Collectively, these findings identify a lectin-dependent pathway that enhances ACE2-dependent infection by SARS-CoV-2 and reveal distinct mechanisms of neutralization by different classes of spike-specific antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3197781442,"The functional relevance of preexisting cross-immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a subject of intense debate. Here, we show that human endemic coronavirus (HCoV)–reactive and SARS-CoV-2–cross-reactive CD4+ T cells are ubiquitous but decrease with age. We identified a universal immunodominant coronavirus-specific spike peptide (S816-830) and demonstrate that preexisting spike- and S816-830–reactive T cells were recruited into immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their frequency correlated with anti–SARS-CoV-2-S1-IgG antibodies. Spike–cross-reactive T cells were also activated after primary BNT162b2 COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccination and displayed kinetics similar to those of secondary immune responses. Our results highlight the functional contribution of preexisting spike–cross-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Cross-reactive immunity may account for the unexpectedly rapid induction of immunity after primary SARS-CoV-2 immunization and the high rate of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease courses."
https://openalex.org/W3198900623,"Metal-catalysed cross-couplings are a mainstay of organic synthesis and are widely used for the formation of C-C bonds, particularly in the production of unsaturated scaffolds1. However, alkyl cross-couplings using native sp3-hybridized functional groups such as alcohols remain relatively underdeveloped2. In particular, a robust and general method for the direct deoxygenative coupling of alcohols would have major implications for the field of organic synthesis. A general method for the direct deoxygenative cross-coupling of free alcohols must overcome several challenges, most notably the in situ cleavage of strong C-O bonds3, but would allow access to the vast collection of commercially available, structurally diverse alcohols as coupling partners4. We report herein a metallaphotoredox-based cross-coupling platform in which free alcohols are activated in situ by N-heterocyclic carbene salts for carbon-carbon bond formation with aryl halide coupling partners. This method is mild, robust, selective and most importantly, capable of accommodating a wide range of primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols as well as pharmaceutically relevant aryl and heteroaryl bromides and chlorides. The power of the transformation has been demonstrated in a number of complex settings, including the late-stage functionalization of Taxol and a modular synthesis of Januvia, an antidiabetic medication. This technology represents a general strategy for the merger of in situ alcohol activation with transition metal catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W3196893569,"Researchers and journalists have argued that work-related factors may be partly responsible for disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates among vulnerable groups. We evaluate these issues by describing racial and ethnic differences in the likelihood of work-related exposure to COVID-19. We extend previous studies by considering 12 racial and ethnic groups and five types of potential occupational exposure to the virus: exposure to infection, physical proximity to others, face-to-face discussions, interactions with external customers and the public, and working indoors. Most importantly, we stratify our results by occupational standing, defined as the proportion of workers within each occupation with at least some college education. This measure serves as a proxy for whether workplaces and workers employ COVID-19-related risk reduction strategies. We use the 2018 American Community Survey to identify recent workers by occupation, and link 409 occupations to information on work context from the Occupational Information Network to identify potential COVID-related risk factors. We then examine the racial/ethnic distribution of all frontline workers and frontline workers at highest potential risk of COVID-19, by occupational standing and by sex. The results indicate that, contrary to expectation, White frontline workers are often overrepresented in high-risk jobs while Black and Latino frontline workers are generally underrepresented in these jobs. However, disaggregation of the results by occupational standing shows that, in contrast to Whites and several Asian groups, Latino and Black frontline workers are overrepresented in lower standing occupations overall and in lower standing occupations associated with high risk, and thus may be less likely to have adequate COVID-19 protections. Our findings suggest that greater work exposures likely contribute to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among Latino and Black adults and underscore the need for measures to reduce potential exposure for workers in low standing occupations and for the development of programs outside the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W3197496609,"Poor tumor infiltration, development of exhaustion, and antigen insufficiency are common mechanisms that limit chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell efficacy. Delivery of pattern recognition receptor agonists is one strategy to improve immune function; however, targeting these agonists to immune cells is challenging, and off-target signaling in cancer cells can be detrimental. Here, we engineer CAR-T cells to deliver RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA that activates RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. RN7SL1 promotes expansion and effector-memory differentiation of CAR-T cells. Moreover, RN7SL1 is deployed in extracellular vesicles and selectively transferred to immune cells. Unlike other RNA agonists, transferred RN7SL1 restricts myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) development, decreases TGFB in myeloid cells, and fosters dendritic cell (DC) subsets with costimulatory features. Consequently, endogenous effector-memory and tumor-specific T cells also expand, allowing rejection of solid tumors with CAR antigen loss. Supported by improved endogenous immunity, CAR-T cells can now co-deploy peptide antigens with RN7SL1 to enhance efficacy, even when heterogenous CAR antigen tumors lack adequate neoantigens."
https://openalex.org/W3196582739,"Generalizing experiences to guide decision-making in novel situations is a hallmark of flexible behavior. Cognitive maps of an environment or task can theoretically afford such flexibility, but direct evidence has proven elusive. In this study, we found that discretely sampled abstract relationships between entities in an unseen two-dimensional social hierarchy are reconstructed into a unitary two-dimensional cognitive map in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We further show that humans use a grid-like code in entorhinal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex for inferred direct trajectories between entities in the reconstructed abstract space during discrete decisions. These grid-like representations in the entorhinal cortex are associated with decision value computations in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction. Collectively, these findings show that grid-like representations are used by the human brain to infer novel solutions, even in abstract and discrete problems, and suggest a general mechanism underpinning flexible decision-making and generalization. Cognitive maps are theorized to enable generalizing experiences in new situations. Park et al. show that non-spatial experiences sampled piecemeal are integrated into a two-dimensional cognitive map of social hierarchy, and a grid code is used for novel inferences."
https://openalex.org/W3197552564,"Background Seldom in history does one get a ‘front row seat’—with large-scale dynamic data—on how online news media narratives shift with a global pandemic. News media narratives matter because they shape societal perceptions and influence the core tent poles of our society, from the economy to elections. Given its importance—and with the benefit of hindsight—we provide a systematic framework to analyze news narratives of Covid-19, laying the groundwork to evaluate policy and risk communications. Objectives We leverage a 10-billion-word-database of online news, taken from over 7,000 English newspapers and magazines across 20 countries, culminating in 28 million articles. First, we track the volume of Covid-19 conversations across 20 countries from before to during the pandemic (Oct’19 to May’20). Second, we distill the phases of global pandemic narratives, and elucidate regional differences. Methods To track the volume of Covid-19 narratives, we identified 10 target terms—Coronavirus, Covid-19, Covid, nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Virus, Virus, Disease, Epidemic, Pandemic—and tracked their combined monthly prevalence across eight months from October 2019 through May 2020. Globally, across 20 countries, we identified 18,042,855 descriptors of the target terms. Further, these descriptors were analysed with natural language processing models to generate the top five topics of Covid-19 that were labelled by two independent researchers. This process was repeated across six continents to distil regional topics. Results Our model found four phases of online news media narratives: Pre-pandemic, Early, Peak and Recovery. Pre-pandemic narratives (Oct’19–Dec’19) were divergent across regions with Africa focused on monkeypox, Asia on dengue fever, and North America on Lyme disease and AIDS. Early (Jan–Feb’20) and Peak Pandemic (Mar–May’20) evidenced a global convergence, reflecting the omnipresence of Covid-19. The brief transition from early to peak pandemic narratives underscored the pandemic’s rapid spread. Emerging from the embers of the pandemic’s peak were nascent recovery words that are regionally divergent—Oceania focused on hope and an uncertain future while North America centered on re-opening the economy and tackling discrimination. Conclusions Practically, we presented a media barometer of Covid-19, and provided a framework to analyse the pandemic’s impact on societal perceptions—laying the important groundwork for policy makers to evaluate policy communications, and design risk communication strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3198692564,"The 15-minute community life circle (15min-CLC) strategy is one of Shanghai’s important methods for building a global city and facing a society with a more diverse population structure in the future. In the existing research, the balance between the construction of the life circle and the needs of the people in the life circle still needs to be further fulfilled. This paper is based on the city’s multi-source large data set including 2018 AutoNavi POI (Point of Interests), OSM (OpenStreetMap) road network data and LandScan population data set, and evaluates the current status of Shanghai’s 15min-CLC through the fusion of kernel density estimation, service area analysis and other statistical models and proposes relevant optimization suggestions. The results show that there are the following shortcomings: (1) From the perspective of different types of infrastructure service facilities, the spatial construction of Shanghai’s overall life service facilities and shopping service facilities needs to be optimized. (2) From the perspective of comprehensive evaluation, the comprehensive service convenience of infrastructure service facilities in the downtown area is relatively high, while the comprehensive service convenience of urban infrastructure service facilities in the suburbs and outer suburbs is relatively low; The diversity of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC in the downtown area is more consistent with the population distribution; However, in the peripheral areas of the urban area, too many infrastructure service facilities have been constructed. Based on the above shortcomings and the perspective of supply and demand matching, relevant optimization strategies are proposed in different regions and different types of infrastructure service facilities: (1) focus on the construction of basic service facilities in the urban fringe and urban-rural areas, improve the full coverage of the basic service facilities, and appropriately reduce the number of basic service facilities in the downtown area. (2) The development of community business models can be used to promote the development of new life service facilities and shopping service facilities. (3) Improve community medical institutions through facility function conversion, merger and reconstruction, etc. (4) Optimize the hierarchical basic service facility system and improve the population supporting facilities of basic service facilities in the 15min-CLC. This paper incorporates people’s needs and concerns on the living environment into the 15min-CLC evaluation model, and uses Shanghai as an example to conduct research, summarizes the existing shortcomings, and proposes corresponding optimization strategies based on the matching of supply and demand. This article attempts to explore a replicable 15min-CLC planning model, so that it can be extended to the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, to provide reference for further research on the 15min-CLC, and to promote urban construction under the concept of sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W3196581551,"We investigated the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 associated with the early COVID-19 period to investigate evolution of the virus in Pakistan.We studied ninety SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between March and October 2020. Whole genome sequences from our laboratory and available genomes were used to investigate phylogeny, genetic variantion and mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 strains in Pakistan. Site specific entropy analysis compared mutation rates between strains isolated before and after June 2020.In March, strains belonging to L, S, V and GH clades were observed but by October, only L and GH strains were present. The highest diversity of clades was present in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory and the least in Punjab province. Initial introductions of SARS-CoV-2 GH (B.1.255, B.1) and S (A) clades were associated with overseas travelers. Additionally, GH (B.1.255, B.1, B.1.160, B.1.36), L (B, B.6, B.4), V (B.4) and S (A) clades were transmitted locally. SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered with global strains except for ten which matched Pakistani isolates. RNA substitution rates were estimated at 5.86 x10-4. The most frequent mutations were 5' UTR 241C > T, Spike glycoprotein D614G, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P4715L and Orf3a Q57H. Strains up until June 2020 exhibited an overall higher mean and site-specific entropy as compared with sequences after June. Relative entropy was higher across GH as compared with GR and L clades. More sites were under selection pressure in GH strains but this was not significant for any particular site.The higher entropy and diversity observed in early pandemic as compared with later strains suggests increasing stability of the genomes in subsequent COVID-19 waves. This would likely lead to the selection of site-specific changes that are advantageous to the virus, as has been currently observed through the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3197947952,"Background Clinical research has been central to the global response to COVID-19, and the United Kingdom (UK), with its research system embedded within the National Health Service (NHS), has been singled out globally for the scale and speed of its COVID-19 research response. This paper explores the impacts of COVID-19 on clinical research in an NHS Trust and how the embedded research system was adapted and repurposed to support the COVID-19 response. Methods and findings Using a multi-method qualitative case study of a research-intensive NHS Trust in London UK, we collected data through a questionnaire (n = 170) and semi-structured interviews (n = 24) with research staff working in four areas: research governance; research leadership; research delivery; and patient and public involvement. We also observed key NHS Trust research prioritisation meetings (40 hours) and PPI activity (4.5 hours) and analysed documents produced by the Trust and national organisation relating to COVID-19 research. Data were analysed for a descriptive account of the Trust’s COVID-19 research response and research staff’s experiences. Data were then analysed thematically. Our analysis identifies three core themes: centralisation; pace of work; and new (temporary) work practices. By centralising research prioritisation at both national and Trust levels, halting non-COVID-19 research and redeploying research staff, an increased pace in the setup and delivery of COVID-19-related research was possible. National and Trust-level responses also led to widescale changes in working practices by adapting protocols and developing local processes to maintain and deliver research. These were effective practical solutions borne out of necessity and point to how the research system was able to adapt to the requirements of the pandemic. Conclusion The Trust and national COVID-19 response entailed a rapid large-scale reorganisation of research staff, research infrastructures and research priorities. The Trust’s local processes that enabled them to enact national policy prioritising COVID-19 research worked well, especially in managing finite resources, and also demonstrate the importance and adaptability of the research workforce. Such findings are useful as we consider how to adapt our healthcare delivery and research practices both at the national and global level for the future. However, as the pandemic continues, research leaders and policymakers must also take into account the short and long term impact of COVID-19 prioritisation on non-COVID-19 health research and the toll of the emergency response on research staff."
https://openalex.org/W3198353783,"Robust inflammatory responses are critical to survival following respiratory infection, with current attention focused on the clinical consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic. Epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as important determinants of immune responses, and EZH2 is a prominent target due to the availability of highly specific and efficacious antagonists. However, very little is known about the role of EZH2 in the myeloid lineage. Here, we show EZH2 acts in macrophages to limit inflammatory responses to activation, and in neutrophils for chemotaxis. Selective genetic deletion in macrophages results in a remarkable gain in protection from infection with the prevalent lung pathogen, pneumococcus. In contrast, neutrophils lacking EZH2 showed impaired mobility in response to chemotactic signals, and resulted in increased susceptibility to pneumococcus. In summary, EZH2 shows complex, and divergent roles in different myeloid lineages, likely contributing to the earlier conflicting reports. Compounds targeting EZH2 are likely to impair mucosal immunity; however, they may prove useful for conditions driven by pulmonary neutrophil influx, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3198145238,"Climate change is projected to increase the incidence of severe drought in many regions, potentially requiring selection for different traits in crop species to maintain productivity under water stress. In this study, we identified a suite of hydraulic traits associated with high productivity under water stress in four genotypes of S . melongena L. We also assessed the potential for recovery of this suite of traits from drought stress after re-watering. We observed that two genotypes, PHL 4841 and PHL 2778, quickly grew into large plants with smaller, thicker leaves and increasingly poor hydraulic status (a water-spender strategy), whereas PHL 2789 and Mara maintained safer water status and larger leaves but sacrificed large gains in biomass (a water-saver strategy). The best performing genotype under water stress, PHL 2778, additionally showed a significant increase in root biomass allocation relative to other genotypes. Biomass traits of all genotypes were negatively impacted by water deficit and remained impaired after a week of recovery; however, physiological traits such as electron transport capacity of photosystem II, and proportional allocation to root biomass and fine root length, and leaf area recovered after one week, indicating a strong capacity for eggplant to rebound from short-term deficits via recovery of physiological activity and allocation to resource acquiring tissues. These traits should be considered in selection and breeding of eggplant hybrids for future agricultural outlooks."
https://openalex.org/W3198467910,"Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are known to have a strong genetic component.In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the UK Biobank, we analyzed the genomes of 1,363 individuals with AAA compared to 27,260 age, ancestry, and sex-matched controls (1:20 case:control study design). A similar analysis was repeated for 435 individuals with TAA compared to 8,700 controls. Polymorphism with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.5% were evaluated. We identified novel loci near LINC01021, ATOH8 and JAK2 genes that achieved genome-wide significance for AAA (p-value <5x10-8), in addition to three known loci. For TAA, three novel loci in CTNNA3, FRMD6 and MBP achieved genome-wide significance. There was no overlap in the genes associated with AAAs and TAAs. Additionally, we identified a linkage group of high-frequency variants (MAFs ~10%) encompassing FBN1, the causal gene for Marfan syndrome, which was associated with TAA. In FinnGen PheWeb, this FBN1 haplotype was associated with aortic dissection. Finally, we found that baseline bradycardia was associated with TAA, but not AAA.Our GWAS found that AAA and TAA were associated with distinct sets of genes, suggesting distinct underlying genetic architecture. We also found association between baseline bradycardia and TAA. These findings, including JAK2 association, offer plausible mechanistic and therapeutic insights. We also found a common FBN1 linkage group that is associated with TAA and aortic dissection in patients who do not have Marfan syndrome. These FBN1 variants suggest shared pathophysiology between Marfan disease and sporadic TAA."
https://openalex.org/W3198744804,"Childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder (CB-PTSD) occurs in 3–7% of all pregnancies and about 35% of women after preterm birth (PTB) meet the criteria for acute stress reaction. Known risk factors are trait anxiety and pain intensity, whereas planned delivery mode, medical support, and positive childbirth experience are protective factors. It has not yet been investigated whether the effects of anxiety and delivery mode are mediated by other factors, and whether a PTB-risk alters these relationships. 284 women were investigated antepartum and six weeks postpartum (risk-group with preterm birth (RG-PB) N = 95, risk-group with term birth (RG-TB) N = 99, and control group (CG) N = 90). CB-PTSD symptoms and anxiety were measured using standardized psychological questionnaires. Pain intensity, medical support, and childbirth experience were assessed by single items. Delivery modes were subdivided into planned vs. unplanned delivery modes. Group differences were examined using MANOVA. To examine direct and indirect effects on CB-PTSD symptoms, a multi-sample path analysis was performed. Rates of PTS were highest in the RG-PB = 11.58% (RG-TB = 7.01%, CG = 1.1%). MANOVA revealed higher values of CB-PTSD symptoms and pain intensity in RG-PB compared to RG-TB and CG. Women with planned delivery mode reported a more positive birth experience. Path modeling revealed a good model fit. Explained variance was highest in RG-PB ( R 2 = 44.7%). Direct enhancing effects of trait anxiety and indirect reducing effects of planned delivery mode on CB-PTSD symptoms were observed in all groups. In both risk groups, CB-PTSD symptoms were indirectly reduced via support by medical staff and positive childbirth experience, while trait anxiety indirectly enhanced CB-PTSD symptoms via pain intensity in the CG. Especially in the RG-PB, a positive birth experience serves as protective factor against CB-PTSD symptoms. Therefore, our data highlights the importance of involving patients in the decision process even under stressful birth conditions and the need for psychological support antepartum, mainly in patients with PTB-risk and anxious traits. Trial registration number: NCT01974531 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier)."
https://openalex.org/W3198610695,"Prolonged periods of sleep restriction seem to be common in the contemporary world. Sleep loss causes perturbations of circadian rhythmicity and degradation of waking alertness as reflected in attention, cognitive efficiency and memory. Understanding whether and how the human brain recovers from chronic sleep loss is important not only from a scientific but also from a public health perspective. In this work we report on behavioral, motor, and neurophysiological correlates of sleep loss in healthy adults in an unprecedented study conducted in natural conditions and comprising 21 consecutive days divided into periods of 4 days of regular life (a baseline), 10 days of chronic partial sleep restriction (30% reduction relative to individual sleep need) and 7 days of recovery. Throughout the whole experiment we continuously measured the spontaneous locomotor activity by means of actigraphy with 1-minute resolution. On a daily basis the subjects were undergoing EEG measurements (64-electrodes with 500 Hz sampling frequency): resting state with eyes open and closed (8 minutes long each) followed by Stroop task lasting 22 minutes. Altogether we analyzed actigraphy (distributions of rest and activity durations), behavioral measures (reaction times and accuracy from Stroop task) and EEG (amplitudes, latencies and scalp maps of event-related potentials from Stroop task and power spectra from resting states). We observed unanimous deterioration in all the measures during sleep restriction. Further results indicate that a week of recovery subsequent to prolonged periods of sleep restriction is insufficient to recover fully. Only one measure (mean reaction time in Stroop task) reverted to baseline values, while the others did not."
https://openalex.org/W3198247396,"The leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 member A (LRRC8A) is an essential subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is critical for cell volume control, but its broader physiological functions remain under investigation. Recent studies in the field indicate that Lrrc8a disruption in the brain astrocytes reduces neuronal excitability, impairs synaptic plasticity and memory, and protects against cerebral ischemia. In the present work, we generated brain-wide conditional LRRC8A knockout mice (LRRC8A bKO) using NestinCre -driven Lrrc8aflox/flox excision in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia. LRRC8A bKO animals were born close to the expected Mendelian ratio and developed without overt histological abnormalities, but, surprisingly, all died between 5 and 9 weeks of age with a seizure phenotype, which was confirmed by video and EEG recordings. Brain slice electrophysiology detected changes in the excitability of pyramidal cells and modified GABAergic inputs in the hippocampal CA1 region of LRRC8A bKO. LRRC8A-null hippocampi showed increased immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker GFAP, indicating reactive astrogliosis. We also found decreased whole-brain protein levels of the GABA transporter GAT-1, the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and the astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase. Complementary HPLC assays identified reduction in the tissue levels of the glutamate and GABA precursor glutamine. Together, these findings suggest that VRAC provides vital control of brain excitability in mouse adolescence. VRAC deletion leads to a lethal phenotype involving progressive astrogliosis and dysregulation of astrocytic uptake and supply of amino acid neurotransmitters and their precursors."
https://openalex.org/W3198737053,"We assessed the feasibility and potential efficacy of a virtual reality (VR) environment using a dome screen as a distraction method in young children during intravenous (IV) placement in the pediatric emergency department. This randomized controlled pilot study enrolled children aged 2 to 6 years who underwent IV placement into either the intervention group or the control group. Children in the intervention group experienced VR using a dome screen during IV placement. The child’s pain intensity was measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale at four time points of IV placement: immediately after arrival to the blood collection room (base); immediately after the child laid down on the bed (preparation); when the tourniquet was applied (tourniquet); and the moment at which the needle penetrated the skin (venipuncture). The guardian’s satisfaction and rating of the child’s distress were assessed using a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire. We recruited 19 children (9 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group). Five children in the control group were excluded from the analysis because of missing video recordings (n = 3), failed first attempt at IV placement (n = 1), and the child’s refusal to lie on the bed during the procedure (n = 1). No side effects of VR were reported during the study period. Although the average FLACC scale score at each time point (preparation, tourniquet, venipuncture) was lower in the intervention group than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (2.3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2.0–3.0; vs. 3.3, IQR: 2.7–6.7, P = 0.255). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the guardian’s satisfaction and anxiety or his/her rating of the child’s pain and anxiety. The guardians and emergency medical technicians reported satisfaction with the use of VR with a dome screen and considered it a useful distraction during the procedure. VR using a dome screen is a feasible distraction method for young children during IV placement. A larger clinical trial with further development of the VR environment and study process is required to adequately evaluate the efficacy of VR using a dome screen."
https://openalex.org/W3196429043,"When it comes to visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil, one of the main targets of public health policies of surveillance is the control of domestic canine reservoirs of Leishmania infantum. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the dog population and household environment for the maintenance of natural foci in the transmission to human and animal hosts in an endemic city for VL, Bauru, in Brazil. We collected 6,578 blood samples of dogs living in 3,916 households from Nov.2019 to Mar.2020 and applied geospatial models to predict the disease risk based on the canine population. We used Kernel density estimation, cluster analysis, geostatistics, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). To validate our models, we used cross-validation and created a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We found an overall canine VL (CVL) seroprevalence of 5.6% for the sampled dogs, while for the households, the positivity rate was 8.7%. Odds ratios (OR) for CVL increased progressively according to the number of canines for >2 dogs (OR 2.70); households that already had CVL in the past increased the chances for CVL currently (OR 2.73); and the cases of CVL increase the chances for human VL cases (OR 1.16). Our models were statistically significant and demonstrated a spatial association between canine and human disease cases, mainly in VL foci that remain endemic. Although the Kernel density ratio map had the best performance (AUC = 82), all the models showed high risk in the city's northwest area. Canine population dynamics must be considered in public policies, and geospatial methods may help target priority areas and planning VL surveillance in low and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3197030491,"Gadolinium-enhancing lesions reflect active disease and are critical for in-patient monitoring in multiple sclerosis (MS). In this work, we have developed the first fully automated method to segment and count the gadolinium-enhancing lesions from routine clinical MRI of MS patients. The proposed method first segments the potential lesions using 2D-UNet from multi-channel scans (T1 post-contrast, T1 pre-contrast, FLAIR, T2, and proton-density) and classifies the lesions using a random forest classifier. The algorithm was trained and validated on 600 MRIs with manual segmentation. We compared the effect of loss functions (Dice, cross entropy, and bootstrapping cross entropy) and number of input contrasts. We compared the lesion counts with those by radiologists using 2,846 images. Dice, lesion-wise sensitivity, and false discovery rate with full 5 contrasts were 0.698, 0.844, and 0.307, which improved to 0.767, 0.969, and 0.00 in large lesions (>100 voxels). The model using bootstrapping loss function provided a statistically significant increase of 7.1% in sensitivity and of 2.3% in Dice compared with the model using cross entropy loss. T1 post/pre-contrast and FLAIR were the most important contrasts. For large lesions, the 2D-UNet model trained using T1 pre-contrast, FLAIR, T2, PD had a lesion-wise sensitivity of 0.688 and false discovery rate 0.083, even without T1 post-contrast. For counting lesions in 2846 routine MRI images, the model with 2D-UNet and random forest, which was trained with bootstrapping cross entropy, achieved accuracy of 87.7% using T1 pre-contrast, T1 post-contrast, and FLAIR when lesion counts were categorized as 0, 1, and 2 or more. The model performs well in routine non-standardized MRI datasets, allows large-scale analysis of clinical datasets, and may have clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3197147233,"Cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) lies in direct contact with the myocardium and coronary arteries and can influence cardiac (patho) physiology through paracrine signaling pathways. This study hypothesized that the proteins released from EAT represent a critical molecular link between the diabetic state and coronary artery endothelial cell dysfunction. To simulate type 2 diabetes-associated metabolic and inflammatory status in an ex vivo tissue culture model, human EAT samples were treated with a cocktail composed of high glucose, high palmitate, and lipopolysaccharide (gplEAT) and were compared with control EAT (conEAT). Compared to conEAT, gplEAT showed a markedly increased gene expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines, corroborating EAT inflammation, a hallmark feature observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Luminex assay of EAT-secretome identified increased release of various proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-alpha 2 (IFNA2), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), interleukin 5 (IL5), interleukin 13 (IL13), and CCL5, among others, in response to high glucose, high palmitate, and lipopolysaccharide. Conditioned culture media was used to collect the concentrated proteins (CPs). In response to gplEAT-CPs, human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) exhibited an inflammatory endothelial cell phenotype, featuring a significantly increased gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cell surface expression of VCAM-1. Moreover, gplEAT-CPs severely decreased Akt-eNOS signaling, nitric oxide production, and angiogenic potential of HCAECs, when compared with conEAT-CPs. These findings indicate that EAT inflammation may play a key role in coronary artery endothelial cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3197306042,"Liver cirrhosis is a leading cause of death and effects millions of people in the United States. Early mortality prediction among patients with cirrhosis might give healthcare providers more opportunity to effectively treat the condition. We hypothesized that laboratory test results and other related diagnoses would be associated with mortality in this population. Our another assumption was that a deep learning model could outperform the current Model for End Stage Liver disease (MELD) score in predicting mortality.We utilized electronic health record data from 34,575 patients with a diagnosis of cirrhosis from a large medical center to study associations with mortality. Three time-windows of mortality (365 days, 180 days and 90 days) and two cases with different number of variables (all 41 available variables and 4 variables in MELD-NA) were studied. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables. Deep learning and machine learning algorithms, i.e., deep neural networks (DNN), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) were employed to study the associations between baseline features such as laboratory measurements and diagnoses for each time window by 5-fold cross validation method. Metrics such as area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate models.Performance of models comprising all variables outperformed those with 4 MELD-NA variables for all prediction cases and the DNN model outperformed the LR and RF models. For example, the DNN model achieved an AUC of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 90, 180, and 365-day mortality respectively as compared to the MELD score, which resulted in corresponding AUCs of 0.81, 0.79, and 0.76 for the same instances. The DNN and LR models had a significantly better f1 score compared to MELD at all time points examined.Other variables such as alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and hemoglobin were also top informative features besides the 4 MELD-Na variables. Machine learning and deep learning models outperformed the current standard of risk prediction among patients with cirrhosis. Advanced informatics techniques showed promise for risk prediction in patients with cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W3197082937,"Geospatial datasets of population are becoming more common in models used for health policy. Publicly-available maps of human population make a consistent picture from inconsistent census data, and the techniques they use to impute data makes each population map unique. Each mapping model explains its methods, but it can be difficult to know which map is appropriate for which policy work. High quality census datasets, where available, are a unique opportunity to characterize maps by comparing them with truth.We use census data from a bed-net mass-distribution campaign on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, conducted by the Bioko Island Malaria Elimination Program as a gold standard to evaluate LandScan (LS), WorldPop Constrained (WP-C) and WorldPop Unconstrained (WP-U), Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and the High-Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL). Each layer is compared to the gold-standard using statistical measures to evaluate distribution, error, and bias. We investigated how map choice affects burden estimates from a malaria prevalence model.Specific population layers were able to match the gold-standard distribution at different population densities. LandScan was able to most accurately capture highly urban distribution, HRSL and WP-C matched best at all other lower population densities. GPW and WP-U performed poorly everywhere. Correctly capturing empty pixels is key, and smaller pixel sizes (100 m vs 1 km) improve this. Normalizing areas based on known district populations increased performance. The use of differing population layers in a malaria model showed a disparity in results around transition points between endemicity levels.The metrics in this paper, some of them novel in this context, characterize how these population maps differ from the gold standard census and from each other. We show that the metrics help understand the performance of a population map within a malaria model. The closest match to the census data would combine LandScan within urban areas and the HRSL for rural areas. Researchers should prefer particular maps if health calculations have a strong dependency on knowing where people are not, or if it is important to categorize variation in density within a city."
https://openalex.org/W3198245208,"The PBAF complex, a member of SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers, plays an essential role in transcriptional regulation. We revealed a disease progression associated elevation of PHF10 subunit of PBAF in clinical melanoma samples. In melanoma cell lines, PHF10 interacts with MYC and facilitates the recruitment of PBAF complex to target gene promoters, therefore, augmenting MYC transcriptional activation of genes involved in the cell cycle progression. Depletion of either PHF10 or MYC induced G1 accumulation and a senescence-like phenotype. Our data identify PHF10 as a pro-oncogenic mechanism and an essential novel link between chromatin remodeling and MYC-dependent gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3162456016,"Animal cognition research aims to understand animal minds by using a diverse range of methods across an equally diverse range of species. Throughout its history, the field has sought to mitigate various biases that occur when studying animal minds, from experimenter effects to anthropomorphism. Recently, there has also been a focus on how common scientific practices might affect the reliability and validity of published research. Usually, these issues are discussed in the literature by a small group of scholars with a specific interest in the topics. This study aimed to survey a wider range of animal cognition researchers to ask about their attitudes towards classic and contemporary issues facing the field. Two-hundred and ten active animal cognition researchers completed our survey, and provided answers on questions relating to bias, replicability, statistics, publication, and belief in animal cognition. Collectively, researchers were wary of bias in the research field, but less so in their own work. Over 70% of researchers endorsed Morgan's canon as a useful principle but many caveated this in their free-text responses. Researchers self-reported that most of their studies had been published, however they often reported that studies went unpublished because they had negative or inconclusive results, or results that questioned ""preferred"" theories. Researchers rarely reported having performed questionable research practices themselves-however they thought that other researchers sometimes (52.7% of responses) or often (27.9% of responses) perform them. Researchers near unanimously agreed that replication studies are important but too infrequently performed in animal cognition research, 73.0% of respondents suggested areas of animal cognition research could experience a 'replication crisis' if replication studies were performed. Consistently, participants' free-text responses provided a nuanced picture of the challenges animal cognition research faces, which are available as part of an open dataset. However, many researchers appeared concerned with how to interpret negative results, publication bias, theoretical bias and reliability in areas of animal cognition research. Collectively, these data provide a candid overview of barriers to progress in animal cognition and can inform debates on how individual researchers, as well as organizations and journals, can facilitate robust scientific research in animal cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3196462977,"Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality rate. Findings from previous studies addressing the ""weekend effect"" on the mortality rate from an acute aortic dissection mortality have been inconsistent. Furthermore, the effect of admission for acute aortic dissection during the holiday season has not been previously investigated.Our aim was to evaluate the effect of admission for acute aortic dissection during holiday season or weekends on the risk of mortality.We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationwide cohort data from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We collected data on all adult patients hospitalized for acute aortic dissection between 2001 and 2017 in Taiwan and classified them into the following three groups based on day of admission: holiday season (at least 4 consecutive days; n = 280), weekend (n = 1 041), and weekday (n = 3 109). The following three outcomes were evaluated: in-hospital mortality, 7-day mortality, and 180-day mortality.A multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for possible cofounders on the measured outcomes. Compared to weekday admissions for acute aortic dissection, weekend admissions resulted in a 29% increase in the risk of in-hospital death (aOR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.59; P = 0.0153), with a 25% increase in the 7-day (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.001-1.563; P = 0.0492) and 20% increase in the 180-day mortality risk (aOR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42; P = 0.0395). Of note, admission over the holiday season did not result in a higher mortality risk than for weekday admissions; this finding, however, might reflect insufficient statistical power on subgroup analysis.Patients admitted for acute aortic dissection during the weekends are at higher risk of mortality compared to those admitted on weekdays. Our finding likely reflects inadequate staffing and team experience of weekend staff and can guide healthcare policy makers to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3197157696,"Epilepsy is one of the most common childhood-onset neurological conditions with a genetic etiology. Genetic diagnosis provides potential for etiologically-based management and treatment. Existing research has focused on early-onset (<24 months) epilepsies; data regarding later-onset epilepsies is limited. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic yield of a clinically available epilepsy panel in a selected pediatric epilepsy cohort with epilepsy onset between 24-60 months of life and evaluate whether this approach decreases the age of diagnosis of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2). Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based epilepsy panels, including genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies and inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) that present with epilepsy, were used. Copy-number variant (CNV) detection from NGS data was included. Variant interpretation was performed per American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Results are reported from 211 consecutive patients with the following inclusion criteria: 24-60 months of age at the time of enrollment, first unprovoked seizure at/after 24 months, and at least one additional finding such as EEG/MRI abnormalities, speech delay, or motor symptoms. Median age was 42 months at testing and 30 months at first seizure onset; the mean delay from first seizure to comprehensive genetic testing was 10.3 months. A genetic diagnosis was established in 43 patients (20.4%). CNVs were reported in 25.6% diagnosed patients; 27.3% of CNVs identified were intragenic. Within the diagnosed cohort, 11 (25.6%) patients were diagnosed with an IEM. The predominant molecular diagnosis was CLN2 (14% of diagnosed patients). For these patients, diagnosis was achieved 12-24 months earlier than reported by natural history of the disease. This study supports comprehensive genetic testing for patients whose first seizure occurs ≥ 24 months of age. It also supports early application of testing in this age group, as the identified diagnoses can have significant impact on patient management and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3198436657,"This article examines cross-national differences in growth of deaths by COVID-19 over time in the first phase of the pandemic, during the time period of 31 st December 2019 to 2 nd April 2020. We seek to understand and explain country level reaction in the initial period of the pandemic. We explore socio-economic and socio-political country characteristics as determinants of deaths per day and we examine whether country characteristics act as moderating factors for different growth patterns of deaths per day over time. The country characteristics include variables about economy, globalization, health care and demography. We examine data published by the European Center of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in combination with World Bank data and a webscraping approach. Using a conditional growth model specified as a multilevel regression model with deaths by COVID-19 per day as the outcome variable, we show that economic variables are not significantly associated with decrease or increase of deaths by COVID-19. In contrast, variables about national health care mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Demography shows expected effects with an increase of growth of deaths in countries with a higher percentage of people older than 65 years. Globalization predicts the death toll as well: Social interaction between people is deadly on a short-term scale (in the form of tourism). Our results mirror frequent demands for global investment in national health systems."
https://openalex.org/W3198558651,"Inflammation is thought to play a pivotal role in the onset of term and some forms of preterm labour. Although, we recently found that myometrial inflammation is a consequence rather than a cause of term labour, there are several other reproductive tissues, including amnion, choriodecidua parietalis and decidua basalis, where the inflammatory stimulus to labour may occur. To investigate this, we have obtained amnion, choriodecidual parietalis and decidua basalis samples from women at various stages of pregnancy and spontaneous labour. The inflammatory cytokine profile in each tissue was determine by Bio-Plex Pro® cytokine multiplex assays and quantitative RT-PCR. Active motif assay was used to study transcription activation in the choriodecidua parietalis. Quantitative RT-PCR was use to study the pro-labour genes ( PGHS-2 , PGDH , OTR and CX43 ) in all of the tissues at the onset of labour and oxytocin (OT) mRNA expression in the choriodecidual parietalis and decidua basalis. Statistical significance was ascribed to a P value &lt;0.05. In the amnion and choriodecidua parietalis, the mRNA levels of various cytokines decreased from preterm no labour to term no labour samples, but the protein levels were unchanged. The choriodecidua parietalis showed increase in the protein levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the term early labour samples. In the amnion and decidua basalis, the protein levels of several cytokines rose in term established labour. The multiples of the median derived from the 19-plex cytokine assay were greater in term early labour and term established labour samples from the choriodecidua parietalis, but only in term established labour for myometrium. These data suggest that the inflammatory stimulus to labour may begin in the choriodecidua parietalis, but the absence of any change in prolabour factor mRNA levels suggests that the cytokines may act on the myometrium where we observed changes in transcription factor activation and increases in prolabour gene expression in earlier studies."
https://openalex.org/W3196822216,"Illegal cannabis cultivation on public lands has emerged as a major threat to wildlife in California and southern Oregon due to the rampant use of pesticides, habitat destruction, and water diversions associated with trespass grow sites. The spatial distribution of cultivation sites, and the factors influencing where they are placed, remain largely unknown due to covert siting practices and limited surveillance funding. We obtained cannabis grow-site locality data from law enforcement agencies and used them to model the potential distribution of cultivation sites in forested regions of California and southern Oregon using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. We mapped the likely distribution of trespass cannabis cultivation sites and identified environmental variables influencing where growers establish their plots to better understand the cumulative impacts of trespass cannabis cultivation on wildlife. We overlaid the resulting grow-site risk maps with habitat distribution maps for three forest species of conservation concern: Pacific fisher (Pekania pennanti), Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis), and northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Results indicate that cannabis cultivation is fairly predictably distributed on public lands in low to mid-elevation (~800-1600m) forests and on moderate slopes (~30-60%). Somewhat paradoxically, results also suggest that growers either preferred sites inside of recently disturbed vegetation (especially those burned 8-12 years prior to cultivation) or well outside (>500m) of recent disturbance, perhaps indicating avoidance of open edges. We ground-truthed the model by surveying randomly selected stream courses for cultivation site presence in subsets of the modeling region and found previously undiscovered sites mostly within areas with predicted high likelihood of grow-site occurrence. Moderate to high-likelihood areas of trespass cultivation overlapped with 40 to 48% of modeled habitats of the three sensitive species. For the endangered southern Sierra Nevada fisher population, moderate-high likelihood growing areas overlapped with over 37% of modeled fisher denning habitat and with 100% of annual female fisher home ranges (mean overlap = 48.0% + 27.0 SD; n = 134) in two intensively studied populations on the Sierra National Forest. Locating and reclaiming contaminated cannabis grow sites by removing all environmental contaminants should be a high priority for resource managers."

Thus, the early detection and prevention of hypertension is critical for reducing cardiovascular disease. However, the influence of sociocultural factors on vulnerability to hypertension needs further investigation. This study performed secondary data analysis on 1,909 individuals in a cross-sectional study (the National survey for noncommunicable disease risk factors and mental health using World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS approach in Bhutan– 2014). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between gender with marital status and hypertension. Women had a higher odds ratio than men (Ref) when married (AOR: 1.27, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.23–1.31), and when separated, divorced, or widowed (AOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12–1.26). People who speak the Tshanglakha language scored the highest odds (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.20–1.27), followed by Lhotshamkha (AOR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06–1.12) and Dzongkha (Ref) after adjusting for various social and biomedical factors. Additionally, tobacco use displayed decreased odds for hypertension. To promote the early detection and prevention of hypertension, these cultural factors should be considered even within small geographic areas, such as Bhutan. It is necessary to strengthen hypertension preventive strategies for people who speak Tshanglakha and Lhotshamkha. Furthermore, careful consideration should be given to preventing hypertension among adults aged 40 years or more, women who are married, separated, divorced, or widowed, and men who never married in Bhutan."
https://openalex.org/W3092986825,"This study simulates the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using a detailed agent-based model and the census data of Japan to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of contact-tracing apps. The model assumes two types of response to the app notification: the notified individuals quarantine themselves (type-Q response) or they get tested (type-T response). The results reveal some crucial characteristics of the apps. First, type-Q response is successful in achieving containment; however, type-T response has a limited curve-flattening effect. Second, type-Q response performs better than type-T response because it involves quarantine of those who are infected but have not become infectious yet, and the current testing technology cannot detect the virus in these individuals. Third, if the download rate of the apps is extremely high, type-Q response can achieve virus containment with a small number of quarantined people and thereby high efficiency. Finally, given a fixed download rate, increasing the number of tests per day enhances the effectiveness of the apps, although the degree of improved effectiveness is not proportional to the change in the number of tests."

Estimating in a fast and reliable way the impact of an illness on a given country is essential to plan and organize effective countermeasures, which is now possible by leveraging unconventional data sources like web searches and visits. In this study, we show the feasibility of exploiting machine learning models and information about Wikipedia’s page views of a selected group of articles to obtain accurate estimates of influenza-like illnesses incidence in four European countries: Italy, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. We propose a novel language-agnostic method, based on two algorithms, Personalized PageRank and CycleRank , to automatically select the most relevant Wikipedia pages to be monitored without the need for expert supervision. We then show how our model can reach state-of-the-art results by comparing it with previous solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3196890769,"This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of studying interactions among various sociodemographic risk factors of childhood stunting in Bangladesh with the help of an interpretable machine learning method. Data used for the analyses are extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014 and pertain to a sample of 6,170 under-5 children. Social and economic determinants such as wealth, mother's decision making on healthcare, parental education are considered in addition to geographic divisions and common demographic characteristics of children including age, sex and birth order. A classification tree was first constructed to identify important interaction-based rules that characterize children with different profiles of risk for stunting. Then binary logistic regression models were fitted to measure the importance of these interactions along with the individual risk factors. Results revealed that, as individual factors, living in Sylhet division (OR: 1.57; CI: 1.26-1.96), being an urban resident (OR: 1.28; CI: 1.03-1.96) and having working mothers (OR: 1.21; CI: 1.02-1.44) were associated with higher likelihoods of childhood stunting, whereas belonging to the richest households (OR: 0.56; CI: 0.35-0.90), higher BMI of mothers (OR: 0.68 CI: 0.56-0.84) and mothers' involvement in decision making about children's healthcare with father (OR: 0.83, CI: 0.71-0.97) were linked to lower likelihoods of stunting. Importantly however, risk classifications defined by the interplay of multiple sociodemographic factors showed more extreme odds ratios (OR) of stunting than single factor ORs. For example, children aged 14 months or above who belong to poor wealth class, have lowly educated fathers and reside in either Dhaka, Barisal, Chittagong or Sylhet division are the most vulnerable to stunting (OR: 2.52, CI: 1.85-3.44). The findings endorse the need for tailored-intervention programs for children based on their distinct risk profiles and sociodemographic characteristics."

This retrospective cohort analysis assessed the pneumonia burden and related healthcare resource utilization and costs in the at-risk (low, medium, and high-risk) adult patients in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).The claims data from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019 were extracted from the Dubai Real-World Claims Database for patients, aged ≥18 year, having at least 1 pneumonia claim. Data for the inpatient, outpatient and emergency visits were assessed for 12-months, before (pre-index) and after (follow-up) a pneumonia episode. Healthcare costs were calculated based on dollar value of 2020.Total 48,562 records of eligible patients were analyzed (mean age = 39.9 years; low [62.1%], medium [36.2%] and high [1.7%] risk cohorts). Mean all-cause healthcare costs were approximately >45% higher in the follow-up period (1,947 USD/patient) versus pre-index period (1,327 USD/patient). During follow-up period, the mean annual pneumonia incidence rate was 1.3 episodes, with a similar pattern across all cohorts. Overall, mean claims and costs (USD) per patient (all-cause) were highest in the high-risk cohort in the follow-up period (claims: overall, 11.6; high-risk, 22.0; medium-risk, 13.9; low-risk, 9.9; costs: high-risk, 14,184; medium-risk, 2,240; low-risk, 1,388). Similarly, the mean pneumonia-related costs (USD) per patient were highest for the high-risk cohort (overall: 1,305; high-risk, 10,207; medium-risk, 1,283; low-risk, 882), however, the claims were similar across cohorts (claims/patient: overall: 2.0; high-risk, 1.9; medium-risk, 2.2; low-risk, 1.9). Most all-cause and pneumonia-related costs were due to inpatient visits (4,901 and 4,818 USD respectively), while outpatient (1,232 and 166 USD respectively) and emergency visits (347 and 206 USD respectively) contributed significantly lesser.Pneumonia imposes a significant healthcare burden in the UAE, especially in the high-risk patients with severe comorbidities.

https://openalex.org/W3197257320,"Interoceptive accuracy is an index of the ability to perceive an individual’s internal bodily state, including heartbeat and respiration. Individual differences in interoceptive accuracy influence emotional recognition through autonomic nervous activity. However, the precise mechanism by which interoceptive accuracy affects autonomic reactivity remains unclear. Here, we investigated how cardiac reactivity induced by a non-affective external rhythm differed among individuals, using a heartbeat counting task. Because individuals with poor interoceptive accuracy cannot distinguish an external rhythm from their cardiac cycles, it has been hypothesized that the interoceptive effect on heart rate works differently in individuals with good interoceptive accuracy and those with poor interoceptive accuracy. Study participants observed a visual or auditory stimulus presented at a rhythm similar to the participants’ resting heart rates. The stimulus rhythm was gradually changed from that of their resting heart rate, and we recorded electrocardiographs while participants were exposed to the stimuli. Individuals with good interoceptive accuracy exhibited a deceleration in heart rate when the rhythm of the auditory stimulus changed. In contrast, in the group with poor interoceptive accuracy, the heart rate decreased only when the stimulus became faster. They were unable to distinguish the rhythm of their own heartbeat from that of the external rhythm; therefore, we propose that such individuals recognize the stimuli at the pace of their heart rate. Individuals with good interoceptive accuracy were able to distinguish their heart rates from the external rhythm. A modality difference was not observed in this study, which suggests that both visual and auditory stimuli help mimic heart rate. These results may provide physiological evidence that autonomic reactivity influences the perception of the internal bodily state, and that interoception and the autonomic state interact to some degree."
https://openalex.org/W3197161676,"Under inadequate chilling conditions, hydrogen cyanamide (HC) is often used to promote budbreak and improve earliness of Southern highbush blueberry ( Vaccinium corymbosum L. interspecific hybrids). However, HC is strictly regulated or even banned in some countries because of its high hazardous properties. Development of safer and effective alternatives to HC is critical to sustainable subtropical blueberry production. In this study, we examined the efficacy of HC and defoliants as bud dormancy-breaking agents for ‘Emerald’ blueberry. First, we compared water control, 1.0% HC (9.35 L ha –1 ), and three defoliants [potassium thiosulfate (KTS), urea, and zinc sulfate (ZS)] applied at 6.0% (28 kg ha –1 ). Model fitting analysis revealed that only HC and ZS advanced both defoliation and budbreak compared with the water control. HC-induced budbreak showed an exponential plateau function with a rapid phase occurring from 0 to 22 days after treatment (DAT), whereas ZS-induced budbreak showed a sigmoidal function with a rapid phase occurring from 15 to 44 DAT. The final budbreak percentage was similar in all treatments (71.7%–83.7%). Compared with the water control, HC and ZS increased yield by up to 171% and 41%, respectively, but the yield increase was statistically significant only for HC. Phytohormone profiling was performed for water-, HC- and ZS-treated flower buds. Both chemicals did not increase gibberellin 4 and indole-3-acetic acid production, but they caused a steady increase in jasmonic acid (JA) during budbreak. Compared with ZS, HC increased JA production to a greater extent and was the only chemical that reduced abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations during budbreak. A follow-up experiment tested ZS at six different rates (0–187 kg ha –1 ) but detected no significant dose-response on budbreak. These results collectively suggest that defoliants are not effective alternatives to HC, and that HC and ZS have different modes of action in budbreak induction. The high efficacy of HC as a dormancy-breaking agent could be due to its ability to reduce ABA concentrations in buds. Our results also suggest that JA accumulation is involved in budbreak induction in blueberry."
https://openalex.org/W3197379092,"In the past, China, like other developing countries in the world, pursued the goal of rapid economic development at the expense of ecology and ignored the issue of environmental protection. But in recent decades, as environmental problems have become increasingly prominent, developing countries have begun to explore ways to coordinate economy and ecological environment. As the largest developing country, China has been actively exploring ecological governance plans, putting forward the concept of green development, setting the goal of building a ""beautiful China"" and placing the construction of ecological civilization in the ontological status of social systems and national goals. In order to accelerate the green development process of enterprises in developing countries, based on the actual situation in China, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of environmental accounting information disclosure with enterprises, investors and media as the research objects, and analyzes the internal mechanism of environmental accounting information disclosure. The model finds that the equilibrium of the three parties is affected by multiple factors. Therefore, this study further uses system dynamics to explore the dynamic process of evolutionary games and the strategic choices among multiple agents, and explore the mechanism of three types of agents to promote environmental accounting information disclosure. The simulation results reveal that government incentives have a greater impact on guiding enterprises and the media to evolve in the direction of legal disclosure and participation in exposure strategies. In addition, the continuous reduction of the cumbersome degree of disclosure procedures and the difficulty of improving environmental performance can fundamentally promote companies to actively choose legal disclosure strategies, which will help improve the quality of environmental accounting information disclosure, boost investor confidence, and enhance government supervision."

During year one, NLF was also collected from welders (n = 6) from the same company to get a comparison with a traditional manufacturing technique with known exposure and health risks. The samples were investigated using untargeted proteomics, as well as using multi-immunoassay to analyze a panel of 71 inflammatory protein markers. NLF in AM operators from year 1 showed decreased levels of Immunoglobulin J and WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 2 and increased levels of Golgi membrane protein 1, Uteroglobin and Protein S100-A6 at the end of the workweek. At year two, after preventive interventions, there were no significant differences at the end of the workweek. In welders, Annexin A1 and Protein S100-A6 were increased at the end of the workweek. The analysis of 71 inflammatory biomarkers showed no significant differences between the beginning and the end of workweek year 1 in AM operators. We identified several proteins of interest in the AM operators that could serve as possible markers for exposure in future studies with a larger cohort for validation."
https://openalex.org/W3198661547,"Background Early detection and management of hearing loss are important to develop ordinary speaking language and academic skills during childhood. Lack of knowledge by either parents or health care providers could hinder the process of hearing loss diagnosis, such that the intervention will be less effective. There is little evidence about the knowledge and practice of family physicians regarding hearing screening in Saudi Arabia and worldwide. Objectives This study aimed to assess family physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to hearing loss in children. This in turn will help policy makers and educational institutions to establish and promote a program concerned with screening, diagnosis and intervention of paediatric hearing loss. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study enrolled 133 family physicians working at primary health centres in Saudi Arabia from March 2020 to September 2020. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of family physicians concerning hearing loss in children. Results The majority of the participants were working under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health and around half of them did not screen any child for hearing loss. Despite that, 91.7% indicated the importance of neonatal hearing screening, 70.7% indicate infant candidacy for cochlear implant and only 33.1% know about the existence of the early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) governmental program in kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Participants were able to identify factors associated with hearing loss such as a family history of hearing loss (85.6%), meningitis (75%) and craniofacial anomalies (51.5%). The most frequent specialists for patient referrals were ear nose and throat ENT (75.2%) and audiologists (67.7%). Conclusion This study shows that family physicians have good general background about the benefits of EHDI programs and the management of hearing loss in the paediatric population. However, it also indicated insufficient knowledge in other domains of hearing loss, including assessments and the presence of the EHDI governmental program in KSA. Further actions on the involvement of family physicians in the process of neonatal hearing screening, diagnosis and intervention for hearing impairment are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3198747896,"The endogenous opioid system is evolutionarily conserved across reptiles, birds and mammals and is known to modulate varied brain functions such as learning, memory, cognition and reward. To date, most of the behavioral and anatomical studies in songbirds have mainly focused on μ-opioid receptors (ORs). Expression patterns of δ-ORs in zebra finches, a well-studied species of songbird have not yet been reported, possibly due to the high sequence similarity amongst different opioid receptors. In the present study, a specific riboprobe against the δ-OR mRNA was used to perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on sections from the male zebra finch brain. We found that δ-OR mRNA was expressed in different parts of the pallium, basal ganglia, cerebellum and the hippocampus. Amongst the song control and auditory nuclei, HVC (abbreviation used as a formal name) and NIf (nucleus interfacialis nidopallii) strongly express δ-OR mRNA and stand out from the surrounding nidopallium. Whereas the expression of δ-OR mRNA is moderate in LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium), it is low in the MSt (medial striatum), Area X, DLM (dorsolateral nucleus of the medial thalamus), RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) of the song control circuit and Field L, Ov (nucleus ovoidalis) and MLd (nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis) of the auditory pathway. Our results suggest that δ-ORs may be involved in modulating singing, song learning as well as spatial learning in zebra finches."
https://openalex.org/W3197193144,"Based on multiple micro databases involving Chinese manufacturing enterprises and World Input-Output Database, this article investigates the impact of China’s manufacturing servitization on export technological sophistication from 2000 to 2010. The results show that manufacturing servitization has an inverted U-shaped impact on export technological sophistication. From the perspective of heterogeneity at the enterprise level and industry level, manufacturing servitization has an inverted U-shaped impact on export technological sophistication for mixed trade enterprises, central and western located enterprises, domestic and foreign enterprises, and knowledge-intensive industries, the nonlinear impact is in the promotion range. Besides, manufacturing servitization with domestic and foreign service input source has an inverted U-shaped impact on export technological sophistication, manufacturing servitization with the domestic consumption-oriented service input source and foreign production-oriented service input source have a promoting effect. Servitization with financial industry and technical research and development service source has a promoting effect, while servitization with transportation service input source has an inverted U-shaped effect. Overall global value chain participation level and simple global value chain participation have a positive moderating effect on the impact, especially for enterprises with lower production efficiency. Mechanism analysis confirms that the ""spillover"" effect and ""cost"" effect are important channels for manufacturing servitization to promote export technological sophistication."
https://openalex.org/W3198540726,"The aim of this study was to explore young people’s experiences of the role and the processes underpinning the use of alcohol and/or other substances in attempts to end their life. Seven young people, aged 16–25 years old, were interviewed using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse these interviews and develop an understanding of how young people understand their attempted suicide in the context of alcohol and/or other substance use. The analysis identified four superordinate themes reflecting young people’s experiences across the seven interviews. Superordinate themes included: i) The complexity of relationships; ii) The double-edged sword of alcohol and substance use; iii) The straw that broke the camel’s back; and iv) Reflecting on the on-going processes of recovery. The results of this study highlight the complex and multifaceted functions of the consumption of alcohol, and other drugs, in the experiences of young people attempting suicide. Young people described a number of inter and intrapersonal factors which impact upon their suicidal experiences including suicidal ideation and attempts. Participants reported using alcohol and substances as methods of coping with distress, low mood, hearing voices, anxiety and mania. However they also reflected on the impact that this has on their own suicidal ideation and attempts."
https://openalex.org/W3196484319,"The dichotomy of the earliest ecosystems into deltaic and floodplain forests was a long-standing view in paleobotany. The morphological traits such as nonbranching rootlets, bifurcating rhizomes, and bulbous bases of the primitive trees such as Eospermatopteris and lycopsids were considered adaptations to the lowland deltaic environments. In contrast, the traits of Archaeopteris trees such as wood, hierarchical branching networks of roots, and true leaves are an adaptation to the upland floodplain environments. The discovery of the Town of Cairo Highway Department (TCHD) fossil site in Upstate New York, where all major clades occupied a floodplain environment casts doubt on the validity of the environmental partition by the earliest trees at the higher taxonomic levels. This study aims to test the hypothesis of the environmental partition at the local scale by reconstructing the fossilized forest-floor landscape, the changes in the landscape over time, and the distribution patterns of the trees along the local environmental gradient at the TCHD site. To reconstruct the fossilized forest floor and to determine the environmental variations at the local scale, seven parallel cross-sections were drawn from south to north at THCH. The outcrop at the quarry floor measured 300 m in the north-south, and varied around 100-150 m in east-west direction. Primary sedimentary structures, the thickness of the sedimentary deposits that formed the forest floor and the surrounding quarry walls, paleosol features, and mega-fossils were measured, recorded, described, and mapped. Up to 3 meters deep drill-cores were extracted from the forest floor. The data was used to correlate the sedimentary deposits, and reconstruct the preserved landscape. Three dominant landscape features including an abandoned channel, an old-grown forest, and a local depression were recognized. These landscape features influenced greatly the pattern of local drainage, slope-gradients, patterns and durations of seasonal water pooling, paleosol developments, fossil distribution, and depositional environments. There is no evidence of environmental partitioning by trees at higher taxonomic levels at the local scale. The size and morphology of the root systems didn't determine the distribution of the trees along the local environmental gradient such as drainage patterns but played important roles in tree stabilization. Forests would go through self-thinning as they matured. Upon comparison, it was found that the forests in unstable environments showed greater resiliency compared to forests established in the stable environments."

https://openalex.org/W3197673197,"Since the 1970s, there has been a growing interest in how individuals appropriate scientific knowledge, which has recently been reinforced by societal issues such as vaccine releases and skepticism about global warming. Faced with the health and social consequences of the mistrust of scientific knowledge, there is an urgent need for tools to measure the acceptance or rejection of scientific knowledge, while at the same time gaining a more detailed understanding of the processes involved. This is the purpose of this article. Thus, we conducted 4 empirical studies to provide a validation of the Credibility of Science Scale from the perspective of a French population, which aims to assess the credibility that individuals attribute to science and to empirically evaluate the link that may exist between the different levels of credibility attributed to science and the social representations of science. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrated good structural validity, the good fidelity (homogeneity and temporal stability), and the good criterion validity of the French version of the scale. In Study 2, we observed the same psychometric qualities of the French version of the scale. We also noted a structuring of the social representation of science based on age (Factor 1) and on the credibility attributed to science (Factor 2). Our results also raise the question of possible means of intervention to promote a better perception of science."
https://openalex.org/W3197812223,"Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) is a familiar singer in the Western Hemisphere family Parulidae, yet apparent geographic variations in its song and potentially related causal mechanisms have not received detailed examination in previously published studies. Here, we analyzed song pattern variations of 651 Louisiana Waterthrush singers in audio spectrogram recordings obtained from our field work and publicly accessible bioacoustics archives. Visual and auditory assessment of the introductory note sequence of each song identified three distinct song types (A, B, and C) and most of the songs were assigned to one of these types. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest methods were used to verify the assignments and showed strong agreement for Type A with slightly less agreement on Types B and C. User error rates (proportion of the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifications that were incorrect) were low for Types A and B, and somewhat higher for Type C, while producer error rates (proportion of the song type for which the Linear Discriminant Analysis was incorrect) were somewhat higher for Types A and C than the minimal levels achieved for Type B. Our findings confirmed that most between-individual variation was in the number of notes and note sequence duration while most within-individual variation resulted from the percent of downstrokes. The location of each singer was plotted on a map of the breeding range and results suggested the song types have large-scale discrete geographic distributions that co-occur in some regions but not range-wide. Evaluation of the distributions provided tentative support for a hypothesis that two of the song types may independently exhibit congruence with the geographic extent of Pleistocene glacial boundaries and the third song type may be distinguished by a lack of congruence, but further investigation is needed to elucidate whether the song variations represent subpopulations with three separate evolutionary histories."
https://openalex.org/W3198306347,"Due to aging and health status people may be subjected to a decrease of cognitive ability and subsequently also a decline of driving safety. On the other hand there is a lack of valid and economically applicable instruments to assess driving performance.The study is designed to develop a valid screening-tool for fitness-to-drive assessment in older people with cognitive impairment externally validated on the basis of on-road driving performance.In a single-centre, non-randomized cross-sectional trial cognitive functioning and on-road-driving-behavior of older drivers will be assessed. Forty participants with cognitive impairment of different etiology and 40 healthy controls will undergo an extensive neuropsychological assessment. Additionally, an on-road driving assessment for external validation of fitness to drive will be carried out. Primary outcome measures will be performance in attention, executive functions and visuospatial tasks that will be validated with respect to performance on the on-road-driving-test. Secondary outcome measures will be sociodemographic, clinical- and driving characteristics to systematically examine their influence on the prediction of driving behavior.In clinical practice counselling patients with respect to driving safety is of great relevance. Thus, having valid, reliable, time economical and easily interpretable screening-tools on hand to counsel patients is of great relevance for practitioners.Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. The trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and various conferences.18-640. Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register. Registration number: DRKS00023549."
https://openalex.org/W3198453656,"To identify mechanical factors, as well as patients' biometric and surgeons' experience factors that correlate with the FF incidence in microkeratome (MK)-assisted LASIK and to construct a predictive model based on these parameters.55,700 consecutive LASIK treatments of 28,506 patients between January 2017 and April 2020 done by 50 surgeons in 10 centers, all with Sub Bowman Keratome (SBK) and 90μ head (OUP) were analyzed retrospectively for the incidence of FF and their correlation to mean keratometry, central corneal thickness, MK ring height and stop, as well as surgeons' experience. A prediction model was built and tested for sensitivity and specificity.The incidence of FF using the SBK MK was 0.276%. Risk factors were low central corneal thickness, very flat (-1) or very thick (+2) ring height, and higher stop values (p<0.001). Mean keratometry and low surgeon experience were not correlated to FF incidence. A prediction model with a cut-off FF risk of 0.274%, a 76% specificity, and a 73% sensitivity was applied.Free flaps are rarely seen in modern MK LASIK. However, the incidence of this complication using the SBK MK increases using higher stop values, very thick and very thin MK rings, and in eyes with thin corneas."
https://openalex.org/W3198817689,"Experimental grinding has been used to study the relationship between human humeral robusticity and cereal grinding in the early Holocene. However, such replication studies raise two questions regarding the robusticity of the results: whether female nonathletes used in previous research are sufficiently comparable to early agricultural females, and whether previous analysis of muscle activation of only four upper limb muscles is sufficient to capture the stress of cereal grinding on upper limb bones. We test the influence of both of these factors. Electromyographic activity of eight upper limb muscles was recorded during cereal grinding in an athletic sample of 10 female rowers and in 25 female nonathletes and analyzed using both an eight- and four-muscle model. Athletes had lower activation than nonathletes in the majority of measured muscles, but except for posterior deltoid these differences were non-significant. Furthermore, both athletes and nonathletes had lower muscle activation during saddle quern grinding than rotary quern grinding suggesting that the nonathletes can be used to model early agricultural females during saddle and rotary quern grinding. Similarly, in both eight- and four-muscle models, upper limb loading was lower during saddle quern grinding than during rotary quern grinding, suggesting that the upper limb muscles may be reduced to the previously used four-muscle model for evaluation of the upper limb loading during cereal grinding. Another implication of our measurements is to question the assumption that skeletal indicators of high involvement of the biceps brachii muscle can be interpreted as specifically indicative of saddle quern grinding."
