https://openalex.org/W4231764333,"Resonant cavities are essential building blocks governing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices. We report, at telecommunication wavelengths, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal topological cavities that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from topological cavities provides the opportunity to develop complex topological circuitry of arbitrary geometries for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2762155383,"INTRODUCTION Reliable estimation of gross primary production (GPP) from landscape to global scales is pivotal to a wide range of ecological research areas, such as carbon-climate feedbacks, and agricultural applications, such as crop yield and drought monitoring. However, measuring GPP at these scales remains a major challenge. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a signal emitted directly from the core of photosynthetic machinery. SIF integrates complex plant physiological functions in vivo to reflect photosynthetic dynamics in real time. The advent of satellite SIF observation promises a new era in global photosynthesis research. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF product is a serendipitous but critically complementary by-product of OCO-2’s primary mission target—atmospheric column CO 2 ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" overflow=""scroll""> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">X</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">CO</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ). OCO-2 SIF removes some important roadblocks that prevent wide and in-depth applications of satellite SIF data sets and offers new opportunities for studying the SIF-GPP relationship and vegetation functional gradients at different spatiotemporal scales. RATIONALE Compared with earlier satellite missions with SIF capability, the OCO-2 SIF product has substantially improved spatial resolution, data acquisition, and retrieval precision. These improvements allow satellite SIF data to be validated, for the first time, directly against ground and airborne measurements and also used to investigate the SIF-GPP relationship and terrestrial ecosystem functional dynamics with considerably better spatiotemporal credibility. RESULTS Coordinated airborne measurements of SIF with the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) were used to validate OCO-2 retrievals. The validation shows close agreement between OCO-2 and CFIS SIF, with a regression slope of 1.02 and R 2 of 0.71. Landscape gradients in SIF emission, corresponding to differences in vegetation types, were clearly delineated by OCO-2, a capability that was lacking in previous satellite missions. The SIF-GPP relationships at eddy covariance flux sites in the vicinity of OCO-2 orbital tracks were found to be more consistent across biomes than previously suggested. Finally, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses on OCO-2 SIF and available GPP products show highly consistent spatiotemporal correspondence in their leading EOF modes across the globe, suggesting that SIF and GPP are governed by similar dynamics and controlled by similar environmental and biological conditions. CONCLUSION OCO-2 represents a major advance in satellite SIF remote sensing. Our analyses suggest that SIF is a powerful proxy for GPP at multiple spatiotemporal scales and that high-quality satellite SIF is of central importance to studying terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Although the possibility of a universal SIF-GPP relationship across different biome types cannot be dismissed, in-depth process-based studies are needed to unravel the true nature of covariations between SIF and GPP. Of critical importance in such efforts are the potential coordinated dynamics between the light-use efficiencies of CO 2 assimilation and fluorescence emission in response to changes in climate and vegetation characteristics. Eventual synergistic uses of SIF with atmospheric CO 2 enabled by OCO-2 will lead to more reliable estimates of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks—when, where, why, and how carbon is exchanged between land and atmosphere—as well as a deeper understanding of carbon-climate feedbacks. The marked ecological gradients depicted by OCO-2’s high-resolution SIF measurements along a transect of temperate deciduous forests, crops, and urban area from Indiana to suburban Chicago, Illinois."

Act-seq opens the way for linking physiological stimuli with acute transcriptional dynamics in specific cell types in diverse complex tissues. The mammalian central nervous system supports a multitude of cognitive and behavioral functions through coordinated action of different neural circuits that are composed of diverse sets of differentiated cell types. Essential to the functional dissection of neural circuits is the precise identification and manipulation of neuronal subsets that are activated during a specific behavior or experience. The expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), which is rapidly and transiently induced by various cellular stimuli including synaptic activity, has been widely used to map neuronal activation patterns and to functionally label ensembles of activated neurons (Kawashima et al., 2014Kawashima T. Okuno H. Bito H. A new era for functional labeling of neurons: activity-dependent promoters have come of age.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Tonegawa et al., 2015Tonegawa S. Pignatelli M. Roy D.S. Ryan T.J. Memory engram storage and retrieval.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 35: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These approaches have been instrumental for understanding the functions of different brain regions and neuronal populations. However, they are mostly limited to the detection of one or a few IEGs, such as Fos, Egr1, and Arc, and the identity of the activated cells are often unclear. Since the activation level and dynamics of different IEGs can vary substantially between brain areas and cell types (Kawashima et al., 2014Kawashima T. Okuno H. Bito H. A new era for functional labeling of neurons: activity-dependent promoters have come of age.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), pre-selecting one or a few IEGs without a systematic survey may limit the detection of activated cell populations. On the other hand, several techniques for bulk transcriptomic profiling of discrete cell populations based on various molecular tags, such as translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A. Surmeier D.J. et al.A translational profiling approach for the molecular characterization of CNS cell types.Cell. 2008; 135: 738-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), RiboTag (Sanz et al., 2009Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Cell-type-specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated ribosome capture (Knight et al., 2012Knight Z.A. Tan K. Birsoy K. Schmidt S. Garrison J.L. Wysocki R.W. Emiliano A. Ekstrand M.I. Friedman J.M. Molecular profiling of activated neurons by phosphorylated ribosome capture.Cell. 2012; 151: 1126-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), allow comprehensive interrogation of the molecular features of different cell populations, including activated neurons. Nonetheless, they do not preserve single-cell identity, and rely on pre-selected “cell-type-specific” markers, which in many cases are not restricted to a single functionally or molecularly distinct cell type. This can confound the interpretation of results from these approaches. For example, it may not be possible to definitively distinguish between activation of neurons and that of non-neuronal cells, or between strong activation of a small fraction of the cells and weak activation of a large fraction of the cells. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have offered unprecedented power to reveal fine-scale molecular differences that may underlie functional heterogeneity across cell types (reviewed in Poulin et al., 2016Poulin J.-F. Tasic B. Hjerling-Leffler J. Trimarchi J.M. Awatramani R. Disentangling neural cell diversity using single-cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). scRNA-seq can potentially survey transcriptome-wide IEG activation and other transcriptional changes in an unbiased manner, and therefore holds the promise of providing a high-throughput, high-resolution tool for revealing the cell-type identity and molecular features of behaviorally relevant cell populations. Furthermore, single-cell profiling of acute transcriptomic changes will be of broad value to the study of diverse biological questions, such as studies on molecular and cellular responses to tissue injuries and immunological stimuli. A major, long-standing issue in transcriptional profiling of dissociated cells, including scRNA-seq, has been artificially evoked transcriptional perturbations that occur during conventional whole-cell dissociation procedures. This dissociation process has been shown to cause cell injury, cellular stress, and excitotoxicity, all of which can cause gene expression changes (Kolodziejczyk et al., 2015Kolodziejczyk A.A.

Cell. 2015; 58: 610-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, Lacar et al., 2016Lacar B. Linker S.B. Jaeger B.N. Krishnaswami S. Barron J. Kelder M. Parylak S.

Disentangling neural cell diversity using single-cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This can not only mask endogenous acute gene expression changes that are truly elicited by physiological stimuli, but may also confound characterization of baseline transcriptional profiles. By dissociating single nuclei instead of whole cells, a recent study showed the feasibility of isolating and profiling nuclei of activated neurons using single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) (Lacar et al., 2016Lacar B. Linker S.B. Jaeger B.N. Krishnaswami S. Barron J. Kelder M. Parylak S. Paquola A. Venepally P. Novotny M. et al.Nuclear RNA-seq of single neurons reveals molecular signatures of activation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11022Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, this method relies upon flow sorting of nuclei after immunostaining for one particular IEG (FOS), introducing bias in cell sampling (Lacar et al., 2016Lacar B. Linker S.B. Jaeger B.N. Krishnaswami S. Barron J. Kelder M. Parylak S. Paquola A. Venepally P. Novotny M. et al.Nuclear RNA-seq of single neurons reveals molecular signatures of activation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11022Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, compared to sequencing of whole cells, snRNA-seq detects appreciably less mRNAs per cell and biases toward nascent, unprocessed RNA species (Habib et al., 2017Habib, N., Basu, A., Avraham-Davidi, I., Burks, T., Choudhury, S.R., Aguet, F., Gelfand, E., Ardlie, K., Weitz, D.A., Rozenblatt-Rosen, O., et al.

Codeluppi S. Yung Y.C. Gao D. Chun J. Kharchenko P.V. Linnarsson S. Zhang K. A comparative strategy for single-nucleus and single-cell transcriptomes confirms accuracy in predicted cell-type expression from nuclear RNA.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). snRNA-seq therefore may not be suitable when studying cell types with low RNA content and/or when capture of processed, more mature RNA species in the cytoplasm is of importance. A method that enables faithful detection of both baseline and physiologically induced transcriptional features through scRNA-seq of whole cells is much needed. Here, we developed Act-seq, which combines scRNA-seq with a new single-cell preparation method that eliminates transcriptional perturbations artificially induced by conventional cell preparation procedures. Act-seq enables detailed cell-type classification and faithful detection of both baseline transcriptional profiles and acute gene expression changes in response to physiological stimuli. We applied Act-seq to the medial amygdala (MeA), a brain region important for the modulation of emotional processing and social behavior (Swanson, 2000Swanson L.W. Cerebral hemisphere regulation of motivated behavior.Brain Res. 2000; 886: 113-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Using Act-seq, we generated the first detailed molecular taxonomy of MeA cells, including 16 transcriptionally distinct neuronal subtypes as well as several non-neuronal cell types. We further demonstrated the ability of Act-seq to robustly capture acute gene expression changes in both neurons and non-neuronal cells and found that IEGs were differentially induced in different cell types. Lastly, we applied Act-seq to detecting neuronal activation following acute stress, revealing preferential activation of neuronal subpopulations that expressed the neuropeptide gene Cck. Previous studies have indicated heterogeneity in gene expression, electrophysiological property, morphology, connectivity, and function among MeA neurons (Bergan et al., 2014Bergan J.F. Ben-Shaul Y.

To dissect cell types in the MeA, we performed high-throughput single-cell transcriptional profiling using Drop-seq (Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z. Basu A. Satija R. Nemesh J. Shekhar K. Goldman M. Tirosh I. Bialas A.R. Kamitaki N.

We acquired 20,679 single-cell transcriptomes containing a total of 16,233 genes from acutely microdissected and dissociated MeA cells of adult mice (Figures 1A and 1B). Using principle component analysis (PCA), dimensionality reduction by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), and clustering with the Louvain-Jaccard algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008Blondel V.D.

Based on expression of previously known common cell-type markers, we identified seven main cell types in the MeA: neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), oligodendrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) (Figures 1C–1F). Differential gene expression analysis revealed numerous genes specifically enriched in each class (Figures 1E and 1F; Table S1, Table S2), many of which have been previously reported as cell-type markers in other brain regions. We further confirmed the expression of markers of each major cell type in the MeA using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohistochemistry (Figure 1G) and observed that the cell-type composition in our Drop-seq data largely corresponded with the proportion of different cell types revealed by staining (Figures 1E and 1H). In addition to known common cell-type markers, comparison with cell-type specific RNA-seq data in the cortex (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.-K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar) identified several genes that appeared to show cell-type enrichment patterns unique to the MeA. For example, Gng13 (a G protein subunit) and Vps8 (an endosomal trafficking protein) were enriched in neurons in the MeA (fold change = 5.7 and 3.5, respectively, false discovery rate [FDR] < 1.0 × 10−6) but not in neurons from the previously examined cortical regions (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B.

Similarly, Kcnt1 (a potassium channel subunit) and Lgi1 (a leucine-rich repeat protein) showed enrichment in astrocytes only in the MeA (fold change = 7.4 and 6.3, respectively, FDR < 1.0 × 10−6), but not in astrocytes in the previously examined cortical regions (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B.

Cerebral hemisphere regulation of motivated behavior.Brain Res. 2000; 886: 113-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Several genes, including Ecel1, Greb1, Esr1, and Rps6ka6, have been reported to display sexually dimorphic expression in the MeA (Xu et al., 2012Xu X. Coats J.K. Yang C.F. Wang A. Ahmed O.M. Alvarado M. Izumi T. Shah N.M. Modular genetic control of sexually dimorphic behaviors.Cell. 2012; 148: 596-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By examining the expression of these genes in different cell types, we found that Ecel1, Greb1, and Esr1 were enriched in neurons, whereas Rps6ka6 appeared to be more highly expressed in OPCs (Figure S2A), suggesting that sexually dimorphic gene expression in the MeA may arise from both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. To confirm the precision of our MeA dissection, we examined the expression of two genes, Cyp26b1 and Bmp3, which were selectively enriched in the neighboring basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei, but not MeA (Figures S3E and S3F). We confirmed that there was little expression of these genes in our scRNA-seq data generated from the MeA (Figures S3A and S3B). This lack of expression was not due to an inability to detect these genes by Drop-seq, as they were readily detectable by Drop-seq in cells dissociated from a broader amygdalar region that included the BLA and CeA (Figures S3C and S3D). To further understand gene coexpression relationships across cells at a systems level, we performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), which defines distinct coexpression modules of correlated genes independent of our cell-type classification (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10270) Google Scholar). Notably, this unsupervised analysis identified gene coexpression modules that showed specific, strong upregulation in the individual cell types that we have independently defined, supporting our clustering results (Figures 1I and 1J). In addition, gene ontology analysis confirmed that these modules were enriched for genes involved in functional processes closely related to the particular cell types in which they were highly expressed (Figure S2B). To further explore neuronal diversity in the MeA, we performed classification for 2,444 neurons with the highest transcript number in our dataset using the BackSpin algorithm (Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods). We partitioned the neurons into 16 clusters that could be distinguished by unique sets of markers, including genes encoding neurotransmitter metabolism enzymes and transporters, neuropeptides, receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figures S4A and S4B; Table S2). Clusters 1–8 expressed higher levels of GABAergic markers (Gad1, Gad2, and Slc32a1), clusters 9–12 expressed higher levels of glutamatergic markers (Slc17a6 or Slc17a7), and cluster 13 was enriched for Nos1 (nitric oxide synthase 1) (Figure S4B; Figure 2B). Several neuropeptides, including NPY (neuropeptide Y), CCK (cholecystokinin), substance P, CART peptides, and SST (somatostatin), have been implicated in the regulation of emotional processes by the amygdala (Ebner and Singewald, 2006Ebner K.

Nonetheless, the distribution of various neuropeptides in different MeA neuronal populations is poorly documented. We found that many neuropeptides exhibited distinct expression profiles across MeA neuronal clusters. To highlight a few, Tac1 (encoding substance P) was enriched in cluster 1, and Cartpt (encoding CART peptides) was enriched in clusters 1 and 2 (Figure 2B); Sst was predominantly expressed in clusters 4 and 5, and was largely non-overlapping with Tac1 or Cartpt (Figure 2B). Cck overlapped with Tac1 and Cartpt in cluster 1 and was also expressed in clusters 3, 10, and 11 (Figure 2B). In addition, we found several transcription factors with cluster restricted expression patterns. For example, cluster 9 specifically expressed Lhx1, Lhx5, and Nhlh2, whereas clusters 10 and 11 expressed Mef2c and Bcl11b (data not shown). To further validate the observations from Drop-seq, we performed dual-color FISH. Costaining for Cartpt or Sst and Gad2 revealed expression of Cartpt and Sst largely in subsets of Gad2+ neurons (Figures 2C, 2D, and 2I). On the other hand, costaining for Cck and Gad2 or Slc17a7 confirmed that Cck was expressed in subsets of both Gad2+ and Slc17a7+ neurons (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2I). In addition, Sst and Cartpt were largely mutually exclusive, whereas Cck and Cartpt signals showed partial overlap (Figures 2G, 2H, and 2J). These results agreed well with our Drop-seq data. We further assessed the spatial distribution of different neuronal subpopulations across different anatomical subdivisions of the MeA using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3669) Google Scholar) and observed some degree of spatial separation between several subpopulations. In particular, we found that Cartpt+ cells were enriched in the posterodorsal MeA (MeApd) (Figures S4C–S4F), whereas Sst+ cells showed a reduced density in the MeApd but were broadly distributed in all other MeA subdivisions (Figures S4O–S4R). Cck+ cells were mostly localized in the anteroventral MeA (MeAav) and the MeApd (Figures S4G–S4J), and Nos1+ cells were enriched in the MeAav and the MeApv (Figures S4K–S4N). Taken together, our analysis provides the first systematic transcriptional survey of MeA neurons, revealing aspects of molecular heterogeneity among these neurons that were largely unappreciated before. Astrocytes play important roles in the regulation of neuronal development and function as well as immune response in the central nervous system (Clarke and Barres, 2013Clarke L.E.

Astrocyte barriers to neurotoxic inflammation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In our dataset, astrocytes comprised the second largest cell population (Figures 1E and 1H). Using Louvain-Jaccard clustering, we further divided the MeA astrocytes into three distinct subclasses (Figure 3A), which we refer to as AS1, AS2, and AS3 hereinafter. While all three clusters shared a number of common astrocyte markers, such as Gja1, Lfng, and Agt, many genes showed higher expression in one population relative to the others (Figures 3B and 3C). For example, Nkx6-2, Sfrp5, and Luzp2 were selectively enriched in AS1, while Myoc, Cidea, and Gfap were selectively enriched in AS3 (Figure 3C). AS2 expressed marker genes that partially overlapped with AS1 and AS3 but clearly showed a distinct transcriptional profile from AS1 and AS3. Relative to AS3, AS2 showed the expression of a subset of AS1-expressed genes, such as Slc7a10, Mfge8, and Gria2, but not others, such as Nkx6-2, Sfrp5, and Luzp2 (Figures 3B and 3C). AS2 also highly expressed a subset of AS3-expressed genes, such as Id3, Lcat, and Id1, but not others, such as Myoc and Cidea (Figures 3B and 3C). Consistently, WGCNA performed on astrocytes identified one gene coexpression module (M1) significantly upregulated in AS1 and one module (M2) strongly upregulated in AS3 (Figure 3D).

https://openalex.org/W2760848730,"INTRODUCTION The influence of El Niño on climate is accompanied by large changes to the carbon cycle, and El Niño–induced variability in the carbon cycle has been attributed mainly to the tropical continents. However, owing to a dearth of observations in the tropics, tropical carbon fluxes are poorly quantified, and considerable debate exists over the dominant mechanisms (e.g., plant growth, respiration, fire) and regions (e.g., humid versus semiarid tropics) on the net carbon balance. RATIONALE The launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) shortly before the 2015–2016 El Niño, the second strongest since the 1950s, has provided an opportunity to understand how tropical land carbon fluxes respond to the warm and dry climate characteristics of El Niño conditions. The El Niño events may also provide a natural experiment to study the response of tropical land carbon fluxes to future climate changes, because anomalously warm and dry tropical environments typical of El Niño are expected to be more frequent under most emission scenarios. RESULTS The tropical regions of three continents (South America, Asia, and Africa) had heterogeneous responses to the 2015–2016 El Niño, in terms of both climate drivers and the carbon cycle. The annual mean precipitation over tropical South America and tropical Asia was lower by 3.0σ and 2.8σ, respectively, in 2015 relative to the 2011 La Niña year. Tropical Africa, on the other hand, had near equal precipitation and the same number of dry months between 2015 and 2011; however, surface temperatures were higher by 1.6σ, dominated by the positive anomaly over its eastern and southern regions. In response to the warmer and drier climate anomaly in 2015, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere than in 2011, which accounts for 83.3% of the global total 3.0–gigatons of carbon (gigatons C) net biosphere flux differences and 92.6% of the atmospheric CO 2 growth-rate differences between 2015 and 2011. It indicates that the tropical land biosphere flux anomaly was the driver of the highest atmospheric CO 2 growth rate in 2015. The three tropical continents had an approximately even contribution to the pantropical net carbon flux anomaly in 2015, but had diverse dominant processes: gross primary production (GPP) reduced carbon uptake (0.9 ± 0.96 gigatons C) in tropical South America, fire increased carbon release (0.4 ± 0.08 gigatons C) in tropical Asia, and respiration increased carbon release (0.6 ± 1.01 gigatons C) in Africa. We found that most of the excess carbon release in 2015 was associated with either extremely low precipitation or high temperatures, or both. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that the global El Niño effect is a superposition of regionally specific effects. The heterogeneous climate forcing and carbon response over the three tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines carbon cycle interannual variability, which could also be due to previous disturbance and soil and vegetation structure. The similarity between the 2015 tropical climate anomaly and the projected climate changes imply that the role of the tropical land as a buffer for fossil fuel emissions may be reduced in the future. The heterogeneous response may reflect differences in temperature and rainfall anomalies, but intrinsic differences in vegetation species, soils, and prior disturbance may contribute as well. A synergistic use of multiple satellite observations and a long time series of spatially resolved fluxes derived from sustained satellite observations will enable tests of these hypotheses, allow for a more process-based understanding, and, ultimately, aid improved carbon-climate model projections.

Here we describe nutritional regulation of key neurons that control hunger in vivo. We show that intragastric nutrient infusion rapidly and durably inhibits hunger-promoting AgRP neurons in awake, behaving mice. This inhibition is proportional to the number of calories infused but surprisingly independent of macronutrient identity or nutritional state. We show that three gastrointestinal signals-serotonin, CCK, and PYY-are necessary or sufficient for these effects. In contrast, the hormone leptin has no acute effect on dynamics of these circuits or their sensory regulation but instead induces a slow modulation that develops over hours and is required for inhibition of feeding. These findings reveal how layers of visceral signals operating on distinct timescales converge on hypothalamic feeding circuits to generate a central representation of energy balance."

The common currency of neural computation is the transmission of action potentials from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons. Neural circuit computation relies upon action potential transmission, and thus changes in transmission efficacy are vital for information storage. In particular, connectivity between excitatory neurons and local interneurons (feedback inhibition, including lateral inhibition) is believed to gate afferent drive (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017Fernández-Ruiz A.

Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of neural circuit operations requires not only connectomic mapping of circuit elements, but also the elucidation of the parameters that affect the dynamic properties of individual synaptic connections that support circuit computation. Synaptic connectivity and strength are usually assayed through paired intracellular recording of the pre- and postsynaptic cells, a method that is impractical in awake-behaving animals, particularly in deep brain structures. An alternative, albeit indirect, approach is to use in vivo multi-electrode extracellular recordings, which provide the timing of spikes recorded in parallel from hundreds of neurons. With such data, it has been suggested that synaptic properties can be deduced from the reliability and precision of spiking in one neuron in the milliseconds after a spike of another cell (Ahissar et al., 1992Ahissar E.

Cross-correlation analysis of interneuronal connectivity in cat visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1981; 46: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, to accurately detect monosynaptic connections requires that pairwise interactions be isolated from indirect polysynaptic drive, as well as from ubiquitous common “third party” inputs, which have the potential to synchronize neurons that lack direct synaptic coupling (Ostojic et al., 2009Ostojic S. Brunel N. Hakim V. How connectivity, background activity, and synaptic properties shape the cross-correlation between spike trains.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10234-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A reliable way to rule out the possibility of third party coordination is to demonstrate that postsynaptic spikes are causally related to the spiking of a single presynaptic neuron. To determine an accurate method for detecting synaptic connections from spike timing data, we decoupled presynaptic neurons from the ongoing network activity through single-cell juxtacellular current injection or optogenetic stimulation of small groups of cells. We focused on the strong excitatory-to-inhibitory synapses in the CA1 region (Gulyás et al., 1993Gulyás A.I. Miles R. Sík A. Tóth K. Tamamaki N. Freund T.F. Hippocampal pyramidal cells excite inhibitory neurons through a single release site.Nature. 1993; 366: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), as weak connections are likely missed with this spike transmission-based approach. First, we generated a “ground-truth” dataset in which we identified monosynaptic pyramidal cell drive of local interneurons and validated two models for detection of such connections. This enabled us to identify monosynaptic connections among nearly 30,000 pyramidal cell-interneuron pairs recorded in behaving mice and rats and examine the functional architecture and dynamics of the excitatory to inhibitory circuit. Using this approach, we uncovered the anatomical organization and several dynamic properties of pyramidal cell-interneuron connections. Key findings include elucidating the space constant for connection strength, time constants for presynaptic cooperativity and postsynaptic receptivity, and support for the role of common excitatory inputs in generating synchrony among interneurons. Additionally, we found that a diversity of short-term facilitation and short-term depression dynamics were simultaneously expressed by different connections of single presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Given that inhibition controls the dynamics of pyramidal cell activity, these findings have important implications for the organization and construction of cell assemblies (Buzsáki, 2010Buzsáki G.

Neurosci. 2016; 19: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We obtained recordings of CA1 neuronal ensembles from freely behaving and awake/sleeping mice (n = 9) and rats (n = 4) and awake head-fixed mice (n = 8). Neurons were separated by type (pyramidal cells versus interneurons; see STAR Methods). Potential synaptic connections between neuron pairs were assessed by examining the short-latency interactions between cell pairs using spike train cross-correlograms (CCGs) (Figures 1B–1F; see STAR Methods). In a dataset of >400,000 neuron pairs, we examined a total of 29,964 excitatory to inhibitory pairwise interactions and 8,602 interactions among inhibitory cells. Figure 1D illustrates short time-scale interactions for four selected neurons, in which two pyramidal neurons (PYR1 and PYR2) potentially excited the same two interneurons (INT1 and INT2). This is evidenced by the short-latency delays between peak firing from the reference spike of the pyramidal neuron (time 0) and the putative interneuron, visible in the CCG (∼1–2 ms delay; Figures 1D and 1E). In contrast, the CCG between the two interneurons showed a zero-centered peak (INT1–INT2 peak: ∼0 ms, Figures 1D and 1F). This zero-centered synchrony, sometimes referred to as “zero time” lag correlation (Diba et al., 2014Diba K. Amarasingham A. Mizuseki K. Buzsáki G.

Visuomotor integration is associated with zero time-lag synchronization among cortical areas.Nature. 1997; 385: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), may be due to the two interneurons sharing a common excitatory drive (Figures 1A and 1D) or to interactions among the interneurons. In a first set of experiments, we examined monosynaptic drive for evoked spikes of presynaptic neurons and compared this drive to that observed during spontaneous activity. We then examined how such connections compared with, and contributed to, zero-centered synchrony among interneurons. We used two methods to test the hypothesis that monosynaptic connections from PYR to INT can be reliably detected from spike timing. The goal of both approaches was to provide a comparison of spike transmission probabilities for evoked (experimentally driven) and spontaneous (network driven) spikes. In the first approach, we evoked action potentials in single presynaptic PYRs using juxtacellular electrodes (Pinault, 1996Pinault D. A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or Neurobiotin.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 65: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), while recording extracellular spikes of local INTs (∼50–100 μm estimated inter-somatic distance; Figure 2A). We used juxtacellular current pulses to induce spikes in PYRs (Figure 2B; median gain = 23.2 Hz, median percent increase: 470%, n = 18). The juxtacellular stimulation protocol approached the limits (Doose et al., 2016Doose J. Doron G. Brecht M. Lindner B. Noisy juxtacellular stimulation in vivo leads to reliable spiking and reveals high-frequency coding in single neurons.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 11120-11132Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of experimentally evoked spike-time precision in PYRs in vivo (mean/median standard deviation of first spike latency after pulse onset = 13.0 ms). To validate that evoked presynaptic spikes were indeed decoupled from network drive, we assessed the degree of synchrony between the evoked spikes and the activity of other pyramidal cells. As compared to spontaneous spikes, evoked spikes were significantly less likely to occur within ±2 ms of spikes of either other PYR presynaptic to the same INT (p = 0.002, n = 26) or all other PYR (p = 0.03, n = 18). As ±2 ms is the window of maximal presynaptic cooperativity (see later in Figure 5), this demonstrates significant decoupling from the network on timescales relevant to presynaptic cooperativity. CCGs were computed independently for spontaneous and evoked spikes (Figures 2C and 2D), and spike transmission probability was calculated as excess synchrony in the 0.8–2.8 ms bins above baseline co-modulation (green area, Figure 2I; see STAR Methods). To assess spike transmission probability following maximally decoupled spikes, we considered only the first evoked spike after the stimulation onset. Transmission probabilities for spontaneous and first evoked spikes were significantly correlated (r = 0.79, p < 1.11−6, n = 30, Figure 2K), and the mean transmission probability for spontaneous spikes did not differ from the first evoked spikes (sign test, p = 0.86, n = 18, Figure S2B). Importantly, deviance in transmission probability for spontaneous versus first evoked spikes did not correlate with the mean time to the first evoked spike (r = 0.153, p = 0.416, n= 30) or with the standard deviation of the time to the first evoked spike (r = 0.151, p = 0.423, n = 30). This suggests that the degree of decoupling of the presynaptic cell from the network cannot explain the difference between transmission probabilities for spontaneous versus evoked spikes. Finally, to assess transmission probability during spontaneous decoupling of presynaptic activity from identified convergent inputs, we tested transmission efficacy for spikes in which the presynaptic cell fired and other convergent inputs were silent within a ±2 ms time window. Consistent with our evoked experiments, the spike transmission probability for all spontaneous spikes matched that for the spontaneously decoupled spikes (sign test, p = 0.26, n = 30), thus suggesting that the major part of the observed CCG peak is indeed a pairwise effect. Combined, these results support the conclusion that pyramidal cell-interneuron CCG peaks reflect monosynaptic connections. In our second approach, we used focal optogenetic stimulation to increase the firing rate of small numbers of pyramidal cells (Figure 2F; Figure S2C), effectively scaling up the experiment in order to gain a more quantitative estimate of the distribution of the pairwise interactions. To record and activate hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we implanted mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under control of an excitatory neuron-specific promoter (CaMKII::ChR2 mice; see STAR Methods) with four-shank silicon probes equipped with 12 μLEDs (Figure 2E) (Kim et al., 2016Kim, K., English, D.F., Mckenzie, S., Wu, F., Stark, E., Seymour, J., Wu, P.C., Wise, K., Buzsaki, G., and Yoon, E.

Since the light sources in this device are intermingled with the recording sites, sub-μW light power is sufficient to activate small numbers of pyramidal cells confined to the vicinity of the light from a single recording shank (Wu et al., 2015Wu F.

We examined the CCGs of 224 optogenetically excited PYR cells and 88 simultaneously recorded INT (yielding 954 potential connections, n = 4 mice) and identified 118 PYR-INT pairs (n = 94 PYR, n = 26 INT) with significant peaks in the CCG (see STAR Methods). As we found with the juxtacellular experiments, CCGs for these pairs were similar when constructed with optogenetically evoked spikes or spontaneous spikes (Figures 2G and 2H), and the spike transmission probabilities were highly correlated (Figure 2L; r = 0.85, p < 1.89−34). The optogenetic stimulation was of insufficient magnitude to evoke ripple-frequency oscillations in the LFP, requiring more than ∼15–20 neurons (Stark et al., 2014Stark E. Roux L. Eichler R. Senzai Y. Royer S. Buzsáki G. Pyramidal cell-interneuron interactions underlie hippocampal ripple oscillations.Neuron. 2014; 83: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, coordinated activity in this frequency range is observable as secondary peaks in the PYR-INT CCGs (Figures 2G and 2H), reflecting interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons within small local circuits. Spike transmission was significantly higher during optogenetic stimulation as compared to baseline (Wilcoxon rank sum, p < 9.0−30). This suggests that more than one optogenetically activated presynaptic pyramidal cell was driving the same interneuron, possibly including optogenetically excited presynaptic terminals of other pyramidal cells. When the number of presynaptic neurons firing together in 2 ms was considered, transmission probability was not different for spontaneous versus optogenetically evoked spikes (Figure S2D), suggesting that presynaptic cooperativity could explain the gain in spike transmission probability during optogenetic stimulation. The data from both our juxtacellular and optogenetic experiments thus support the hypothesis that pyramidal cell-interneuron CCG peaks can be reliably used to identify monosynaptic connections. We used the spike transmission during juxtacellular current or optogenetic stimulation as our “ground truth” data in determining synaptic connectivity. With this labeled data, we tested the accuracy of two synapse detection algorithms applied to spontaneous spiking activity. In our first approach, we considered the cross-correlation between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Under this framework, synaptic interactions were assumed to produce excess synchrony above that expected from lower frequency co-modulation induced by common network drive. The low-frequency network co-modulation was dissociated from the high-frequency synaptic synchrony by convolving the observed CCG with a partially hollow Gaussian kernel (Stark and Abeles, 2009Stark E. Abeles M. Unbiased estimation of precise temporal correlations between spike trains.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 179: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and only pairs with significant high-frequency synchrony (Figure 2I, “fast”) were retained for subsequent analysis. In addition to fast pairwise synchrony in excess of slow co-modulation, we assumed that the synaptic interaction must produce significant excess synchrony in the causal direction, with the peak in the CCG at positive lags higher than that observed at negative lags (Figure 2I, “causal”). The performance of a classifier defined by the fast and causal elements of the pairwise interaction was determined by its receiver operating characteristic curve (Figure 2J), which showed a true positive rate of 81.3% and a false positive rate of 2.1% at our optimal performance threshold (Provost and Fawcett, 2001Provost F. Fawcett T. Robust classification for imprecise environments.Mach. Learn. 2001; 42: 203-231Crossref Scopus (917) Google Scholar). As an independent approach, we used a generalized linear model that derives the expected spike transmission kernel while explicitly modeling the origin of the network co-modulation (Pillow et al., 2008Pillow J.W. Shlens J. Paninski L. Sher A. Litke A.M. Chichilnisky E.J. Simoncelli E.P. Spatio-temporal correlations and visual signalling in a complete neuronal population.Nature. 2008; 454: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) by including regressors for multi-unit activity and phasic modulation by ripple and theta oscillations. The algorithms had strikingly similar detection accuracy and quantitative agreement on the contribution of the single pre-synaptic input to the increase in the post-synaptic firing rate (Figure S3). Since both algorithms performed equally well, we used the simpler and computationally more efficient convolution method to classify (see STAR Methods) a large set of potential connections in 29,964 PYR-INT pairs, yielding 1,754 monosynaptic connections (Figure 2M). We next addressed the hypothesis that “zero lag” peaks in the CCGs between pairs of interneurons (<1 ms; Figure 1F) reflect a common drive of neuronal pairs from divergent presynaptic neurons (Diba et al., 2014Diba K.

Physiological properties and behavioral correlates of hippocampal granule cells and mossy cells.Neuron. 2017; 93: 691-704.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Such synchrony was not always exactly zero-centered, possibly due to axonal conduction delays, and thus we first aimed to determine whether such a situation could be mistaken for monosynaptic drive. We compared CCGs for PYR-INT and INT-INT pairs with different inter-somatic distances (by choosing cells recorded on different shanks of the silicon probe; Figures 3A and 3B , n = 4 rats). PYR-INT pairs with significant CCG peaks could be detected up to 600 μm apart (Figures 3A and 3C, green), while INT-INT pairs with significant CCG peaks could be detected across all shanks placed in the pyramidal layer (up to 1.4 mm distance; Figure 3C, black). For PYR-INT pairs, inter-somatic distance strongly correlated with the time of the peak in the cross correlation, even when regressing out the influence of connection strength on peak timing (partial r2 of distance and lag = 0.49, p < 10−5; Figure 3C). Similarly, the peak delay between INT-INT increased with inter-somatic distance (partial r2 of distance and lag = 0.35, p = 10−5, n = 4 rats; Figure 3C). Importantly, the distribution of the delays to the CCG peak for connected PYR-INT pairs and synchronous INT-INT pairs, at ≥200 μm (Figure 3D), showed that the two peaks were distinct. These observations show that the timing of the CCG peak can effectively disambiguate zero lag synchrony between INT-INT pairs and the monosynaptic drive seen between PYR-INT pairs. To evaluate the potential contribution of local excitatory inputs to the zero lag synchrony seen among interneurons, we first assessed whether the observation of multiple convergent inputs influences interneuron coordination. Highly synchronous interneuron pairs are expected to have more spikes emitted at short interspike intervals (ISIs). Therefore, we calculated the distribution of ISIs between spikes from two interneurons and compared the observed distribution to a resampled dataset in which the spike trains were shifted relative to one another (see STAR Methods). In support of common excitatory inputs contributing to zero-lag INT-INT synchrony, interneurons with more shared presynaptic partners exhibited significantly, and proportionally, more short pairwise ISIs (Figure 3E). To test for the ability of interneurons to generate synchrony among themselves (Hu et al., 2011Hu H. Ma Y. Agmon A. Submillisecond firing synchrony between different subtypes of cortical interneurons connected chemically but not electrically.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3351-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we stimulated single interneurons with a juxtacellular electrode (mean gain during stimulation: 59.1 Hz, SD 46.6 Hz, n = 9 stimulated interneurons in three mice) while monitoring the extracellular spiking of other local (∼50–100 μm inter-somatic distance) interneurons with a silicon probe. CCGs constructed with spontaneously occurring juxtacellular spikes exhibited significant zero-centered peaks, while CCGs constructed with evoked spikes had no, or significantly, diminished, zero-centered peaks (Figure 3F; Figure S4), suggesting that interneuron-interneuron interactions alone may not be sufficient for generating zero-lag synchrony. Figure 4A illustrates the connectivity map of pyramidal cells and interneurons recorded in a single session, showing that individual pyramidal neurons targeted multiple interneurons (Figure 4B) and that multiple pyramidal cells converged on the same interneuron (Figure 4C). The probability of finding a connection decreased with increased distance along the septo-temporal axis (Figure 4D), as expected, due to the increasing number of potential targets in larger volumes. We observed a higher probability of connections from superficial pyramidal neurons onto deep interneurons (Figure 4E). The magnitude of spike transmission probability between PYR-INT varied several orders of magnitude and its distribution was skewed (Anderson-Darling test for normality p < 0.05; Figure 4F). We found a significant positive correlation (r = 0.33; p = 7.66−9, n = 784) between the magnitude of spike transmission probability and the density of PYR-INT convergence for individual INT (Figure 4G). This suggests that interneurons receiving more connections from local PYR also tend to have apparently stronger connections with local PYR cells. Stronger spike transmission may be explained by properties of the synapse (i.e., larger conductance), postsynaptic features (i.e., more depolarized resting membrane potential and/or lower threshold voltage), or a combination of these factors. Finally, we demonstrated that spike transmission probability decreased with increased distance between PYR-INT pairs (rank sum, same shank versus one shank away p = 2.92−17, one shank away versus two shanks away, p = 6.0−6, correlation coefficient of distance with spike transmission probability, p = −0.19, p = 5.0−17; Figure 4H), which is not due to differences in synchrony among local versus distant pyramidal neurons, as pyramidal cells on the same shank, as compared to those recorded on separate shanks, were equally likely to fire at short latency (2–5 ms) ISIs (rank-sum test for excess synchrony p > 0.05; see STAR Methods). Finally, we assessed the effect of brain state on PYR-INT connection strength at different intersomatic distances and found that distal pairs, as compared to pairs recorded on the same shank, had more of a decrease in spike transmission probability during sleep as compared to wake (Figure S4B). Synchronous spiking of a presynaptic population (in this case two neurons) is expected to facilitate spike transmission due to synaptic integration. First, we identified such synchronous events and found that pyramidal neuron pairs that shared a postsynaptic target were more likely to co-fire at short intervals (<10 ms), compared to those that did not have a shared postsynaptic partner (Figure 5A). Though our synchrony measure controls for firing rate (see STAR Methods), we also saw an increase in short ISI synchrony when explicitly equalizing the rates between the two groups (data not shown). We next examined the statistics of the postsynaptic spiking at times of high presynaptic synchrony (defined as two presynaptic neurons spiking with an ISI of less than ±2"
https://openalex.org/W2762558415,"INTRODUCTION Earth’s carbon cycle involves large fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) between the atmosphere, land biosphere, and oceans. Over the past several decades, net loss of CO 2 from the atmosphere to the land and oceans has varied considerably from year to year, equaling 20 to 80% of CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. On average, the uptake is about 50%. The imbalance between CO 2 emissions and removal is seen in increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. In recent years, an increase of 2 to 3 parts per million (ppm) per year in the atmospheric mole fraction, which is currently about 400 ppm, has been observed. Almost a quarter of the CO 2 emitted by human activities is being absorbed by the ocean, and another quarter is absorbed by processes on land. The identity and location of the terrestrial sinks are poorly understood. This absorption has been attributed by some to tropical or Eurasian temperate forests, whereas others argue that these regions may be net sources of CO 2 . The efficiency of these land sinks appears to vary dramatically from year to year. Because the identity, location, and processes controlling these natural sinks are not well constrained, substantial additional uncertainty is added to projections of future CO 2 levels. RATIONALE The NASA satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), which was launched on 2 July 2014, is designed to collect global measurements with sufficient precision, coverage, and resolution to aid in resolving sources and sinks of CO 2 on regional scales. Since 6 September 2014, the OCO-2 mission has been producing about 2 million estimates of the column-averaged CO 2 dry-air mole fraction ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" overflow=""scroll""> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">X</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">CO</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) each month after quality screening, with spatial resolution of &lt;3 km 2 per sounding. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a small amount of light emitted during photosynthesis, is detected in remote sensing measurements of radiance within solar Fraunhofer lines and is another data product from OCO-2. RESULTS The measurements from OCO-2 provide a global view of the seasonal cycles and spatial patterns of atmospheric CO 2 , with the anticipated year-over-year growth rate. The buildup of CO 2 in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and its rapid decrease in concentration as spring arrives (and the SIF increases) is seen in unprecedented detail. The enhanced CO 2 in urban areas relative to nearby background areas is observed with a single overpass of OCO-2. Increases in CO 2 due to the biomass burning in Africa are also clearly observed.

The NDE contents of all 4 proteins were decreased significantly in AD dementia ( n = 46), and diminished levels of AMPA4 and NLGN1 correlated with the extent of cognitive loss. In a preclinical period, 6-11 yr before the onset of dementia, the NDE levels of all but NPTX2 were significantly lower than those of matched controls, and levels of all proteins declined significantly with the development of dementia. Reductions in NDE levels of these specialized excitatory synaptic proteins may therefore be indicative of the extent of cognitive loss and may reflect progression of the severity of AD.-Goetzl, E.

These discrepancies likely stem from a reliance by both models on measures of regional activity and statistical coherence that cannot resolve the activity dynamics of discrete, anatomically defined projections. Thus, tracking real-time, learning-related changes in the activity of associative and sensorimotor cortical inputs to striatal subregions will refine and help disambiguate the circuit basis of action learning. Similarly lacking from neural models of skill learning is an account of complex modulation of presynaptic function. Glutamate release from corticostriatal terminals, known to drive activity in striatal medium-sized spiny projection neurons (Wilson, 1995Wilson C.J.

However, monitoring presynaptic function in discrete corticostriatal projections in vivo during learning is required to test these predictions and advance a more anatomically and physiologically constrained view of how cortex communicates with striatum to encode action learning. We designed novel in vivo fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

We injected adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding a Cre recombinase-dependent form of the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6s into either the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the M1 of mice expressing Cre under the control of the Emx1 promoter (Emx1::Cre mice). GCaMP6s was thus expressed in mPFC or M1 pyramidal neurons and their dorsal striatal inputs, which preferentially innervate the DMS or DLS, respectively (Figures 1A and 1B ). An optical fiber was implanted into the DMS or DLS to simultaneously deliver blue excitation light and collect GCaMP6s fluorescence from associative (mPFC-DMS) or sensorimotor (M1-DLS) inputs (Figure S1). Fluorescence was directed into a polychromator and 16-channel photomultiplier array coupled to a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module to quantify bulk fluorescence across a range of wavelengths (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation.Nature. 2013; 494: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, Cui et al., 2014Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Luo G. Pham M.D. Lovinger D.M. Vogel S.S. Costa R.M. Deep brain optical measurements of cell type-specific neural activity in behaving mice.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar; Figures 1C and 1D). Experiments using photometric recordings of ex vivo fluorescent brain tissue determined that fluorescence detected by our fiber photometry system derives from a brain volume of ∼0.02 mm3 (∼450 μm from tip of fiber, ∼375 μm at base of detection cone) that enables selective sampling from discrete striatal and cortical brain areas (Figures 1E–1I). In freely moving mice showing GCaMP6s expression in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS corticostriatal inputs, we commonly observed sustained movement-related changes in fluorescence intensity (Figure 2A). Changes were more prominent in spectral channels comprising the peak of the GCaMP6s spectra than in off-peak channels and were absent in mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or in wild-type mice. Thus, these fluorescence changes are unlikely to reflect motion-related artifacts. Supporting the activity dependence of these fluorescent changes, isoflurane anesthesia reversibly reduced basal GCaMP6s fluorescence and GCaMP6s fluorescent events in presynaptic corticostriatal inputs (Figure 2B; Figure S2A). Moreover, local pharmacological manipulation of mPFC or M1 activity by microinfusion of picrotoxin or lidocaine bidirectionally altered GCaMP6s fluorescence in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS inputs of freely moving mice (Figures 2C–2F; Figures S2D–S2J). Together, these data and our previously reported brain slice photometry findings (Kupferschmidt and Lovinger, 2015Kupferschmidt D.A. Lovinger D.M. Inhibition of presynaptic calcium transients in cortical inputs to the dorsolateral striatum by metabotropic GABA(B) and mGlu2/3 receptors.J. Physiol. 2015; 593: 2295-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicate that changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence from presynaptic corticostriatal elements represent Ca2+ dynamics that serve as a proxy for in vivo presynaptic activity. To examine the relationship between corticostriatal input activity and motor actions, we measured GCaMP6s fluorescence in mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS inputs while mice performed on the accelerating rotarod. GCaMP6s fluorescence increased in both inputs when mice were placed on the rotating rod, generally intensified as the rod accelerated from 4 to 40 revolutions per minute (rpm), causing mice to make progressively faster stepping movements, and returned to baseline after mice fell off the rod (Figures 2G–2J; Figures S2B and S2C). This increase in fluorescence was selective for wavelengths within the GCaMP6s spectrum and absent in eGFP-expressing mice, indicating that rotarod performance is associated with increased activity of both mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS inputs. We will subsequently refer to this performance-related increase in activity as “engagement.” To probe the activity-related properties of the presynaptic signals that we observed during performance, we conducted simultaneous in vivo photometry and extracellular field recordings from anesthetized mice (Figure 3; Figure S3). mPFC or M1 electrical stimulation evoked increases in GCaMP6s fluorescence in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS inputs that responded dynamically (and comparably) to changes in stimulation intensity, frequency, and duration. Notably, sustained 5–10 Hz stimulation of mPFC or M1 evoked sustained fluorescence increases in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS inputs that closely mimicked those seen during rotarod performance (Figures 2G, 2H, 3G, and 3H; Figures S3C and S3D). To assess how movement-related activity of corticostriatal inputs changed with skill learning, we trained mice expressing GCaMP6s or eGFP in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS inputs on the rotarod for 10 trials/day for 5 days and simultaneously recorded changes in task-related fluorescence. This training paradigm produces a characteristic pattern of motor skill learning, as evidenced by rapid increases in latency to fall off the rotarod across trials on day 1 and slower, incremental increases in latency to fall across days 2 to 5 (Figures 4A and 4D ; Costa et al., 2004Costa R.M.

Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Dynamic reorganization of striatal circuits during the acquisition and consolidation of a skill.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). High-speed video analysis of foot position confirmed that increases in latency to fall are accompanied by increases in average foot height (i.e., learned ability to remain atop the rotating rod) and reductions in foot height variability, consistent with the acquisition of a refined motor skill (Figures S4A–S4D; Cao et al., 2015Cao V.Y. Ye Y. Mastwal S. Ren M. Coon M. Liu Q. Costa R.M. Wang K.H. Motor learning consolidates arc-expressing neuronal ensembles in secondary motor cortex.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, mice targeted for photometric recordings of GCaMP6s or eGFP in mPFC-DMS or M1-DLS inputs performed indistinguishably on the rotarod (Figures S4E–S4G), consistent with immunohistochemical and whole-cell electrophysiology experiments demonstrating that GCaMP6s expression induced no overt neuronal toxicity (Figure S5). Photometric recordings of task-related GCaMP6s fluorescence during rotarod learning revealed that mPFC-DMS inputs were weakly engaged during initial trials on day 1 of training (“naive” stage) but rapidly increased and peaked in their task-related engagement by the final trials of day 1 (“early” stage; Figures 4B, 4C, and 4K). Interestingly, the magnitude of task-related fluorescence in these inputs rapidly decreased on day 2 of training, indicating “disengagement” of these afferents. This decrease persisted into the final trials of day 5 (“late” stage; Figures 4B, 4C, and 4K). M1-DLS inputs, however, were strongly engaged during the naive and early learning stages and incrementally disengaged across training (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4K). Importantly, learning-related reductions in the magnitude of task-related fluorescence could not be attributed to bleaching or loss of GCaMP6s expression over the training period (Figures 4G and 4H; Figures S4H and S6) and were indistinguishable in male and female mice (Figure 4I) and in left and right hemispheres (Figure 4J). To directly compare activity profiles of these inputs, we normalized data from each mouse to its peak trial activity. Although differentially engaged at various stages of action learning, mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS inputs were substantively coactive, and both disengaged as actions were learned (Figure 4L). Together, these data provide direct evidence that associative and sensorimotor inputs show parallel (but dissociable) activity dynamics and concurrently engage their striatal targets at many stages of action learning (Thorn et al., 2010Thorn C.A.

Moreover, both inputs reduce their activity, albeit with different time courses and to different extents, as skilled actions are learned (Wu et al., 2004Wu T. Kansaku K. Hallett M.

To further probe the relationship between corticostriatal input activity and skill learning, we assessed learning-related changes in the slopes of the mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS fluorescent signals during rotarod performance (Figures S7A–S7F). The fluorescence during task performance generally showed an upward slope that was strongest in the early stages of skill learning and showed reductions with training in both pathways (Figures S7A–S7C). mPFC-DMS input signals showed a modestly more rapid reduction in slope following early learning than M1-DLS input signals (Figure S7C). To assess whether the slopes of the signals of mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS inputs related to acceleration of the rotarod, we trained a subset of GCaMP6s-expressing mice previously trained for 5 days on the 4–40 rpm paradigm on “double acceleration” (8–80 rpm) and “no acceleration” (25 rpm) paradigms. Slopes of M1-DLS input signals were selectively enhanced when rotarod acceleration was increased to 8–80 rpm (Figures S7D–S7F). Notably, slopes of the fluorescent signals in mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS inputs induced by sustained electrical stimulation of cortex in anesthetized mice varied more by stimulation frequency (which controls frequency of afferent firing) than current intensity (which controls the extent of activated cortical tissue; Figures 3G and 3H; Figures S3C and S3D). This suggests that the upward slope observed during behavior depends on the frequency of afferent activation and changes in slope seen across skill learning or different acceleration paradigms may predominantly reflect changes in the patterning of activity in a population of striatal-projecting cortical neurons rather than changes in the proportion of task-activated corticostriatal neurons (see Costa et al., 2004Costa R.M. Cohen D. Nicolelis M.A. Differential corticostriatal plasticity during fast and slow motor skill learning in mice.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1124-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We next assessed whether training-related changes in corticostriatal input activity correlated with skill learning. Input engagement within day 1 and disengagement across days 1 to 5 were uncorrelated with coincident improvements in performance (Figures 5A and 5B ). However, the magnitude of disengagement of mPFC-DMS inputs immediately following early training was predictive of higher performance gains across subsequent training (Figure 5C). Moreover, the rate of disengagement of mPFC-DMS inputs positively correlated with the rate at which individual mice achieved their maximum performance (Figure 5D). These findings indicate that activity of mPFC inputs to the DMS may help to gate the transition from unskilled to skilled actions, perhaps by impeding access of sensorimotor circuits to the control of skilled performance (Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H.

During central nervous system (CNS) development, the formation of neuronal synapses at the right time, in the right place, and of the right strength is crucial to the ongoing function of the brain throughout life. Work in recent years has shown that secreted signals from neighboring astrocytes strongly regulate synapse formation, affecting not only when and where synapses would form, but also whether an active or a silent synapse will develop (Allen, 2013Allen N.J.

We previously showed that astrocyte-secreted glypicans 4 and 6 (Gpc4 and Gpc6) induce active synapse formation by recruiting dendritic GluA1-containing AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, the neuronal signaling pathways that underlie this effect have not been determined. Here we identify the signaling pathway induced in neurons by astrocyte-secreted Gpc4, leading to functional synapse formation. GluA1, the AMPAR subunit regulated by Gpc4 and Gpc6, is a major component of AMPARs at developing synapses, suggesting an important role for Gpc4 in synapse initiation (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, in developing neurons, AMPARs are present at nascent synaptic contacts but in an unstable state and that the stabilization of AMPARs is crucial for the maintenance and maturation of these synapses (Groc et al., 2006Groc L. Gustafsson B. Hanse E. AMPA signalling in nascent glutamatergic synapses: there and not there!.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A major way of regulating synaptic AMPAR stability and function is via AMPAR-interacting proteins that can act both intra- and extracellularly (Bassani et al., 2013Bassani S. Folci A. Zapata J.

NP1 is most highly expressed in the developing brain when synapses are first forming (Bjartmar et al., 2006Bjartmar L. Huberman A.D. Ullian E.M. Rentería R.C. Liu X. Xu W. Prezioso J. Susman M.W.

Importantly, the mechanism of how synapses are formed downstream of Gpc4-receptor interaction is not known. Here we identify the pathway of astrocyte-secreted Gpc4 in inducing functional synapse formation. We found that Gpc4 induces release of the AMPAR-clustering factor NP1 from axons by interacting with presynaptic RPTPδ. The secreted NP1 binds and recruits postsynaptic GluA1-containing AMPARs, promoting active synapses to form. Our findings reveal a functional link between pre- and postsynaptic signaling pathways and provide important mechanistic insight into the role of astrocytes in neuronal synaptogenesis. Mutations in glypican family members have been implicated in multiple neurological disorders that have underlying synaptic dysfunction, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia (Doan et al., 2016Doan R.N.

Identification of the molecular mechanism of how glypicans regulate synapse formation, and their unexpected functional link with NP1, opens new avenues to explore the mechanisms of these disorders. Due to the relatively slow effect of Gpc4 on GluA1 synaptic expression (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Gpc4 regulates neuronal signaling pathways that mediate AMPAR dendritic clustering. To test this, we took an unbiased approach—gene expression profiling of neurons treated with soluble Gpc4 protein to mimic the astrocyte-secreted form, using pure cultures of retinal ganglion cell neurons (RGCs) (Ullian et al., 2001Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Control of synapse number by glia.Science. 2001; 291: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). RGCs are ideal for these studies as they form few synapses when cultured in isolation but profoundly increase synapse number and function when cultured with astrocytes or astrocyte-secreted proteins, including Gpc4 (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RGCs were treated for 12 hr (preceding the surface GluA1 increase; Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with Gpc4 to induce active synapse formation or thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) to induce silent synapse formation (Figure 1A), and mRNA levels were measured using microarrays. TSP1 is an additional control as it induces structurally intact, but functionally silent, AMPAR-lacking synapses by signaling through the α2δ1 receptor (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P.

There was no overlap in gene expression changes induced by Gpc4 (49 genes) and TSP1 (3 genes), highlighting that they induce synapse formation via distinct pathways (Table S1). We focused on factors known to regulate synaptic clustering of AMPARs and found that, interestingly, mRNA for neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) is significantly upregulated by Gpc4 treatment (1.83-fold, Table S2). NP1 binds the extracellular region of AMPARs and clusters them on dendritic surfaces increasing synapse number (O’Brien et al., 1999O’Brien R.J. Xu D. Petralia R.S. Steward O. Huganir R.L. Worley P.

Hopf C. Reddy R. Cho R.W. Guo L. Lanahan A. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. O’Brien R.J. Worley P. Narp and NP1 form heterocomplexes that function in developmental and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 513-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This same effect is seen in neurons treated with soluble Gpc4 (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), making regulation of NP1 an ideal candidate for Gpc4-induced synaptogenesis. Since NP1 is a secreted protein that acts in the extracellular space, we first asked whether Gpc4 would increase NP1 protein secretion (Figure 1B). RGCs were treated with soluble Gpc4 for 4 days, and levels of NP1 in the neuron culture media were assayed by western blot. Gpc4 treatment caused a significant increase in the extracellular levels of NP1 (2.07-fold ± 0.10-fold), and to a lesser extent NP2 (1.41-fold ± 0.10-fold; Figures S1A and S1B), showing that Gpc4 is sufficient to upregulate NP1 release from neurons. To determine whether secreted NP1 is binding to the surface of neuronal processes, which is necessary for it to cluster AMPARs (Xu et al., 2003Xu D. Hopf C. Reddy R. Cho R.W. Guo L. Lanahan A. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. O’Brien R.J. Worley P. Narp and NP1 form heterocomplexes that function in developmental and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 513-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we examined the levels of NP1 using a surface immunostaining assay. Treating RGCs with astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) or purified soluble Gpc4 for 6 days increased the amount of NP1 accumulated on the surface of neuronal processes by 1.54-fold ± 0.16-fold and 1.84-fold ± 0.22-fold for ACM and Gpc4, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). The same results were obtained using two different antibodies against NP1 (Figures S1C–S1F). To test the specificity of this effect, we treated RGCs with TSP1 to induce silent synapses that lack AMPARs (Figure 1A). TSP1 treatment did not increase surface levels of NP1 over untreated controls (1.18-fold ± 0.11-fold, ns; Figures 1E and 1F), showing that NP1 release is specific to the Gpc4 pathway. To determine when an increase in NP1 surface accumulation can first be detected, we performed a time course experiment. At all times tested, both ACM and Gpc4 caused an increase in surface NP1 compared to untreated neurons. Measurements were performed at 4 hr (ACM: 1.72-fold ± 0.17-fold; Gpc4: 1.64-fold ± 0.15-fold), 12 hr (ACM: 2.10-fold ± 0.22-fold; Gpc4: 1.87-fold ± 0.26-fold), and 6 days (above) (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1G–1J). Because increases in NP1 surface accumulation preceded our 12-hr microarray time point, we used qRT-PCR to determine when a significant change in NP1 mRNA is detected. We found that NP1 mRNA was beginning to be upregulated compared to untreated RGCs after 4 hr (1.28-fold ± 0.27-fold, ns) and significantly upregulated after 12 hr (1.23-fold ± 0.07-fold) and 18 hr (1.56-fold ± 0.11-fold), but not after 1 hr (1.09-fold ± 0.06-fold, ns) (Figure S1G). Gpc4 treatment did not alter the mRNA expression levels of the other NPs (NP2 and NPR) at any time point assayed (Figure S1G). To determine whether an increase in NP1 mRNA is necessary for the increase in surface accumulation of NP1 protein (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1G–1J), we treated RGCs with actinomycin D (ActD) to block mRNA synthesis, and asked whether Gpc4 was still able to increase surface NP1, assayed by immunostaining. ActD had no effect on the ability of Gpc4 to increase surface NP1 after 4 hr (Gpc4: 2.54-fold ± 0.27-fold; Gpc4+ActD: 2.32-fold ± 0.21-fold) (Figures S1H and S1J), but it blocked the increase in NP1 following 12 hr of Gpc4 treatment compared to untreated RGCs (Gpc4: 2.05-fold ± 0.24-fold; Gpc4+ActD: 0.81-fold ± 0.07-fold; Figures S1I and S1K). These results demonstrate that the initial step of Gpc4-induced synaptogenesis is increasing secretion and surface accumulation of NP1 protein, rather than regulation of NP1 mRNA levels, suggesting that a local synaptic signaling mechanism may initiate NP1 protein secretion. This possibility is explored in the following experiments. We previously demonstrated that surface clustering of GluA1 is necessary for Gpc4 to induce synapse formation (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J. Bennett M.L. Foo L.C. Wang G.X. Chakraborty C. Smith S.J. Barres B.A. Astrocyte glypicans 4 and 6 promote formation of excitatory synapses via GluA1 AMPA receptors.Nature. 2012; 486: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NP1 induces synapse formation by binding to AMPARs (Lee et al., 2017Lee S.J. Wei M. Zhang C. Maxeiner S. Pak C. Calado Botelho S. Trotter J. Sterky F.H. Südhof T.C.

Narp and NP1 form heterocomplexes that function in developmental and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 513-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), so we next asked whether blocking the NP1-GluA1 interaction would prevent Gpc4-induced synaptogenesis. To do this, we generated a Fab antibody fragment that specifically binds the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of GluA1 (GluA1-Fab), the NP1 binding site, but not to other AMPAR subunits (Figure 2A). Specific binding was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Figure 2B) and by immunostaining HEK293T cells overexpressing different AMPAR subunits with GluA1-Fab, showing binding to GluA1, but not GluA2, GluA3, or GluA4, (Figure S2A). As a control, we mutated the GluA1-Fab CDR region, generating the Mut-Fab variant, which does not bind GluA1 (Figure S2B). To determine whether the GluA1-Fab can block NP1 binding to RGC processes, we applied recombinant NP1 labeled with Alexa 488 to RGCs in vitro for 24 hr, either by itself or in the presence of the Mut-Fab or GluA1-Fab. NP1-Alexa 488 showed robust binding to RGC processes (Figure 2C), and this was significantly decreased by the presence of the GluA1-Fab, whereas the Mut-Fab had no effect (Mut-Fab: 0.92-fold ± 0.05-fold; GluA1-Fab: 0.61-fold ± 0.05-fold; compared to NP1-Alexa 488: no treatment; Figures 2C and 2D). We next asked whether the GluA1-Fab could inhibit Gpc4-mediated synapse formation. RGCs were treated for 6 days with soluble Gpc4 along with the GluA1-Fab or the Mut-Fab (Figure 2A). Synapse formation was assayed by immunostaining for Bassoon (presynaptic active zone) and Homer (postsynaptic density), with colocalization of these markers counted as structural synapses (Allen et al., 2012Allen N.J.

Marchant N.J. Lucantonio F. Schoenbaum G. Bossert J.M. Shaham Y.

Psychiatry. 2015; 78: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this model, we first train rats to self-administer palatable food (the alternative non-drug reward) and then to self-administer a drug for several weeks. We then assess relapse to drug seeking during early and late abstinence days in the absence of the alternative food reward. Between tests, we expose the rats to daily mutually exclusive choice sessions between the drug and food (Cantin et al., 2010Cantin L. Lenoir M. Augier E. Vanhille N. Dubreucq S. Serre F. Vouillac C.

Under these contingency management conditions, like human addicts, male and female rats choose to abstain from methamphetamine or heroin when an alternative non-drug reward is available, but they relapse to drug seeking when the alternative reward is removed (Caprioli et al., 2015aCaprioli D.

In our initial mechanistic study, we used the Daun02 inactivation procedure (Koya et al., 2009aKoya E. Golden S.A. Harvey B.K. Guez-Barber D.H. Berkow A. Simmons D.E. Bossert J.M. Nair S.G.

Zhang M. Bossert J.M. Warren B.L. Hope B.T. Shaham Y. Role of dorsomedial striatum neuronal ensembles in incubation of methamphetamine craving after voluntary abstinence.J.

Connectivity of the rat amygaloid complex.in: Aggleton J.P. The amygdala: A Functional Analysis. Oxford University Press, 2000: 31-115Google Scholar) in relapse after voluntary abstinence. We focused on the CeA because we and others previously found that neuronal activity in this brain region is critical for the time-dependent increases in cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine seeking after forced abstinence (incubation of drug craving) (Funk et al., 2016Funk D.

Biol. 2013; 18: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of CeA neuronal activity decreases reinstatement of cocaine seeking after extinction (Alleweireldt et al., 2006Alleweireldt A.T. Hobbs R.J. Taylor A.R. Neisewander J.L.

See R.E. Differential contributions of the basolateral and central amygdala in the acquisition and expression of conditioned relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiment 1, we determined whether relapse to methamphetamine seeking after voluntary abstinence is associated with increased Fos expression in the CeA and the nearby basolateral amygdala (BLA). We also determined whether relapse and Fos expression are decreased by systemic injections of the selective dopamine Drd1 antagonist SCH39166 (Chipkin et al., 1988Chipkin R.E. Iorio L.C. Coffin V.L. McQuade R.D. Berger J.G. Barnett A. Pharmacological profile of SCH39166: a dopamine D1 selective benzonaphthazepine with potential antipsychotic activity.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 1093-1102PubMed Google Scholar), because the effect of addictive drugs or drug-associated cues on Fos induction in different brain areas is dependent on the activation of Drd1 (Ciccocioppo et al., 2001Ciccocioppo R. Sanna P.P. Weiss F. Cocaine-predictive stimulus induces drug-seeking behavior and neural activation in limbic brain regions after multiple months of abstinence: reversal by D(1) antagonists.Proc.

Zhai H. Hope B.T. Shaham Y. Role of ERK in cocaine addiction.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 695-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Additionally, we used RNAscope in situ hybridization (Wang et al., 2012Wang F. Flanagan J. Su N. Wang L.C. Bui S. Nielson A. Wu X. Vo H.T. Ma X.J. Luo Y.

Finally, recent studies demonstrated different roles of the CeA sub-nuclei—lateral (CeL) and medial (CeM)—in appetitive and aversive learned behaviors (Cai et al., 2014Cai H. Haubensak W.

Therefore, we also determined whether relapse after voluntary abstinence is associated with selective activation of Drd1-expressing cells in CeL and CeM. Based on experiment 1 results, in experiment 2 we tested whether pharmacological blockade of CeA Drd1 with SCH39166 would mimic the systemic effect of the drug on relapse, as well as the pharmacological and anatomical specificity of this manipulation. In experiment 3, our goal was to identify the afferent glutamatergic projection to CeA whose activation during the relapse test would precede CeA activation. For this purpose, we combined retrograde tracing via CeA injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) (Luppi et al., 1990Luppi P.H. Fort P. Jouvet M. Iontophoretic application of unconjugated cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) combined with immunohistochemistry of neurochemical substances: a method for transmitter identification of retrogradely labeled neurons.Brain Res. 1990; 534: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with detection of Fos to determine relapse-associated activity in ventral and dorsal anterior insular cortex (AIV and AID, also called agranular anterior insular cortex; Shi and Cassell, 1998Shi C.J. Cassell M.D. Cortical, thalamic, and amygdaloid connections of the anterior and posterior insular cortices.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 440-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), BLA, paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT), and ventral subiculum (vSub) neurons projecting to CeA (Pitkanen, 2000Pitkanen A. Connectivity of the rat amygaloid complex.in: Aggleton J.P. The amygdala: A Functional Analysis. Oxford University Press, 2000: 31-115Google Scholar). We found that relapse after voluntary abstinence was associated with selective activation of the AIV→CeA projection. Thus, in experiments 4 and 5, we first reversibly inactivated the AIV with the GABAA + GABAB receptor agonists (muscimol + baclofen) (McFarland and Kalivas, 2001McFarland K. Kalivas P.W. The circuitry mediating cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8655-8663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to determine whether AIV activity is critical to relapse after voluntary abstinence. Next, we used chemogenetics (Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) to selectively inhibit the AIV→CeA projection (Mahler et al., 2014Mahler S.V. Vazey E.M. Beckley J.T. Keistler C.R. McGlinchey E.M. Kaufling J. Wilson S.P. Deisseroth K. Woodward J.J. Aston-Jones G. Designer receptors show role for ventral pallidum input to ventral tegmental area in cocaine seeking.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) during the relapse tests to determine the causal role of this projection in relapse after voluntary abstinence. Finally, in experiment 6, we used electron microscopy and ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology to determine ultrastructural, functional, and biochemical properties of AIV inputs to CeA. Based on the results of experiments 1–6, we conclude that activation of Drd1-expressing cells in the CeA by a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection from AIV, which primarily innervates the CeL, is critical to relapse to methamphetamine seeking after choice-based voluntary abstinence, a rat model of the human condition of relapse after cessation of contingency management. In the experiments described below (see STAR Methods for details), we first trained food-sated rats to press on the food-paired lever for a palatable food reward (5 pellets per reward delivery) for 6 days. We then trained them to lever press on the methamphetamine-paired lever for an intravenous methamphetamine reward (0.1 mg/kg/infusion) for 14 days (see timeline in Figures 1A, 2A , 3A , and 4A ). The two levers and the distinct food- and drug-associated cues were located on opposite sides of the self-administration chambers. Next, during the voluntary abstinence period (14 days), we gave the rats a mutually exclusive choice between the palatable food and methamphetamine (20 trials/day, 10-min inter-trial interval); during the choice trials, the rats can earn either the palatable food or intravenous methamphetamine, but not both (a contingency management manipulation) (Caprioli et al., 2015aCaprioli D.

On the next day, we tested the rats for relapse to methamphetamine seeking. During testing, the food-paired lever was not available (cessation of contingency management), and presses on the methamphetamine-paired lever (the operational measure of relapse to drug seeking in rat models; Shalev et al., 2002Shalev U.

However, surprisingly little evidence exists to support the idea that synaptic plasticity in place cells is involved in forming new place fields. Here we used high-resolution functional imaging to determine the signaling patterns in CA1 soma, dendrites, and axons associated with place field formation when mice are exposed to novel virtual environments. We found that putative local dendritic spikes often occur prior to somatic place field firing. Subsequently, the first occurrence of somatic place field firing was associated with widespread regenerative dendritic events, which decreased in prevalence with increased novel environment experience. This transient increase in regenerative events was likely facilitated by a reduction in dendritic inhibition. Since regenerative dendritic events can provide the depolarization necessary for Hebbian potentiation, these results suggest that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlies the formation of many CA1 place fields.

Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep.Science. 1994; 265: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). This has led to the idea that place cell ensembles represent a cognitive map of space and a memory of places. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which are the cells that form place fields during spatial navigation, are capable of engaging activity-dependent Hebbian synaptic plasticity (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9540) Google Scholar), a potential mechanism by which spatial information can be encoded and stored. Indeed, disruption of components of the molecular pathways involved in synaptic plasticity, such as NMDA receptors or CaMKII, is correlated with behavioral deficits in memory or spatial navigation tasks (Morris et al., 1986Morris R.G. Anderson E. Lynch G.S. Baudry M.

Given that ensembles of place fields are thought to represent spatial memories and are likely used for spatial navigation, these findings have led to the hypothesis that place fields may form de novo through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (Takeuchi et al., 2013Takeuchi T.

NMDA receptor antagonism blocks experience-dependent expansion of hippocampal “place fields”.Neuron. 2001; 31: 631-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but nonetheless place fields still form. Additionally, many place fields are immediately present upon the animal’s first traversal across a novel environment (Frank et al., 2004Frank L.M. Stanley G.B. Brown E.N.

Such a rapidly appearing cognitive map suggests that hippocampal representations could arise through the novel stimulus-dependent selection of pre-strengthened neuronal ensembles (Deguchi et al., 2011Deguchi Y.

Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These results call into question the idea that place fields form de novo through synaptic plasticity during experience of a novel environment. It has been difficult to assess directly the involvement of synaptic plasticity in awake animals engaged in navigation tasks. One step toward this goal would be to investigate dendritic regenerative events (back propagating action potentials or dendritically generated spikes, here collectively referred to as branch spikes [Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015Sheffield M.E. Dombeck D.A. Calcium transient prevalence across the dendritic arbour predicts place field properties.Nature. 2015; 517: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]), which are thought to provide the post-synaptic depolarization necessary for Hebbian potentiation when paired with presynaptic input (Golding et al., 2002Golding N.L. Staff N.P. Spruston N. Dendritic spikes as a mechanism for cooperative long-term potentiation.Nature. 2002; 418: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Magee and Johnston, 1997Magee J.C. Johnston D. A synaptically controlled, associative signal for Hebbian plasticity in hippocampal neurons.Science. 1997; 275: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, Schiller et al., 1998Schiller J. Schiller Y. Clapham D.E. NMDA receptors amplify calcium influx into dendritic spines during associative pre- and postsynaptic activation.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Measuring the occurrence of branch spikes during place field formation would therefore indicate periods in which Hebbian synaptic potentiation could be occurring. A recent study used somatically recorded plateau potentials to infer the existence of branch spiking events throughout the arbor and found that such events may underlie the formation of both artificially induced and spontaneously appearing place fields in familiar environments (Bittner et al., 2015Bittner K.C. Grienberger C. Vaidya S.P. Milstein A.D. Macklin J.J. Suh J. Tonegawa S. Magee J.C. Conjunctive input processing drives feature selectivity in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The technology now exists to record branch spiking directly in behaving mice and, in fact, these events have recently been detected in hippocampal place cells, though again these observations were made during navigation in familiar environments (Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015Sheffield M.E. Dombeck D.A. Calcium transient prevalence across the dendritic arbour predicts place field properties.Nature. 2015; 517: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This previous research (Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015Sheffield M.E. Dombeck D.A. Calcium transient prevalence across the dendritic arbour predicts place field properties.Nature. 2015; 517: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) demonstrated that branch spiking and somatic firing are often dissociated in place cells, meaning that somatic firing does not provide a direct read out of branch spiking across the arbor. Thus, while there is now evidence to support the idea that branch spiking occurs in place cells and is likely capable of inducing plasticity that can lead to place field firing in familiar environments, it remains unclear whether branch spiking events occur during, or lead to, natural place field formation in novel environments. Here we used virtual reality (VR) combined with two-photon functional imaging to monitor large populations of hippocampal CA1 neuron somata, co-record CA1 neuron dendrites and somata, or record CA1 interneuron axons while mice were rapidly exposed to novel virtual environments. Global remapping occurred during this paradigm and was similar to that described in real-world environments (Bostock et al., 1991Bostock E. Muller R.U. Kubie J.L. Experience-dependent modifications of hippocampal place cell firing.Hippocampus. 1991; 1: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B.

Kubie J.L. The effects of changes in the environment on the spatial firing of hippocampal complex-spike cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1951-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing us to continuously monitor the remapping process from the first moments of novel environment exposure. We found that regenerative dendritic events occur during the first appearance of somatic place field firing and during the first several novel environment traversals the prevalence of these events was increased across the arbor compared to familiar environments or later traversals in the novel environment. For some place fields, localized regenerative dendritic events preceded the appearance of detectable somatic place field firing and predicted the location of the later forming somatic place field. Additionally, we found a transient reduction in the magnitude of calcium transients in the axons of dendrite targeting interneurons on the first few laps in novel environments, while a brief increase in the magnitude of calcium transients in the axons of somatic targeting interneurons was found during a similar period. Finally, we found that when functional NMDA receptors are knocked out in CA1 neurons, the number of place fields that form across the population is reduced by ∼50%. These results suggest that exposure to a novel environment is accompanied by a short time window of reduced dendritic inhibition in CA1, which leads to increased branch spiking, which may potentiate synapses in a subset of neurons to form new place fields. Together these results support the idea that hippocampal activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlies the formation of a subset of CA1 place fields in the hippocampus during novel environment exposure. We used VR to implement an environment switch paradigm to induce hippocampal global remapping in head-restrained mice (Figure 1, Figure S1). Mice were trained once a day for 7 days on a 1D treadmill to traverse a 3 m virtual visual linear track (Figure 1A, Figures S1A and S1B) for water rewards (Heys et al., 2014Heys J.G. Rangarajan K.V. Dombeck D.A. The functional micro-organization of grid cells revealed by cellular-resolution imaging.Neuron. 2014; 84: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequently, on experimental day 1, mice traversed this familiar environment (F) for at least 15 laps before F was rapidly (∼30 ms) switched to a novel environment (N; Figure 1A, Figures S1A and S1B). Mice then experienced N for at least 20 laps, before being placed back in their home cage. The following day (experimental day 2) the mice were re-exposed to N where they traversed the track for at least 20 laps. An F-to-N switch was implemented twice for each mouse, with different environments for each switch (Figures S1A and S1B). To quantify behavior before, during, and after the switch, we measured mean lap velocity (Figure 1B2), stopping probability (Figure S1D) and mean stopping time (Figure S1E) on each lap. We found that the first lap in N was traversed slower (15.6 ± 1.5 cm−s SEM on first lap in N versus 27.7 ± 0.5 cm−s SEM in F, p < 0.001, paired t test, n = 32 sessions, n = 16 mice) and with more stops (0.8 ± 0.1 SEM on first lap in N versus 0.19 ± 0.02 SEM in F, p < 0.01) that lasted longer (5.4 ± 2.1 s SEM on first lap in N versus 0.63 ± 0.13 s SEM in F, p < 0.001) compared to F, but behavior quickly stabilized such that on all subsequent laps in N, mean lap velocity and mean stopping time were not different compared to F (mean lap velocity from all laps and excluding lap 1 in N: 27.7 ± 0.5 cm−s in F versus 27.7 ± 0.5 cm−s in N, p > 0.05, paired t test; mean lap stopping time from all laps following lap 1: 0.63 ± 0.13 s SEM in F versus 1.04 ± 0.25 s SEM in N, p > 0.05), and mean stopping probability was only slightly increased (mean lap stopping probability from all laps following lap 1: 0.19 ± 0.02 in F versus 0.30 ± 0.02 SEM in N, p < 0.001, paired t test). Therefore, our VR paradigm allows for rapid switching from familiar to novel environments with relatively little change in behavior after the first traversal. We then asked whether the switch from F to N caused global remapping in the hippocampus, a phenomenon that occurs in the real world when animals are placed in novel environments (Bostock et al., 1991Bostock E.

Kubie J.L. The effects of changes in the environment on the spatial firing of hippocampal complex-spike cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1951-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used our previously described methods to optically record somatic calcium transients (a measure of action potential firing; GCaMP6f) in populations of CA1 pyramidal neurons and defined the place firing field(s) of neurons within the population (Dombeck et al., 2010Dombeck D.A.

Calcium transient prevalence across the dendritic arbour predicts place field properties.Nature. 2015; 517: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Over all traversals in F, we found all neurons with significant mean place fields. From eight sessions in F (n = 4 mice), we identified 347 place cells. Some place cells expressed two place fields, and we treated each place field independently (382 place fields total). A typical CA1 field of view contained place cells (Figure 1C, bottom left) expressing place fields tiling the track (Figure 1C, top left). We then switched from F to N and measured the firing patterns of the same neurons (the place cells that had place fields in F; Figure 1C, bottom middle) over all traversals in N on experimental day 1 (Figure 1C, top middle). We found that, across all mice, many cells identified as having place fields in F did not have place fields in N (301/382 place fields). For the cells that did have place fields in both F and N, the location of the fields were not correlated (see STAR Methods, Figure S1F) and showed significantly less spatial correlation compared to fields examined within F (Figure 1D, spatial correlation within first half to second half of F = 0.87 ± 0.01 SEM, n = 382 place fields versus across F to N = 0.06 ± 0.04 SEM, n = 81 place fields, p < 0.001, unpaired t test). However, additional place cells appeared in N (n = 263 total place cells; n = 279 total place fields across all mice; Figure 1C, bottom right) and their place fields tiled the novel track (Figure 1C, top right). These data are consistent with global remapping in real-world environments (Bostock et al., 1991Bostock E. Muller R.U. Kubie J.L.

Engagement of neural circuits underlying 2D spatial navigation in a rodent virtual reality system.Neuron. 2014; 84: 442-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and indicate that global remapping occurs in the hippocampus of head-restrained mice following a rapid switch from a familiar to a novel VR environment. Next we tracked somatic calcium transients of the place fields that appeared in N on each lap starting from the very first lap in N (Figure 1E). We noticed that place fields abruptly appeared on a range of laps during the initial exposure to N (Figure 1E), an observation also consistent with remapping in real-world novel environments (Frank et al., 2004Frank L.M. Stanley G.B. Brown E.N. Hippocampal plasticity across multiple days of exposure to novel environments.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Hill, 1978Hill A.J. First occurrence of hippocampal spatial firing in a new environment.Exp. Neurol. 1978; 62: 282-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To quantify this, for each place field detected in N, we identified the lap in which transients first began to robustly occur within the place field (place field onset lap; Figure 1E, red arrows; see STAR Methods). Pooling the place fields from all mice (n = 4 mice, n = 8 sessions in N), we found that 116/279 place fields appeared on the first lap in N, 35/279 had a place field onset lap of 2, and 128/279 had a place field onset lap greater than lap 2 (Figure 1F1; a different distribution compared to the same measurements in F, see Figures 1F2 and 1F3). Overall, the vast majority of place fields appeared within the first several laps of N (224/279 (80%) within 8 laps and 261/279 (94%) within 16 laps; 92.3 ± 2.4 s SEM and 179.5 ± 3.2 s SEM was required to complete 8 and 16 laps respectively). These results demonstrate that exposure to novel environments leads to the appearance of place fields over the first few traversals and minutes. To test whether synaptic plasticity could occur during the initial exposure to N, when the majority of place fields first appear, we asked whether branch spiking (Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015Sheffield M.E. Dombeck D.A. Calcium transient prevalence across the dendritic arbour predicts place field properties.Nature. 2015; 517: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which can provide the post-synaptic depolarization necessary for Hebbian synaptic potentiation (Golding et al., 2002Golding N.L.

https://openalex.org/W2763551617,"INTRODUCTION Although the carbon budget is often presented in terms of global-scale fluxes, many of the contributing processes occur through localized point sources, which have been challenging to measure from space. Persistent anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions have altered the natural balance of Earth’s carbon sources and sinks. These emissions are driven by a multitude of individual mobile and stationary point sources that combust fossil fuels, with urban areas accounting for more than 70% of anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. Natural point-source emissions are dominated by wildfires and persistent volcanic degassing. RATIONALE Comprehensive global measurements from space could help to more completely characterize anthropogenic and natural point-source emissions. In global carbon cycle models, anthropogenic point-source information comes from bottom-up emission inventories, whereas natural point-source information comes from a sparse in situ measurement network. Whereas clusters of urban CO 2 point-source plumes merge together, isolated point sources (e.g., remote power plants, cement production plants, and persistently degassing volcanoes) create localized plumes. Because turbulent mixing and diffusion cause rapid downwind dilution, they are challenging to detect and analyze. Point-source detection from space is complicated by signal dilution: The observed values of <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" overflow=""scroll""> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi> <mml:msub> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">X</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">CO</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> (enhancement of the column-averaged dry-air CO 2 mole fraction) correspond to in situ CO 2 enhancements of 10-fold or higher.

These sensors would also advance the detectability of volcanic eruption precursors and improve volcanic CO 2 emission inventories.

These highest continuous volcanic CO 2 emissions are collectively dwarfed by about 70 fossil fuel–burning power plants on Earth, which each emit more than 15 megatons per year of CO 2 . CONCLUSION OCO-2’s sampling strategy was designed to characterize CO 2 sources and sinks on regional to continental and ocean-basin scales, but the unprecedented kilometer-scale resolution and high sensitivity enables detection of CO 2 from natural and anthropogenic localized emission sources. OCO-2 captures seasonal, intra-urban, and isolated plume signals. Capitalizing on OCO-2’s sensitivity, a much higher temporal resolution would capture anthropogenic emission signal variations from diurnal, weekly, climatic, and economic effects, and, for volcanoes, precursory emission variability. Future sampling strategies will benefit from a continuous mapping approach with the sensitivity of OCO-2 to systematically and repeatedly capture these smaller, urban to individual plume scales of CO 2 point sources.

The chaperones Tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein-related (TAPBPR) facilitate MHC I peptide loading and high-affinity epitope selection. Despite the pivotal role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR-MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as peptide selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding groove, and inserting a loop into the groove that interferes with peptide binding. The complex explains how mutations in MHC I-specific chaperones cause defects in antigen processing and suggests a unifying mechanism of peptide proofreading."

We provide an RNA-seq roadmap for the stress-sensitive vDG. The transcription factor REST binds to xCT promoter in co-occupancy with the epigenetic marker H3K27ac to regulate expression of xCT, which is also reduced in a genetic mouse model of inherent susceptibility to depressive-like behavior. Pharmacologically, modulating histone acetylation with acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC) or acetyl-N-cysteine (NAC) rapidly increases xCT and activates a network with mGlu2 receptors to prime an enhanced glutamate homeostasis that promotes both pro-resilient and antidepressant-like responses. Pharmacological xCT blockage counteracts NAC prophylactic effects. GFAP+-Cre-dependent overexpression of xCT in vDG mimics pharmacological actions in promoting resilience. This work establishes a mechanism by which vDG protection leads to stress resilience and antidepressant responses via epigenetic programming of an xCT-mGlu2 network."
https://openalex.org/W2762947920,"INTRODUCTION The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is NASA’s first satellite designed to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) with the precision, resolution, and coverage necessary to quantify regional carbon sources and sinks. OCO-2 launched on 2 July 2014, and during the first 2 years of its operation, a major El Niño occurred: the 2015–2016 El Niño, which was one of the strongest events ever recorded. El Niño and its cold counterpart La Niña (collectively known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation or ENSO) are the dominant modes of tropical climate variability. ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean but spurs a variety of anomalous weather patterns around the globe. Not surprisingly, it also leaves an imprint on the global carbon cycle. Understanding the magnitude and phasing of the ENSO-CO 2 relationship has important implications for improving the predictability of carbon-climate feedbacks. The high-density observations from NASA’s OCO-2 mission, coupled with surface ocean CO 2 measurements from NOAA buoys, have provided us with a unique data set to track the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and unravel the timing of the response of the ocean and the terrestrial carbon cycle during the 2015–2016 El Niño. RATIONALE During strong El Niño events, there is an overall increase in global atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. This increase is predominantly due to the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to El Niño–induced changes in weather patterns. But along with the terrestrial component, the tropical Pacific Ocean also plays an important role. Typically, the tropical Pacific Ocean is a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere due to equatorial upwelling that brings CO 2 -rich water from the interior ocean to the surface. During El Niño, this equatorial upwelling is suppressed in the eastern and the central Pacific Ocean, reducing the supply of CO 2 to the surface. If CO 2 fluxes were to remain constant elsewhere, this reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes should contribute to a slowdown in the growth of atmospheric CO 2 . This hypothesis cannot be verified, however, without large-scale CO 2 observations over the tropical Pacific Ocean. RESULTS OCO-2 observations confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean played an early and important role in the response of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations to the 2015–2016 El Niño. By analyzing trends in the time series of atmospheric CO 2 , we see clear evidence of an initial decrease in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations over the tropical Pacific Ocean, specifically during the early stages of the El Niño event (March through July 2015). Atmospheric CO 2 concentration anomalies suggest a flux reduction of 26 to 54% that is validated by the NOAA Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring CO 2 data. Both the OCO-2 and TAO data further show that the reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes is spatially variable and has strong gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean. During the later stages of the El Niño (August 2015 and later), the OCO-2 observations register a rise in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. We attribute this increase to the response from the terrestrial component of the carbon cycle—a combination of reduction in biospheric uptake of CO 2 over pan-tropical regions and an enhancement in biomass burning emissions over Southeast Asia and Indonesia. The net impact of the 2015–2016 El Niño event on the global carbon cycle is an increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, which would likely be larger if it were not for the reduction in outgassing from the ocean. CONCLUSION The strong El Niño event of 2015–2016 provided us with an opportunity to study how the global carbon cycle responds to a change in the physical climate system. Space-based observations of atmospheric CO 2 , such as from OCO-2, allow us to observe and monitor the temporal sequence of El Niño–induced changes in CO 2 concentrations. Disentangling the timing of the ocean and terrestrial responses is the first step toward interpreting their relative contribution to the global atmospheric CO 2 growth rate, and thereby understanding the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to climate forcing on interannual to decadal time scales. NASA’s carbon sleuth tracks the influence of El Niño on atmospheric CO 2 . The tropical Pacific Ocean, the center of action during an El Niño event, is shown in cross section. Warm ocean surface temperatures are shown in red, cooler waters in blue. The Niño 3.4 region, which scientists use to study the El Niño, is denoted by yellow dashed lines. As a result of OCO-2’s global coverage and 16-day repeat cycle, it flies over the entire region every few days, keeping tabs on the changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2762020729,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating side effect of many cancer treatments. The hallmark of CIPN is degeneration of long axons required for transmission of sensory information; axonal degeneration causes impaired tactile sensation and persistent pain. Currently the molecular mechanisms of CIPN are not understood, and there are no available treatments. Here we show that the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel triggers CIPN by altering IP3 receptor phosphorylation and intracellular calcium flux, and activating calcium-dependent calpain proteases. Concomitantly paclitaxel impairs axonal trafficking of RNA-granules and reduces synthesis of Bclw (bcl2l2), a Bcl2 family member that binds IP3R1 and restrains axon degeneration. Surprisingly, Bclw or a stapled peptide corresponding to the Bclw BH4 domain interact with axonal IP3R1 and prevent paclitaxel-induced degeneration, while Bcl2 and BclxL cannot do so. Together these data identify a Bclw-IP3R1-dependent cascade that causes axon degeneration and suggest that Bclw-mimetics could provide effective therapy to prevent CIPN."

https://openalex.org/W2762217164,"Precise connectivity between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons is thought to be essential for the transmission of visual information. Consistent with this view, electrophysiological measurements have previously estimated that 1–3 RGCs converge onto a mouse geniculate TC neuron. Recent advances in connectomics and rabies tracing have yielded much higher estimates of retinogeniculate convergence, although not all identified contacts may be functional. Here we use optogenetics and a computational simulation to determine the number of functionally relevant retinogeniculate inputs onto TC neurons in mice. We find an average of ten RGCs converging onto a mature TC neuron, in contrast to >30 inputs before developmental refinement. However, only 30% of retinogeniculate inputs exceed the threshold for dominating postsynaptic activity. These results signify a greater role for the thalamus in visual processing and provide a functional perspective of anatomical connectivity data."

The foraging behavior of primates is especially complex and requires long-term memory, value comparison, strategic planning, and decision-making.

In our foraging tasks, salience refers to the difference between decision thresholds and the net harvested reward. Salience signals were stronger in poor foraging contexts than rich ones, suggesting low harvest rates recruit mechanisms in PCC that regulate strategic disengagement and exploration during foraging."

This essential enzyme has been suggested as a therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we report functional and structural studies on the mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase from E. faecalis (MDDEF). The MDDEF crystal structure in complex with ATP (MDDEF-ATP) revealed that the phosphate-binding loop (amino acids 97-105) is not involved in ATP binding and that the phosphate tail of ATP in this structure is in an outward-facing position pointing away from the active site. This suggested that binding of MDDEF to MVAPP is necessary to guide ATP into a catalytically favorable position. Enzymology experiments show that the MDDEF performs a sequential ordered bi-substrate reaction with MVAPP as the first substrate, consistent with the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. On the basis of ITC results, we propose that this initial prerequisite binding of MVAPP enhances ATP binding. In summary, our findings reveal a substrate-induced substrate-binding event that occurs during the MDDEF-catalyzed reaction. The disengagement of the phosphate-binding loop concomitant with the alternative ATP-binding configuration may provide the structural basis for antimicrobial design against these pathogenic enterococci."

They show different time courses in plasticity of associative and sensorimotor circuits across learning that involve changes at both the synaptic and cortical level. Skill learning is a critical aspect of our everyday lives. The process of learning and acquiring new motor skills consists of two phases: (1) an acquisition phase, where behaviors are goal-directed and sensitive to feedback about performance, and (2) a mastery phase, where action-outcome associations become implicit and behavior becomes automatic. The neuronal mechanisms underlying this behavioral transition are an area of intense research focus. Skill learning relies heavily on plasticity of corticostriatal circuits, which are topographically organized into functionally segregated circuits defined along a medial-lateral axis. Dorsomedial parts of the striatum (DMS) receive input from prefrontal cortical (PFC) areas, creating a circuit that is important for action-outcome associations. Dorsolateral parts of the striatum (DLS) receive input from primary sensory and motor cortices, creating a sensorimotor circuit that signals action outcome during early learning and encodes stimulus-response associations (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 357-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6726) Google Scholar). Disrupting DMS function has been shown to impair goal-directed behaviors and prevent acquisition of motor skills, but does not disrupt performance of mastered skills (Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H. Mulcare S.P. Hilário M.R. Clouse E. Holloway T. Davis M.I. Hansson A.C. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Nat.

Disrupting DLS function, in contrast, impairs performance of mastered skills and reverts automated behaviors back to goal-directed control (Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H. Mulcare S.P. Hilário M.R.

These data suggest a sequential model in which PFC-DMS circuits dominate in early skill learning and M1-DLS circuits dominate once a skill is mastered. However, other studies have shown concurrent and competing activation of parallel corticostriatal circuits throughout learning (Bassett et al., 2015Bassett D.S. Yang M. Wymbs N.F. Grafton S.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, Thorn et al., 2010Thorn C.A. Atallah H. Howe M. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 2010; 66: 781-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In a T-maze choice task, motor and associative regions of striatum were active simultaneously during multiple stages of learning, with DMS reaching peak activation during skill acquisition and DLS reaching peak activation with mastery (Thorn et al., 2010Thorn C.A. Atallah H. Howe M. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 2010; 66: 781-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Likewise, human imaging studies show that mastering a motor skill is associated with sustained motor system activity that increases throughout learning, and transient associative circuit activity that is reduced as motor circuit activity increases (Bassett et al., 2015Bassett D.S. Yang M. Wymbs N.F. Grafton S.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This suggests a competition model in which associative and motor circuits vie for control over learning to achieve mastery. In this issue of Neuron, Kupferschmidt et al., 2017Kupferschmidt D.A. Juczewski K. Cui G. Johnson K.A. Lovinger D.M. Neuron. 2017; 96 (this issue): 476-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar seek to resolve this controversy by tracking activity of defined subsets of corticostriatal projections during skill learning. To do this, they use fiber photometry to record the activity of synaptic terminals in associative (medial prefrontal cortex to dorsomedial striatum, mPFC-DMS) or sensorimotor (primary motor cortex to dorsolateral striatum, M1-DLS) corticostriatal circuits during skill learning (Figure 1A). Because fiber photometry measures bulk calcium signal produced by the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6s, by restricting GCaMP6s expression to terminals originating from mPFC or M1 neurons, the authors are able to monitor activity in these pathways with unprecedented spatial and temporal specificity. To induce skill learning, mice are trained on an accelerating rotarod paradigm, in which they learn to balance on a rod rotating at gradually increasing speeds. This paradigm has been used previously to study the transition from skill acquisition to skill mastery (Costa et al., 2004Costa R.M. Cohen D. Nicolelis M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1124-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the first set of experiments, the authors implant optical fibers into the DMS or DLS to record pathway-specific calcium signals during rotarod performance (Figure 1A). In the naive state (the first trial in which mice experienced the accelerating rotarod), task-related activity (i.e., engagement) of mPFC-DMS terminals is low, but M1-DLS terminal activity is at its peak. During the early learning phase (end of day 1, 10 trials completed), mPFC-DMS activity sharply increases, whereas activity of the M1-DLS pathway remains high, similar to levels recorded in naive mice. Across additional training sessions, activity in the two pathways diverges (Figure 1C). At the beginning of day 2, mPFC-DMS terminal activity rapidly disengages and remains low throughout the rest of training. In contrast, M1-DLS terminal activity disengages more gradually across subsequent training days, reaching its lowest task engagement during late training (day 5). These data suggest that associative and sensorimotor corticostriatal circuits exhibit concurrent activation during skill acquisition, but their activity dissociates as skill mastery is achieved. These results unite the competition and sequential models of skill learning to create a new model, in which both pathways are active during learning and decline with mastery, but in which sensorimotor circuits remain more engaged during execution of mastered skills than associative circuits. The early peak and rapid disengagement of mPFC-DMS activity during early learning is strongly supported by previous studies showing that skill acquisition is accompanied by peak DMS activity in vivo (Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H. Mulcare S.P. Hilário M.R. Clouse E. Holloway T. Davis M.I. Hansson A.C. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, Thorn et al., 2010Thorn C.A. Atallah H. Howe M. Graybiel A.M. Neuron. 2010; 66: 781-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and peak DMS post-synaptic responses ex vivo, both of which decrease with skill mastery (Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H. Mulcare S.P. Hilário M.R. Clouse E. Holloway T. Davis M.I. Hansson A.C. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, Kupferschmidt and colleagues take things a step further by showing that greater mPFC-DMS disengagement at the beginning of day 2 is significantly predictive of how well the animal learns the task on subsequent days (Figure 1C). These results are consistent with a learning model in which high mPFC-DMS engagement facilitates skill acquisition by promoting behavioral flexibility to create strong action-outcome relationships. Then, to master a skill, behavioral flexibility must decrease in order to allow the skill to solidify. Support for this learning model comes from previous studies that show that prefrontal/DMS circuits promote behavioral flexibility required for learning. In one study, inactivating different nodes of the mPFC-DMS circuit was shown to impair behavioral flexibility in an instrumental learning task after a rule switch (Ragozzino, 2007Ragozzino M.E. Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1121: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that mPFC-DMS activity acts as a gate during initial learning of a task to allow flexibility when different strategies are being explored, but that continued activity in this circuit impairs skill mastery. This hypothesis is supported by human imaging data that show decreased activity in associative brain circuits during motor skill learning is correlated with enhanced performance (Bassett et al., 2015Bassett D.S. Yang M. Wymbs N.F. Grafton S.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, these recording data are only correlative. Such a hypothesis should be tested more directly in future experiments using optogenetic manipulation of mPFC-DMS terminals at different stages of learning. After establishing that mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS terminals exhibit different time courses of engagement during skill learning, the authors then probe deeply into the mechanisms underlying this effect. They hypothesize that at least two different mechanisms could influence the extent of terminal engagement measured in the striatum. First, changes in task-related activity of cortical neurons could profoundly affect the degree of terminal activity measured in the striatum. Indeed, previous studies have shown that skill learning is associated with decreased engagement of neurons in cortical motor areas (Cao et al., 2015Cao V.Y. Ye Y. Mastwal S. Ren M. Coon M. Liu Q. Costa R.M. Wang K.H. Neuron. 2015; 86: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Picard et al., 2013Picard N. Matsuzaka Y. Strick P.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Second, plasticity at the presynaptic terminals themselves could alter their activation dynamics and, hence, photometric signal. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the authors injected a retrograde Cre virus into the DMS or DLS and a Cre-dependent GCaMP virus in the cortex to measure bulk calcium signals from the somata of cortical neurons located in the mPFC or M1, respectively (Figure 1B). They reasoned that if changes in the activity of cortical somata exactly mirror changes in striatal terminal activity, this would suggest that plasticity of cortical ensembles is entirely responsible for changes in corticostriatal signaling during skill learning. Alternatively, dissociations between the activity of cortical somata and striatal terminal activity would suggest that plasticity at the terminals is involved. The results of these experiments show that changes in terminal fluorescence are largely mirrored by changes in somatic fluorescence, suggesting that changes in cortical engagement account for the majority of changes in terminal fluorescence across days. However, a notable exception was observed on day 1, during the early phase of the paradigm (Figure 1B). Whereas the fluorescent signal from mPFC-DMS terminals increases rapidly with training, the increase in mPFC-DMS somata fluorescence is more gradual. This suggests that mPFC-DMS synapses are potentiated prior to changes in cortical ensembles during early stages of skill learning. In the M1-DLS pathway, an opposite dissociation between somatic and terminal activity is observed on day 1. Whereas the fluorescent signal from M1-DLS terminals decreases gradually with training, the decrease in fluorescent signal from M1-DLS somata is more abrupt. This suggests that synaptic potentiation of M1-DLS terminals helps to maintain a strong contribution of this pathway during early learning, even though cortical engagement has already started to decrease. The differing contributions of synaptic versus ensemble plasticity are important additions to the literature on the neuronal dynamics of skill learning. Most prior studies have focused only on changes in the somatic activity of neurons in the cortex or the striatum, without the resolution to measure plasticity of the synapses themselves (but see Yin et al., 2009Yin H.H. Mulcare S.P. Hilário M.R. Clouse E. Holloway T. Davis M.I. Hansson A.C. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The findings by Kupferschmidt et al., that there is a dissociation between somatic and synaptic engagement in corticostriatal pathways during early learning, highlight the importance of continued development of techniques to measure synaptic, not just somatic, activity during behavior. The observation of decreased task-related activity of both mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS circuits as mastery is achieved is consistent with findings from a number of other recent studies showing that skill learning is associated overall with less neural activity rather than more (Cao et al., 2015Cao V.Y. Ye Y. Mastwal S. Ren M. Coon M. Liu Q. Costa R.M. Wang K.H. Neuron. 2015; 86: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Picard et al., 2013Picard N. Matsuzaka Y. Strick P.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been shown that as skill on the rotarod increases, the ensemble of task-related Arc-expressing neurons in supplementary motor area became more consolidated (Cao et al., 2015Cao V.Y. Ye Y. Mastwal S. Ren M. Coon M. Liu Q. Costa R.M. Wang K.H. Neuron. 2015; 86: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that as the motor skill is mastered, fewer neurons are needed to code the activity. This phenomenon may reflect a mechanism for efficient signal processing. To further understand if these findings represent a general theme in neuronal processing, future studies must take advantage of identification, recording, and manipulation of specific task-related ensembles using immediate-early gene technologies. Kupferschmidt and colleagues set the stage for new avenues of research to advance understanding of the transition from skill acquisition to mastery. They present a dissection of two corticostriatal pathways known to play a significant role in this process and demonstrate that mPFC-DMS and M1-DLS terminals show parallel and dissociable, but not competing, activity dynamics throughout the process of learning a rotarod task. Moving forward, it will be critical to focus on causality in addition to correlational neuronal observation of these two systems. These future studies will capitalize on the foundation laid by Kupferschmidt et al., to fully understand the complex circuit dynamics underlying skill learning.

The OCO-2 satellite can measure photosynthesis, as well as the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, and so will shed new light on the carbon cycle.

One of the crowning achievements of modern environmental science is the Keeling curve, the detailed time series of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) begun in 1958 that has enabled deep insights into the mechanisms of global climate change. These measurements were difficult to make for most of their 60-year history, involving the physical collection of air samples in flasks at a small number of sites scattered strategically around the globe and the subsequent analysis of their CO2 inventories in a handful of laboratories throughout the world. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission was designed to circumvent those limitations by providing a platform with which atmospheric CO2 can be measured spectrally from space over large geographic areas, thereby offering an unprecedented capability to study, in great detail, the processes that affect the concentration of the gas over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The satellite can also measure solar-induced fluorescence, a proxy for photosynthesis, which provides valuable information about the biological processes that affect atmospheric CO2.

In this issue, a collection of Research Articles presents the initial results from OCO-2, covering the detection of CO2 emissions from specific point sources; measurements of CO2 variations associated with El Nino, on land and at sea; and solar-induced fluorescence measurements of photosynthesis for determining gross primary production by plants. With its impressive collection of observational capabilities, OCO-2 will enable measurements of atmospheric CO2 to be made with sufficient precision, resolution, and coverage to faithfully characterize its sources and sinks globally over the seasonal cycle, a long-standing goal in atmospheric and climate science.

There has been great interest in understanding the neural mechanisms mediating decision-making and the subjective sense of confidence that a decision taken is the correct one.

Neuron. 2017; 96 (this issue): 348-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar build on ideas derived from human neuroimaging, animal models, and computational studies to provide a detailed characterization of a human clinical condition: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Normally, people adjust the way in which they make decisions as a function of their confidence in those decisions. In OCD, however, this is no longer the case. To behave adaptively, humans and animals learn from experience (for example, learning to predict where your opponent in tennis is likely to serve a ball). However, in the real world, which is changing and uncertain, this is not easy. If a serve is in a different place than expected, was this a chance event or does it indicate a change in the opponent’s strategy? Inspiration for how the brain might solve this has come from Bayesian approaches to information representation (O’Reilly, 2013O’Reilly J.X. Front. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Beliefs are seen as distributions, not as point estimates (Figure 1A). For example, you don’t only know where the serve is most likely to land but also how likely it is to land in other places. This meta-belief, or confidence, should affect how much you update your beliefs about the most likely serving target when there is an unexpected serve. If you are not confident that your belief is true, you should be very influenced by a surprising serve, while if you are already quite certain about your belief, it is more likely that a surprising outcome is due to chance and therefore you should update your belief less. Ideas about confidence can also be combined with canonical learning theories in which belief updates are driven by prediction errors (differences between predictions and subsequent actual outcomes). Vaghi and colleagues take such an approach (Vaghi et al., 2017Vaghi F. Luyckx F. Sule A. Fineberg F. Robbins T.W. De Martino B. Neuron. 2017; 96 (this issue): 348-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this framework, confidence determines a learning rate that in turn determines how much impact prediction errors have on belief updates. The learning rate is faster when you are uncertain (you are more ready to change your beliefs) but slower when you are confident. This Bayesian framework has informed our understanding of how the brain computes uncertainty and uses it in diverse ways such as weighing up and integrating sources of evidence (Franklin and Wolpert, 2011Franklin D.W. Wolpert D.M. Neuron. 2011; 72: 425-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) or driving exploration for information (Zajkowski et al., 2017Zajkowski W.K. Kossut M. Wilson R.C. eLife. 2017; (Published online September 15, 2017)https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this Bayesian view, information is represented in an inherently meta-cognitive way: there are beliefs about beliefs. As a result, updating of beliefs, using Bayes’ rule, automatically takes the meta-beliefs into account so that learning is informed by confidence. What Vaghi and colleagues realized, however, is that the behavior of OCD patients might provide an intriguing window into this process. An important feature of OCD is that it is ego-dystonic: patients know their obsessions (e.g., germ contamination) and compulsions (e.g., hand washing) are excessive, but their symptoms nevertheless persist. Vaghi and colleagues therefore examined the extent to which OCD patients hold metacognitions about their beliefs and the degree to which they influence adaptation of behavior, i.e., behavioral measures of learning. In a computer game task, participants learned where a “particle” was likely to land so they could place a bucket to catch it (a similar problem to the one confronted by the tennis player trying to predict where the opponent will serve). They then rated their confidence in how well they had placed the bucket. Just like the tennis serves, the particles were likely to land close to one another for a while (following a normal distribution with some random noise), but sometimes a “change point” occurred: the most likely particle position changed just as a tennis player might change her tactics. Uncertainty varied throughout the task: immediately after change points, uncertainty was high. Then, as participants observed more and more particles in the same vicinity, uncertainty decreased. Importantly, two measurements were made on every trial: explicit report of the participants’ confidence in their bucket positioning (prior to outcome observation) and the actual bucket position participants chose. Trial-by-trial changes in bucket position could then be used to estimate behavioral change or learning rate. As expected, healthy controls reported both higher confidence and exhibited lower learning rates the more samples they had seen since a change point. However, a striking dissociation between confidence and behavioral adaptation was revealed in OCD. OCD patients did not differ in their explicit confidence ratings from healthy controls. However, they did not adapt their behavioral learning rates in the same way. They made large behavioral adjustments even when their explicit reports had indicated high confidence. A similar result was found by analyzing the data more formally by regressing measures of uncertainty derived from a Bayesian model against either type of measure. To test directly whether participants used their belief about uncertainty as reported in the ratings to guide behavior, Vaghi and colleagues measured the impact of these ratings on behavioral adaptation. For control participants, there was a clear relationship between the reported uncertainty and the trial-by-trial behavioral learning rates. However, in OCD there was a disjunction between the possession of intellectual knowledge and its use in behavioral adaptation. The study is an exemplary demonstration of the increasingly popular computational psychiatry approach: applying knowledge about cognitive and neural processes from basic research to psychiatric disorders. This leads to objective and quantifiable accounts of a disorder that go beyond symptoms, and instead tackle the fundamental mechanistic changes associated with the disorder, sometimes even revealing aspects of a disorder that were not previously captured by clinical intuition. The finding here of a difference between intellectual knowledge and use of the knowledge to guide behavioral adaptation is in line with previous experimental findings that OCD patients do not learn in the same manner as healthy controls (Gillan and Robbins, 2014Gillan C.M. Robbins T.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2013.0475Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), regardless of whether or not the learning task concerns the content of their obsessional thoughts. However, this emerging picture of OCD contrasts with the description of OCD in the DSM-V clinical manual that sees obsessions as primary and compulsions simply as consequences—something patients do to reduce the distress caused by the obsessive thought. These findings thus highlight how careful behavioral investigation can reveal new insights into the nature of even well-known conditions that could not have been gleaned from patients’ subjective reports given in the clinic. For the future, it will be interesting to explore how this new understanding could inform treatments for OCD. If patients’ problems reflect a divergence between uncertainty estimates in different representations—an accurate representation of uncertainty that can be read out by explicit report and an inaccurate one that guides behavioral change—then a psychological therapy that “synchronizes” these representations might be beneficial. Notably, the focus of mindfulness-based treatments for other psychological illnesses such as depression is on transforming the way in which intellectual knowledge is linked to actual behavior (Teasdale, 1999Teasdale J.D. Clin. Psychol. Psychother. 1999; 6: 146-155Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Stepping back from OCD, however, the results have implications for basic cognitive neuroscience because they shed light on how Bayesian beliefs might be stored in the brain. The results suggest the brain may not (or not only) represent beliefs as explicit probability distributions because if this were the case, then updating should inevitably take into account uncertainty. This is not the case in OCD, yet OCD patients have a sense of uncertainty. One way in which such a finding might be explained is if the brain stores, as heuristics, point estimates of both the belief and the uncertainty; the quasi-optimal Bayesian learning model that Vaghi and colleagues employ actually operates in a similar manner. In this scenario, the deficit in OCD simply results from a problem in making the right information accessible for actions. In addition, as proposed more recently, brains might be better described as “Bayesian samplers,” rather than representing explicit probability distributions (Bornstein and Norman, 2017Bornstein A.M. Norman K.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Sanborn and Chater, 2016Sanborn A.N. Chater N. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2016; 20: 883-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). According to this view, the brain represents a probability distribution when needed by “drawing samples” from memory (Figure 1B). Importantly, how exactly the memory is probed could change what is retrieved. When retrieving the distribution to make a confidence judgement, patients might sample the distribution correctly, leading to a correct confidence judgment. Similarly, they can report that their obsessive beliefs are inappropriate. In contrast, when sampling the distribution to generate action, OCD patients might show a bias in sampling; for example, showing “stickiness” in their sampling and repeatedly sampling the same unlikely (outlier) memory again and again (Figure 1B). This would be analogous to having obsessive thoughts that return to the same content again and again. Given that there are parallel systems for decision-making, another possibility is that different systems may have independent representations of uncertainty (Figure 1C). For example, during decision-making some brain structures such as anterior cingulate cortex simultaneously hold multiple estimates of response evidence that are based on different timescales of experience (Meder et al., 2017Meder D. Kolling N. Verhagen L. Wittmann M. Scholl J. Madsen K.H. Hulme O. Behrens T. Rushworth M. bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/195842Crossref Google Scholar, Wittmann et al., 2016Wittmann M.K. Kolling N. Akaishi R. Chau B.K. Brown J.W. Nelissen N. Rushworth M.F. Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Co-activation of such representations may provide one substrate for an estimate of uncertainty. Other brain structures, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that possess quite different representations of response evidence, may construct uncertainty estimates on the basis of a quite distinct process. Changes in just one system’s representation, while another system remains intact, might underlie the diverging uncertainty effects identified by Vaghi and colleagues and some of the striking features of OCD.
