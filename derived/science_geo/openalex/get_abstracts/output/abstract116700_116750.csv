https://openalex.org/W2077439063,"In the brain of adult mice, cells that divide in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle migrate up to 5 millimeters to the olfactory bulb where they differentiate into neurons. These migrating cells were found to move as chains through a well-defined pathway, the rostral migratory stream. Electron microscopic analysis of serial sections showed that these chains contained only closely apposed, elongated neuroblasts connected by membrane specializations. A second cell type, which contained glial fibrillary acidic protein, ensheathed the chains of migrating neuroblasts. Thus, during chain migration, neural precursors moved associated with each other and were not guided by radial glial or axonal fibers."

The cloning of ob, and the demonstration that it encodes a secreted protein (leptin) that binds specifically to a receptor (OB-R) in the brain, have validated critical aspects of this hypothesis. Here it is shown by genetic mapping and genomic analysis that mouse db, rat fatty (a homolog of db), and the gene encoding the OB-R are the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W2084140927,Variants of lambda repressor and cytochrome b562 translated from messenger RNAs without stop codons were modified by carboxyl terminal addition of an ssrA-encoded peptide tag and subsequently degraded by carboxyl terminal-specific proteases present in both the cytoplasm and periplasm of Escherichia coli. The tag appears to be added to the carboxyl terminus of the nascent polypeptide chain by cotranslational switching of the ribosome from the damaged messenger RNA to ssrA RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2003240840,"The force required to rupture the streptavidin-biotin complex was calculated here by computer simulations. The computed force agrees well with that obtained by recent single molecule atomic force microscope experiments. These simulations suggest a detailed multiple-pathway rupture mechanism involving five major unbinding steps. Binding forces and specificity are attributed to a hydrogen bond network between the biotin ligand and residues within the binding pocket of streptavidin. During rupture, additional water bridges substantially enhance the stability of the complex and even dominate the binding interactions. In contrast, steric restraints do not appear to contribute to the binding forces, although conformational motions were observed."

https://openalex.org/W2043290332,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-linked receptors of the chemoattractant subfamily can trigger adhesion through leukocyte integrins, and in this role they are thought to regulate immune cell-cell interactions and trafficking. In lymphoid cells transfected with formyl peptide or interleukin-8 receptors, agonist stimulation activated nucleotide exchange on the small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein RhoA in seconds. Inactivation of Rho by C3 transferase exoenzyme blocked agonist-induced lymphocyte alpha4beta1 adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and neutrophil beta2 integrin adhesion to fibrinogen. These findings suggest that Rho participates in signaling from chemoattractant receptors to trigger rapid adhesion in leukocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1999580437,"The TGF-beta superfamily comprises a number of functionally diverse growth factors/signalling molecules (1) which elicit their response upon binding to serine-threonine kinase receptors (2). We recently reported the isolation and characterization of two new members of the family, designated cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein (CDMP) 1 and 2 (ref. 3) which are closely related to the sub-family of bone morphogenetic proteins. CDMP-1 is predominantly expressed at sites of skeletal morphogenesis (3), and we now show that a mutation in hCDMP-1 is associated with a recessive human chondrodysplasia (acromesomelic chondrodysplasia, Hunter-Thompson type (4,5)). The disorder, characterized by skeletal abnormalities restricted to the limbs andlimb joints, is phenotypically similar to murine brachypodism (bp) which is due to mutations in growth/differentiation factor-5 (Gdf-5) (6), the mouse homologue of hCDMP-1. Affected individuals are homozygous for a 22-bp (tandem-duplication) frameshift mutation in the mature region of CDMP-1. The resulting phenotype provides direct evidence for the involvement of CDMP-1 in human skeletal development and represents the first human disorder attributable to a mutation in a TGF-beta superfamily member."

https://openalex.org/W1990999119,"The genetic background of T lymphocytes influences development of the T helper (TH) phenotype, resulting in either resistance or susceptibility of certain mouse strains to pathogens such as Leishmania major. With an in vitro model system, a difference in maintenance of responsiveness of T cells to interleukin-12 (IL-12) was detected between BALB/c and B10.D2 mice. Although naive T cells from both strains initially responded to IL-12, BALB/c T cells lost IL-12 responsiveness after stimulation with antigen in vitro, even when cocultured with B10.D2 T cells. Thus, susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection with L. major may derive from the loss of the ability to generate IL-12-induced TH1 responses rather than from an IL-4-induced TH2 response."

https://openalex.org/W2081973949,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a pleiotropic cytokine, is a major regulator of the immune system and is considered crucial for the development of T helper cell type 2 (TH2) responses. The susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection with Leishmania major has been associated with a polarized TH2 response and an inability to down-modulate IL-4 production. The role of IL-4 in vivo was examined directly by disrupting the IL-4 gene in BALB/c embryonic stem cells. Despite the absence of IL-4, the genetically pure BALB/c mutant mice remained susceptible to L. major infection, showed no signs of lesion healing or parasite clearance, and did not switch to a TH1 phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1998597651,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8), the prototypic member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines, induces in neutrophils chemotaxis, the respiratory burst, granule release, and increased cell adhesion. The IL-8 receptor is a seven-transmembrane spanning receptor coupled to specific heterotrimeric G proteins including Gi and G16. IL-8 stimulation of its receptor on neutrophils activates Ras GTP loading and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway including Raf-1 and B-Raf. The properties of IL-8 stimulation of the MAPK pathway differ from those observed for chemoattractants such as C5a. Even though Ras GTP loading is similar for IL-8 and C5a, the maximal activation of Raf-1 and B-Raf is approximately 2-fold and 3-7-fold, respectively, less for IL-8 than that observed for C5a. Raf-1 activation is rapid but transient, returning to near basal levels by 10 min. B-Raf activation is slower in onset and does not return to basal levels for nearly 30 min. IL-8 activation of MAPK follows a time course suggesting an involvement of both Raf-1 and B-Raf. Surprisingly, wortmannin, at low concentrations, inhibits Raf-1, B-Raf, and MAPK activation in response to IL-8 and C5a demonstrating a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the activation of Raf kinases in G protein-coupled receptor systems in human neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W2036727875,"Targeting of substrates for degradation by the ATP, ubiquitin-dependent pathway requires formation of multiubiquitin chains in which the 8.6-kDa polypeptide is linked by isopeptide bonds between carboxyl termini and Lys-48 residues of successive monomers. Binding of Lys-48-linked chains by subunit 5 of the 26 S proteasome regulatory complex commits the attached target protein to degradation with concomitant release of free ubiquitin monomers following disassembly of the chains. Point mutants of ubiquitin (Lys → Arg) were used to map the linkage specificity for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes previously demonstrated to form novel multiubiquitin chains not attached through Lys-48. Recombinant human E2EPF catalyzed multiubiquitin chain formation exclusively through Lys-11 of ubiquitin while recombinant yeast RAD6 formed chains linked only through Lys-6. Multiubiquitin chains linked through Lys-6, Lys-11, or Lys-48 each bound to subunit 5 of partially purified human 26 S proteasome with comparable affinities. Since chains bearing different linkages are expected to pack into distinct structures, competition between Lys-11 and Lys-48 chains for binding to subunit 5 demonstrates that the latter possesses determinants for recognizing alternatively linked chains and precludes the existence of subunit 5 isoforms recognizing distinct structures. In addition, competition studies provided an estimate of Kd≤ 18 nM for the intrinsic binding of Lys-48-linked chains of linkage number n > 4. This result suggests that the principal mechanistic advantage of multiubiquitin chain formation is to enhance the affinity of the associated substrate for the 26 S complex relative to that of unconjugated target protein. Complementation studies with E1/E2-depleted rabbit reticulocyte extract demonstrated RAD6 supported isopeptide ligase-dependent degradation only through Lys-48-linked chains, while E2EPF retained the ability to target a model radiolabeled substrate through Lys-11-linked chains. Therefore, the linkage specificity exhibited by these E2 isozymes depends on their catalytic context with respect to isopeptide ligase.

In the case of cyclins, discrete recognition signals are conserved among related isoforms and within unrelated proteins(6.Yaglom J. Linskens M.H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Futcher B. Finley D. Mol. Cell.

Attachment of single ubiquitin moieties to target proteins effects a modest rate of degradation by the 26 S proteasome(32.Haas A. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Considerable recent work has demonstrated that these multiubiquitin chains are formed by a repeating structure in which the carboxyl terminus of each ubiquitin is linked to Lys-48 of the preceding ubiquitin(33.Gregori L. Poosch M.S. Cousins G. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8354-8357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the resulting multiubiquitin chain exhibits considerable packing order and symmetry that is thought essential for recognition by the S5 subunit of the regulatory complex capping the 26 S proteasome (36.Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37.Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model is supported by mutagenesis studies identifying essential ubiquitin residues required for both multiubiquitin chain binding to S5 and for subsequent degradative targeting(38.Pickart C. Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has been most extensively studied in yeast and rabbit reticulocytes. Within these systems, the almost quantitative inhibition of ATP-dependent degradation accompanying substitution of rmUb ( 1The abbreviations used are: rmUbreductively methylated ubiquitinBSAbovine serum albuminE1ubiquitin activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier protein (subscript denotes relative molecular weight or isozyme)E3ubiquitin:protein isopeptide ligasercmBSAreduced carboxymethylated BSAPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisUbubiquitin.) or UbK48R for wild type polypeptide demonstrates that a significant fraction of degradative flux proceeds through conjugated intermediates bearing Lys-48-linked multiubiquitin chains since neither rmUb nor UbK48R supports chain elongation(33.Gregori L. Poosch M.S. Cousins G. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8354-8357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence supports the existence of multiubiquitin chains bearing linkage specificities distinct from Lys-48. Purified recombinant yeast RAD6, a member of the ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) isozyme family, catalyzes multiubiquitin chain formation to core histones in the presence of only ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) to maintain the E2 active site cysteine charged with ubiquitin thiolester(39.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linkage specificity for these chains does not require Lys-48 since rmUb but not UbK48R blocks the characteristic ladder of conjugates revealed by SDS-PAGE(39.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results supporting Lys-48-independent chains have more recently been obtained with recombinant E2EPF, an isoform cloned from human keratinocytes using autoantibodies obtained from pemphigous foliaceus patients(64.Liu Z. Haas A.L. Conrad C.A. Diaz L.A. Giudice G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, stable Lys-63-linked chains requiring participation of RAD6 (UBC2) have been observed in yeast and proposed to account in part for the DNA repair function of this E2 isoform(40.Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since RAD6 normally supports Lys-48 chain-dependent degradation in yeast within the N-end rule pathway(41.Dohmen R.J. Madura K. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 42.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter observation suggests linkage specificity may be context specific and depend on either the target protein or, more likely, the cognate E3 required for conjugation. reductively methylated ubiquitin bovine serum albumin ubiquitin activating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein (subscript denotes relative molecular weight or isozyme) ubiquitin:protein isopeptide ligase reduced carboxymethylated BSA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ubiquitin. The currently accepted paradigm for target protein conjugation requires ubiquitin activating enzyme, a ubiquitin carrier protein, and ubiquitin:protein isopeptide ligase. The metabolic significance of E3-independent conjugation by certain members of the E2 family remains uncertain, although conjugates formed in the absence of E3 by yeast RAD6 and CDC34 as well as the rabbit reticulocyte isoform E232k are substrates for 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation(32.Haas A. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, mutagenesis of the lysine residues present on ubiquitin have allowed the assignment of linkage specificity for multiubiquitin chain formation by RAD6 and E2EPF. Other results indicate that these alternatively linked chains are recognized by subunit 5 of the 26 S proteasome, suggesting target proteins marked by such homopolymer structures may be degradative intermediates. Finally, reconstitution experiments with rabbit reticulocyte extracts demonstrate that alternatively linked chains are competent in the overall degradative pathway. These results define a functional role for alternatively linked chains and serve as a basis for future mechanistic studies with the cognate E3 isoforms. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (high pressure liquid chromatography purified) was obtained from Sigma. Carrier-free Na125I and [2,8-3H]ATP were purchased from DuPont NEN.

A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recrystallized BSA was obtained from Pentex and used for the preparation of 125I-rcmBSA(46.Evans Jr., A.C. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2915-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte-rich whole blood was generated by phenylhydrazine induction and used to generate fraction II (45.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A portion of fraction II was used to prepare apparently homogeneous E232k and E1/E2-depleted fraction II(39.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit liver E1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by adapting reported affinity chromatography/fast protein liquid chromatography methods reported previously (47.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantitated by the stoichiometric formation of ubiquitin [3H]adenylate(48.Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homogeneous native histone H2B (generous gift of Dr. Vaughn Jackson, Medical College of Wisconsin) and recombinant yeast CDC34 (UBC3) and RAD6 (UBC2) were those reported previously(49.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine erythrocyte ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma as a lyophilized powder. Although previous lots of this polypeptide were sufficiently homogeneous for use without additional purification, recent lots have consistently contained several contaminating proteins that preclude accurate spectrophotometric quantitation of ubiquitin and obviate its direct use following radioiodination. Therefore, commercial preparations were additionally purified by modification of published procedures(44.Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Commercial ubiquitin was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and then titrated to pH 4.5 (4°C) with glacial acetic acid. Aliquots were applied to an HR 10/10 Mono S cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.5). Ubiquitin eluted as a single, symmetric peak at 0.29 M NaCl within a linear gradient of 5 mM/ml (2 ml/min). Ubiquitin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against distilled water using tubing having an exclusion limit of 3.5 kDa. The resulting sample was concentrated by lyophilization and then dissolved in a minimum amount of distilled water. Ubiquitin (>99% pure) was quantitated spectrophotometrically using an empirically determined 280-nm extinction coefficient of 0.16 ml/mg•cm(44.Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of the homogeneous ubiquitin was used to prepare rmUb as described previously (49.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-site mutagenesis of each lysine residue present within ubiquitin was accomplished by the polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension method of Ho et al.(50.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) using the pPLhUb mutagenesis/expression plasmid described earlier(51.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following the final amplification step, the mutant polymerase chain reaction product was restricted with NdeI/SapI then ligated into NdeI/SapI-restricted pPLhUb. Generation of the predicted mutants was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing the complete ubiquitin coding region of the resulting pPLhUb constructs. Mutant ubiquitins were expressed in the Escherichia coli AR58 strain by heat induction and purified to apparent homogeneity without modification(51.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as for wild type polypeptide. Typical yields were in the range of 10 mg/liter of culture for all mutants except UbK29R, which gave a consistent yield of approximately 0.5 mg/liter of culture. In all subsequent applications, all mutants displayed stabilities comparable to wild type polypeptide. In addition, all mutants exhibited CD spectra between 190 and 260 nm, indistinguishable from that of wild type ubiquitin (not shown). Initial rates of histone H2B monoubiquitination were measured for wild type and mutant ubiquitins as described(51.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of wild type or mutant radioiodinated ubiquitin (ca. 2-4 × 103 cpm/pmol) were incubated at 37°C in reactions of 25 μl, final volume, containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 15 μM H2B, 1 IU creatine phosphokinase, 1 IU inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1 nM E1, and 20 nM E232k. In addition, all reactions contained 0.5 mg/ml BSA as a carrier protein to prevent adsorption of the enzymes to the reaction tubes. Reactions were quenched by addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and then boiled for 5 min. Following SDS-PAGE resolution, the monoubiquitinated H2B band was excised and associated radioactivity was determined by γ counting(45.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Data were corrected for radioactivity present in an identical section of a control lane derived from an incubation performed in the absence of E1 and E232k. The incubation conditions were chosen to be E1 limiting, indicated by a linear dependence of initial rate on [E1], to kinetically isolate the ubiquitin-dependent activation step. The linkage specificity for multiubiquitin chain formation catalyzed by recombinant CDC34, RAD6, and E2EPF was determined in incubations similar to those for the kinetic assays with the exception that E1 and E2 concentrations were empirically adjusted to be rate-limiting with respect to E2 to kinetically isolate the step of multiubiquitin chain elongation, and histone was present only in the experiment testing RAD6 to serve as a substrate for conjugation(39.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each incubation was conducted under initial velocity conditions with 5 μM radioiodinated wild type or mutant ubiquitin. Following resolution by 12% SDS-PAGE, the pattern of conjugates was visualized by autoradiography. Correction for slight differences in the specific activities of the radioiodinated proteins was achieved by either normalizing for exposure at constant sample volume (Fig. 1) or adjusting the sample volume at constant exposure (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:).Figure 4:Subunit 5 of the 26 S proteasome binds alternatively linked multiubiquitin chains. Aliquots of partially purified 26 S proteasome (25 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue (left lane) or transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with radiolabeled chains of the indicated linkage type as described under “Materials and Methods.” Positions of subunit 5 and the 100-kDa putative isopeptidase-T bands are indicated to the left.

Proteolytic activity was monitored with the fluorogenic peptide N-succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. Fractions exhibiting ATP-dependent hydrolysis of the peptide substrate were pooled and used in the direct conjugate binding assay of Deveraux et al.(37.Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of purified 26 S proteasome per lane was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell)(53.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excess nitrocellulose binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 M NaCl and 5% (w/v) powdered milk. The blots were then incubated for 1.5 h in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 M NaCl, 25 mg/ml BSA, and 3 × 104 cpm/ml multiubiquitin chain prepared using 125I-ubiquitin and the indicated E2 isozyme. Nonspecifically bound label was removed by four successive 5-min washes in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 M NaCl, the second and third of which additionally contained 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. Specifically bound label was visualized by autoradiography. Binding quantitation was achieved by excising the S5 band and determining associated 125I label by γ counting. Radioactivity was corrected for nonspecifically bound label associated with an equally sized portion of the blot not containing the S5 band. The ability of wild type or mutant ubiquitins to support ATP, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of 125I-rcmBSA in the presence of the three E2 isozymes was assayed using E1/E2-depleted rabbit reticulocyte fraction II(45.Haas A.L.

https://openalex.org/W2048576933,"A class of lamellar biological hydrogels comprised of fluid membranes of lipids and surfactants with small amounts of low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol)-derived polymer lipids (PEG-lipids) were studied by x-ray diffraction, polarized light microscopy, and rheometry. In contrast to isotropic hydrogels of polymer networks, these membrane-based birefringent liquid crystalline biogels, labeled L-alpha,g, form the gel phase when water is added to the liquid-like lamellar L-alpha phase, which reenters a liquid-like mixed phase upon further dilution. Furthermore, gels with larger water content require less PEG-lipid to remain stable. Although concentrated (approximately 50 weight percent) mixtures of free PEG (molecular weight, 5000) and water do not gel, gelation does occur in mixtures containing as little as 0.5 weight percent PEG-lipid. A defining signature of the L-alpha,g regime as it sets in from the fluid lamellar L-alpha phase is the proliferation of layer-dislocation-type defects, which are stabilized by the segregation of PEG-lipids to the defect regions of high membrane curvature that connect the membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2057254962,"E6-AP, a 100-kDa cellular protein, was originally identified through its interaction with the E6 protein of the oncogenic human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. The complex of E6-AP and E6 specifically interacts with p53 and mediates ubiquitination of p53 in concert with the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5. Recent results suggest that E6-AP is representative of a family of putative ubiquitin-protein ligases. Members of this family are characterized by a conserved C-terminal region, termed hect domain. In this paper, we describe the isolation of two human E2s, designated as UbcH6 and UbcH7, that in addition to UbcH5 can interact with E6-AP. UbcH6 is a novel member of an evolutionally conserved subfamily of E2s that includes UbcH5 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBC4. Although UbcH7 does not appear to be a member of this subfamily, UbcH7 efficiently substitutes for UbcH5 in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. Surprisingly, UbcH6 was only weakly active in this particular assay. In addition, UbcH5 but not UbcH6 or UbcH7 efficiently interacts with the hect protein RSP5.

These results indicate that E6-AP can interact with at least two species of E2 and that different hect proteins may interact with different E2s. The ubiquitin system represents a major pathway involved in selective protein degradation(1.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 3.Jentsch S. Annu.

This pathway first requires the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein, to defined lysine residues of substrate proteins. Ubiquitin-protein conjugates are then recognized and degraded by a specific protease complex, the 26 S proteasome. Protein ubiquitination involves three classes of enzymes. These are the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ( 1The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein ligaseGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2, and the ubiquitin-protein ligases E3. Ubiquitin is first activated by E1 via formation of a thioester bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of E1. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to one of a number of E2s preserving the high energy thioester bond. The E2s have then been thought to catalyze the final attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate protein, often in concert with E3s. E3s have been proposed to function by specifically binding to substrate proteins that are otherwise not recognized by E2s. Recent results, however, suggest that at least some E3s may also be directly involved in the final transfer of ubiquitin to a substrate protein(5.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin-protein ligase glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction rapid amplification of cDNA ends polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Only two genes encoding proteins with E3 activity have been cloned so far. These are UBR1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(6.Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and human E6-AP(7.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). E6-AP was originally identified through its interaction with the E6 oncoprotein of the cancer-associated human papillomavirus types 16 and 18(8.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4129-4135Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The E6•E6-AP complex specifically binds to the tumor suppressor protein p53 and induces its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation(7.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 9.Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). An essential intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent protein ubiquitination is the formation of a thioester complex between ubiquitin and E6-AP (5.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the direction of ubiquitin transfer is from E1 to E2 and then from E2 to E6-AP. This suggests that in this particular system, the E3 catalyzes the final attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate protein, rather than the E2 as previously assumed. The cysteine residue of E6-AP involved in thioester formation has been mapped to the carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl-terminal regions of several proteins from different organisms show significant similarity to the carboxyl terminus of E6-AP(5.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue necessary for thioester formation of E6-AP with ubiquitin is conserved among all of these proteins. Because of this similarity these proteins have been termed hect proteins, for homologous to E6-AP C Terminus(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Although their function is presently unknown, an intriguing possibility is that these proteins have E3 activity, similar to E6-AP. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that two of the hect proteins, namely S. cerevisiae RSP5 and a rat 100-kDa protein, can form thioester complexes with ubiquitin(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Identification of all the components necessary and sufficient for E6•E6-AP-induced ubiquitination of p53 revealed that E6-AP interacts only with a distinct E2 activity(10.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). This E2 activity is represented by members of an evolutionally conserved subgroup of E2s that includes human UbcH5, S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5, and Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8(12.Scheffner M.

Recently, another mammalian E2 activity was described that appeared to be involved in E6•E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination of p53(15.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This E2, termed E2-F1, is different from UbcH5, as shown by comparison of the partial amino acid sequence of proteolytic fragments of biochemically purified E2-F1 and the sequence of UbcH5. This indicated that there may be more than one species of E2 that can interact with E6-AP. Here we report the isolation of two human cDNAs encoding E2s. One of these, termed UbcH6, represents a novel member of the subfamily of E2s mentioned above. The amino acid sequence of the other E2, termed UbcH7, includes the previously reported sequences of the proteolytic fragments of E2-F1, indicating that UbcH7 is identical to E2-F1. In E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination, UbcH7 is as active as UbcH5, whereas UbcH6 shows only little activity. However, only UbcH5 interacts efficiently with RSP5. This indicates that E6-AP can interact with different species of E2s and that different hect proteins may interact with different E2s. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from the human papillomavirus-negative cell line C-33A, and from the human papillomavirus-positive cell line HeLa by standard procedures(17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) were used for reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification. Reactions were performed using the RNA PCR kit from Cetus. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-1. The sequence of several clones derived from independent PCR reactions was determined using T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The 5′-end and the 3′-end of the open reading frame were cloned using a 5′-RACE kit and a 3′-RACE kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions were performed according to the suggestions of the manufacturer. For 5′-RACE, reverse transcription was performed using a primer extending from nucleotides 516 to 497 (Fig. 1). The resulting cDNA was tailed with poly(dC) and terminal nucleotidyltransferase followed by PCR amplification. An aliquot of the PCR reaction was taken, and a second round of PCR amplification performed using a primer supplied by the 5′-RACE kit. For 3′-RACE, an oligo(dT) primer supplied by the 3′-RACE kit was used for reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification using a primer extending from nucleotides 415 to 434. An aliquot of the PCR reaction was used as a template in a second round of PCR using a primer extending from nucleotides 469 to 488. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-1 and sequenced. To clone UbcH7, previously referred to as E2-F1(15.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two degenerate primers, which correspond to two peptide sequences of UbcH7 derived from direct protein sequencing (amino acids 106-101 and 53-59; for numbering see Fig. 1), respectively, were used for reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-1 and sequenced. Using a 32P-labeled fragment comprising nucleotides 157 to 318 (see Fig. 1) as a probe, a phage λ clone comprising the complete open reading frame was isolated from a random-primed cDNA library from normal human keratinocytes (Clontech). The complete open reading frames of UbcH6 and UbcH7 were cloned in a single fragment by reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification. For UbcH6, the primer for reverse transcription comprised nucleotides 582-563 of the open reading frame. For UbcH7, the primer for reverse transcription spanned nucleotides 465-445. Both primers contained a BamHI site at the 5′-end for cloning. For both UbcH6 and UbcH7, the opposing primer used for PCR amplification extended from nucleotides 1 to 21 of the respective open reading frame with an NdeI site at the 5′-end. The PCR products were cloned into pET-3a and sequenced. E1, A. thaliana UBC1, UbcH5, UbcH6, and UbcH7 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the pET expression system as described previously(12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl.

Formation of thioester adducts of the different E2s, E6-AP, and RSP5ΔC6 with ubiquitin was determined as described previously(5.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained approximately 5-10 ng of E1, 1 μg of 32P-labeled GST-ubiquitin, 100 ng of the respective E2, and where indicated, 300 ng of E6-AP and RSP5ΔC6, respectively, in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol. After 5 min at 25°C, reactions were terminated either by incubating the mixtures for 15 min at 30°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 M urea, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol or by boiling the mixtures in the buffer above containing 100 mM dithiothreitol instead of urea. The whole reaction mixtures were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 4°C and radioactively labeled bands visualized by autoradiography. Ubiquitination assays using GST-E6-E7 as substrate were performed as described previously(10.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). Human UbcH5 has been cloned by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to highly conserved regions of S. cerevisiae UBC4 and A. thaliana UBC8(12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae as well as A.thaliana encode for several E2s, which are highly related to UBC4 and UBC8 at the amino acid sequence level(3.Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14.Girod P.-A. Carpenter T.P. van Nocker S. Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test whether human cells also encode a UbcH5-like subfamily of E2s, cDNA was synthesized from cytoplasmic RNA and was amplified by PCR using the same set of primers. This approach yielded a 325-base pair PCR product. Cloning and sequencing of this product revealed that two classes of cDNAs were isolated. The DNA sequence of one class of cDNAs was identical to the sequence of UbcH5 (data not shown). The other class of DNA sequences encoded an amino acid sequence similar to amino acids 52-140 of UbcH5 (for numbering see Fig. 2), but not identical (62% identity). To obtain the sequence of the complete open reading frame other PCR approaches, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, were used(22.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). This resulted in the specific accumulation of PCR products encoding portions of the 5′-region as well as of the 3′-region of the E2 open reading frame. The cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 1(UbcH6) contains only those sequences that were present in multiple clones from independent PCRs. It encodes a protein of 193 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 21.3 kDa. The E2 was termed UbcH6 because, to our knowledge, at the time of isolation this was the sixth E2 isolated from human cells(12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8797-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that it is not clear whether the methionine codon at position 1 represents the initiating codon since a stop codon located upstream of the methionine codon could not be found in the 5′-RACE PCR products. In addition, cDNA library screening has not yet resulted in the isolation of a clone that expands in the 5′ direction of this putative E2. Sequence comparison suggests that UbcH6 is related to the E2 subfamily including UbcH5 and S. cerevisiae UBC4 (Fig. 2). However, UbcH6 appears to be unique among these E2s since it contains an amino-terminal extension of approximately 40 amino acids (see Fig. 1). The functional significance of this extension is presently unknown. To obtain a cDNA that encodes for E2-F1, two degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on two peptide sequences derived from direct protein sequencing of biochemically purified E2-F1(15.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers were used to amplify cDNA synthesized from cytoplasmic RNA isolated from human cells. A 162-base pair product was isolated, cloned, and sequenced. The DNA sequence was identical in all clones and encoded an amino acid sequence containing the sequence of a third peptide derived from E2-F1 (see Fig. 1). Since the sequence of the third peptide was not encoded by the primers used, this strongly suggests that the cDNA cloned indeed corresponds to E2-F1. Using the 162-base pair PCR fragment as a probe, a cDNA clone encoding the complete open reading frame was isolated from a cDNA library made from primary human keratinocytes (Fig. 1, UbcH7). The cDNA contains an open reading frame that encodes 154 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17 kDa. Since there is a stop codon located upstream of the putative start codon (data not shown) the initiating methionine is presumably present within this cDNA. In keeping with the nomenclature introduced above, this E2, which most likely is identical to E2-F1, was termed UbcH7. Based on sequence comparison (Fig. 2), UbcH7 does not appear to be a member of the E2 subfamily mentioned above. The sequence of UbcH7 shows approximately the same similarity to UbcH5 as E2s, which are functionally not related to UbcH5 with respect to the ability to mediate E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. A common feature of all E2s characterized to date is the ability to form thioester adducts with ubiquitin in the presence of E1(3.Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28.Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol.

Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that UbcH6 and UbcH7 are indeed E2s, the respective cDNAs were cloned into the pET-3a vector and the proteins were expressed in E. coli. Both UbcH6 and UbcH7 were then incubated with radioactively labeled ubiquitin and E1. As shown in Fig. 3, both proteins could form thioester complexes with ubiquitin, demonstrating that UbcH6 as well as UbcH7 have the properties of an E2. To test whether UbcH7 may indeed represent the E2 activity described by Ciechanover and colleagues(15.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its ability to mediate the E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination of an E6-E7 fusion protein or of p53 was assayed. As a negative control A. thaliana UBC1 was used which was previously shown to be inactive in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination(10.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). In the presence of E6-AP, UbcH7 as well as UbcH5 could efficiently mediate ubiquitination of the E6-E7 fusion protein (Fig. 4) as well as of p53 (data not shown), with UbcH5 being slightly more active than UbcH7 under the conditions used. This strongly suggests that UbcH7 represents the E2 activity described previously. Although UbcH6 appears to be more similar to UbcH5 than UbcH7 on the amino acid sequence level, UbcH6 was only weakly active in this particular assay (Fig. 4). A possible explanation for this observation was that the amino-terminal extension of UbcH6, which distinguishes it from UbcH5 and UbcH5-related proteins of other organisms, negatively interferes with the activity of UbcH6. However, a deletion mutant of UbcH6, which initiates at the second methionine and therefore lacks the amino-terminal extension, was as inefficient in ubiquitination of the E6-E7 fusion protein as the full-length UbcH6 (data not shown). An essential intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent protein ubiquitination is the formation of thioester adducts of E6-AP with ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and a specific E2(5.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Therefore a possible explanation for the inability of UbcH6 to efficiently support E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination is that UbcH6 may be impaired in its ability to transfer an activated ubiquitin molecule to E6-AP. Alternatively, beside transferring ubiquitin to E6-AP, UbcH5 and UbcH7 may play an active role in the final attachment of ubiquitin to the E6-E7 fusion protein, a function that may not be exerted by UbcH6. To distinguish between these possibilities, thioester formation of E6-AP with ubiquitin was assayed in the presence of the different E2s. As shown in Fig. 5, UbcH5 and UbcH7 could transfer ubiquitin to E6-AP with a similar efficiency. In the presence of UbcH6, significantly less ubiquitin thioester complexes of E6-AP could be detected, indicating that UbcH6 is not capable to efficiently transfer ubiquitin to E6-AP. Recently it was reported that UbcH5 can also interact with RSP5, a member of the hect family of proteins, as measured by UbcH5-dependent formation of ubiquitin thioester adducts of a deletion mutant of RSP5 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 6 amino acids (RSP5ΔC6). It was therefore tested whether UbcH7 or UbcH6, or both, could substitute for UbcH5 in this reaction (Fig. 6). In contrast to the experiments with E6-AP, both UbcH6 and UbcH7 were significantly less active than UbcH5, as judged by the appearance of thioester complexes of RSP5ΔC6 with ubiquitin. The ubiquitin system plays a major role in selective protein degradation(1.Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 3.Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 177-205Crossref Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4.Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Selective protein degradation requires the specific targeting of many different proteins, often at particular stages of the cell cycle or differentiation. The selectivity of the ubiquitin system appears to be mediated by E2s, often in conjunction with E3s. It was previously shown that E6-AP and RSP5, two members of the hect family of putative E3 proteins, interact specifically with a subgroup of human E2s represented by UbcH5(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have now cloned two additional human E2s, designated UbcH6 and UbcH7, that can interact with E6-AP and RSP5. However, whereas RSP5 interacts only weakly with UbcH6 and UbcH7 compared with UbcH5, UbcH7 is as active as UbcH5 in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. This indicates that different hect proteins may require different E2 activities for protein ubiquitination. The differential interaction between E3s and E2s may further contribute to ensure the high specificity of protein ubiquitination. UbcH6 was cloned by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers that correspond to highly conserved regions of a subfamily of E2s, which includes UbcH5 and S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 13.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Accordingly, amino acid sequence comparison with other E2s revealed that UbcH6 has the highest similarity to the members of this subfamily. Nevertheless, UbcH6 appears to be a unique member of this subfamily in that it contains an amino-terminal extension of approximately 40 amino acids, in contrast to all other members of the subfamily described to date(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 13.Seufert W. Jentsch S.

Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the similarity, UbcH6 could not efficiently substitute for UbcH5 or S. cerevisiae UBC4 in E6-AP-dependent protein ubiquitination. It seemed possible that the amino-terminal extension masks a domain of UbcH6 necessary for interaction with E6-AP or induces a conformation of UbcH6, which is not properly recognized by E6-AP. However, a deletion mutant of UbcH6 lacking the amino-terminal extension was not more efficient in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination than the full-length protein. The amino-terminal extension contains an unusual high number of serines. Therefore, it is conceivable that modification of the amino-terminal extension, such as phosphorylation, may result in a form of UbcH6 that, like UbcH5, can efficiently interact with E6-AP. Alternatively, UbcH6 and UbcH5 may interact with a different set of E3s. In support of the latter hypothesis is the recent observation by S. Jentsch and co-workers ( 2S. Jentsch, personal communication.) that a murine E2, which is almost identical to UbcH6 at the amino acid sequence level, could only partially substitute for S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5 in genetic experiments. UbcH7 was cloned based on the published sequences of proteolytic fragments derived from a chromatographically purified E2 activity termed E2-F1(15.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to UbcH5, E2-F1 was reported to function in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination(16.Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since UbcH5 and E2-F1 have similar chromatographic properties, ( 3M. Scheffner, unpublished.) however, it seemed possible that the E2-F1 preparation used was contaminated by UbcH5. This possibility can now be excluded since bacterially expressed UbcH7 was indeed functional in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. Amino acid sequence comparison of UbcH7 with UbcH5 suggests that UbcH7 is not more related to UbcH5 than E2s, which are inactive in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. This indicates that E6-AP can interact with different species of E2s. Whether there are additional E2s that may interact with E6-AP is not clear at present. Such E2s, however, should have chromatographic properties similar to UbcH5 and UbcH7 because only fractions obtained by cation-exchange chromatography of cellular extracts that contain UbcH5 and UbcH7 can support E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination(10.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar).3 An intriguing but purely speculative hypothesis is that in the presence of UbcH7, E6-AP has an altered substrate specificity from that in the presence of UbcH5. However, although E6-AP interacts with both UbcH5 and UbcH7 in in vitro systems, further experiments will be necessary to determine whether these interactions also exist in vivo. Similar amounts of thioester complexes of E6-AP and ubiquitin were detected in the presence of UbcH5 and UbcH7, respectively. In contrast, transfer of ubiquitin to RSP5 was much less efficient in the presence of UbcH7 than in the presence of UbcH5. The reason for this apparent difference between RSP5 and E6-AP is not known. As mentioned above, UbcH7 is apparently not a member of the UbcH5-like subfamily of E2s. Nevertheless it seems likely that the regions (or structures) of UbcH5 and UbcH7 that are necessary for interaction with E6-AP and RSP5 are similar to each other. Construction of deletion and point mutants as well as of chimeric proteins of UbcH5 and UbcH7 or UbcH6, respectively, should allow definition of those regions. Both E6-AP and RSP5 are members of the family of hect proteins, which are putative E3s(11.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). E3s are presumably involved in mediating the substrate selectivity of protein ubiquitination, indicating that there may be a large number of proteins with E3-like activities. Recent data base searches suggest that human cells encode for 10 or more hect proteins.3 Assuming that all of these proteins interact with the ubiquitin system, it will be interesting to see whether hect proteins in general share the property of E6-AP and RSP5 to interact with members of the UbcH5-like subfamily of E2s or whether some of these may interact with other E2s. Characterization of hect proteins and their interplay with E2s should contribute to define the precise role of E2s and E3s in mediating substrate recognition in E3-dependent protein ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W2008417039,"Leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene B4 into its biologically less active metabolite, 12-oxo-leukotriene B4. This is an initial and key step of metabolic inactivation of leukotriene B4 in various tissues other than leukocytes. Here we report the cDNA cloning for porcine and human enzymes from kidney cDNA libraries. A full-length cDNA of the porcine enzyme contains an open reading frame consisting of 987 base pairs, corresponding to 329 amino acids. The human enzyme showed a 97.1% homology with the porcine enzyme. Northern blotting of human tissues revealed its high expression in the kidney, liver, and intestine but not in leukocytes. The porcine enzyme was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, which exhibited similar characteristics with the native enzyme. Because the enzymes have a homology, in part, with NAD(P)+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, a site-directed mutagenesis study was carried out. We found that three glycines at 152, 155, and 166 have crucial roles in the enzyme activity, possibly by producing an NADP+ binding pocket. Leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of leukotriene B4 into its biologically less active metabolite, 12-oxo-leukotriene B4. This is an initial and key step of metabolic inactivation of leukotriene B4 in various tissues other than leukocytes. Here we report the cDNA cloning for porcine and human enzymes from kidney cDNA libraries. A full-length cDNA of the porcine enzyme contains an open reading frame consisting of 987 base pairs, corresponding to 329 amino acids. The human enzyme showed a 97.1% homology with the porcine enzyme. Northern blotting of human tissues revealed its high expression in the kidney, liver, and intestine but not in leukocytes. The porcine enzyme was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, which exhibited similar characteristics with the native enzyme.

This is in contrast with CMP/UMP kinase from Dictyostelium discoideum, an enzyme active on CMP or UMP but much less active on the corresponding deoxynucleotides. Binding of CMP enhanced the affinity of E. coli CMP kinase for ATP or ADP, a particularity never described in this family of proteins that might explain inhibition of enzyme activity by excess of nucleoside monophosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1989941063,"The expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1, a potent neurotrophic factor, increases during differentiation and remains high in adult neuronal tissues. To examine the importance of this expression on the neuronal phenotype, we have used PC12 cells, a model to study FGF-induced neuronal differentiation. After demonstrating that FGF1 and FGF2 are synthesized by PC12 cells, we investigated if FGF1 expression could be a key element in differentiation. Using the cell signaling pathway to determine the effects of FGF1 alone, FGF1 plus heparin, or a mutated FGF1, we showed an activation to the same extent of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase and MAP kinase (extracellular regulated kinase 1). However, only FGF1 plus heparin could promote PC12 cell differentiation. Thus, the MAP kinase pathway is insufficient to promote differentiation. Analysis of the PC12 cells after the addition of FGF1 plus heparin or FGF2 demonstrated a significant increase in the level of FGF1 expression with the same time course as the appearance of the neuritic extensions. Transfection experiments were performed to enhance constitutivly or after dexamethasone induction the level of FGF1 expression. The degree of differentiation achieved by the cells correlated directly with the amount of FGF1 expressed. The MAP kinase pathway did not appear to be involved. Interestingly, a 5-fold increase in FGF1 in constitutive transfected cells extended dramatically their survival in serum-free medium, suggesting that the rise of FGF1 synthesis during neuronal differentiation is probably linked to their ability to survive in the adult. All of these data demonstrate that, in contrast to the MAP kinase cascade, FGF1 expression is sufficient to induce in PC12 cells both differentiation and survival. It also shows that auto- and trans-activation of FGF1 expression is involved in the differentiation process stimulated by exogenous FGFs through a new pathway which remains to be characterized.

In rat brain, FGF2 is present in most neurons within the cerebral cortex(1.Pettmann B. Labourdette G. Weibel M. Sensenbrenner M. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 68: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), hippocampus(2.Janet T. Miehe M. Pettmann B. Labourdette G. Sensenbrenner M. Neurosci.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). High levels of FGF1 expression have been observed in motor neurons, primary sensory neurons, and retinal ganglion neurons(4.Jacquemin E. Halley C. Alterio J. Laurent M. Courtois Y. Jeanny J.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 116: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5.Elde R. Cao Y.H. Cintra A. Brelje T.C. Pelto-Huikko M. Junttila T. Fuxe K. Pettersson R.F. Hokfelt T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 349-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In chick brain, the expression of FGF1 is developmentally regulated(6.Schnurch H. Risau W. Development. 1991; 111: 1143-1154PubMed Google Scholar). In bovine and rat embryonic retina, all neuronal layers express FGF1 with an appearance corresponding to their sequential differentiation(7.Jacquemin E. Jonet L. Oliver L. Bugra K. Laurent M. Courtois Y. Jeanny J.C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bugra K. Oliver L. Jacquemin E. Laurent M. Courtois Y. Hicks D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1586-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In rat, the level of FGF1 expression remains uniformly low throughout the embryonic period until postnatal day 7. Thereafter, it increases rapidly, reaching a maximum in the adult retina. In the intermediate central nervous system, subclasses of FGF receptors appear to be down-regulated during development(9.Heuer J.G. Von-Batheld C.S. Kinoshita Y. Evers P.C. Bothwell M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 283-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and during retinal embryonic development, the expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 follows the retinal layering(10.Tcheng M. Fuhrman G. Hartman M.P. Courtois Y. Jeanny J.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These patterns of FGF expression suggest that these growth factors are involved in the integrity, development, and differentiation of the central nervous system. In fact, in vitro studies have shown that FGF1 promotes the survival of photoreceptors (11.Hicks D. Courtois Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the neuritic outgrowth of dissociated retinal ganglion cells(12.Lipton S.A. Wagner J.A. Madison R.D.D. Amore P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). FGF1 also inhibits pigmentation of immature pigmented epithelium cells of embryonic chick retina and stimulates ganglion cell differentiation (13.Guillemot F. Cepko C.L. Development. 1992; 114: 743-754PubMed Google Scholar). FGF2 promotes the survival of neurons of the peripheral (14.Eckenstein F.P. Esch F. Holbert T. Blacher R.W. Nishi R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 623-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and central nervous systems (15.Hatten M.E. Lynch M. Rydel R.E. Sanchez J. Joseph-Silverstein J. Moscatelli D.

Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2618-2627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and delays photoreceptor degeneration in a retinal degeneration model(17.Faktorovitch E.G. Steinberg R.H. Yasumura D. Matthes M.T. Lavail M.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 18.La Vail M.M. Unoki K. Yasumura D. Matthes M.T. Yancopoulos G.D. Steinberg R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11249-11253Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar).These FGF activities in in vitro systems together with the temporal and spatial expression patterns of FGF in embryonic and adult neuronal tissues suggested that the FGF expressed by neuronal cells could be involved in the mediation of their neurotrophic activity. To investigate whether the expression of FGF1 by neuronal cells was implicated in the differentiation and neuronal survival, we have used PC12 cells as an in vitro model. This cell line was derived from a rat adrenal tumor (24.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) and responded to NGF and FGF by the extension of neurites and the acquisition of sympathetic neuronal phenotype. The transition of chromaffin phenotype to neuronal phenotype by NGF and FGF is accompanied by events mediated by the activation of high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors and the activation of the MAP kinase cascade. This is a main signaling pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation and appears to mediate differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF and FGF2 (25.Tsao H. Aletta J.M. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15471-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that PC12 cells expressed both FGF1 and FGF2. These cells were treated with different stimuli: FGF1-heparin, FGF2, and NGF (promotors of differentiation) or Lys-132-mutated FGF1 (FGF1K132E) and FGF1 alone (which do not promote differentiation). The expression of FGF1 at the transcript and protein level in parallel with the activation of the MAP kinase cascade was investigated in stimulated cells as a function of neuronal differentiation. The effect of FGF1 expression on neuronal differentiation was also examined in transfected cells in which FGF1 expression was under the control of a constitutive or dexamethasone-inducible promotor.We show that the expression of FGF1 was activated only by exogenous FGF stimuli (FGF2 and FGF1-heparin) which are neurotrophic for PC12 cells and was unchanged when cells remained undifferentiated upon treatment with FGF1 alone or mutated FGF1K132E. In contrast, the MAP kinase cascade was similarly activated in stimulated cells whether or not they differentiated in sympathetic neurons. Accordingly, in transfected cells the expression of FGF1 strictly correlated with the differentiated phenotype and increased the survival of PC12 cells. We thus propose that the activation of the MAP kinase cascade is insufficient to induce the differentiation and survival of PC12 cells, and that the expression of FGF1 stimulated by exogenous FGF stimuli is a key element in the neurotrophic activities of the FGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman recombinant FGF1 was produced and purified in our laboratory (INSERM XR118). FGF1K132E was from one of our laboratories (G. G.-G.). In the mutant FGF1, the lysine 132 was mutated to glutamic acid, and this mutation decreased the affinity of FGF1 to heparin(29.Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Human recombinant FGF2 was a kind gift from Farmitalia, Carlo Erba. The recombinant expression vector (pSVL-FGF1-134) was obtained from Dr. Jaye (Rhone-Poulenc-Rohrer)(30.Jaye M. Lyall R.M. Mudd R. Schlessinger J. Sarver N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The FGF2-saporin, a cytotoxic fusion protein, was a gift from by Drs. Lappi and Baird (Whitter Institut, San Diego).Cell CulturesStock cultures of rat PC12 cells (originally obtained from P. Brachet, Angers) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and antibiotics at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, air. Culture media were renewed every 3 days. PC12 cells transfected with pSVL-FGF1-134 were maintained as described for the control PC12 cells. PC12 cells transfected with pLK-FGF1-134 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum which were both depleted in glucocorticoid by fixation onto 1% Norit-A and 0.1% dextran T70. FGF1 expression was induced by 5 × 10−7M dexamethasone.FGF1 Eukaryotic Expression Vectors and PC12 Cell TransfectionThe FGF1 expression vector (pSVL-FGF1-134) codes for 134 amino acids of the human FGF1 and is under the control of the early promotor from the simian virus 40(30.Jaye M. Lyall R.M. Mudd R. Schlessinger J. Sarver N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The coding region of pSVL-FGF1-134 was subcloned into a glucocorticoid-responsive vector (pLK), which contained a variant murine mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promotor and the neomycin resistance gene(31.Wellinger R.J. Garcia M. Vessaz A. Diggelman H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was named plK-FGF1-134. PC12 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of FGF1 recombinant pSVL plasmid DNA and 1 μg of pSVL2-neomycin plasmid DNA (ratio 1 to 10) or with the FGF1-inducible expression vector pLK-FGF1-134 with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the method previously described by Muller et al.(32.Muller S.R. Sullivan P.D. Clegg D.O. Feinstein S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the different plasmid DNA used for transfection were purified twice onto a cesium chloride gradient. The transfection medium containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA (9 μg of pSVL-FGF-134 and 1 μg of pSVL2-neomycin or 10 μg of pLK-FGF1-134), 60 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 2 ml of serum-free DMEM was incubated 20 min at room temperature, then diluted with DMEM to a final volume of 6 ml and added to PC12 cells, plated the day before at the density of 105 cells per 100-mm diameter Petri dishes. The transfection process occurred at 37°C for 4 h, then 6 ml of DMEM containing 20% FCS and 10% horse serum were added to the cells. Two days later, the cells were trypsinized and replated in four Petri dishes in selection medium (0.5 mg/ml geneticin in culture medium). The selection of the stably transfected clones was performed for 15 days, and the geneticin-resistant colonies were picked and allowed to grow.Neurite Outgrowth AssayPC12 cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/ml. After cell attachment (18 h), the cells were treated for 4 days with FGF2 (10 ng/ml), FGF1 (100 ng/ml), or FGF1K132E (100 ng/ml or 5 μg/ml). In some experiments heparin (10 μg/ml) was added when cells were treated with FGF1 or with FGF1K132E. The media and the growth factors were renewed every 2 days. The morphology of the PC12 cells stimulated by exogenous factors and of the transfected cells was examined after 3-4 days of culture.Cell Survival AssayPC12 cells and constitutive transfected cells were washed three times with PBS, dissociated in PBS, 10 mM EDTA, and plated in a 24-multiwell plate at a density of 5 × 104cells/ml in serum-free medium. At the indicated times, trypan blue exclusion tests were performed.RT-PCR AssayRNA preparations and RT-PCR assay were performed as described previously by Renaud et al.(33.Renaud F. Oliver L. Desset S. Tassin J. Romquin N. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the guanidium isothiocyanate method(34.Chirginn J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar). One μg of RNA and 170 pg of tobacco leaf nitrate reductase transcripts were reverse transcribed in 30 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 3 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 2.5 μM random hexanucleotide primers, 300 units of Maloney murine leukemia virus (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1/10 of the reverse transcripts were amplified in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 7 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 15 mM ammonium sulfate, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM of dNTP mix, 15 pmol of each specific primer with 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Eurobio) as described previously(33.Renaud F. Oliver L. Desset S. Tassin J. Romquin N. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a preliminary experiment, the level of FGF1 or FGF2 in PC12 cells was tested by RT-PCR after 20-40 cycles of amplification, and we determined that the linear exponential FGF1/FGF2 amplification phase is comprised between 26 and 33 cycles (data not shown). However, some small RT-PCR efficiency differences between each experiment occurred. Thus, to ensure that the amplification was in the exponential phase, for each experiment aliquots were withdrawn at three different cycles and analyzed. For FGF1 and FGF2 amplification, the oligomers were chosen in different coding exons to avoid amplification of genomic DNA. Specific oligomers were used for rat (rFGF1S, rFGF1AS) and human (hFGF1S, hFGF1AS) FGF1 amplification: rFGF1AS (5′-AAG CCC GTC GGT GTC CAT GG-3′) and rFGF1S (5′-GAT GGC ACA GTG GAT GGG AC-3′) generated a 135-bp fragment; hFGF1AS (5′-TCC GAG GAC CGC GTT TGC AG 3-′) and hFGF1S (5′-GAT CCT TCC GGA TGG CAC AG-3′) generated a 295-bp fragment. The two FGF2 oligomers (antisense primer 5′-CCC AGT TCG TTT CAG TGC CAC C-3′, sense primer 5′-CAT TCA AAG GAG TGT GTG CAA ACC-3′) generated a 174-bp fragment, the two NGF oligomers (antisense primer 5′-CTC CAA CCC ACA CAC TGA CA-3′, sense primer 5′-TCT GTC CCT GAA GCC CAC TG-3′) generated a 342-bp fragment, and the nitrate reductase-specific oligomers (antisense primer 5′-GCT GGA TCC ATT GCA AAT TCC-3′, sense primer 5′-AGG AGC TGA TGT GTT GCC CGG-3′) generated a 75-bp fragment. The FGF1 or FGF2 or NGF and nitrate reductase-amplified products were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto Hybond N+, and hybridized with specific FGF1, FGF2, NGF, and NR probes. X-Omat AR5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) was exposed for different periods, depending on the intensity of the signal.FGF1 Expression Analysis by Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) and Western BlotNative PC12 cells, FGF1-treated PC12 cells, and FGF1-transfected PC12 cells were lysed in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 2 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). The lysates were used to assay FGF1 by EIA and Western blot. Cell lysate proteins (1 mg) were incubated with 100 μl of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in PBS, 0.6 M NaCl. After one night of absorption at 4°C, the heparin-Sepharose was washed twice with the binding buffer, and the heparin-binding proteins were eluted in PBS, 2 M NaCl. The FGF1 was quantified using a second antibody solid phase EIA as described previously by Oliver et al.(35.Oliver L. Raulais D. Vigny M. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For Western blotting analysis, 50-150 μg of lysate protein from inducible and constitutive transfected cells and from control PC12 cells were incubated with 30 μl of heparin-Sepharose in 0.6 M NaCl as for EIA. Heparin-binding proteins were eluted in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran BA-S 83, Schleicher & Schuell), the proteins bound to heparin were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with rabbit polyclonal FGF1 antibody (diluted 1:500) in 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing O.1% milk protein. The FGF1 antibody, directed against human recombinant FGF1, has been produced in our laboratory, and its specificity has been previously described(35.Oliver L. Raulais D. Vigny M. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The filter was washed three times in the aforementioned buffer, incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG from donkey (diluted 1:400; Amersham Corp.), then with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase congugate (diluted 1:400; Amersham Corp.), and finally demonstrated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.ERK1 or MAPKK AssayNative PC12 cells or constitutive transfected PC12 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml. After 2-3 days of culture in complete medium, cells were incubated overnight in 0.25% fetal calf serum and 0.2% bovine serum albumin prior to stimulation and incubated for specified times with growth factors. The cells were lysed in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The solubilized cell extracts were incubated for 2 h with antibodies to ERK1 (diluted 1:50) or MAPKK (diluted 1:50) preabsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads in HNT buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, O.1% Triton X-100). Anti-ERK1 is a rabbit antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide from the carboxyl-terminal tail of the MAP kinase ERK1 (36.Scimeca J.C. Ballotti R. Nguyen T.T. Filoux C. Van Obberghen E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 913-919Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the anti-MAPKK is directed against the 17-amino acid amino terminus (37.Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1 activity was measured as the ability of immunopurified ERK1 to stimulate myelin basic protein phosphorylation, MAPKK activity was measured in a reconstitution assay as the ability of immunopurified MAPKK to activate added recombinant rat ERK1. Both assays were performed as described previously by Frodin et al.(37.Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ERK1 and MAPKK Expression Analysis by Western BlotPC12 cells and constitutive transfected cells were lyzed in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. 330 μg of cellular protein were electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred to nylon membranes, and immunoprobed for ERK1 and MAPKK (both antibodies were diluted 1:2000).

When treated with FGF1 and heparin, PC12 cells extend neurites and increase their steady state levels of FGF1 (Fig. 1B) and FGF2 (Fig. 1D) mRNAs. The level of FGF1 transcripts remained constant during the first hours of treatment when no neuritic extensions are observed and increased progressively from day 1 to 5 with the same time course as the neuritic extension process (Fig. 1E). Short extensions appeared after 1 day of treatment and increased greatly in size from day 3 to 5. In contrast, the amount of FGF1 transcripts was similar in proliferating and confluent control cells cultured for 1, 3, and 5 days without FGF (Fig. 1C).Neuritic Extensions in PC12 Cells Treated with FGF1, Mutated FGF1, FGF2, and NGFCells were treated in DMEM in the presence (Fig. 2) or absence of serum (data not shown), with FGF1 (100 ng/ml), FGF1K132E (5 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of heparin (10 μg/ml), FGF2 (10 ng/ml), and NGF (50 ng/ml). After 4 days of treatment, cells extended neurites only when exposed to FGF1 and heparin (Fig. 2, 3), to FGF2 (Fig. 2, 4), or to NGF (2, 5). PC12 cells remained undifferentiated when treated with FGF1 alone (Fig. 2, 2) or with FGF1K132E (Fig. 2, 7) even in the presence (Fig. 2, 6) of heparin. This mutated FGF1, known to have a lower affinity for heparin, binds to the FGFRs but has no mitogenic activity (29.Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J.

The dependence of FGF1 on heparin for its neurotrophic activity allowed us to discriminate between the neurotrophic activity of this growth factor and its other properties.Figure 2:Effects of FGF2, FGF1, and FGF1K132E on neuritic extension in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml FGF1 (2), 100 ng/ml FGF1 plus 10 μg/ml heparin (3), 10 ng/ml FGF2 (4), 50 ng/ml NGF (5), 5 μg/ml FGF1K132E plus 10 μg/ml heparin (6), 5 μg/ml FGF1K132E (7), or 10 μg/ml heparin (8).

NGF (50 ng/ml)-treated cells were introduced as a control of differentiated cells. An increase in FGF1 transcripts was only observed in FGF differentiated cells. After 3 days of treatment with FGF1 and heparin (lane 3) or FGF2 (lane 4), the steady state level of FGF1 transcripts in differentiated cells increased 5.7 and 3.5 times, but remained unchanged when differentiation was induced by NGF (lane 5). Cells treated with FGF1 alone (lane 2), or FGF1K132E and heparin (lane 6) remained undifferentiated and expressed the same level of FGF1 transcripts as control cells (lane 1). These data strongly suggested that an up-regulation of FGF1 gene expression was implicated in the differentiation of PC12 cells. To test this hypothesis the effect of overexpression of FGF1 was analyzed by transfecting PC12 cells with plasmid constructs leading to constitutive overexpression of FGF1.Figure 3:Analysis by RT-PCR of FGF1 transcripts in differentiated and undifferentiated PC12 cells. Total RNA was extracted from PC12 cells after 3 days of treatment with 100 ng/ml FGF1, in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of heparin (10 μg/ml), with 10 ng/ml of FGF2 (lane 4), with 100 ng/ml of NGF (lane 5) or with 100 ng/ml FGF1K132E plus heparin (10 μg/ml) (lane 6). Untreated cells cultured for 3 days were used as control (lane 1). One μg of each RNA preparation was assayed along with nitrate reductase transcripts to RT-PCR as in Fig. 1A.

However, when choline deficiency is prolonged, the growth rate of CD rats is similar to that of control rats fed a choline-supplemented diet. Furthermore, CD rats maintain their levels of choline-containing lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. The mechanism for this compensation in CD rats was investigated. We screened the major tissues for the activities of two important enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). Only the livers of CD rats had higher specific enzyme activities of PEMT and CT than control animals. The amount of PEMT2, one of two PEMTs in liver, increased 5-fold in CD rats after 6 weeks on the CD diet. A similar increase in the level of PEMT2 mRNA suggested that this activation was due to enhanced expression of the PEMT2 gene in CD livers. The labeling of phosphatidycholine in isolated hepatocytes from CD rats was consistent with the conversion of PE to PC being increased as a result of a higher expression of liver PEMT. We conclude that activation of PE methylation at the level of gene expression may be the mechanism by which CD rats compensate for the lack of dietary choline.

Cardiac myocyte cell hypertrophy has been used as an in vitro model for studying cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac myocytes respond to hemodynamic overload by altering the expression of specific set of genes, which are needed for hypertrophy. Our laboratory has been studying the molecular basis of myocardial hypertrophy using spontaneously hypertensive rat as an animal model(1.Sen S. Kundu G. Mekhail N. Castel J. Misono K. Healy B. J.

Adhikary G. Sen S. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar) ( 1N. Sivasubramanian, P. Sil, G. Adhikary, and S. Sen, manuscript in preparation.) and found that the cardiac myotrophin is identical to a previously reported rat brain v1 protein (7.Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T.

In addition, we have expressed the myotrophin protein in Escherichia coli and showed that the recombinant myotrophin has the ability to stimulate protein synthesis in neonatal cardiac myocytes (4.Sivasubramanian N.

Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar).1 In the present study, analyzed the expression of myotrophin in various tissues, identified new structural and functional domains, and, using the recombinant myotrophin, determined one of the key activities of myotrophin. RNA transcripts specific for myotrophin were analyzed in various rat tissues. Total RNA was first isolated from 9-day-old rat hearts. Poly(A)-enriched RNA was isolated using the oligo(dT) method. Briefly, total RNA was applied to an oligo(dT)-cellulose (Collaborative Research type III) column at high salt conditions (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl). After washing the column with high-salt buffer, poly(A) RNA was eluted with no-salt (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) buffer. The poly(A) RNA eluted by this method was fractionated on 1% agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred to a ZetaProbe membrane, and hybridized with radiolabeled probe. Random-Primer labeling method was used to generate radiolabeled myotrophin cDNA probe using pCRII-8-Myo cDNA clone (4.Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sen S. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar).1 Utilizing the same clone, single-stranded myotrophin-specific radiolabeled RNA probe was made using T7 RNA polymerase-directed in vitro transcription system. The hybridization experiment was done using very high stringency and wash conditions for both the myotrophin cDNA (42°C, 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and RNA (50°C, 1.5 × SSPE, 1% SDS, 0.5% BLOTTO, 50% formamide, tRNA (0.2 mg/ml), and salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/ml)) probes. Approximately 5 μg of pure poly(A) RNA (lane a in Fig. 1B) and 2 μg of “low salt wash RNA” (lane b in Fig. 1 B) from 9-day-old WKY rat hearts was fractionated on the agarose gel. High stringency hybridization and wash conditions described above were used to analyze this Northern blot; experiments were repeated several times with different batches of RNA, and the results were reproducible. The multiple tissue Northern blot containing pure poly(A) RNA from various rat tissues was obtained from Clonetech (no. 7764-1) Approximately 2 μg of pure poly(A) from each tissue was fractionated on the agarose gel according to Clonetech. The high stringency hybridization and wash conditions recommended by Clonetech were used to analyze this multiple tissue Northern blot and is described above. Poly(A) RNA isolated from various rat tissues in our laboratory also revealed the same results (data not shown). Myotrophin was expressed in E. coli using the T7 promoter-based vector, pET3a (Novagen Inc.)(4.Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sen S. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar).1 The myotrophin recombinant pET3a-51 vector was introduced into BL21(DE3) LysS strain, which harbors a T7 RNA polymerase coding gene. The recombinant myotrophin was expressed by growing the E. coli cells to early log phase and was later induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 16 h. Overnight induced cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mM NaCl by freeze thawing three times. The lysed E. coli cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the soluble supernatant was used to purify the recombinant myotrophin. The soluble form of recombinant myotrophin was highly abundant in the supernatant and was separated from the rest of the E. coli proteins using a Centriprep-30 (30-kDa cutoff) Amicon cartridge. Later, the purified recombinant myotrophin was concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (10-kDa cutoff) cartridge. On a 12% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, ( 2The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase(s)EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.) the purified recombinant myotrophin migrated as a single band at the 12-kDa region. Protein concentration was estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and appropriate quantities of recombinant myotrophin were used in gel shift assays. The recombinant myotrophin was further tested for its immunoreactivity using native myotrophin-specific antibodies(5.Sil P. Mukherjee D.P. Sen S. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Native myotrophin-specific antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide containing the 17 amino acid residues of the T26 tryptic peptide of native myotrophin(5.Sil P. Mukherjee D.P. Sen S.

McTiernan C.F. Sen S. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were used in the gel shift assays. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in 12 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mM Tris•Cl (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI•dC) and 10% glycerol in a final volume of 15 μl. The reactions contained 10 μg of Jurkat cell nuclear extract, varying amounts (1-3 μl, containing 200 ng/μl) of bacterially expressed recombinant myotrophin, and 10,000 cpm of end-labeled NF-κB or Oct-1 binding site probe. After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the reactions were run on a 4% PAGE using 0.25 × TBE as the gel buffer and 1 × TBE as the running buffer. The gel was electrophoresed at 160 volts for 2 h. Later, the gel was dried and autoradiographed overnight at −70°C. Purified myotrophin-specific antibodies (IgG) ((5.Sil P. Mukherjee D.P. Sen S. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) and preimmune antibodies (IgG) were preincubated with myotrophin for 1 hour in ice before the binding reactions were carried out. A multiple tissue Northern blot containing poly(A) RNA from various tissues of rat was obtained from Clonetech. Myotrophin-specific double-stranded cDNA probe was used to identify myotrophin-specific transcripts. The blot was hybridized and washed at very high stringency conditions. The results of the experiment are shown in Fig. 1A. In total, at least five myotrophin-specific transcripts were detected in these tissues. Among them, two high molecular weight transcripts (4.3 and 3.5 kb) were detected in almost all tissues. These transcripts were most abundant in brain and least in skeletal muscle compared to other tissues. In addition, three transcripts of 2.4, 1.8, and 1.0 kb in size were also detected in some tissues, although at different levels. These were detected more abundantly in certain tissues like testis and liver compared to other tissues. Based on its ubiquitous distribution, it appears that the myotrophin protein may be playing a very important role in the basic functions of various tissues. We have recently obtained several myotrophin cDNA clones through direct screening of a rat heart 5′-stretch cDNA library (Clonetech), and the preliminary characterization reveals that the size of the clone inserts correspond to the sizes of these multiple transcripts. Based on the initial nucleotide sequence data from few cDNA clones as well as data from rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reactions (4.Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sen S. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar), 1 it appears that the heterogeneity in the length of 3′-untranslated regions contributes to the observed heterogeneity in the multiple transcripts. The observation of multiple types of cDNA clones with different 3′-untranslated regions(4.Sivasubramanian N. Adhikary G. Sen S. Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 637Google Scholar, 8.Taoka M. Isobe T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 1 supports the present observation of multiple transcripts in the northern hybridization experiment. Southern analysis of rat genomic DNA also suggests that myotrophin is coded by a single copy gene as revealed by our observation of a single 4.3-kilobase pair HindIII genomic DNA fragment hybridizing to the myotrophin coding region probe, ( 3G. Adhikary, unpublished observations.) and hence these multiple transcripts arise from the single copy myotrophin gene. Similar types of multiple transcripts have been observed for other genes like opsin in mouse, rat, human, and frog(20.Al-Ubaidi M.R. Pittler S.J. Champagne M.S. Triantafyllos J.T. McGinnis J.F. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20563-20569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of myotrophin gene specifically in rat hearts was analyzed in more detail using Northern blot analysis. Using the coding region of myotrophin gene, both double-stranded DNA probe (lane a in Fig. 1B) as well as single-stranded antisense RNA probe (lane b in Fig. 1B) was used (see “Experimental Procedures”) in different Northern blot experiments. Very high stringency hybridization and wash conditions were followed for this experiment. Initially, only the 4.3- and 3.5-kb transcripts were detected when pure poly(A) RNA was used (lane a in Fig. 1B). Since low molecular weight myotrophin transcripts were not detected significantly in this poly(A) RNA, we included a low-salt wash step in our oligo(dT) purification procedure (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl) before eluting the poly(A) RNA with no-salt buffer. The RNA from this low salt wash fraction was ethanol precipitated and analyzed for myotrophin-specific transcripts. Interestingly, the majority of the myotrophin-specific low molecular weight transcripts (2.4, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.4 kb) were observed mostly in the low salt-eluted RNA when compared to pure poly(A) RNA (lane b in Fig. 1B). It is possible that poly(A) tracts in these transcripts may be either shorter in length or totally devoid of and thus eluted in the low-salt buffer. The observation of several myotrophin-specific transcripts in the low salt wash RNA fraction also suggests that either these are degraded products of the myotrophin mRNAs after translation or translationally silenced mRNAs ready to be translated upon receiving the physiological signal(21.Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 22.Huarte J. Stutz A. O'Connell M.L. Gubler P. Belin D. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Vassalli J.D.

The primary structure of the myotrophin protein was analyzed thoroughly to locate any structural domains that would have any specific functions. For this purpose, two analyses were conducted. Initially, using the MacPattern (version 3.2) software and Prosite data base, the myotrophin amino acid sequence was analyzed to locate any possible functional domains. This analysis revealed two putative consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (TVK) and casein kinase II (TALE) (Fig. 2A). These putative domains were not reported earlier for V1 protein from rat brain(7.Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second analysis, the individual ankyrin repeats as well as segments of myotrophin amino acid sequence were compared against the entire GenBank/EMBL protein data base using BLASTP program(6.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed new information about the structural features of myotrophin protein. First, an additional half ankyrin repeat spanning from residues 92-107 was identified, which was not reported previously(7.Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8.Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During this analysis, a significant homology was also observed between the ankyrin repeat 2 (residues 27-58) of myotrophin and the ankyrin repeats of IκBα proteins (9-12) (Fig. 2B). The ankyrin repeats of myotrophin span from amino acid residues 9 to 107 (Fig. 2A). Myotrophin possesses two full-length ankyrin repeats (repeat 2, 27-58 and repeat 3, 59-91) and two incomplete (half) repeats (repeat 1, 9-26 and repeat 4, 92-107). One incomplete repeat (9-26) is a carboxyl half of a typical ankyrin repeat, and the other (92-107) is an amino half (Fig. 2A). Ankyrin repeats are generally 33 amino acids in length and possess two regions: one region is highly conserved and the other is highly variable. A typical ankyrin repeat sequence is shown below, where X indicates a highly variable region compared with the rest of the conserved region: XGXTPLHXAXXLLXXGADXXXDX. Since the ankyrin repeats are found in various classes of proteins (cytoplasmic, nuclear, and cell surface), Hatada et al.(13.Hatada E.N. Nieters A. Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Meyer R. Nucifora G. McKeithan T.W. Scheidereit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2489-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have attempted to classify these ankyrin repeats. Based on the sequence homology in the variable region of these ankyrin repeats, Hatada et al.(13.Hatada E.N. Nieters A. Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Meyer R. Nucifora G. McKeithan T.W. Scheidereit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The BLASTP analysis of myotrophin revealed a significant homology between the ankyrin repeat 2 (residues 27-58) of myotrophin and two ankyrin repeats of IκBα proteins (Fig. 2B). The myotrophin ankyrin repeat 2, in addition to the homology in the core consensus sequence, possesses homologous residues in the variable region similar to the IκBα ankyrin repeat (Fig. 2B). Since the ankyrin repeats are considered as modular protein-interacting domains with sub-regions of these repeats conferring unique specificity, the observed homology between myotrophin ankyrin repeat 2 and the two ankyrin repeats of IκBα proteins (9-13) is considered very significant (Fig. 2B). It is well known that the IκB proteins interact with NF-κB/rel factors through its ankyrin repeats (15-19). Specifically, it has been shown that IκBα ankyrin repeats bind to rel domains of NF-κB subunits (p50 and p65). In addition to the ankyrin repeats, putative consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II, which were observed in IκBα proteins (9-12), were also observed in myotrophin (Fig. 2A). However, myotrophin is only a 12-kilodalton protein with fewer ankyrin repeats than other known IκBα proteins. The observation of IκBα homologous ankyrin repeats and putative consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II in myotrophin suggested that myotrophin may be a unique IκB-related protein. Because of the above structural observations, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with Jurkat T cell nuclear extract proteins to identify whether the NF-κB/rel is a target for myotrophin binding. The results are shown in Fig. 3A. Interestingly, we observed that with increasing concentrations of myotrophin, ternary complexes are formed between myotrophin and NF-κB/rel. Two types of ternary complexes (lanes 5-7 in Fig. 3A) were demonstrated by PAGE. The slower migrating (SC) complexes appear to be heterotrimeric (myo-NF-κB/rel), and the faster migrating (FC) complexes appear to be devoid of one of the subunits of the NF-κB/rel complex (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the preimmune serum IgG (lane 9 in Fig. 3A) did not prevent this binding, whereas the myotrophin-specific IgG (lane 8 in Fig. 3A) inhibited specifically the formation of these ternary complexes. However, myotrophin by itself did not bind to κB DNA substrate probe (lane 4 in Fig. 3A). Unlike other known IκB proteins, myotrophin did not inhibit the DNA binding activity of the NF-κB complex; instead, it formed ternary complexes. These results were also confirmed by preliminary EMSAs with cardiac myocyte nuclear extracts (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of myotrophin interaction with the NF-κB/rel complex, Oct-1 EMSAs (14.Bhargava A.K. Li Z. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10260-10264Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were also carried out using the same Jurkat T cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3B). With the same increasing concentrations of myotrophin, myotrophin (lanes 2-4 in Fig. 3B) did not affect any of the Oct-1•DNA complexes at all. These results clearly show that the specific target for myotrophin is the subunits of the NF-κB/rel complex. To further confirm the myotrophin interaction with NF-κB/rel factors, EMSAs were performed in presence of p50 and p65 antibodies. The results are shown in Fig. 4. When incubated with either p50 (lane 6) or p65 (lane 4) antibodies, the myotrophin-shifted κB complexes were supershifted to slower migrating ternary complexes (SSC-50 and SSC-65 in Fig. 4), and the intensity of these complexes increased when more myotrophin was present in the reaction. These results clearly show that myotrophin-shifted protein complexes actually contain NF-κB/rel factors. It should also be noted that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced Jurkat T cells probably contain a sufficient amount of endogenous myotrophin since myotrophin-shifted κB complexes were also detected at a lower level in the control experiments (lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 4). In the present study, we have shown that the myotrophin gene is expressed in various rat tissues and as much as seven myotrophin-specific transcripts have been detected in rat heart and in other tissues. These transcripts were most abundant in brain and least in skeletal muscle compared to other tissues. Based on its ubiquitous distribution, it appears that the myotrophin protein may be playing a very important role in the basic functions of various tissues. Our analysis on the primary structure of the myotrophin protein also revealed the homology between one of the ankyrin repeats of myotrophin and to those of IκBα/rel ankyrin repeats. Furthermore, our analysis showed putative consensus phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II in myotrophin protein, which were also observed in IκBα proteins. The significance of these homologies were experimentally confirmed with κB gel shift assays. The results of these gel shift assays clearly show that the recombinant myotrophin has the ability to interact with NF-κB/rel proteins in vitro. In vivo experiments are currently being conducted to further confirm these results. Thus, these results clearly indicate that the 12-kDa myotrophin protein is a unique rel/NF-κB interacting protein. It has been very well documented that upon exposure to a variety of external stimuli, NF-κB/rel proteins are involved in the rapid induction of genes whose products play a central role in the immune responses, inflammation, and cell proliferation(15.Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem.

The most obvious characteristic of NF-κB is its rapid translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus in response to extracellular signals. They are kept dormant in the cytoplasm by the members of the IκB family of proteins. Many signals inactivate the inhibitor IκB, thereby allowing the NF-κB to enter nuclei and rapidly induce coordinate sets of defense-related genes. It is possible that upon exposure to chronic hemodynamic overload signals, cardiac myocytes respond through their NF-κB rapid response system to alter myocardial gene expression. In the present preliminary study, we have shown by its ability to interact with NF-κB in vitro that myotrophin is probably a component of such a rapid response system, which might influence the transcription of hypertrophy-specific genes. Based on the present study, we speculate that myotrophin is probably involved in regulating the expression of hypertrophy-specific genes in the myocardium through rel factors and κB DNA sites. It should be noted that no transcription regulatory factor has been reported so far to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Further studies are in progress to determine the exact mechanism of action of myotrophin. -We thank Vijaya Kandaswamy and David Young for technical help during this project."
https://openalex.org/W2074424881,"A novel member of the ubiquitin carrier protein family, designated E2EPF, has been cloned by our laboratory and expressed in a bacterial system in an active form. Ubiquitin carrier proteins, or E2s, catalyze one step in a multistep process that leads to the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins. In this paper, we show that recombinant E2EPF catalyzes auto/multiubiquitination, the conjugation of multiple ubiquitin molecules to itself. Multiubiquitination has been shown previously to be required for targeting of a substrate protein for rapid degradation. Using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, E2EPF was shown to support the degradation of a model substrate in an ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent fashion. In contrast to a previous study which showed that selective protein degradation in one system is dependent upon multiubiquitination via the lysine 48 residue of ubiquitin, multiubiquitination, and proteolytic targeting by E2EPF was shown here to be independent of the lysine 48 multiubiquitin linkage. This functional characterization of E2EPF revealed a combination of features that distinguishes this enzyme from all previously characterized members of the ubiquitin carrier protein family. These results also suggest several possible autoregulatory models for E2EPF involving auto- and multiubiquitination.

These results also suggest several possible autoregulatory models for E2EPF involving auto- and multiubiquitination. Ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide, is present in all eukaryotic cells either in a free state or covalently conjugated to various cellular proteins(1.Hershko J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1990; 15: 195-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ub-protein conjugates are formed through an isopeptide linkage between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and ε-amino groups of substrate proteins (3.Ciechanover A. Heller H. Elias S.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 173-206Crossref Google Scholar) and have been localized to various cellular compartments including the cytosol(6.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin conjugation has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions. The best understood of these is the targeting of the substrate protein for selective degradation via a nonlysosomal pathway(9.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates involves a three-step process(15.Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A.

In the second step, ubiquitin is transferred to the active site cysteine residue of a ubiquitin carrier protein (or E2). In the last step, an isopeptide bond is formed between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and a lysyl ε-amino group within a substrate protein, a reaction catalyzed either directly by the E2 enzyme or via a third enzyme designated isopeptide ligase (E3). Enzymes designated ubiquitin isopeptidases have also been described which deubiquitinate conjugates(18.Wilkinson K.D. Lee K. Deshpande S. Duerksen-Hughes P. Boss J.M. Pohl J. Science. 1989; 246: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), consistent with evidence for the dynamic balance governing ubiquitin adduct pools(5.Haas A.L. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin.

E2s exist as a family of isozymes that exhibit variability in terms of molecular weight, physiological function, substrate specificity, and dependence on E3 in in vitro systems(2.Jentsch S.

For example, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eight genes (designated UBC1-8) encoding distinct E2s have been described(2.Jentsch S. Seufert W. Sommer T. Reins H. Trends Biochem.

Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). CDC34 (UBC3) is an E2 of 24 kDa that is essential for G1/S transition during mitosis(11.Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The basic structure of E2s consists of a 153-amino acid core domain containing an active site cysteine within a highly conserved random coil segment. Additional carboxyl-terminal extension domains present on many isozymes are often acidic and generally show a high degree of sequence divergence, suggesting that they may play a role in substrate specificity during E3-independent conjugation or may contribute to the specificity of binding to cognate E3 isoforms. A subset of E2s has been shown to support multiubiquitination, a process in which successive ubiquitin molecules are linked by an isopeptide bond between a side chain amino group of one ubiquitin and the terminal carboxyl group of a second ubiquitin molecule. In vitro studies have demonstrated that E3-independent multiubiquitination by several E2 isozymes is sufficient for degradative targeting by the 26 S multicatalytic protease complex(22.Haas A.L. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, polyubiquitination refers to the conjugation of multiple ubiquitin molecules directly to different lysine residues within a single substrate molecule. Studies show that RAD6, CDC34, and the rabbit reticulocyte E232K catalyze E3-indepedent multiubiquitination and support E3-dependent ubiquitin conjugation; however, these enzymes differ in their linkage specificity for multiubiquitination, with CDC34 and E232K using Lys-48 (20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RAD6 utilizing Lys-6(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol.

Multiubiquitination via lysine 48 of ubiquitin has also been demonstrated in the E220K of wheat germ (23.Nocker S.V. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10297-10301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and E225K from calf thymus(24.Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of branched, multiubiquitin adducts have been shown to be involved in targeting of the substrate protein for selective degradation by an ATP-dependent protease complex(25.Mattews W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8354-8357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that proteolytic targeting can be inhibited by preventing multiubiquitination via the lysine 48 residue of ubiquitin. A novel member of the E2 protein family, E2EPF, has recently been cloned from human keratinocytes(28.Liu Z. Diaz L.A. Haas A.L. Giudice G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15829-15835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E2EPF is unique among E2s in that it contains a highly basic carboxyl-terminal extension domain. The E2EPF transcript was also shown to encode an antigenic polypeptide recognized by autoantibodies from pemphigus foliaceus patients. E2EPF is therefore the first member of the E2 enzyme family to be implicated in a disease process. The present paper reports the detailed enzymatic characterization of recombinant E2EPF, revealing a set of functional properties that distinguishes this isozyme from all other characterized E2s. E2EPF is shown to exhibit auto- and multiubiquitination activities. We further show that this E2 supports the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway in the absence of Lys-48 multiubiquitination. The latter observation indicates that multiubiquitination by linkage other than Lys-48 are competent degradative intermediates, supporting a role for subpopulations of ubiquitin having different linkage specificities within the overall pathway of ATP, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. Ubiquitin, rcmBSA (reduced, carboxymethylated form of BSA), UbK48R (site-directed mutant of Ub in which the lysine residue at position 48 has been replaced by arginine), and rmUb (reductively methylated form of ubiquitin in which all free amino groups are blocked by methyl groups) were prepared as described previously(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte E1 and E214K were purified to homogeneity by a combination of affinity and high performance chromatography and then quantitated by stoichiometric activity assays(29.Haas A.L.

All other proteins and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. The removal of endogenous ubiquitin, E1, and various E2 isozymes from rabbit reticulocyte lysate was accomplished using previously described procedures(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol.

The resulting unadsorbed fraction from the ubiquitin affinity column (depleted fraction II) was determined to be quantitatively depleted of ubiquitin, E1, and E2 isozymes by its inability to support 125I-ubiquitin conjugation without supplementation by exogenous E1 and E214K and inability to support 125I-rcmBSA degradation without further addition of ubiquitin. Cloned E2EPF was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α harboring the pGEXEPF5-ORF2B expression construct(28.Liu Z. Diaz L.A. Haas A.L. Giudice G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15829-15835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the culture reached A600 of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. After an additional 3-h incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.04 volume of solution TD (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM DTT). The cells were lysed by passing the suspension twice through a French press at 1000 p.s.i. The cell lysate containing the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-E2EPF fusion protein was clarified by centrifugation at 105× g for 60 min at 4°C. The fusion protein was purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (31.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Ten ml of the clarified cell extract was mixed with 10 ml of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose (Sigma) suspension (in solution TD) in a 50-ml capped tube and rocked at 4°C for 30 min. The agarose beads were washed 5 times with 30 ml of solution TD. The washed beads were then poured into a column and washed again with 5 bed volumes of solution TD. The bound fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM glutathione (Sigma) in solution TD. The capacity of the glutathione-agarose affinity column was calculated to be approximately 1 mg of fusion protein per mg of the glutathione-agarose matrix under the conditions described. Isolation of E2EPF (cDNA-encoded polypeptide without the amino-terminal GST moiety) was accomplished as follows. The immobilized fusion protein was incubated with a highly purified preparation of thrombin (4000 NIH units/mg of protein; Sigma) at a concentration of 30 NIH units/ml in TD buffer resulting in elution of the E2EPF while the GST moiety of the fusion protein remained bound to the column. Optimal digestion conditions were 1 unit of thrombin per 5 μg of fusion protein at 25°C for 1-2 h. Longer incubations resulted in partial degradation of E2EPF (data not shown). To remove minor contaminants including thrombin, undigested fusion protein, and GST, the eluted fraction was subjected to further purification by anion exchange chromatography(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to chromatography, the sample was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The filtrate was chromatographed at 4°C on a Mono Q HR 5/10 anion exchange column equilibrated with solution TD using a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. fast protein liquid chromatography system(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min during sample loading and gradient elution. After sample injection, the column was washed with solution TD and eluted with a linear 0-0.5 M NaCl gradient having a slope of 12.5 mM/min. Eluted fractions were assayed by both SDS-PAGE and ubiquitin thiol ester formation(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E2EPF consistently eluted as a single peak at 125 mM NaCl. A typical yield of E2EPF based on the thiol ester formation assay was approximately 10 nmol/liter bacterial culture. Purified E2EPF was stored at −80°C. Under these conditions, E2EPF retained full activity for over 8 months and after two cycles of freeze thawing. Purified E2EPF was assayed for the ability to form a thiol ester linkage with ubiquitin, according to the procedure of Haas and Bright(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E2EPF was incubated with 125I-ubiquitin (5 μM, 5-10 × 104 cpm/pmol) in the presence of 10 nM purified reticulocyte E1, 20 IU/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, and 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). After a 1-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. Replicate-quenched samples were boiled for 1 min in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol to cleave the 125I-ubiquitin thiol ester(16.Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), and 125I-ubiquitin-containing bands were visualized by autoradiography(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of E2EPF activity was accomplished using a modification of the above thiol ester assay. One-minute incubations containing different amounts of E2EPF were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. Thiol ester bands were cut from the gel and quantified by γ counting on an automatic γ counter (Micromedic 4/600 Plus, ICN Micromedic Systems Inc.). The absolute content of thiol ester was calculated based on the specific activity of 125I-ubiquitin(32.Haas A.L. Rose A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation assays for measuring steady state levels of conjugates were performed at 37°C for 60 min as described previously(29.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 IU/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, various concentrations of 125I-ubiquitin (native, UbK48R, or rmUb), purified rabbit reticulocyte E1, and purified E2 (E214K, E2EPF, or CDC34). The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and visualized by autoradiography. A similar approach was used to assay the conjugation of ubiquitin to endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Assays contained 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 20 IU/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 5 μM125I-ubiquitin (4-8 × 104 cpm/pmol), 10 nM E1, indicated concentrations of E2s, and the depleted fraction II (158 μg) as a source of both E3 and substrates. Degradation of reduced, carboxymethylated BSA (125I-rcmBSA) was quantified by generation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity similar to that described previously(9.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions of 50 μl total volume containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 20 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 μM ubiquitin, 4 μM125I-rcmBSA (4 × 104cpm/pmol), 10 nM E1, the indicated concentrations of E2s, and 158 μg of depleted fraction II were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μl of 5 mg of BSA/ml as carrier followed by 150 μl of ice-cold 16% trichloroacetic acid. Following a 10-min precipitation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The level of radioactivity in each 200 μl of supernatant was determined by γ counting using a Micromedic 4/600 Plus Automatic Gamma Counter (ICN Micromedic Systems, Inc.). Acid-soluble radioactivity present in the blank was subtracted from each reading, and the results were expressed as the net counts/min. The coding region of the E2EPF cDNA was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector, pGEX-2T (Pharmacia), to generate construct pGEXEPF5-ORF2B as described previously(5.Haas A.L. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 173-206Crossref Google Scholar). The fusion protein encoded by this construct consists of the full-length 24-kDa E2EPF fused to the carboxyl terminus of a 26-kDa segment of GST. The recombinant protein was purified using the glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography procedure essentially as described by Smith and Johnson(31.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2, this single step affinity purification yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous preparation of the GST-E2EPF fusion protein. Separation of the GST and E2EPF moieties of the fusion protein was accomplished by thrombin digestion followed by Mono Q anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purity of the resulting E2EPF polypeptide was demonstrated by electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 1, lane 3). The apparent molecular weight of the E2EPF polypeptide agreed with the size predicted by sequence analysis. The Mono Q chromatography step resolved intact E2 from minor fragmentation products generated during thrombin processing (not shown). Note that E2EPF exhibits a more intense level of staining by the silver technique relative to that of an equal mass of GST-E2EPF fusion protein (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). This is attributable to differences in mole amounts between the two proteins when normalized for equal mass and a greater mole fraction of lysine for E2EPF compared to GST, since lysine serves as the site of silver deposition. The GST-E2EPF fusion protein is catalytically active in forming the corresponding 125I-ubiquitin thiol ester in the presence of E1(28.Liu Z. Diaz L.A. Haas A.L. Giudice G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15829-15835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that recombinant E2EPF processed from GST by thrombin and subsequently purified by Mono Q FPLC is also active in ubiquitin thiol ester formation (lane 5). The amount of thiol ester formed to free E2EPF, determined by quantification of 125I radioactivity associated with the corresponding band in lane 5 of Fig. 2(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), agreed with that predicted from the mass of E2EPF protein determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The 125I-ubiquitin thiol ester adducts of both E2EPF and GST-E2EPF formed in incubations parallel to those of Fig. 2 were quantitatively labile to reducing conditions in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (not shown), confirming that the associated 125I-ubiquitin was in thiol ester linkage(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We consistently noted that, at equimolar concentrations, free E2EPF formed more ubiquitin thiol ester than did the GST-E2EPF fusion protein (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). The amount of thiol ester formed to the fusion protein did not increase on longer incubation and thus did not result from a lower rate of transthiolation from the E1 ternary complex (not shown). The lower level of GST-E2EPF thiol ester also did not result from inactivation since the predicted amount of free E2EPF thiol ester, based on protein determination, was observed if the fusion protein was first incubated with thrombin (not shown). These results indicate that the presence of GST at the amino terminus of E2EPF sterically alters the equilibrium constant rather than the rate of thiol ester formation from the E1 ternary complex. The results of Fig. 2 demonstrate that transthiolation from the E1 ternary complex to either free E2EPF or the GST fusion is complete within the 1.5-min incubation time employed, as is typical of the analogous loading reaction with other members of the E2 family(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On longer incubation with free E2EPF, a series of higher molecular weight 125I-ubiquitin adducts was consistently observed on nonreducing thiol ester gels (Fig. 3A). Unlike the 125I-ubiquitin-E2EPF thiol ester formed following short incubation (Fig. 2), the higher molecular weight bands formed during prolonged incubation were stable to reducing conditions, Fig. 3B, indicating that they represented peptide conjugates to radioiodinated ubiquitin. In addition, a small fraction of the monoubiquitin adduct was also stable to reducing conditions and showed a time-dependent accumulation on prolonged incubation. Therefore, the E2-Ub1 band in Fig. 3 represents a mixture of 125I-ubiquitin thiol ester and conjugate adducts at long incubation times but principally only thiol esters at short times. The relative molecular weights of the ladder of ubiquitin conjugates corresponded to integer multiples of the molecular weight for ubiquitin ligated to free E2EPF. The bands present under reducing conditions in Fig. 3B were confirmed as E2EPF-ubiquitin conjugates by comigration of identical bands when similar incubations containing unlabeled ubiquitin were analyzed on immunoblots probed with either anti-E2EPF or antiubiquitin antibodies (not shown). Thus, E2EPF catalyzes an E3-independent autoubiquitination reaction resulting in the formation of multiubiquitin homopolymer chains. Accumulation of autoubiquitinated E2EPF adducts of molecular weights greater than that predicted for monoubiquitination of all 17 lysines within E2EPF (Fig. 3) indicates that some or all of the attached ubiquitin moieties are present as multiubiquitin chains. To demonstrate this conclusively, E2EPF autoubiquitination was carried out in the presence of 125I-rmUb which is incapable of supporting chain elongation due to the absence of primary lysyl ε-amines(20.Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inability to form adducts above E2EPF-Ub2 (Fig. 4, lane 2), under conditions for which there is accumulation of these products with wild-type ubiquitin (lane 1), demonstrates that ubiquitin moieties ligated to E2EPF can"
