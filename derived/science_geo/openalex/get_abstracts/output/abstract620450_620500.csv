https://openalex.org/W2895961568,"Background A primary variant of social media, online support groups (OSG) extend beyond the standard definition to incorporate a dimension of advice, support and guidance for patients. OSG are complementary, yet significant adjunct to patient journeys. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be applied to these large volumes of unstructured text discussions accumulated in OSG for intelligent extraction of patient-reported demographics, behaviours, decisions, treatment, side effects and expressions of emotions. New insights from the fusion and synthesis of such diverse patient-reported information, as expressed throughout the patient journey from diagnosis to treatment and recovery, can contribute towards informed decision-making on personalized healthcare delivery and the development of healthcare policy guidelines. Methods and findings We have designed and developed an artificial intelligence based analytics framework using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for intelligent analysis and automated aggregation of patient information and interaction trajectories in online support groups. Alongside the social interactions aspect, patient behaviours, decisions, demographics, clinical factors, emotions, as subsequently expressed over time, are extracted and analysed. More specifically, we utilised this platform to investigate the impact of online social influences on the intimate decision scenario of selecting a treatment type, recovery after treatment, side effects and emotions expressed over time, using prostate cancer as a model. Results manifest the three major decision-making behaviours among patients, Paternalistic group, Autonomous group and Shared group. Furthermore, each group demonstrated diverse behaviours in post-decision discussions on clinical outcomes, advice and expressions of emotion during the twelve months following treatment. Over time, the transition of patients from information and emotional support seeking behaviours to providers of information and emotional support to other patients was also observed. Conclusions Findings from this study are a rigorous indication of the expectations of social media empowered patients, their potential for individualised decision-making, clinical and emotional needs. The increasing popularity of OSG further confirms that it is timely for clinicians to consider patient voices as expressed in OSG. We have successfully demonstrated that the proposed platform can be utilised to investigate, analyse and derive actionable insights from patient-reported information on prostate cancer, in support of patient focused healthcare delivery. The platform can be extended and applied just as effectively to any other medical condition."
https://openalex.org/W2897586401,"Background Vision plays an important role in controlling posture and balance in children. Reduced postural control has been reported in children with strabismus, but little has been reported specifically in amblyopia. Objective To investigate whether children with amblyopia have reduced balance compared to both children with strabismus without amblyopia and healthy controls. Study design and methods In this cross-sectional study, a total of 56 patients and healthy controls were recruited from the Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology Clinics at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Participants were divided into three groups: (1) 18 with unilateral amblyopia (strabismic amblyopia or mixed mechanism); (2) 16 with strabismus only without amblyopia; and (3) 22 visually-normal controls. The primary outcome was the balance performance as measured by the balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency 2 [BOT2]. Results The age and gender-adjusted BOT2 balance scores were significantly reduced in the amblyopia group (mean score 9.0 ± 3.1 SD) and the strabismus without amblyopia group (mean score 8.6 ± 2.4 SD) compared to visually normal controls (mean score 18.9 ± 4.2) (p<0.0001), but no statistical difference was demonstrated between the two patient groups (p = 0.907). Further subgroup analysis of the strabismus only group did not reveal a statistically significant difference in performance on BOT2 balance score between strabismus only patients with good stereopsis 60 sec or better (BOT2 mean score 9.8±3.0 SD) to patients with 3000 sec or no stereopsis (BOT2 mean score 7.9±1.7) (p = 0.144). Conclusion Our findings suggest that normal vision plays an important role in the development and maintenance of balance control. When normal binocular vision is disrupted in childhood in strabismus and/or amblyopia, not only is the vision affected, but balance is also reduced. Our results indicate that the presence of even mild binocular discordance/dysfunction (patients with intermittent strabismus and good stereopsis) may lead to postural instability."
https://openalex.org/W2896680161,"Endophytic fungi are known to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which can stimulate plant growth. Twenty-seven isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated from Coffea arabica in northern Thailand. Only one isolate (CMU-A109) produced IAA in vitro. This isolate was identified as Colletotrichum fructicola based on morphological characteristics and molecular phylogenetic analysis of a combined five loci (internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA, actin, β-tubulin 2, chitin synthase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes). Identification of a fungal IAA production obtained from indole 3-acetamide (IAM) and tryptophan 2-monooxygenase activity is suggestive of IAM routed IAA biosynthesis. The highest IAA yield (1205.58±151.89 μg/mL) was obtained after 26 days of cultivation in liquid medium supplemented with 8 mg/mL L-tryptophan at 30°C. Moreover, the crude fungal IAA could stimulate coleoptile elongation of maize, rice and rye. This is the first report of IAA production by C. fructicola and its ability to produce IAA was highest when compared with previous reports on IAA produced by fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2896733997,"Twitter offers a platform for rapid diffusion of information and its users' attitudes and behaviors. Insights about information propagation via retweets (the message forwarding function) offer observable explanations of ways in which modern human interactions get organized in the form of online networks, and contextualized in the form of public health, policy decisions, disaster management, and civic participation. This study conceptualized and validated the Why We Retweet Scale to contextualize retweeting behavior.Twitter users were identified using clustering algorithms that consider a users' position in their network and invited for an online survey. Participants (N = 1433) responded to 19 questions about why they retweet. Exploratory factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on a scale development sample (70% of original sample), which informed the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on a scale testing sample (30% of the original sample). Varimax rotation was used to obtain a rotated factor solution, which resulted in interpretable factors. Demographic differences among scale factors were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or independent samples t-tests.The final model (χ221 = 28, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI, 0.00-0.06], CFA = .99, TLI = 0.99) represented a parsimonious solution with 4 factors, measured by 2-3 items each, creating a final scale consisting of 9 items. Factor labels and definitions were: (1) Show approval, ""Show support to the tweeter""; (2) Argue, ""To argue against a tweet that I disagree with""; (3) Gain attention, ""Add followers or gain attention""; and (4) Entertain, ""Create humor/amusement"". Demographic differences were also reported.The Why We Retweet Scale offers a useful conceptualization and assessment of motivations for retweeting. In the future, communication strategists might consider the factors associated with information propagation when designing campaign messages to maximize message reach and engagement on Twitter."

Here we report resistance rates and trends among conjunctival-sourced ocular isolates collected across the US from 2009 through 2016. A total of 1198 conjunctival isolates (483 S. aureus, 305 CoNS, 208 H. influenzae, 118 S. pneumoniae, and 84 P. aeruginosa) were collected from patients with presumed bacterial conjunctivitis from 57 sites across 40 states. A large proportion of staphylococci demonstrated resistance to oxacillin and azithromycin, while resistance was low against the majority of antibiotics tested for S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenzae. Multidrug resistance (≥3 antibiotic classes) was found in 30.2% of S. aureus and 39.0% of CoNS isolates, and methicillin resistance more than doubled the rate of multi-drug resistance (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], 76.5%; methicillin-resistant CoNS isolates, 72.8%). There was a pattern of increasing mean percent resistance with increasing age by decade of life among S. aureus, MRSA, and CoNS (P≤0.038). Over the eight-year study period, there were small yet significant decreases in resistance rates among S. aureus to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, trimethoprim, and oxacillin (P≤0.003), and among CoNS and P. aeruginosa (both P<0.05) to ciprofloxacin. These data indicate that antibiotic resistance is high, but did not increase, among conjunctival-sourced isolates collected in the US from 2009 through 2016. For certain antibiotic/pathogen combinations, there was a trend of decreased resistance, including a decrease in oxacillin resistance among S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2896094732,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of public health challenges among immigrant refugees and their surrounding communities in developing countries. Evaluating the treatment outcome of TB patients is one of the key indicators to understand the performance of TB control program. Hence, this study aims to assess profile, treatment outcome and factors associated with unsuccessful outcome of TB patients treated under the TB control program among refugees and their surrounding communities (SCs) in Gambella Regional State, Ethiopia. Methodology Retrospective study was conducted in the health facilities of refugee and their SCs in Gambella Regional State from March 1 to May 30, 2017. Demographic and related data of all TB patients registered in TB Control Program between September, 2008 and October, 2017 in health facilities of refugee and the SCs was extracted using data extraction format. Eight years trend of TB, treatment outcome and factors associated with unsuccessful outcome among refugees and the SCs were computed using SPSS version 20.0 software. Result A total of 886 refugees and 3284 SCs TB patients, registered for anti TB treatment in the last eight years, were evaluated in the study. The trend of all forms of TB is progressively increasing among refugees contrary to the SCs in the course of the study period (X2 trend = 207.7; P<0.0001). Smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB+) was found to be predominant (57.6%) TB form in refugees while smear negative pulmonary TB (PTB-) (44.8%) is in the SCs (X2 = 185.834; P<0.0001). There was also significant difference in the treatment outcome (X2 = 170.915; P<0.0001). Mean treatment success rate was 74.2% and 88.1% for refugees and the SCs, respectively (X2 = 92.887; P<0.0001). The study also revealed that the risk of unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was significantly higher among refugee (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.69–2.77), retreated cases (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.07–2.17), patients aged between 35–44 years (AOR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.0–1.91), and greater than 44 years old (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.28–2.44), and patients with extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) form (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04–1.73) compared to their counterparts. Patient coming from rural area (AOR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62–0.97), who are female (AOR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63–0.91) and TB/HIV non-infected (AOR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51–0.77) were more likely to be successfully treated. Conclusion The study confirmed that there was low treatment success rate among refugees compared to the SCs. Being refugee, retreated case, patient’s age ≥35 years old, EPTB form, gender, rural patient address and HIV status were predictor factors for unsuccessful treatment outcome. Hence, the study urges the need for strengthened TB prevention program among refugees with due consideration of identified predictor factors to prevent the potential effect of hosting refugee to the SCs and the nations at large."
https://openalex.org/W2896484346,"Clinicians in intensive care units experience alarm fatigue related to frequent false and non-actionable alarms produced by physiologic monitors. To reduce non-actionable alarms, alarm settings may need to be customized for individual patients; however, nurses may not customize alarms because of competing demands and alarm fatigue.To examine the effectiveness and acceptance of physiologic monitor software to support customization of alarms.This pre/post intervention study was conducted in a 56-bed medical intensive care unit. IntelliVue® Alarm Advisor customization support software for alarm limit violations was installed on all monitors and education on its use provided. For 2 months before and after implementation of the software, data were collected on patient characteristics from the electronic health record, alarm counts and duration from the monitoring system, and nurses' experience of alarms from a survey.Medium-priority heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial pressure alarms were significantly reduced after software implementation (9.3%, 11.8%, and 15.9% reduction respectively; p<0.001 for all). The duration of these alarms was also significantly shorter (7.8%, 13.3%, and 9.3% reduction respectively; p<0.05 for all). The number and duration of SpO2 alarms did not decrease (p>0.05 for both). Patients post-intervention had worse Glasgow Coma Scale scores (p = 0.014), but otherwise were comparable to those pre-intervention. Nurses reported less time spent on non-actionable alarms post-intervention than pre-intervention (p = 0.026). Also lower post-intervention were the proportions of nurses who reported that alarms disturbed their workflow (p = 0.027) and who encountered a situation where an important alarm was ignored (p = 0.043). The majority (>50%) agreed that the software supported setting appropriate alarm limits and was easy to use.Alarm customization software was associated with a reduction in alarms. Use of software to support nurses' recognition of trends in patients' alarms and facilitate changes to alarm settings may add value to alarm reduction initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2896982389,"The identification of biological processes related to the regulation of complex traits is a difficult task. Commonly, complex traits are regulated through a multitude of genes contributing each to a small part of the total genetic variance. Additionally, some loci can simultaneously regulate several complex traits, a phenomenon defined as pleiotropy. The lack of understanding on the biological processes responsible for the regulation of these traits results in the decrease of selection efficiency and the selection of undesirable hitchhiking effects. The identification of pleiotropic key-regulator genes can assist in developing important tools for investigating biological processes underlying complex traits. A multi-breed and multi-OMICs approach was applied to study the pleiotropic effects of key-regulator genes using three independent beef cattle populations evaluated for fertility traits. A pleiotropic map for 32 traits related to growth, feed efficiency, carcass and meat quality, and reproduction was used to identify genes shared among the different populations and breeds in pleiotropic regions. Furthermore, data-mining analyses were performed using the Cattle QTL database (CattleQTLdb) to identify the QTL category annotated in the regions around the genes shared among breeds. This approach allowed the identification of a main gene network (composed of 38 genes) shared among breeds. This gene network was significantly associated with thyroid activity, among other biological processes, and displayed a high regulatory potential. In addition, it was possible to identify genes with pleiotropic effects related to crucial biological processes that regulate economically relevant traits associated with fertility, production and health, such as MYC, PPARG, GSK3B, TG and IYD genes. These genes will be further investigated to better understand the biological processes involved in the expression of complex traits and assist in the identification of functional variants associated with undesirable phenotypes, such as decreased fertility, poor feed efficiency and negative energetic balance."
https://openalex.org/W2897340341,"Introduction Motivation in medical students is positively associated with learning strategies. However, the evidence of a direct relationship between motivation and performance is vague. The objective of this study is to determine if the motivation that pushed students to choose the medical career is associated with their academic performance during their university years. Methods The study was conducted in 4,290 medical students from 10 countries in Latin America. The “Attribution Scale of General Achievement Motivation” was used to evaluate their general performance. The “Medical motivation Scale” test was used to measure social, altruist, economic, and prestige motivators. For statistical analyses, frequencies and percentages were described, and generalized linear models were used to establish statistical associations. Results Fifty percent of the students surveyed were females and the mean student age was 21 years old. This study showed that male students had a higher social/altruist motivation (PR:1.11,95%CI: 1.03–1.18; p<0,01) than females. Those who had familial pressure had a lower social/altruist motivation (PR:0.17,95%CI:0.08–0.36; p<0,001). The positive vocational test was associated with a higher social/altruist motivation (PR:1.85,95%CI:1.03–3.30; p<0,05). Moreover, good grades at school were related with a higher economical/prestige motivation (PR:1.39,95%CI:1.05–1.83; p<0,05), but lower social/altruist motivation (PR:0.85,95%CI:0.74–0.98; p<0,05) and academic performance (PR:0.63,95%CI:0.50–0.79; p<0,001). We found a higher frequency in the general motivation was associated to a lowest social/altruist motivation (PR: 0.57; CI95%: 0.46–0.70; p<0.001), and that it increased according to the year of study (PR: 1.15; CI95%: 1.03–1.28; p:0.013) and was higher when pressure by the family was present (PR: 1.36; CI95%: 1.17–1.59; p<0.001). Conclusion This study indicated that male medical students and having a positive vocational test were associated with a higher social/altruist motivation. Conversely, those who had familial pressure and good grades at school had a lower social/altruist motivation. Is necessary to conduct further studies that assess other factors related to motivation as demographics, personality, and learning styles."
https://openalex.org/W2895973748,"Neuroimaging data suggest that pediatric overweight and obesity are associated with morphological alterations in gray matter (GM) brain structures, but previous studies using mainly voxel-based morphometry (VBM) showed inconsistent results. Here, we aimed to examine the relationship between youth obesity and the volume of predefined reward system structures using magnetic resonance (MR) volumetry. We also aimed to complement volumetry with VBM-style analysis.Fifty-one Caucasian young subjects (32 females; mean age: 13.8±1.9, range: 10.2-16.5 years) were included. Subjects were selected from a subsample of the I.Family study examined in the Hungarian center. A T1-weighted 1 mm3 isotropic resolution image was acquired. Age- and sex-standardized body mass index (zBMI) was assessed at the day of MRI and ~1.89 years (mean±SD: 689±188 days) before the examination. Obesity related GM alterations were investigated using MR volumetry in five predefined brain structures presumed to play crucial roles in body weight regulation (hippocampus, amygdala, accumbens, caudate, putamen), as well as whole-brain and regional VBM.The volumes of accumbens and amygdala showed significant positive correlations with zBMI, while their GM densities were inversely related to zBMI. Voxel-based GM mass also showed significant negative correlation with zBMI when investigated in the predefined amygdala region, but this relationship was mediated by GM density.Overweight/obesity related morphometric brain differences already seem to be present in children/adolescents. Our work highlights the disparity between volume and VBM-derived measures and that GM mass (combination of volume and density) is not informative in the context of obesity related volumetric changes. To better characterize the association between childhood obesity and GM morphometry, a combination of volumetric segmentation and VBM methods, as well as future longitudinal studies are necessary. Our results suggest that childhood obesity is associated with enlarged structural volumes, but decreased GM density in the reward system."
https://openalex.org/W2895985082,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that causes ataxia and deficits in balance. Exercise-based therapies have been identified as integral to the recovery of motor function in MS, but few studies have investigated non-traditional movement interventions. We examined a targeted ballet program (TBP) designed to mitigate ataxia and improve balance in females with mild-to-moderate relapsing-remitting MS. Methods and findings Twelve females with mild-to-moderate disability due to MS were assessed for study eligibility for the study. Ten participants met the inclusion criteria. Two were lost to unrelated health complications. Eight participants completed the TBP. The TBP met twice a week for 60 minutes for 16 weeks. Assessments included (a) the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), (b) the Mini-Balance Evaluations Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), (c) smoothness of movement during a five-meter walk, and (d) balance in a step to stand task before and after the TBP. There were no TBP-related adverse events. Single-tailed paired samples t-tests and Wilcoxon tests were conducted. Improvements were observed in ICARS (p = 7.11E-05), Mini-BESTest (p = 0.001), smoothness of movement in the left (p = 0.027) and right (p = 0.028) sides of the body, and balance in a step-to-stand task in the back (p = 0.025) direction. Results yielded 42% and 58% improvements in the mean Mini-BESTest and ICARS scores, respectively. Conclusions This study adds to current research by providing support for a TBP intervention targeting ataxia and balance in MS. The TBP was well tolerated, improved balance, and mitigated ataxia. Clinical improvements were larger than those of previous studies on physical rehabilitation in MS with similar outcome measures. Trial registration ISRCTN ISRCTN67916624."
https://openalex.org/W2896247479,"Objective Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important tick-borne arboviral disease in Europe and Asia. The Upper Rhine Valley is thought to be the very western border of TBEV distribution in Europe. The aim of our study was to identify natural foci and isolate TBEV from ticks, to determine the prevalence of TBEV in local tick populations and to study the phylogenetic relatedness of circulating TBEV strains in this region. Material and methods Ticks were collected between 2016, 2017 and 2018 by flagging. TBEV was isolated from collected ticks and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Minimal infection rates (MIR) of the collected ticks were calculated. Results At 12 sampling sites, a total of 4,064 Ixodes ticks were collected in 2016 and 2017 –(and one single collection 2018). 953 male, 856 female adult ticks and 2,255 nymphs were identified. The MIR rates were 0,17% (1/595) for Schiltach (Germany) and 0,11% (1/944) for Foret de la Robertsau (France), respectively. Overall, the three newly described TBEV strains, isolated in the years 2016 and 2017 from the Upper Rhine Valley have no close phylogenetic relation and show a genetic relationship with strains from eastern Europe. The 2018 TBEV strain from Aubachstrasse (Germany), however, is closely related to the TBEV found in Schiltach (Germany). Conclusion In conclusion, we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, the phylogenetic relations of the newly isolated TBEV strains on both sides of the upper Rhine river."
https://openalex.org/W2896908875,"Identifying subgroups of treatment responders through the different phases of clinical trials has the potential to increase success in drug development. Recent developments in subgroup analysis consider subgroups that are defined in terms of the predicted individual treatment effect, i.e. the difference between the predicted outcome under treatment and the predicted outcome under control for each individual, which in turn may depend on multiple biomarkers. In this work, we study the properties of different modelling strategies to estimate the predicted individual treatment effect. We explore linear models and compare different estimation methods, such as maximum likelihood and the Lasso with and without randomized response. For the latter, we implement confidence intervals based on the selective inference framework to account for the model selection stage. We illustrate the methods in a dataset of a treatment for Alzheimer disease (normal response) and in a dataset of a treatment for prostate cancer (survival outcome). We also evaluate via simulations the performance of using the predicted individual treatment effect to identify subgroups where a novel treatment leads to better outcomes compared to a control treatment."

Five separate materials were produced in the preparation of 211At-BC8-B10: (1) p-isothiocyanato-phenethyl-closo-decaborate(2-) (B10-NCS), (2) anti-CD45 MAb, BC8, (3) BC8-B10 MAb conjugate, (4) [211At]NaAt, and (5) 211At-BC8-B10. The 211At-labeling reagent, B10-NCS, was synthesized as previously reported. BC8 was produced, then conjugated with B10-NCS under cGMP conditions to form BC8-B10. [211At]NaAt was produced by α-irradiation of Bi targets, followed by isolation of the 211At using a ""wet chemistry"" method. The clinical product, 211At-BC8-B10, was prepared by reacting [211At]NaAt with BC8-B10 in NH4OAc buffer (pH 5.5) for 2 min at room temperature, followed by size-exclusion chromatography purification. Quality control tests conducted on the 211At-BC8-B10 included evaluations for purity and identity, as well as pyrogen and sterility tests. Stability of the 211At-BC8-B10 in 25 mg/mL sodium ascorbate solution was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 21 h post isolation. For qualification, three consecutive 211At-BC8-B10 clinical preparations were successfully conducted in the cGMP suite, and an additional cGMP clinical preparation was carried out to validate each step required to deliver 211At-BC8-B10 to a patient. These cGMP preparations provided 0.80-1.28 Gbq (21.5-34.5 mCi) of 211At-BC8-B10 with radiochemical purity of >97%. The preparations were found to be sterile and have a pyrogen level <0.50 EU/mL. Cell binding was retained by the 211At-BC8-B10. 211At-BC8-B10 in ascorbic acid solution demonstrated a radiochemical stability of >95% for up to 21 h at room temperature. The experiments conducted have defined conditions for translation of 211At-BC8-B10 production from the laboratory to cGMP suite.

https://openalex.org/W2895964125,"In controlled environment plant production facilities, elevating either light or CO2 levels generally has led to increased biomass and yield due to enhanced canopy photosynthesis. Today, advancements in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have made this technology a viable option for both supplementary lighting in greenhouses and a sole lighting source in controlled environment chambers. Our study used tomato plants grown under both ambient CO2 (AC) and elevated CO2 (EC) conditions then exposed them to various CO2 and lighting treatments during both whole plant and leaf level measurements. Plants grown under EC reached the first flower developmental stage 8 days sooner and were approximately 15cm taller than those grown under AC. However, under AC plants had more leaf area while their dry weights were similar. Of note, under EC chlorophyll a and b were lower, as were carotenoids per unit leaf area. Whole plant analyses, under all CO2 challenges, showed that plants exposed to high-pressure sodium (HPS), red-blue LED, and red-white LED had similar photosynthesis, respiration, and daily carbon gain. Under different light qualities, day-time transpiration rates were similar among CO2 conditions. Day-time water-use efficiency (WUE) was higher in plants grown and exposed to EC. Similarly, WUE of plants grown under AC but exposed to short-term elevated CO2 conditions was higher than those grown and tested under AC during all light treatments. Under all CO2 conditions, plants exposed to red-white and red-blue LEDs had lower WUE than those exposed to HPS lighting. Assessing alterations due to CO2 and light quality on a whole plant basis, not merely on an individual leaf basis, furthers our understanding of the interactions between these two parameters during controlled environment production. Principle component analyses of both whole plant and leaf data indicates that increasing CO2 supply has a more dramatic effect on photosynthesis and WUE than on transpiration."
https://openalex.org/W2896132102,"The IGFN1 (Immunoglobulin-Like And Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 1) gene has a role in skeletal muscle function and is also involved in metastatic breast cancer, and the isoforms with three N-terminal globular domains are sufficient for its function in skeletal muscle. Two novel splicing isoforms of IGFN1 have been identified in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), one with 5’exon extension and an isoform with a novel exon. The role of G-quadruplex, a non-B DNA, was explored for the splicing alteration of IGFN1 in RCC. G-quadruplexes are the secondary structures acquired by stacking of G-quartets by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding in DNA and RNA. IGFN1 has intronic potential G-quadruplex forming sequence (PQS) folding into G-quadruplex and is studied for its involvement in aberrant splicing. A PQS in the intron 15 of IGFN1 gene was observed in our in silico analysis by QGRS mapper and non BdB web servers. We observed PQS folds into stable G-quadruplex structure in gel shift assay and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the presence of G-quadruplex stabilizing agents Pyridostatin (PDS) and KCl, respectively. G-quadruplex formation site with single base resolution was mapped by Sanger sequencing of the plasmid constructs harbouring the cloned PQS and its mutant. This stable G-quadruplex inhibits reverse transcriptase and taq polymerase in reverse transcriptase & PCR stop assays. PDS changes the different splicing isoforms of IGFN1 in UOK146 cell line, displaying involvement of intronic G-quadruplex in IGFN1 splicing. These results lead us to propose that a stable G-quadruplex structure is formed in IGFN1 intron and a reason behind IGFN1 aberrant splicing which could be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2896228814,"This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and type of oral HPV-infection in women with a cervical HPV-lesion and in the oral and genital mucosa of their male partners.The study group comprised 44 sexually-active women, 20-45 years with abnormal PAP smear, not more than 6 months prior to referral together with the male partners cohabiting in stable partnerships. A detailed questionnaire was administered concerning the HPV-related risk factors. Oral swabs, oral rinses, cervical swabs and urine samples were collected. HPV DNA was detected using two different polymerase chain reactions (PCRs): MY09-11 and FAP59-64. Positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing and the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra II probe assay. The association with risk factors was assessed by fitting a generalized model, using the General Linear Model function in the R-software; correlations were calculated between all data.HPV was detected in 84% of Cervical Samples, in 24.3% of oral samples and in one urine sample. Only 27% of the HPV-positive results were identical with both PCR DNA assays. 8 male had oral HPV-positive samples different from women cervical samples. In one couple the urine-male sample had the same HPV present in the female-cervical sample. A significant association resulted between women/oral sex practices and men/n. of partners.This study reports that women (20.4%) with a diagnosis of cervical-HPV and their male partners (30,7%) are at high risk for subclinical oral HPV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2896516662,"The trophic niche is a life trait that identifies the consumer's position in a local food web. Several factors, such as ontogeny, competitive ability and resource availability contribute in shaping species trophic niches. To date, information on the diet of European Hydromantes salamanders are only available for a limited number of species, no dietary studies have involved more than one species of the genus at a time, and there are limited evidences on how multiple factors interact in determining diet variation. In this study we examined the diet of multiple populations of six out of the eight European cave salamanders, providing the first data on the diet for five of them. In addition, we assessed whether these closely related generalist species show similar diet and, for each species, we tested whether season, age class or sex influence the number and the type of prey consumed. Stomach condition (empty/full) and the number of prey consumed were strongly related to seasonality and to the activity level of individuals. Empty stomachs were more frequent in autumn, in individuals far from cave entrance and in juveniles. Diet composition was significantly different among species. Hydromantes imperialis and H. supramontis were the most generalist species; H. flavus and H. sarrabusensis fed mostly on Hymenoptera and Coleoptera Staphylinidae, while H. genei and H. ambrosii mostly consumed Arachnida and Endopterygota larvae. Furthermore, we detected seasonal shifts of diet in the majority of the species examined. Conversely, within each species, we did not find diet differences between females, males and juveniles. Although being assumed to have very similar dietary habits, here Hydromantes species were shown to be characterized by a high divergence in diet composition and in the stomach condition of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2896737328,"Many animals exhibit behavioral plasticity as they move between habitats seasonally, reside in fluctuating environments, or respond to human-induced environmental change. We know that physical environment during early development can have a lasting impact on behavior, and on the neural mechanisms that shape behavior. In adults, social context can have similar persistent effects on behavior and the brain. Here, we asked whether physical context impacts adult social behavior in a novel environment. We placed groups of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in two different physical contexts. After two weeks, we measured group behavior in a novel context, and found that zebrafish with recent experience in a more-complex physical environment charged each other more often and tended to form tighter shoals than did fish that had been housed in less-complex environments. These differences were present regardless of the novel context in which we assayed behavior, and were not easily explained by differences in activity level. Our results demonstrate the impact of recent experiences on adult behavior, and highlight the importance of physical as well as social history in predicting animal behavior in novel situations."
https://openalex.org/W2895934016,"Given a set of temporal networks, from different domains and with different sizes, how can we compare them? Can we identify evolutionary patterns that are both (i) characteristic and (ii) meaningful? We address these challenges by introducing a novel temporal and topological network fingerprint named Graphlet-orbit Transitions (GoT). We demonstrate that GoT provides very rich and interpretable network characterizations. Our work puts forward an extension of graphlets and uses the notion of orbits to encapsulate the roles of nodes in each subgraph. We build a transition matrix that keeps track of the temporal trajectory of nodes in terms of their orbits, therefore describing their evolution. We also introduce a metric (OTA) to compare two networks when considering these matrices. Our experiments show that networks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions. GoT correctly groups synthetic networks pertaining to well-known graph models more accurately than competing static and dynamic state-of-the-art approaches by over 30%. Furthermore, our tests on real-world networks show that GoT produces highly interpretable results, which we use to provide insight into characteristic orbit transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2897302216,"Introduction The introduction of universal health insurance coverage aims to provide equal accessibility and affordability of health care, but whether such a policy eliminates health inequalities has not been conclusively determined. This research aims to examine the healthcare outcomes of oral cancer and determine whether the universal coverage system in Taiwan has reduced health inequality. Methods Linking the databases of the National Cancer Registry with the National Mortality Registry in Taiwan, we stratified patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma by gender and income to estimate the incidence rate, cumulative incidence rate aged from 20 to 79 (CIR20-79), life expectancy, and expected years of life lost (EYLL). The difficulties with asymmetries and short follow-up periods were resolved through applying survival analysis extrapolation methods. Results While all people showed a general improvement in life expectancy after the introduction of the NHI, the estimated change in EYLL’s of the high-, middle-, and low-income female patients were found to have +0.3, -0.5 and -7 years of EYLL, respectively, indicating a reduction in health inequality. Improvements for the male patients were unremarkable. There was no drop in the CIR20-79 of oral cancer in disadvantaged groups as in those with higher incomes. Conclusions Universal coverage alone may not reduce health inequality across different income groups for oral cancer unless effective preventive measures are implemented for economically disadvantaged regions."
https://openalex.org/W2897916294,"In eukaryotes, the modification of an invariant histidine (His-699 in yeast) residue in translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) with diphthamide involves a conserved pathway encoded by the DPH1-DPH7 gene network. Diphthamide is the target for diphtheria toxin and related lethal ADP ribosylases, which collectively kill cells by inactivating the essential translocase function of EF2 during mRNA translation and protein biosynthesis. Although this notion emphasizes the pathological importance of diphthamide, precisely why cells including our own require EF2 to carry it, is unclear. Mining the synthetic genetic array (SGA) landscape from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed negative interactions between EF2 (EFT1-EFT2) and diphthamide (DPH1-DPH7) gene deletions. In line with these correlations, we confirm in here that loss of diphthamide modification (dphΔ) on EF2 combined with EF2 undersupply (eft2Δ) causes synthetic growth phenotypes in the composite mutant (dphΔ eft2Δ). These reflect negative interference with cell performance under standard as well as thermal and/or chemical stress conditions, cell growth rates and doubling times, competitive fitness, cell viability in the presence of TOR inhibitors (rapamycin, caffeine) and translation indicator drugs (hygromycin, anisomycin). Together with significantly suppressed tolerance towards EF2 inhibition by cytotoxic DPH5 overexpression and increased ribosomal -1 frame-shift errors in mutants lacking modifiable pools of EF2 (dphΔ, dphΔ eft2Δ), our data indicate that diphthamide is important for the fidelity of the EF2 translocation function during mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2896044039,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune disease of the synovial joints, hallmarked by chronic inflammation and subsequent progressive tissue destruction. TYRO3, AXL and MER (gene name Mertk) (TAM) receptors are part of a negative feedback signaling system in the immune reaction and mediate efferocytosis thereby tempering the inflammatory process. We have shown that Axl-/- and Mertk-/- mice develop more severe arthritis whereas activating these receptors by overexpressing their ligands Pros1 and Gas6 ameliorates arthritis. Mice genetically ablated for the three genes of the TAM receptor family Tyro3/Axl/Mertk (TAM triple knock-out or TKO) have been described to spontaneously develop macroscopic signs of arthritis. In this study we aimed to analyze arthritis development in TAM TKO mice histologically to determine the extent and sequence of pathological changes in the joint. Ankle joints of three different age groups, adolescence (14 weeks), mature adult (34 weeks) and middle-age (52 weeks), of TAM TKO or wild-type mice were examined macroscopically, histologically and immunohistochemically. Surprisingly, until the age of 52 weeks, none of the mice examined developed spontaneous macroscopic signs of arthritis. There was no synovial inflammation nor any signs of damage to the cartilage or bone. However, bone marrow edema was observed in TAM TKO mice in the two latter age groups. The infiltrate in the bone marrow was characterized by both myeloid cells and lymphocytes. This study showed that TAM TKO mice developed a pre-stage (pre-clinical phase) of arthritis marked by bone marrow edema."

These threads are always exposed to the surrounding environmental conditions. Understanding how environmental pH affects these threads is crucial in understanding how climate change can affect mussels. This work examines three factors (load at failure, thread extensibility, and total thread counts) that indicate the performance of byssal threads as well as condition index to assess impacts on the physiological condition of mussels held in artificial seawater acidified by the addition of CO2. There was no significant variation between the control (~786 μatm CO2 / ~7.98 pH/ ~2805 μmol kg-1 total alkalinity) and acidified (~2555 μatm CO2 / ~7.47 pH/ ~2650 μmol kg-1 total alkalinity) treatment groups in any of these factors. The results of this study suggest that ocean acidification by CO2 addition has no significant effect on the quality and performance of threads produced by M. edulis."

The purposes of this study were to 1) evaluate outcomes of EMG-PR and inertial measurement units (IMU) control of the DEKA Arm as compared to personal prosthesis; and 2) compare outcomes of EMG-PR to IMU control of DEKA Arm.This was a quasi-experimental, multi-site study with repeated measures that compared non-randomized groups using two types of controls: EMG-PR and IMUs. Subjects (N = 36) were transradial (TR) and transhumeral (TH) amputees. Outcomes were collected at Baseline (using personal prosthesis), and after in-laboratory training (Part A), and home use (Part B). Data was compared to personal prosthesis, stratified by amputation level and control type. Outcomes were also compared by control type.The EMG-PR group had greater prosthesis use after Part A, but worse dexterity, lower satisfaction, and slower activity performance compared to Baseline; the IMU group had slower activity performance. After Part B, the EMG-PR group had less perceived activity difficulty; the IMU group had improved activity performance, improved disability and activity difficulty, but slower performance. No differences were observed for TH group by control type in Part A or B. The TR group using EMG-PR had worse dexterity (Parts A & B), and activity performance (Part A) as compared to IMU users.Findings suggest that for the TR group that IMUs are a more effective control method for the DEKA Arm as compared to the EMG-PR prototypes employed in this study. Further research is needed to refine the EMG-PR systems for multi-DOF devices. Future studies should include a larger sample of TH amputees.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01551420."
https://openalex.org/W2897816006,"Although the spatial mapping and fertility assessment of soil chemical properties (SCPs) are well studied in the Loess Plateau region of China at farmland scale, little is known about spatial mapping the SCPs and their fertility and their influence factors at urban forest scale. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare the performance of two spatial interpolation methods, Ordinary kriging (OK) and regression kriging (RK), and (2) explain the relationships of the vegetation, terrain, and soil layer depth between the eight SCPs and their fertility, and (3) find the limiting factors of soil comprehensive fertility in this study area? The Yan'an urban forest was taken as study case, used hybrid spatial interpolation methods based on OK and RK to mapping eight SCPs and the soil fertility in each soil layer (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm) for 285 soil samples. The results indicated that RK outperformed OK for total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (AK), organic matter (OM) in 0-60 cm profile and available phosphorus (AP) in the 0-20 cm and 40-60 cm soil layers because RK considered the impact of terrain. The terrain factors, comprising the relative terrain position, slope, aspect, and relative elevation significantly affected the SCPs and spatial heterogeneity of fertility, where the vegetation cover types determined the average SCPs to some extent. On average, the six SCPs (except total potassium and AP) and the fertility decreased as the soil layer depth increased. Ten vegetation cover types comprising broadleaved mixed natural forest (BM), cultivated land (CL), economic forest (EF), grassland (GL), Platycladus orientalis natural forest (PON), Platycladus orientalis plantation (POP), Pinus tabuliformis plantation (PT), Quercus wutaishanica natural forest (QW), Robinia pseudoacacia plantation (RP), and Shrubwood (SW) were associated with significant differences in TN, OM, AN, AP, and AK, across the three soil layers. QW, PON, and BM also had higher content of TN, OM, AN, and AK contents than the other vegetation cover types. There were small differences in TK, AK, and pH among the 10 vegetation cover types. We concluded that AN, TN, and OM are the limiting factors of soil comprehensive fertility in this region. These results improve understanding of the spatial mapping, influence and limiting factors of SCPs and their fertility at urban forest scales."
https://openalex.org/W2897137552,"We aimed to identify factors predicting parametrial invasion in early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy. We recruited women with invasive cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy at a single medical institute from 2000-2011. The clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively recorded, and the risk factors for parametrial invasion were analyzed. We enrolled 339 patients, including 7 with stage IA1 carcinomas, 10 with stage IA2, 266 with stage IB1, 39 with stage IB2, 14 with stage IIA1, and 3 with stage IIA2. The majority (237/339, 69.9%) had squamous cell carcinoma, while 32 (12.4%) had parametrial invasion. The 16 patients with stage IB1 tumors and parametrial invasion were older (55.9±9.5vs. 49.0±9.9 years, p = 0.005, Mann-Whitney U test), and had deeper cervical stromal invasion (9.59±4.87 vs. 7.47±5.48 mm, p = 0.048, Mann-Whitney U test), larger tumor size (2.32±1.15 vs. 1.74±1.14cm, p = 0.043, Mann-Whitney U test), higher incidences of lymphovascular space invasion (87.5% vs. 28.8%, p<0.001, chi-square test), and greater lymph node metastasis (68.8% vs. 10.8%, p<0.001, chi-square test) than the 260 patients without parametrial invasion. Among the patients with stage IB1 tumor size >2 cm,10% had parametrial invasion and 24.2% had lymph node metastasis compared with only 4% and 9.4% of stage IB1 patients with a tumor size <2 cm, respectively. Only one (0.9%) of the 109 patients aged less than 50 years had parametrial invasion compared with 6 (9.7%) of the 62 patients aged over 50 years. Patients with stage IA2 and IB1 tumors <2 cm may not need radical hysterectomy owing to the low incidence of parametrial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2896264121,"Citrate is an ubiquitous compound in nature. However, citrate fermentation is present only in a few pathogenic or nonpathogenic microorganisms. The citrate fermentation pathway includes a citrate transporter, a citrate lyase complex, an oxaloacetate decarboxylase and a regulatory system. Enterococcus faecalis is commonly present in the gastro-intestinal microbiota of warm-blooded animals and insect guts. These bacteria can also cause infection and disease in immunocompromised individuals. In the present study, we performed whole genome analysis in Enterococcus strains finding that the complete citrate pathway is present in all of the E. faecalis strains isolated from such diverse habitats as animals, hospitals, water, milk, plants, insects, cheese, etc. These results indicate the importance of this metabolic preservation for persistence and growth of E. faecalis in different niches. We also analyzed the role of citrate metabolism in the E. faecalis pathogenicity. We found that an E. faecalis citrate fermentation-deficient strain was less pathogenic for Galleria mellonella larvae than the wild type. Furthermore, strains with deletions in the oxaloacetate decarboxylase subunits or in the α-acetolactate synthase resulted also less virulent than the wild type strain. We also observed that citrate promoters are induced in blood, urine and also in the hemolymph of G. mellonella. In addition, we showed that citrate fermentation allows E. faecalis to grow better in blood, urine and G. mellonella. The results presented here clearly indicate that citrate fermentation plays an important role in E. faecalis opportunistic pathogenic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2897042058,"The most commonly used models for estimating measures of latent variables from polytomous rating scale data are the Andrich rating scale model and the Samejima graded response model. The Andrich model has the undesirable property of estimating disordered rating category thresholds, and users of the model are advised to manipulate data to force thresholds to come out ordered. The Samejima model estimates ordered thresholds, but has the undesirable property of estimating person measures on a non-invariant scale—the scale depends on which items a person rates and makes comparisons across people difficult. We derive the rating scale model logically implied by the generally agreed upon definition of rating scale—a real line partitioned by ordered thresholds into ordered intervals called rating categories—and show that it estimates ordered thresholds as well as person and item measures on an invariant scale. The derived model turns out to be a special case of the Samejima model, but with no item discrimination parameter and with common thresholds across items. All parameters in our model are estimated using a fast and efficient method called the Method of Successive Dichotomizations, which applies the dichotomous Rasch model as many times as there are thresholds and demonstrates that the derived model is a polytomous Rasch model that estimates ordered thresholds. We tested both the Method of Successive Dichotomizations and the Andrich model against simulated rating scale data and found that the estimated parameters of our model were nearly perfectly correlated with the true values, while estimated thresholds of the Andrich model became negatively correlated with the true values as the number of rating categories increased. Our method also estimates parameters on a scale that remains invariant to the number of rating categories, in contrast to the Andrich model."

The median time of follow-up was 55.5 months. The 2-year loco-regional control rate of all the patients was 60.4%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that N3 stage, extracapsular spread, distant metastasis, and treatment modality were significantly associated with neck recurrence. The actuarial 5-year disease-specific survival rates of neck dissection, neck dissection plus adjuvant therapy, radiotherapy alone, and combined therapy were 80.0%, 61.7%, 33.3%, and 68.8%, respectively (p = 0.046). The 5-year disease-specific survival rates of N1/N2a, N2b/N2c, and N3 stage were 83.9%, 64.3%, and 36.7%, respectively (p = 0.013). Univariate regression analysis revealed that neck recurrence, supraclavicular node involvement, distant metastasis, N3 stage, and unhealthy lifestyle habits were correlated with disease-specific mortality, especially the first three parameters. Patient's occupation and comorbidity were not significantly correlated with survival.Composite therapy is mandatory for advanced unknown primary SCCHN. Supraclavicular node involvement and unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as betel nut chewing, indicate a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2897709049,"The oral bacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis, as well as systemic infections including endocarditis, produces numerous virulence factors, including a repeats-in-toxin (RTX) protein called leukotoxin (LtxA), which kills human immune cells. The strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans most closely associated with disease have been shown to produce the most LtxA, suggesting that LtxA plays a significant role in the virulence of this organism. LtxA, like many of the RTX toxins, can be divided into four functional domains: an N-terminal hydrophobic domain, which contains a significant fraction of hydrophobic residues and has been proposed to play a role in the membrane interaction of the toxin; the central domain, which contains two lysine residues that are the sites of post-translational acylation; the repeat domain that is characteristic of the RTX toxins, and a C-terminal domain thought to be involved in secretion. In its initial interaction with the host cell, LtxA must bind to both cholesterol and an integrin receptor, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). While both interactions are essential for toxicity, the domains of LtxA involved remain unknown. We therefore undertook a series of experiments, including tryptophan quenching and trypsin digestion, to characterize the structure of LtxA upon interaction with membranes of various lipid compositions. Our results demonstrate that LtxA adopts a U-shaped conformation in the membrane, with the N- and C-terminal domains residing outside of the membrane."

Reliable biomarkers that can identify these cases are therefore highly desired. ErbB2/HER2 status is important in the medical management of patients with various human malignancies, whereas its clinical relevance in human meningiomas is ambiguous. For this reason, we wanted to investigate the expression of intra- and extracellular domains of ErbB2/HER2 as well as the level of activated receptor in these tumors. Further, we wanted to elucidate any clinicopathological associations to antibody expression and if gene amplification was present.In total, 186 human meningiomas of all malignancy grades were included in the study, 163 of these were in tissue microarrays (TMA). Antibody expression was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).All cases were immunoreactive with antibodies targeting the intracellular domain, whereas about 48% and 11% were positive with antibodies against the extracellular domain and against the activated receptor, respectively. Normal meninges were not immunoreactive. There were no relations to malignancy grade, and only the activated receptor was significantly correlated with increased risk for recurrence or death (time to recurrence: HR 1.568, CI (1.153 to 2.132), p = 0.004). No gene amplification was found.ErbB2/HER2 is generally upregulated in human meningiomas, but in an activated state only in a few cases. Only the activated receptor is associated with poorer prognosis, a link that needs further investigations."

Patients and methods The present study identified 14,340 symptomatic menopausal women without a history of CHD from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013. A total of 14,340 age- and Charlson-comorbidity-index-score-matched asymptomatic women were used as controls. Possible comorbidity-attributable risks of CHD were surveyed to assess whether the symptomatic menopausal cohort had a higher incidence of CHD. Results The incidence of CHD was higher in the symptomatic menopausal cohort than in the control cohort (17.18 vs. 12.05 per 1000 person-years). After adjustment in multivariate Cox analysis, the risk of CHD was significantly higher in the symptomatic menopausal cohort (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.344, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.262–1.43, P < 0.001) than in the control cohort. In the symptomatic menopausal cohort, the risk of CHD was significantly higher in all subgroups, except for the hormone therapy (HT) subgroup. Patients undergoing HT had a nonsignificantly higher risk of CHD, regardless of the presence or absence of menopausal symptoms. Conclusion This large-scale longitudinal retrospective cohort study revealed that menopausal symptoms are an independent risk factor for CHD. Moreover, our findings indicate that HT has a nonsignificant effect on the risk of CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2897080475,"Palm leaves represent one of the most important non-timber forest products in tropical and subtropical regions. Brahea aculeata is an endemic palm of northwest Mexico, whose leaves are intensively exploited for roof thatch and handcrafts. As part of a long-term defoliation experiment, we evaluated the effects of different leaf harvest on foliar and reproductive traits of adults and attributes of their progeny. We conducted a six-year manipulative experiment and applied three harvesting treatments to adults: high harvest, low harvest and no harvest (control). We recorded leaf production and size, flower and fruit production, seed germination and seedling growth. We also explored trade-offs among foliar and reproductive traits. Harvested palms exhibited drastically reduced reproductive activity, producing fewer flowers and fruits (up to 80 and 90% fewer than unharvested palms). However, individuals in both harvest treatments had larger leaves and increased leaf production rates, compared to control palms. For harvested palms, we registered first a slight increase in leaf traits and a decline in reproductive attributes. These traits showed a gradual reduction and for six period attained very low proportional values compared to control palms (~0.10), however individuals in the harvested treatments maintained the greatest leaf lengths and leaf production rates. Seed germination and seedling growth rates of progeny from harvested palms were significantly lower than control palms, with seeds from the high harvest treatment having the lowest seed production and germination rates. Relationships among leaf (size/production) and reproductive traits (flower/fruit production) were positive during the fourth year, but showed negative relationships for the fifth year suggesting a trade-off between reproduction and growth functions. Leaf harvesting in B. aculeata seems to alter patterns of resource allocation away from reproduction as reflected in a decrease in the probability of reproduction, seed number, germination, and vigor, causing a strong decrease in the reproductive success of this species. Results showed that the consequences of long-term leaf harvest not only affect harvested individuals, but also the fitness and vigor of progeny. This type of long-term studies is essential to understand the population dynamics of non-timber forest products and helps inform sustainable harvesting programs considering intensity, frequencies and periods for recovery from defoliation. Also results may help to explain how intensive and non-planned management schemes may negatively affect vital rates and long-term dynamics of populations from non-timber forest products and other components of the ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2895785546,"The purpose of this study was to clarify whether foot strike patterns are associated with different sprint performance and kinematics in preadolescent boys. The study enrolled 24 healthy 10–11-year-old boys in the fifth grade at public elementary schools in Japan. The participants performed the 50-m sprint with maximum effort. Sprint motion was recorded using a high-speed video camera (120 fps) placed in the sagittal plane on the left side of a line drawn at 35-m from the start line. Kinematic variables were calculated based on manually digitized body landmark coordinates. The participants were categorized into two groups according to their foot strike pattern (rearfoot strikers, RF group, n = 12; forefoot or midfoot strikers, FF/MF group, n = 12). The time taken to complete the 50-m sprint in the FF/MF group (9.08±0.52 s) was faster than that in the RF group (9.63±0.51 s). The FF/MF group had greater sprint speed, higher step frequency, and shorter foot contact time than the RF group. Regarding the association between foot strike pattern and sprint kinematics, we found that the RF group had a greater range of knee flexion during the support-leg phase, whereas the FF/MF group had shorter horizontal distance from the heel of the support leg to the centre of mass at the touchdown, greater maximal knee flexion velocity during the swing-leg phase, and higher the maximum hip extension velocity during the support-leg phase. The current results suggested that, in preadolescent boys, forefoot or midfoot strike (rather than rearfoot strike) is effective for obtaining a higher step frequency and sprint speed through greater magnitude of knee flexion and hip extension movement velocities during the swing and support phases, respectively. The current findings will be useful for understanding the characteristics of the development of sprinting performance in preadolescent children."
https://openalex.org/W2896766263,"Studies on paleopathological alterations in fossil vertebrates, including damages caused by infections and ectoparasites, are important because they are potential sources of paleoecological information. Analyzing exoskeleton material (isolated osteoderms, carapace and caudal tube fragments) from fossil cingulates of the Brazilian Quaternary Megafauna, we identified damages that were attributed to attacks by fleas and dermic infections. The former were compatible with alterations produced by one species of flea of the genus Tunga, which generates well-delimited circular perforations with a patterned distribution along the carapace; the latter were attributable to pathogenic microorganisms, likely bacteria or fungi that removed the ornamentation of osteoderms and, in certain cases, generated craters or pittings. Certain bone alterations observed in this study represent the first record of flea attack and pitting in two species of large glyptodonts (Panochthus and Glyptotherium) and in a non-glyptodontid large cingulate (Pachyarmatherium) from the Quaternary of the Brazilian Intertropical Region. These new occurrences widen the geographic distribution of those diseases during the Cenozoic and provide more evidence for the co-evolutionary interaction between cingulates and parasites registered to date only for a small number of other extinct and extant species."
https://openalex.org/W2896849290,"Language users often infer a person’s gender when it is not explicitly mentioned. This information is included in the mental model of the described situation, giving rise to expectations regarding the continuation of the discourse. Such gender inferences can be based on two types of information: gender stereotypes (e.g., nurses are female) and masculine generics, which are grammatically masculine word forms that are used to refer to all genders in certain contexts (e.g., To each his own). In this eye-tracking experiment (N = 82), which is the first to systematically investigate the online processing of masculine generic pronouns, we tested whether the frequently used Dutch masculine generic zijn ‘his’ leads to a male bias. In addition, we tested the effect of context by introducing male, female, and neutral stereotypes. We found no evidence for the hypothesis that the generically-intended masculine pronoun zijn ‘his’ results in a male bias. However, we found an effect of stereotype context. After introducing a female stereotype, reading about a man led to an increase in processing time. However, the reverse did not hold, which parallels the finding in social psychology that men are penalized more for gender-nonconforming behavior. This suggests that language processing is not only affected by the strength of stereotype contexts; the associated disapproval of violating these gender stereotypes affects language processing, too."
https://openalex.org/W2895949382,"Pre-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in mink kits is a common multifactorial syndrome on commercial mink farms. Several potential pathogens such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus delphini have been studied, but the etiology of the syndrome seems complex. In pooled samples from 38 diarrheic and 42 non-diarrheic litters, each comprising of intestinal contents from 2-3 mink kits from the same litter, the bacterial populations were studied using Illumina Next Generation Sequencing technology and targeted 16S amplicon sequencing. In addition, we used deep sequencing to determine and compare the viral intestinal content in 31 healthy non-diarrheic and 30 diarrheic pooled samples (2-3 mink kits from the same litter per pool). The results showed high variations in composition of the bacterial species between the pools. Enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci dominated in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic pools. However, enterococci accounted for 70% of the reads in the diarrheic group compared to 50% in the non-diarrheic group and this increase was at the expense of staphylococci and streptococci which together accounted for 45% and 17% of the reads in the non-diarrheic and diarrheic group, respectively. Moreover, in the diarrheic pools there were more reads assigned to Clostridia, Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacter compared to the non-diarrheic pools. The taxonomically categorized sequences from the virome showed that the most prevalent viruses in all pools were caliciviruses and mamastroviruses (almost exclusively type 10). However, the numbers of reads assigned to caliciviruses were almost 3 times higher in the diarrheic pools compared the non-diarrheic pools and Sapporo-like caliciviruses were more abundant than the Norwalk-like caliciviruses. The results from this study have contributed to the insight into the changes in the intestinal microbiota associated with the PWD syndrome of mink."
https://openalex.org/W2897850056,"As a step toward the development of variant forms of Env with enhanced immunogenic properties, we have expressed the glycoprotein in the yeast surface display system in a form that can be subjected to random mutagenesis followed by screening for forms with enhanced binding to germline antibodies. To optimize the expression and immunogenicity of the yeast-displayed Env protein, we tested different approaches for cell wall anchoring, expression of gp120 and gp140 Env from different viral strains, the effects of introducing mutations designed to stabilize Env, and the effects of procedures for altering N-linked glycosylation of Env. We find that diverse forms of HIV envelope glycoprotein can be efficiently expressed at the yeast cell surface and that gp140 forms of Env are effectively cleaved by Kex2p, the yeast furin protease homolog. Multiple yeast-displayed gp120 and gp140 proteins are capable of binding to antibodies directed against the V3-variable loop, CD4 binding site, and gp41 membrane-proximal regions, including some antibodies whose binding is known to depend on Env conformation and N-linked glycan. Based on antibody recognition and sensitivity to glycosidases, yeast glycosylation patterns partially mimic high mannose-type N-glycosylation in mammalian cells. However, yeast-displayed Env is not recognized by some anti-Env antibodies sensitive to quaternary structure, suggesting either that the displayed protein exists in a monomeric state or that for these antibodies, yeast glycosylation in certain regions hinders recognition or access. Consistent with studies in other systems, reconstructed predicted unmutated precursors to anti-Env antibodies exhibit little affinity for the yeast-displayed envelope protein."
https://openalex.org/W2896348464,"The rare branched-chain sugar apiose, once thought to only be present in the plant kingdom, was found in two bacterial species: Geminicoccus roseus and Xanthomonas pisi. Glycans with apiose residues were detected in aqueous methanol-soluble fractions as well as in the insoluble pellet fraction of X. pisi. Genes encoding bacterial uridine diphosphate apiose (UDP-apiose) synthases (bUASs) were characterized in these bacterial species, but the enzyme(s) involved in the incorporation of the apiose into glycans remained unknown. In the X. pisi genome two genes flanking the XpUAS were annotated as hypothetical glycosyltransferase (GT) proteins. The first GT (here on named XpApiT) belongs to GT family 90 and has a Leloir type B fold and a putative lipopolysaccharide-modifying (LPS) domain. The second GT (here on XpXylT) belongs to GT family 2 and has a type A fold. The XpXylT and XpApiT genes were cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli. Analysis of nucleotide sugar extracts from E. coli expressing XpXylT or XpApiT with UAS showed that recombinant XpApiT utilized UDP-apiose and XpXylT utilized UDP-xylose as substrate. Indirect activity assay (UDP-Glo) revealed that XpApiT is an apiosyltransferase (ApiT) able to specifically use UDP-apiose. Further support for the apiosyltransferase activity was demonstrated by in microbe co-expression of UAS and XpApiT in E. coli showing the utilization of UDP-apiose to generate an apioside detectable in the pellet fraction. This work provides evidence that X. pisi developed the ability to synthesize an apioside of indeterminate function; however, the evolution of the bacterial ApiT remains to be determined. From genetic and evolutionary perspectives, the apiose operon may provide a unique opportunity to examine how genomic changes reflect ecological adaptation during the divergence of a bacterial group."
https://openalex.org/W2897690546,"In clinical neuropsychology the cognitive abilities of neurological patients are commonly estimated using well-established paper-based tests. Typically, scores on some tests remain relatively well preserved, whilst others exhibit a significant and disproportionate decline. Scores on those tests that measure preserved cognitive functions (so-called 'hold' tests) may be used to estimate premorbid abilities, including scores in non-hold tests that would have been expected prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. Many hold tests entail word reading, with each word being graded as correctly or incorrectly pronounced. Inevitably, such tests are likely to contain words that provide little or no diagnostic power (i.e., can be eliminated without negatively affecting prediction accuracy). In this paper, a genetic algorithm is developed and demonstrated, using n = 92 neurologically healthy participants, to identify optimal word subsets from the National Adult Reading Test that minimize the mean error in predicting the most widely used clinical measure of IQ and cognitive ability, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition IQ. In addition to requiring only 17-20 of the original 50 words (suggesting that this test could be revised to be up to 66% shorter) and minimizing mean prediction error, the algorithm increases the proportion of the variance in the predicted variable explained in comparison to using all words (from r2 = 0.46 to r2 = 0.61). In a clinical setting this would improve estimates of premorbid cognitive function and, if an abbreviated revision to this test were to be adopted, reduce the arduousness of the test for patients. The proposed method is evaluated with jackknifing and leave one out cross validation. The general approach may be used to optimize the relationship between any two psychological tests by finding the question subset in one test that minimizes the prediction error in a second test by training the genetic algorithm using data collected from participants upon whom both tests have been administered. This approach may also be used to develop new predictive tests, since it provides a method to identify an optimal subset of a set of candidate questions (for which empirical data have been collected) that maximizes prediction accuracy and the proportion of variance in the predicted variable that can be explained."
https://openalex.org/W2897505929,"The purpose of the present investigation was to follow-up the effect of specific commandos' training-cycles (SCTCs) on upper-body strength resistance and running endurance performance, as well as determine whether variation in seasonal parameters has any effect on physical performance. Fourteen SCTCs were held over eight years, involving 466 participants. Participants were assigned to four subgroups according to their distribution over the seasons: summer (n = 124), autumn (n = 145), winter (n = 52) and spring (n = 145). Before and after each SCTC, four tests (maximal pull-up, push-up and sit-up repetitions in 70-seconds for muscle strength resistance) and a 5-km cross-country run (endurance) were performed. Seasonal data were continuously recorded during all SCTCs. Body mass decreased significantly (p<0.05) in all groups following SCTCs. These training-cycles induced a significant increase (p<0.05) in the 70-seconds push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups and a decrease (p<0.01) in the 5-km cross-country running time among all trainees. The main effect of the season was present in all tests (p<0.01). With regard to the percentage of changes, the results from the 70-seconds push-up, pull-up and sit-up tests were significantly higher in winter and spring (p<0.01) compared with the two other seasons, while 5-km cross-country performance improvements were significantly higher (p<0.01) in spring and summer, compared to the two other seasons. In summary,14-week of SCTCs improved upper-body strength resistance and running endurance performance in the commandos. Improvements in strength resistance performance were greater during cool weather (winter and spring), while improvements in running endurance performance were higher during hotter (spring and summer) seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2896117614,"While stress is a widely utilized concept, no direct methods facilitating its measurement are currently available. In our previous work we proposed stress entropic load (SEL) as a potential new marker of stress response in the human body. However, at that time no method for SEL measurement existed. In this pilot study we devised and then tested methodology for SEL measurement. Healthy male participants were monitored by indirect calorimetry and thermography while resting and subsequently while under prolonged mental effort. The acquired data was then used to calculate the temporal development of SEL for each participant. Our results show that SEL production increased significantly in participants subjected to prolonged mental effort. Furthermore, we observed that the calculated development of SEL over time may be used to accurately determine the time point at which participants started performing stressful tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2896360033,"Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine) is a widely-distributed but rapidly declining high elevation western North American tree and a candidate for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Our objectives were to develop reliable nuclear microsatellite markers that can be used to assess within-population genetic diversity as well as seed and pollen migration dynamics, and to validate markers using two geographically proximal P. albicaulis populations. We identified 1,667 microsatellite-containing sequences from shotgun DNA libraries of P. albicaulis. Primer pairs were designed for 308 unique microsatellite-containing loci, and these were evaluated for PCR amplification success and segregation in a panel of diploid needle tissue. DNA was extracted with an SDS protocol, and primers were screened through gel electrophoresis. Microsatellites were genotyped through fluorescent primer fragment analysis. Ten novel and 13 transferred loci were found to be reproducible in analyses based on 20 foliage samples from each of two locations: Henderson Mountain, Custer Gallatin National Forest, Montana, and Mt. Washburn, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (USA). Transferred loci had higher numbers of alleles and expected heterozygosities than novel loci, but also revealed evidence for a higher frequency of null alleles. Eight of the 13 transferred loci deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, and showed large positive FIS values that were likely inflated by null alleles. Mantel’s tests of transferred and novel markers showed no correlation between genetic and geographic distances within or among the two sampled populations. AMOVA suggests that 91% of genetic variability occurs within populations and 9% between the two populations. Studies assessing genetic diversity using these microsatellite loci can help guide future management and restoration activities for P. albicaulis."
https://openalex.org/W2896441340,"Community engagement on research design is widely highlighted as an important approach for ethical research. This article reports the experience of consulting with communities on the logo used for an influenza study in Malawi. The logo was designed for use on badges worn by study researchers, participant information sheets and other project documents, and could affect perceptions of the study and consequent engagement in the research.Four focus group discussions were conducted with populations targeted by the influenza study: pregnant women, people with HIV, mothers and community members. The focus groups incorporated a participatory matrix exercise focusing on key themes emerging from the discussions such as: attractiveness, comprehension, acceptability and suggestions for improvement. Findings from the focus groups were analyzed according to these key themes.The consultation highlighted important benefits of discussion with communities on research design, including providing new perspectives and helping to avoid harm. For example, people living with HIV felt that one of the possible logos could increase stigma within communities. The experience also indicated potential challenges of consultation. In particular, there were contrasting perspectives among the groups, such that the consultation did not provide a clear answer about which logo should be selected.Our experience adds to current evidence on community engagement by reporting on an area where there is less discussion of community consultation for design of a study logo. The consultation exercise reaffirmed the value of community engagement, but also the difficulty of relying on a brief consultation for decision-making in research design. Further ethical guidance is required on how to negotiate contradictory views during consultations."
https://openalex.org/W2897279515,"This paper examines social class-based differences in influence in online review contexts. We explore four mechanisms for how a review writer's social class may affect readers' evaluations of the organization. First, we argue that, via a ""contagion"" process, organizations reviewed by higher-class individuals will be evaluated more positively than organizations reviewed by lower-class individuals. Second, we expect that higher-class reviewers will be seen as more knowledgeable; thus, their opinions will be more influential in shaping others' opinions. Third, we expect that reviewers will be seen more influential when they review organizations that match their social class. Fourth, we expect people to be more influenced by those who share their own class background. A large-scale observational study of reviews (N = 1,234,665) from Yelp.com finds support for the contagion, the organization-reviewer social class matching, and the reviewer-participant social matching hypotheses, but disconfirms the hypothesis that higher-class reviewers are always treated as having more expertise. Two experimental studies (N = 354 and N = 638) demonstrate that reviewer class plays a causal role in both a contagion process and in an assumption of higher-class knowledge process, but do not provide evidence for the reviewer-participant social matching hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2898043638,"How one allele interacts with the other for the function of a gene is not well understood. In this study, we tested potential allelic interaction at the Peg3 imprinted locus with several mutant alleles targeting an Imprinting Control Region, the Peg3-DMR. According to the results, maternal deletion of the Peg3-DMR resulted in 2-fold up-regulation of two paternally expressed genes, Peg3 and Usp29. These trans-allelic mutational effects were observed consistently throughout various tissues with different developmental stages. These effects were also associated mainly with the genetic manipulation of the Peg3-DMR, but not with the other genomic changes within the Peg3 locus. The observed trans-allelic effects were unidirectional with the maternal influencing the paternal allele, but not with the opposite direction. Overall, the observed mutational effects suggest the presence of previously unrecognized trans-allelic regulation associated with the Peg3-DMR."
https://openalex.org/W2896644379,"Clapping Music is a minimalist work by Steve Reich based on twelve phased variations of a rhythmic pattern. It has been reimagined as a game-based mobile application, designed with a dual purpose. First, to introduce new audiences to the Minimalist genre through interaction with the piece presented as an engaging game. Second, to use large-scale data collection within the app to address research questions about the factors determining rhythm production performance. The twelve patterns can be differentiated using existing theories of rhythmic complexity. Using performance indicators from the game such as tap accuracy we can determine which patterns players found most challenging and so assess hypotheses from theoretical models with empirical evidence. The app has been downloaded over 140,000 times since the launch in July 2015, and over 46 million rows of gameplay data have been collected, requiring a big data approach to analysis. The results shed light on the rhythmic factors contributing to performance difficulty and show that the effect of making a transition from one pattern to the next is as significant, in terms of pattern difficulty, as the inherent complexity of the pattern itself. Challenges that arose in applying this novel approach are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2896473769,"To assess the quality and diagnostic accuracy of monochromatic images combined with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) performed via spectral computed tomography (CT) in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS).Sixty-two patients with BCS underwent pectral CT with upper abdominal two-phase contrast-enhanced scanning to generate a 60keV monochromatic energy level combined with ASIR (ranging from 0% -100%) during the portal venous phase (PVP) and the hepatic venous phase (HVP). One-way ANOVA was used to compare vessel-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the portal vein (PV), hepatic vein (HV), and inferior vena cava (IVC). Subjective evaluations of the images in the three groups were conducted by image quality assessors and compared via Kruskal-Wallis H test.The CNR values of the PV trunk, HV, IVC, liver parenchyma and pancreas were within ASIR (ranging from 0% - 100%) weight, and the difference were statistically significant (p <0.05). The highest overall image score was distributed at 50% ASIR weight value. Higher CNR values of HV, hepatic parenchyma and pancreas were obtained in the IVC type than in mixed and HV types (respective p values = 0.035, 0.019 and 0.042). Higher CNR values of the IVC were obtained in the HV type than in mixed and IVC types (p = 0.032). The CNR value of the IVC in the mixed type was less than that of the HV type (p = 0.028). The CNR values of the HV and liver parenchyma in mixed type were lower than those of the IVC type (p = 0.016 and 0.038, respectively). The CNR value of pancreas in IVC type was higher than that of the HV type (p = 0.037). The diagnostic value of CNR in patients with the IVC type was higher than that in patients with mixed and HV type, while the diagnostic value of CNR was found to be the lowest for the HV type (p = 0.043).A monochromatic energy level of 60 keV with 50% ASIR can significantly improve image quality in cases of BCS."
