We hypothesized that activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in response to increased muscle activity stimulated Pgc-1α gene transcription as part of the mechanisms for skeletal muscle adaptation. Here we report that a single bout of voluntary running induced a transient increase of Pgc-1α mRNA expression in mouse plantaris muscle, concurrent with an activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in cultured C2C12 myocytes stimulated Pgc-1α promoter activity, which could be blocked by the specific inhibitors of p38, SB203580 and SB202190, or a dominant negative p38. Furthermore, the p38-mediated increase in Pgc-1α promoter activity was enhanced by increased expression of the downstream transcription factor ATF2 and completely blocked by ATF2ΔN, a dominant negative ATF2. Skeletal muscle-specific expression of a constitutively active activator of p38, MKK6E, in transgenic mice resulted in enhanced Pgc-1α and cytochrome oxidase IV protein expression in fast-twitch skeletal muscles. These findings suggest that contractile activity-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway promotes Pgc-1α gene expression and skeletal muscle adaptation.

Adult skeletal muscle is remarkably plastic (1Booth F.W. Baldwin K.M. Rowell L.B. Shepard J.T. The Handbook of Physiology.

The Handbook of Physiology: Integration of Motor, Circulatory, Respiratory and Metabolic Control During Exercise. Oxford University Press, Bethesda, MD1996: 1124-1150Google Scholar). Increased contractile activity, such as endurance exercise, elicits multiple signals to activate a large set of genes, leading to phenotypic changes in skeletal muscle, including IIb-to-IIa fiber type switching, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and angiogenesis, to match physiologic capability to functional demand. To date, the signaling pathways that link the neuromuscular activity to the gene regulatory machinery are not fully understood.PGC-1α, 1The abbreviations used are: PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α; Pgc-1αL, Pgc-1α-luciferase; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; MHC, myosin heavy chain; RT, reverse transcription; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COXIV, cytochrome oxidase IV; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α; Pgc-1αL, Pgc-1α-luciferase; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; MHC, myosin heavy chain; RT, reverse transcription; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COXIV, cytochrome oxidase IV; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. a transcriptional co-activator cloned from a differentiated brown fat cell line (3Puigserver P.

Kralli A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence are consistent with the notion that PGC-1α functions in promoting oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle. Firstly, overexpression of PGC-1α in cultured myoblasts increases mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative respiration (5Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar), and muscle-specific overexpression of PGC-1α in transgenic mice results in enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and more slow-twitch (type I) fiber formation (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Secondly, endurance exercise induces PGC-1α mRNA and protein expression in rats and humans (7Terada S. Tabata I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E208-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Baar K. Wende A.R. Jones T.E. Marison M. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Kelly D.P. Holloszy J.O.

Thirdly, more slow-twitch fiber formation evoked by genetic or pharmacologic means is associated with enhanced expression of PGC-1α mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle (10Zong H. Ren J.M. Young L.H. Pypaert M. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15983-15987Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 11Wu H. Kanatous S.B. Thurmond F.A. Gallardo T. Isotani E. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Science. 2002; 296: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Finally, PGC-1α mRNA and protein are highly expressed in slow-twitch, oxidative (type I), and fast-twitch oxidative fibers (type IIa) compared with the fast glycolytic fibers (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar, 11Wu H.

Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether exercise-induced PGC-1α expression in skeletal muscle is essential for enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and/or IIb-to-IIa fiber type switching, the latter being different from the reported function of PGC-1α in transgenic mice in promoting more type I fiber formation (6Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar).Exercise-induced expression of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle is, at least in part, because of increased transcription (9Pilegaard H. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 851-858Crossref Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Human, mouse, and rat PGC-1α promoters share an overall 80-90% identity, suggesting conserved regulation of the PGC-1α gene. The functional roles of several sequence elements within the PGC-1α promoter have been tested in cultured myocytes (13Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Fishman G.I. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and in mature skeletal muscle in vivo (15Akimoto T. Sorg B.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C790-C796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PGC-1α itself regulates the promoter activity in a positive autoregulation loop, through myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) at a binding site (-1539) (14Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), possibly through its interaction with MEF2 (16Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A dominant negative form of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) or mutation of the CRE site (-222) reduces the activation of PGC-1α promoter by an activated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) (14Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). We have recently confirmed the importance of the MEF2 and CRE binding sites for contractile activity-induced activation of the Pgc-1α promoter in living mice (15Akimoto T. Sorg B.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C790-C796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings reveal the importance of regulatory factors that bind the CRE and MEF2 consensus sites in Pgc-1α gene regulation.The p38 MAPK pathway in skeletal muscle has been a focus of recent research. In particular, p38 MAPK activity is necessary for myogenic cell differentiation (17Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in glucose metabolism and energy expenditure (18Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 19Niu W. Huang C. Nawaz Z. Levy M. Somwar R. Li D. Bilan P.J. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17953-17962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the p38 MAPK pathway plays a functional role in skeletal muscle adaptation to changing patterns of contractile work (20Boppart M.D. Hirshman M.F. Sakamoto K. Fielding R.A. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C352-C358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Irrcher I. Adhihetty P.J. Sheehan T. Joseph A.M. Hood D.A. Am. J.

Based on several previous findings, we propose that the functional role of the p38 MAPK pathway in skeletal muscle adaptation is mediated through regulation of PGC-1α expression and activity. For example, p38 MAPK can directly stimulate upstream transcription factors of the Pgc-1α gene, such as ATF2 and MEF2 (14Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tarr P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 25Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK can also de-repress PGC-1α activity by inhibiting the repressor p160 Myb-binding protein (27Fan M. Rhee J. St-Pierre J. Handschin C. Puigserver P. Lin J. Jaeger S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and promote PGC-1α function (18Puigserver P. Rhee J. Lin J. Wu Z. Yoon J.C. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Mootha V.K. Lowell B.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44495-44501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct evidence that p38 activity stimulates Pgc-1α gene transcription in skeletal muscle, and it is not known whether activation of this pathway is sufficient to induce, and necessary for, skeletal muscle adaptation.In this study, we subjected mice to voluntary running, a physiological model of exercise that mimics many aspects of endurance exercise-induced adaptation, such as fiber type switching, mitochondrial biogenesis, and angiogenesis (12Akimoto T. Ribar T.J. Williams R.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Waters R.E. Rotevatn S. Li P. Annex B.H. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1342-C1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that voluntary running activates the p38 MAPK pathway and stimulates Pgc-1α mRNA expression. A link between an activated p38 MAPK pathway and the Pgc-1α transcription was established in cultured myogenic cells. We further demonstrated that muscle-specific activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in transgenic mice was sufficient to enhance PGC-1α expression and promote mitochondrial biogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Adult (8-week-old) male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were housed in temperature-controlled (21 °C) quarters with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provided with water and food (Purina Chow) ad libitum. The running cage used was described previously (29Waters R.E. Rotevatn S. Li P. Annex B.H. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1342-C1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Allen D.L. Harrison B.C. Maass A. Bell M.L. Byrnes W.C. Leinwand L.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1900-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mice in the running group were subjected to voluntary running for different lengths of time as specified under “Results.” Plantaris muscles were harvested under anesthesia (50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, intraperitoneal) and processed for further analyses. For long-term (4-week) voluntary running mice, the muscle samples were harvested following a 24-h resting period (with locked wheels) after the last bout of running. Animal protocols were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Generation of Transgenic Mice—To examine the relevance of the p38 MAPK-signaling pathway to adaptation in intact muscles, we generated transgenic mouse lines with overexpression of a constitutively active MKK6, MKK6E, in skeletal muscles by using a standard protocol at the Transgenic Mouse Facility of Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Briefly, a PCR fragment of C-terminal FLAG-tagged MKK6E coding region (31Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 32Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) was inserted into a pTarget expression vector (Promega). A 1.5-kb HindIII-HindIII DNA fragment containing this coding region with an upstream chimeric intron was then inserted into plasmid MCKhGHpolyA between a 4.8-kb proximal region from the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (33Naya F.J. Mercer B. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4545-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and the human growth hormone polyadenylation site. The MCK promoter, preferentially active in adult skeletal muscles, drove the expression of MKK6E independent of upstream signals (31Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). PCR analysis was employed for genotyping and confirming the expression of the transgene in adult skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle samples were harvested from the F1 generation of the transgenic lines and the wild-type littermates (B6SJLF1/J:C57BL6/J background) at 8 weeks of age.Indirect Immunofluorescence—For fiber type composition determination, plantaris muscles were harvested and frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cross-sections (5 μm) were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies against myosin heavy chains (MHC) I, IIa, and IIb as described previously (12Akimoto T. Ribar T.J. Williams R.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Semiquantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from skeletal muscles by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to measure endogenous PGC-1α mRNA expression in plantaris muscle in response to voluntary running as described previously (12Akimoto T. Ribar T.J. Williams R.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Yan Z. Choi S. Liu X. Zhang M. Schageman J.J. Lee S.Y. Hart R. Lin L. Thurmond F.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8826-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Western Immunoblot Analysis—For protein analysis, dissected plantaris muscles were homogenized and analyzed as described previously (12Akimoto T. Ribar T.J. Williams R.S. Yan Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1311-C1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunoblot analysis were PGC-1α polyclonal antibody (SC-13067, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-tubulin antibody (13-8000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and MHC mouse monoclonal antibodies (BF-F8 for MHC I, SC-71 for MHC IIa, and BF-F3 for MHC IIb, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). For phosphoprotein detection, the following antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology were used: P-MKK3/6 (9231), MKK3 (9232), P-p38 (9211), p38 (9212), P-ATF2 (9221), and ATF2 (9222). To detect FLAG-tagged MKK6E transgene expression in cultured C2C12 myocytes, ∼15 μg of proteins in total cell lysate for each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (F-7425, Sigma) with a dilution of 1:1000 as described above. The intensities of the immunoblot bands were quantified by using ImageQuant software.Plasmid Constructs, Tissue Culture, Cell Transfection, and Reporter Assay—The Pgc-1α-luciferase reporter gene (Pgc-1αL) was kindly supplied by Dr. E. N. Olson (13Czubryt M.P. McAnally J. Fishman G.I. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs containing FLAG-tagged MKK3E, MKK6E, p38 (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ), and the non-phosphorylatable p38 (p38βAF) under the control of the constitutively active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in pcDNA3 were generously provided by Dr. J. Han. The full-length ATF2 cDNA was cloned by an RT-PCR reaction using a skeletal muscle total RNA with forward primer 5′-CGGATCCAATATGAGTGATGACAAACCCTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGTACCACTTCCTGAGGGCTGTGC-3′. The expected 1.5-kb PCR fragment was inserted into pTarget vector (Promega) to generate plasmid CMV-ATF2, in which ATF2 expression is under the control of the constitutively active CMV promoter. Non-phosphorylatable mutant ATF2, ATF2(T69A/T71A), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (36Yan Z. Serrano A.L. Schiaffino S. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17361-17366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the changes in the following sequence are underlined: 5′-GTGGCTGATCAGGCTCCAGCGCCAACAAGATTCC-3′. The dominant negative ATF2ΔN, kindly provided by Dr. G. Thiel (37Steinmuller L. Thiel G. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), is a truncated ATF2 with N-terminal deletion from amino acids 1-137. For transient transfection, C2C12 myoblasts were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Myoblasts were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For each transfection, 50 ng of PGC-1αL and 60 ng of plasmid DNA containing MKK3E, MKK6E, p38α, p38β, p38δ, p38γ, p38βAF, ATF2, ATF2(T69A/T71A), or ATF2ΔN were co-transfected with 50 ng of plasmid DNA SV40-LacZ as a control for the transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (38Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In the experiments with transfected C2C12 myocytes with MCK-MKK6E, myogenic differentiation was induced in C2C12 cells for 4 days by changing the culture medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum. All transfection data are presented as means of a minimum of three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate.Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett test for comparisons between two groups or multiple groups, respectively.RESULTSVoluntary Running Induces Skeletal Muscle Adaptation and PGC-1α Protein Expression—Wild-type mice were subjected to voluntary wheel running for 4 weeks. The running distance increased from 6.7 ± 0.6 kilometers/night (12 h in the dark) on the first day to 13.6 ± 2.0 kilometers/night after 4 weeks of training (p < 0.05, n = 5). Long-term voluntary running resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in the percentage of type IIa fibers and a concurrent decrease in type IIb fibers (Fig. 1 and Table I). Western immunoblot analysis showed significant increases of MHC IIa (250%) and PGC-1α (50%) proteins in plantaris muscles after 4 weeks of running (Fig. 2).Fig. 1Voluntary running induces type IIb-to-IIa fiber type switching in mouse skeletal muscle. Indirect immunofluorescence staining is shown of type I (red), IIa (blue), IIb (green), and IId/x (no staining) myofibers in mouse plantaris muscles in sedentary control mice and in mice after 4 weeks of running (Trained). An increased percentage of type IIa myofibers with a concurrent decrease in type IIb myofibers is noticeable in trained plantaris muscle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IVoluntary running-induced change in fiber type composition in mouse plantaris muscle Values are mean ± S.E., n = 7.Fiber typeControlaSedentary control miceTrainedbMice after 4 weeks of voluntary running%%IcMyofibers stained positive for MHC I with antibody BA-F80.04 ± 0.040.01 ± 0.01IIadMyofibers stained positive for MHC IIa with antibody SC-7117.1 ± 1.531.7 ± 1.7eSignificant difference between the control and trained mice with p < 0.05IIbfMyofibers stained positive for MHC IIb with antibody BF-F366.8 ± 2.151.9 ± 1.4eSignificant difference between the control and trained mice with p < 0.05IId/xgMyofibers with negative staining16.1 ± 0.716.4 ± 0.9a Sedentary control miceb Mice after 4 weeks of voluntary runningc Myofibers stained positive for MHC I with antibody BA-F8d Myofibers stained positive for MHC IIa with antibody SC-71e Significant difference between the control and trained mice with p < 0.05f Myofibers stained positive for MHC IIb with antibody BF-F3g Myofibers with negative staining Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Voluntary running induces skeletal muscle adaptation.

Recent work demonstrated the importance of the tuberous sclerosis protein TSC2 for regulation of mTOR by insulin. TSC2 contains a GTPase-activator domain that promotes hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rheb, which positively regulates mTOR signaling. Some studies have suggested that TSC2 also mediates the control of mTOR by amino acids. In cells lacking TSC2, amino acid withdrawal still results in dephosphorylation of S6K1, ribosomal protein S6, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein, and elongation factor-2 kinase. The effects of amino acid withdrawal are diminished by inhibiting protein synthesis or adding back amino acids. These studies demonstrate that amino acid signaling to mTOR occurs independently of TSC2 and involves additional unidentified inputs. Although TSC2 is not required for amino acid control of mTOR, amino acid withdrawal does decrease the proportion of Rheb in the active GTP-bound state. Here we also show that Rheb and mTOR form stable complexes, which are not, however, disrupted by amino acid withdrawal. Mutants of Rheb that cannot bind GTP or GDP can interact with mTOR complexes. We also show that the effects of hydrogen peroxide and sorbitol, cell stresses that impair mTOR signaling, are independent of TSC2. Finally, we show that the ability of energy depletion (which impairs mTOR signaling in TSC2+/+ cells) to increase the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 is also independent of TSC2. This likely involves the phosphorylation of the elongation factor-2 kinase by the AMP-activated protein kinase.

The regulation of mRNA translation in mammalian cells involves the coordinated control of a number of components of the translational apparatus. Several of them are regulated through signaling via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 1The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; BCAA, branched-chain amino acids; CHX, cycloheximide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; GAP, GT-Pase-activator protein; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Rheb, Ras homologue enriched in brain; S6, ribosomal protein S6; S6K1, S6 kinase 1; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; AICAR, AICA-riboside (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside); HEK, human embryonic kidney; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

Biol. 2001; 27: 143-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These include the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) (3Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the translational repressor protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (2Gingras A.-C. Raught B.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5360-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of these proteins is regulated in a rapamycin-sensitive (i.e. mTOR-dependent) manner and serves to modulate the activity of each of them. It is well established that the phosphorylation of these proteins is regulated by insulin and amino acids. In many types of cells, withdrawal of amino acids results in dephosphorylation of the S6Ks, 4E-BP1 and eEF2 kinase, and prevents the regulation of the phosphorylation of these proteins by insulin (reviewed in Refs. 1Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 215-244PubMed Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell.

Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, these effects operate such that amino acid withdrawal switches off key steps in the process of translation, which clearly makes physiological sense given that amino acids are the precursors for this process. The fact that they regulate multiple proteins that lie downstream of mTOR suggests that they, in some way, modulate the activity of mTOR. However, it is not known how amino acids exert these effects. mTOR forms a complex with other proteins (e.g. the scaffold protein raptor (7Kim D.H. Sarbassov D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R.

Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar)). Some evidence has been presented to suggest that amino acids decrease the binding of raptor to mTOR (7Kim D.H. Sarbassov D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar), although the mechanism is unclear. Other data indicate that, in vertebrate cells, mTOR signaling is actually regulated by intracellular rather than extracellular amino acids (9Christie G.R. Hajduch E. Hundal H.S. Proud C.G. Taylor P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9952-9957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Beugnet A. Tee A.R. Taylor P.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 372: 566Google Scholar). Thus, the pool of amino acids that regulates mTOR signaling probably receives contributions from extracellular amino acids and from amino acids generated by protein breakdown, including autophagy (10Beugnet A. Tee A.R. Taylor P.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 372: 566Google Scholar). Recently, important advances have been made in understanding the control of mTOR signaling by stimuli such as insulin. This involves the proteins termed hamartin and tuberin (also called TSC1 and TSC2) that together act to suppress mTOR signaling (11Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Recent data show that TSC2 functions as a GTPase-activator protein (GAP) for the small G-protein Rheb, which in its GTP-liganded state activates mTOR signaling, although the mechanism by which it does this is unclear (reviewed in Ref. 12Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TSC2 by protein kinase B (also termed Akt) is thought to inactivate its GAP function, thus activating Rheb and mTOR. Because insulin activates protein kinase B via PI 3-kinase, this provides a mechanism by which insulin (and other agents that activate PI 3-kinase) can turn on mTOR signaling. There is currently a high level of interest in this area due, for example, to connections between mTOR signaling and a range of human diseases. These include tuberous sclerosis, which is caused by mutations in the genes for TSC1 or TSC2, and certain types of cancer (e.g. those caused by inactivation of the lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) (13Houghton P.J. Huang S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 339-359PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the beneficial effects of rapamycin have been reported for conditions such as restenosis after angioplasty (14Fattori R. Piva T. Lancet. 2003; 361: 247-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), liver fibrosis (15Zhu J. Wu J. Frizell E. Liu S.L. Bashey R. Rubin R. Norton P. Zern M.A. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1198-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), Huntington chorea (16Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S.

Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar), and tumor angiogenesis (17Guba M. von Breitenbuch P. Steinbauer M. Koehl G. Flegel S. Hornung M. Bruns C.J. Zuelke C. Farkas S. Anthuber M. Jauch K.W. Geissler E.K. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Despite this important progress in understanding how insulin regulates mTOR signaling, it remains unclear how amino acids regulate the pathway. It has been suggested previously that the effects of amino acids on mTOR signaling may be mediated through TSC1/2. For instance, the effects of amino acid withdrawal on S6K1 were apparently lost in cells in which TSC2 levels had been decreased or its function compromised (18Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). These studies employed insect cells in which the levels of TSC2 had been decreased by RNA interference or cells from the Eker rat in which TSC2 has undergone a C-terminal truncation (18Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A limitation in both those earlier studies is that these cells did not completely lack TSC2 but harbored a mutated form of the protein or residual TSC2. Nevertheless, the idea has developed that TSC2 is involved in the amino acid-sensing mechanisms that control mTOR signaling. Consistent with this, Tee et al. (11Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of TSC1/2 impaired the ability of amino acids to activate S6K1. Conversely, ectopic expression of Rheb activated mTOR signaling in amino acid-deprived cells. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (19Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) reported that nutrient starvation still impaired mTOR signaling in cells lacking TSC2. However, in their study the effects of amino acids were only partial, leaving open the possibility that there exists a TSC2-independent mechanism by which amino acids control mTOR signaling, and no comparison with the corresponding TSC2+/+ cells was conducted. Furthermore, although there are several targets for the mTOR pathway, each of which is phosphorylated at multiple sites, previous work has focused on the role of TSC2 in the amino acid control of S6K1. Regulation of targets of mTOR signaling may involve more than one output from mTOR; for example, 4E-BP1 contains two regulatory motifs that act in distinct ways to modulate the phosphorylation of different sites (20Schalm S.S. Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 21Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Beugnet A. Wang X. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40717-40722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that ATP depletion leads to impairment of mTOR signaling, through the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (23Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). This is likely mediated by the direct phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK (24Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Earlier work showed that depletion of cellular ATP, or other treatments that activate the AMPK, cause pronounced increases in the phosphorylation of eEF2 (25Horman S. Browne G.J. Krause U. Patel J.V. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A. Hue L. Proud C.G. Rider M.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1419-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 26Browne G.J. Finn S.G.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although more recent data suggest that this could be mediated through TSC2, AMPK also directly phosphorylates the kinase that acts on eEF2, eEF2 kinase, and this is associated with its activation (26Browne G.J. Finn S.G. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12220-12231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We therefore considered it important to exploit the availability of TSC2 null cells to test the involvement of TSC2 in the control of eEF2 and eEF2 kinase by ATP depletion and other situations that activate AMPK. Finally, other stressful conditions lead to an impairment of mTOR signaling as assessed by effects on S6K1, ribosomal protein (RP) S6, and 4E-BP1 (see Refs. 28Patel J. McLeod L.E. Vries R.G. Flynn A.

Many stressful conditions (e.g. hyperosmolarity) lead to activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway which, via the downstream kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2, may modulate the function of TSC2 (34Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Li Y. Inoki K. Yeung R. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44593-44596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We therefore also wished to test whether the effects of other stresses on mTOR signaling required TSC2. Here we have performed a detailed analysis of the effects of amino acid starvation and other stresses on multiple targets of mTOR signaling in TSC2+/+ and TSC2–/– cells. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that amino acid deprivation does indeed impair mTOR signaling in TSC2–/– cells. This implies (i) that TSC2 is not essential for the effects of amino acids on mTOR signaling and thus (ii) that additional mechanisms exist, independent of TSC2, for the control of mTOR by amino acids. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effects of ATP depletion and AMPK activation on the phosphorylation of eEF2 are also independent of TSC2, as are the effects of selected cell stresses on mTOR signaling. These data imply that regulation of targets of the mTOR pathway involves mechanisms that operate independently of TSC2, so that additional regulatory inputs operate to control mTOR signaling in mammalian cells.

Fingar D.C. Sabatini D.M. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 797-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar)). These MEF cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Prior to treatment, 90% confluent MEF cells were starved of serum (see legends for details) for 16 h. To starve cells of external amino acids, plates were rinsed once in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm d-glucose (D-PBS/glucose) and then incubated in the same solution plus MEM vitamins diluted 1:25 (v/v) (for the times indicated in the figures). Cells were then treated with insulin or rapamycin where indicated (at the final concentrations and times indicated in figures). For certain control experiments, a mixture of amino acids was added to the D-PBS/glucose for the duration of the amino acid starvation. Alternatively, amino acids were added back (for 30 min) to cells that had been kept in D-PBS/glucose for 90 min. The composition of the amino acid mixture is exactly as given in Ref. 10Beugnet A. Tee A.R. Taylor P.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 372: 566Google Scholar. For treatment of cells with stress-inducing agents, cells were grown to near confluence prior to exposure to sodium arsenite, hydrogen peroxide, or sorbitol for 30 min at the indicated concentrations. For experiments to address the role of AMPK in regulating targets of the mTOR pathway, 90% confluent MEF cells were placed in low glucose medium (see text for details). Cells were then treated with AICAR or 2-deoxyglucose at the final concentrations and times indicated in the figures. Control cells received an appropriate dose of the relevant vehicle. Cells were lysed by scraping into our standard extraction buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain (pH 7.4)). Lysates were briefly centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415D microcentrifuge to remove debris. Protein concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined using the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 77: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate eEF2 kinase, supernatants were removed to fresh tubes and then rotated at 4 °C in the presence of protein G-Sepharose prebound to anti-eEF2 kinase antibody. Analysis of the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was performed by affinity-purifying eIF4E from cell lysates followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (38Wang X. Li W. Parra J.-L. Beugnet A. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Assays for eEF2 Kinase and AMPK—eEF2 kinase and AMPK were assayed as described previously (26Browne G.J. Finn S.G. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12220-12231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). AMPK was assayed after immunoprecipitation using the “AMARA” peptide. Guanine Nucleotide Binding to Rheb in Vivo—HEK293 cells grown on 10-cm2 plates were incubated in 5 ml of phosphate-free medium containing 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. These cells were then harvested in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton). FLAG-tagged Rheb was immunoprecipitated for 1 h with anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice each with both buffer A and buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton) in the presence of protease inhibitors. 32P-Labeled GTP and GDP were eluted from Rheb using 20 μl of elution buffer (0.5 mm GDP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS) at 68 °C for 20 min and then resolved by TLC on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Sigma) with KH2PO4. [32P]GTP and 32[P]GDP levels were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Vectors—N-terminal Ha-tagged Rheb/pRK7 was generated by subcloning Rheb from FLAG-Rheb/pRK7 into pKH3. FLAG-tagged TSC1, TSC2, and Rheb were generated as described previously (39Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The vector encoding AU1-tagged mTOR was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Abraham (Burnham Institute, San Diego). Immunoprecipitation of Rheb-mTOR Complexes—HEK293 cells overexpressing AU1-mTOR and either FLAG-Rheb or HA-Rheb were harvested in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2% CHAPS (Calbiochem). Rheb was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with either anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in extraction buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for detection of both mTOR and Rheb. mTOR was detected using mTAB1 antibodies, kindly provided by Professor Dick Denton (University of Bristol, UK). Determination of BCAA Concentrations—Where indicated TSC2–/– cells were starved of serum for 16 h and also in some cases (indicated) of amino acids for the times shown, followed in some cases by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide as indicated in figure legends. For BCAA measurement experiments only, cells were lysed in 0.3 m perchloric acid. Samples of cleared, neutralized cell lysates were incubated with BCAA dehydrogenase as described (40Gleeson M. Maughan R.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1986; 156: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Assays were then diluted with 300 μl of water and fluorescence intensity read at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Fluorescence blanks were prepared for each sample by substituting the glycerol vehicle for enzyme. The assays were calibrated using leucine standards (0–200 μmol/liter) in place of cell supernatants. Gel Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Other Procedures—These procedures were performed as described previously (41Price N.T. Nakielny S.F. Clark S.J. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the mobilities of different forms of 4E-BP1, resolving gels containing 13.5% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.36% (w/v) methylenebisacrylamide were used. To study the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein, S6 gels containing 15% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.1% (w/v) methylenebisacrylamide were used. All other standard resolving gels contained 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.1% (w/v) methylenebisacrylamide. Equal amounts of cell protein were loaded into each lane, and equal loading of the samples was generally further confirmed by Western blot analysis with the appropriate antisera. Blots were developed using ECL. Reproducibility and Quantitation—Where indicated, the data have been quantitated using the Image/J software (available at rsb.info.nih. gov/ij/). The ratios arrived at in this way are arbitrary and do not indicate, for example, true stoichiometries. In all cases, data are representative of at least three independent experiments, where similar data were obtained. Other information about the analysis of the data is given in the relevant figure legends. Effects of Amino Acid Starvation on Rheb—Although the above data indicate that TSC2 is not required for the effects of amino acid starvation on mTOR signaling, it was still conceivable that Rheb might be affected. We therefore first studied whether amino acid starvation affected the relative amounts of GTP and GDP associated with Rheb. Antisera for Rheb are available commercially. However, despite our repeated attempts to employ them, they proved unsuitable for the analysis of endogenous Rheb, e.g. in MEFs. In Western blots, the antibodies detected multiple bands, raising questions about their specificity, and when used to try to immunoprecipitate Rheb from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells, no bound GDP or GTP was detected, suggesting either that Rheb levels are too low to permit this kind of analysis or that the antibodies work poorly in immunoprecipitation. We therefore expressed Rheb in an epitope (FLAG)-tagged form. However, it is very hard to achieve efficient transfection of MEFs, and we therefore exploited an easily transfectable cell type, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Amino acid starvation inhibits mTOR signaling markedly in HEK293 cells, as judged here from the phosphorylation states of 4E-BP1 and S6 (11Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). When expressed at high levels, Rheb tends to be found almost entirely in its GTP-bound form (42Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This could be a consequence of the abnormally high levels, and we therefore considered it important to study Rheb when it was expressed at levels similar to those of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1A, lowest panel, where endogenous and exogenous Rheb run as a poorly resolved doublet). As expected, the data show that expression of Rheb increases the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1A). Most importantly, amino acid withdrawal reverts 4E-BP1 phosphorylation to basal levels. Thus, low level expression of Rheb does not overcome the effects of amino acid withdrawal, in contrast to the situation when Rheb is highly overexpressed (39Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Amino acid withdrawal caused a reproducible decrease in the proportion of Rheb bound to GTP from about 40% to around 25% (Fig. 1B). By using the available reagents, we cannot yet address the issue of whether amino acid starvation regulates the level of GTP-bound Rheb in TSC2 null cells. One possible explanation for the effects of amino acid withdrawal on the GDP/GTP loading of Rheb could be that amino acid withdrawal leads to activation of the TSC1/2 complex, bringing about the hydrolysis of Rheb-bound GTP. It was therefore important to assess whether the effects of amino acid withdrawal on mTOR signaling required TSC2. Amino Acid Withdrawal Impairs mTOR Signaling in TSC2–/–Cells—Some earlier studies have attempted to address the same issue, but the experimental protocols and cell lines used were such that it was unclear whether the cells used completely lacked functional TSC2. To obviate these problems, we have employed MEFs that have been engineered to be devoid of TSC2 (19Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We confirmed previo"
https://openalex.org/W2026535174,"The restoration of energy balance during ischemia is critical to cellular survival; however, relatively little is known concerning the regulation of neuronal metabolic pathways in response to central nervous system ischemia. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of energy balance in peripheral tissues, is phosphorylated and activated when energy balance is low. We investigated whether AMPK might also modulate neuronal energy homeostasis during ischemia. We utilized two model systems of ischemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo and oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro, to delineate changes in AMPK activity incurred from a metabolic stress. AMPK is highly expressed in cortical and hippocampal neurons under both normal and ischemic conditions. AMPK activity, as assessed by phosphorylation status, is increased following both middle cerebral artery occlusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK by either C75, a known modulator of neuronal ATP levels, or compound C reduced stroke damage. In contrast, activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside exacerbated damage. Mice deficient in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase demonstrated a decrease in both stroke damage and AMPK activation compared with wild type, suggesting a possible interaction between NO and AMPK activation in stroke. These data demonstrate a role for AMPK in the response of neurons during metabolic stress and suggest that in ischemia the activation of AMPK is deleterious. The ability to manipulate pharmacologically neuronal energy balance during ischemia represents an innovative approach to neuroprotection."

Here we report that RNA-bound iron plays a pivotal role for RNA oxidation in vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer disease brain. The cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons showed significantly higher redox activity and iron(II) staining than age-matched controls. Notably, both were susceptible to RNase, suggesting a physical association of iron(II) with RNA. Ultrastructural analysis further suggested an endoplasmic reticulum association. Both rRNA and mRNA showed twice the iron binding as tRNA. rRNA, extremely abundant in neurons, was considered to provide the greatest number of iron binding sites among cytoplasmic RNA species. Interestingly, the difference of iron binding capacity disappeared after denaturation of RNA, suggesting that the higher order structure may contribute to the greater iron binding of rRNA. Reflecting the difference of iron binding capacity, oxidation of rRNA by the Fenton reaction formed 13 times more 8-hydroxyguanosine than tRNA. Consistent with in situ findings, ribosomes purified from Alzheimer hippocampus contained significantly higher levels of RNase-sensitive iron(II) and redox activity than control. Furthermore, only Alzheimer rRNA contains 8-hydroxyguanosine in reverse transcriptase-PCR. Addressing the biological significance of ribosome oxidation by redox-active iron, in vitro translation with oxidized ribosomes from rabbit reticulocyte showed a significant reduction of protein synthesis. In conclusion these results suggest that rRNA provides a binding site for redox-active iron and serves as a redox center within the cytoplasm of vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer disease in advance of the appearance of morphological change indicating neurodegeneration.

Interestingly, a recent study characterizes an iron-responsive element in the 5′-untranslated region of the Alzheimers AβPP transcript, indicating the post-transcriptional regulation of AβPP synthesis by iron (16Rogers J.T.

Because redox-active iron (Fe2+, iron(II)) has a potential to produce a highly reactive ·OH when it meets hydrogen peroxide (Fenton reaction; Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + ·OH + OH–), iron is considered as the likely candidate to mediate oxidative stress in AD.Redox-active iron-mediated oxidative damage to nucleic acids has been extensively studied in DNA (17Henle E.S. Luo Y. Gassmann W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21177-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Luo Y. Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol.

Although the radical species produced by the Fenton reaction in DNA oxidization is still controversial (20Luo Y. Han Z. Chin S.M. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12438-12442Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the location of oxidative damage is suggested as site-directed (21Lloyd D.R. Phillips D.H. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).As for RNA oxidization, recent studies have shown that the Fenton reaction oxidized and cleaved rRNA in cultured primary neurons (22Ding Q. Dimayuga E. Markesbery W.R. Keller J.N. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNAs are known to require divalent metals for functionality and proper folding. It is known that physiologically Mg2+ is used for proper folding of RNAs (23Shiman R. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and redox-active iron has been shown to also bind with RNA at the metal binding site (24Berens C. Streicher B. Schroeder R. Hillen W. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Neurons are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species, which are produced from the mitochondrial electron transport chain because of the high demand for molecular oxygen to maintain their function and metabolism (25% of total body oxidative metabolism is within the brain). To cope with this continuous reactive oxygen species production, neurons possess anti-oxidant machinery. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, the latter being a membrane oxidant capable of reaching throughout the neuronal cytoplasm. Amyloid β of senile plaques and other locations could also be a source of hydrogen peroxide, because it can catalyze superoxide dismutase-like reactions (25Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I.

However, it is likely the mitochondrial abnormalities in AD (27Hirai K. Aliev G. Nunomura A. Fujioka H. Russell R.L. Atwood C.S. Johnson A.B. Kress Y. Vinters H.V. Tabaton M. Shimohama S. Cash A.D.

Zhu X. Takeda A. Perry G. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fenton chemistry may be the mechanism for the extensive damage to all categories of macromolecules characterizing AD.Previously we demonstrated that cytoplasmic RNA of vulnerable neurons is consistently oxidized in AD-vulnerable neurons (5Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because hydroxyl radical mediates oxidative modification of nucleic acids, in the present study we addressed whether redox-active iron is involved in the oxidation of cytoplasmic RNA in vulnerable neurons of AD, especially focusing on ribosomal RNA.MATERIALS AND METHODSNucleic Acids—Bovine rRNA and tRNA were obtained from Sigma. For the preparation of mRNA, total RNA was extracted from M-17 neuroblastoma cells by using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then mRNA was purified with Oligotex mRNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted by using Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, MI).Tissue—Brain tissue was obtained at autopsy from clinically and pathologically confirmed cases of AD (n = 16) using National Institute of Aging and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers disease criteria (29Khachaturian Z.S. Arch. Neurol. 1985; 42: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), and was compared with tissue from non-demented, age, and postmortem interval-matched control cases (n = 16). Hippocampal tissue was fixed in methacarn (methanol/chloroform/acetic acid, 60:30:10, by volume) at 4 °C for 15 h. Following fixation, tissue was placed in 50% ethanol, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin, and sections (6 μm thick) were mounted onto silane-coated slides. To assume that the mildly acidic nature of methacarn fixation does not alter metal ion binding to their tissue sites, some tissues were alternatively fixed in ethanol alone or left unfixed. No difference was seen between these preparation methods (30Sayre L.M. Perry G. Harris P.L. Liu Y. Schubert K.A. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).Histochemistry—Redox staining was performed as previously published (30Sayre L.M. Perry G. Harris P.L. Liu Y. Schubert K.A. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In brief, following deparaffinization in xylene and hydration, sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 with 0.75 mg/ml DAB in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, for 2 h. For comparative analyses, slides were processed simultaneously and incubated with DAB for identical intervals.Iron(II) and iron(III) staining was performed by using an Iron(II)/Iron(III) detection kit (StressGen, British Colombia, Canada) following the manufacturer's direction. This iron detection method is a modification of the well established Prussian blue reaction (13Smith M.A. Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9866-9868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This method involves binding of iron(II) cyanide (ferrocyanide) to iron(III) (for detection of iron(III)) or iron(III) cyanide (ferricyanide) to iron(II) (for detection of iron(II)) to give a brilliant blue mixed-valence iron(II/III) complex, which can be observed directly or that can be enhanced, based on the ability of the mixed-valence complex to catalyze a peroxidase-like H2O2-dependent oxidation of DAB (13Smith M.A. Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9866-9868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The specificity of this reaction has been demonstrated by chelator or direct in situ catalysis of H2O2-mediated oxidation of DAB (13Smith M.A. Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9866-9868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). All treatments with nuclease or iron chelator were performed on adjacent serial sections.For nuclease treatments, tissue sections were incubated with 1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) or 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. For iron chelation, tissue sections were treated with 100 mm deferoxamine mesylate (Sigma) overnight at room temperature.Quantitation of Cytochemistry—Images were assessed by a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a KS300 Imaging System quantitation program. The intensity of the cytoplasmic reaction was evaluated by outlining manually and measuring the OD of the cytoplasm of neurons, excluding the nucleus, in three adjacent fields of the stratum pyramidal of the CA1 field of the hippocampus. To focus on cytoplasmic iron, neurons with NFT were excluded. The OD measurement was obtained for each of the three fields and averaged. The OD value was corrected for background by subtracting the OD of the neurophil on the same section. Measurements were done under the same optical and light conditions, and an electronic shading correction was used to compensate for unevenness arising in the illumination.Dot Blot Analysis—Unless specifically mentioned in the following section, for analysis of redox-active iron binding, nucleic acid solutions were prepared at a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml in 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and 1 μl of the solution per each dot was blotted on positive charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+: Amersham Biosciences). Each dot blot analysis of RNA was done in triplicate. Following UV fixation, the membrane was incubated in 0.01 mm ferrous chloride and 0.01 mm ferric citrate in 12.5 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6, for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. After rinsing with water, the membrane was incubated in 3% H2O2 with 0.75 mg/ml DAB in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, for 6 min at room temperature. Iron(II) and iron(III) staining was performed by the Iron(II)/Iron(III) detection kit (StressGen). The semi-solid phase reaction between iron and RNA in dot blot analysis simulates the condition between redox-active iron and RNA in tissue. Because our finding of iron bound to RNA is based on this histochemical observation, we chose the dot blot approach to analyze our histochemical observations.The blot image was captured immediately by using a scanner (Scan Jet 5370C; Hewlett Packard) and analyzed with the KS300 Imaging System quantitation program. The intensity of reaction was evaluated by measuring the mean OD of each dot outlined manually. The OD measurement was obtained for each of the three dots and averaged. The OD value was corrected by subtracting the background OD. In the case of the dot blot analysis for redox-active iron binding capacity in which different amounts of RNA were used, we assessed the sum of the OD area instead of the mean OD to measure the difference of iron binding when dot size varied.For detection of iron and redox activity in ribosomes from brain tissues, after adjusting the concentration of samples with ribosomal buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) each 1 μl of sample was blotted on the nylon membrane and redox staining and iron(II)/iron(III) staining were performed as described above. To correct for differences of redox-active iron binding to ribosomes because of the difference of the concentration of iron in brain homogenate, iron binding to ribosomes in the brain homogenate was also evaluated. After adjusting the concentration of brain homogenate by the weight of brain tissue, we blotted 1 μl of brain homogenate and examined iron(II), iron(III), and redox activity as mentioned. The OD of ribosome was divided by that of the brain homogenate corresponding to the ribosome sample and expressed as an arbitrary unit. For treatment of ribosome with proteinase K or RNase, the dotted membrane was incubated with 1 μg/ml proteinase K or 1 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6.To detect 8-OHG in RNA, 5 μg of RNA samples were dot blotted on the positive charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+). Following UV fixation, the membrane was incubated with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with the monoclonal antibody 15A3 (1:500; QED Bioscience, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. The specificity of the anti-8-OHG monoclonal antibody on immunocytochemistry, Northwestern blot, and immunoprecipitation has been reported (5Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shan X. Tashiro H. Lin C.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4913-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also confirmed its specificity by antigen absorption with excess 8-OHG and omission of this antibody on immunoprecipitation (details presented under “Immunoprecipitation” below). Additionally, we found increased RNA oxidation in AD brain by analytical analysis of nucleic acids. 2T. Hofer and G. Perry, unpublished observation. The signals were detected with ECL (Santa Cruz) according to the manufacturer's direction and the image was digitally captured. Optical density was analyzed with a KS300 Imaging System as stated above.Oxidation of RNA by the Fenton Reaction—Two hundred μl of RNA sample was incubated in an iron solution (200 μm FeCl2 and 200 μm ferric citrate in 12.5 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6) at 4 °C for 5 min and then hydrogen peroxide (10 mm final concentration) was added. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated with deferoxamine (10 mm final concentration) and chilled on ice for 5 min. The oxidized RNA was precipitated with 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 100% ethanol. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and dried for 5 min. It was resuspended in 20 μl of 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water.Northwestern Blotting—Following oxidization, 20 μg of an RNA sample was electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and capillary-transferred onto positive charged nylon membrane. The membrane was treated in the same manner as the dot blot analysis. The image was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).Electron Microscopy—Ultrastructural localization of redox activity with DAB was performed with tissue from a 75-year-old AD patient with a postmortem interval of 4 h. The tissue was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.5 mm calcium chloride, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the section was incubated in 100% normal goat serum, followed by rabbit anti-serum to DAB (gift of Dr. B. Erlanger, Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York) (32Chen B.X. Szabolcs M.J. Matsushima A.Y. Erlanger B.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 4 °C. Following rinsing, 17-nm gold-labeled goat antiserum to rabbit IgG was applied. The tissue was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then post-fixed in 1.0% OsO4. The specimens were dehydrated and embedded in Spurrs medium, sectioned at 60–100 nm, and contrasted with lead and uranyl salts. The specimens were examined in a Zeiss CEM 902 electron microscope at 80 kV.Preparation of Ribosomes—Hippocampus from postmortem brain (about 2 g) was homogenized by using a glass homogenizer (pestle A 10 times then pestle B 10 times) in 9 ml of ice-cold ribosomal buffer containing 30 units/ml of RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g (Beckman JA20) for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 ml) was transferred onto a 15–40% sucrose gradient (11.5 ml) and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g (Beckman SW 40Ti) for 2 h at 4 °C. Optical density at 254 nm was measured using a UA-5 UV detector (ISCO) and fractions containing monosomes were collected. The fractions were transferred onto a 1 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 45,000 × g (Beckman 50Ti) for20 h at 4 °C. The pellet was reconstituted with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at –80 °C.In Vitro Translation—The poly(U) assay was performed as previously published (33Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Kemper W.M. Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After oxidation of ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes, 0.4 A260 units of ribosomes was used as a component in the following 50-μl reaction mixture (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm GTP, 2.1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 IU of pyruvate kinase, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 A260 units of poly(U), 10 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNA, and saturating levels of 2 μg of eEF-1A and 0.2 μgof eEF-2). The reaction mixtures are incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Then the reaction tubes were heated at 90 °C for 15 min. Precipitated proteins were collected by vacuum filtration onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry.Immunoprecipitation—Ribosomal RNA (1.5 μg) that was purified from the ribosomes were incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-8-OHG antibody 15A3 at 4 °C for 1 h. The integrity and quality of rRNA were confirmed for each sample by gel analysis and spectrophotometry. A260/A280 of each sample fell into the range from 1.8 to 2.0. To further confirm the purity of rRNA, we examined the presence of mRNA with poly(A) tails in the purified rRNA samples by using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). mRNA was not detected in the samples from AD or controls. For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted or preincubated with 24 ng/μl of 8-OHG (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Protein G Plus-agarose (20 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added and incubated with gentle rotation overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.04% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Roche). Then the following reagents were added subsequently: 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 30 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS, and 300 μl of phenol/chloroform solution. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (vortexed every 5 min) and separated into an aqueous phase and an organic phase by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 30 μlof3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 2 μl of 5 mg/ml glycogen, plus 750 μl of ethanol. The sample was frozen at –80 °C for 1 h and centrifuged for 20 min. The sample was washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol and air-dried. It was reconstituted with 15 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water.Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—Immunoprecipitated rRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a Retroscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's directions, and then PCR was performed with specific primers and DNA polymerase (Ambion). The following primers specific for human 28 S and 18 S rRNA were used: 28 S forward, 5′-CGGATTCCGACTTCCATG-3′ (nt 1635–1653: Gen-Bank™ accession M11167), reverse, 5′-TGGTTCCCTCCGAAGTTTC-3′ (nt 1973–1956); 18 S forward, 5′-CCCGAGATTGAGCAATAA-3′ (nt 1470–1487 GenBank accession X03205), reverse, 5′-GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAA-3′ (nt 1738–1720). The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. PCR products were examined on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.RESULTSIn Situ Redox Activity and Redox-active Iron Are Associated with Cytoplasmic RNA in AD—We quantified the intensity of DAB staining in neuronal cytoplasm at the CA1 area in AD (n = 6), and age- and PMI-matched control cases (n = 5) (mean age (year) ± S.D.: AD 73.83 ± 6.68; control: 67.8 ± 7.05; mean PMI (hour) ± S.D.: AD 13.17 ± 9.22, control: 16.36 ± 7.19). We observed a significantly higher level of redox activity in AD than control (p = 0.0021) (Fig. 1A). Because this result is similar to that of cytoplasmic RNA oxidation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in AD (5Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of RNase on redox staining. Pretreatment with RNase A essentially abolished redox staining in CA1 pyramidal neuron cytoplasm, whereas treatment with DNase I had no significant effect, suggesting the association of redox activity with RNA in the neuronal cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). The iron chelator deferoxamine almost completely abolished cytoplasmic redox staining (Fig. 1C). In contrast, adding iron treatment to sections prior to measuring returned redox activity with no difference between AD and control samples (data not shown). These observations suggest the possibility that the redox activity localized in the cytoplasm is because of iron associated with RNA in neurons.To examine whether the redox activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons is derived from redox-active iron (Fe2+), we investigated hippocampus by iron(II) staining (13Smith M.A. Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Perry G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9866-9868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In AD cases (n = 4) the neuronal cytoplasm of CA1 pyramidal neurons was stained clearly, whereas the staining was faint in age- and PMI-matched control (n = 5) (mean age (year) ± S.D.: AD 76.7 ± 11.3; control: 76.6 ± 8.11; mean PMI (hour) ± S.D.: AD 17.5 ± 14.6, control: 26.7 ± 11.0) (Fig. 2, A and B). This difference was also significant (p = 0.0001; Fig. 2C). RNase pretreatment almost completely abolished cytoplasmic iron(II) staining (Fig. 2E), whereas DNase had little effect (Fig. 2F), indicating the physical association of redox-active iron with RNA in the neuronal cytoplasm.Fig. 2Iron(II) staining is increased in CA1 pyramidal neurons in AD. Visualization of iron(II) localized in neuronal cytoplasm. Note the extensive iron staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus of AD brains (B), whereas it remains at low levels in controls (A). The intensity of iron(II) staining expressed as mean density (± S.E.) was analyzed. Note there is a significant difference between AD and age-matched control brains (p = 0.0001). C, cytoplasmic iron(II) staining (D) from a case of AD is almost completely removed with RNase treatment (E), but no apparent change was observed with DNase treatment (F).

Here, we describe three potent PDK1 inhibitors, BX-795, BX-912, and BX-320 (IC50 = 11–30 nm) and their initial biological characterization. The inhibitors blocked PDK1/Akt signaling in tumor cells and inhibited the anchorage-dependent growth of a variety of tumor cell lines in culture or induced apoptosis. A number of cancer cell lines with elevated Akt activity were >30-fold more sensitive to growth inhibition by PDK1 inhibitors in soft agar than on tissue culture plastic, consistent with the cell survival function of the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway, which is particularly important for unattached cells. BX-320 inhibited the growth of LOX melanoma tumors in the lungs of nude mice after injection of tumor cells into the tail vein. The effect of BX-320 on cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo indicates that PDK1 inhibitors may have clinical utility as anticancer agents.

Komander D. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The first identified and best characterized PDK1 substrate is the proto-oncogene Akt (2Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Koutsilieris M. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PDK1 phosphorylates the activation loop of Akt (also called the T-loop) on residue Thr308, which promotes the formation of the enzyme conformation with catalytic activity (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have found a high level of activated Akt in a large percentage (30–60%) of common tumor types, including melanoma and breast, lung, gastric, prostate, hematological, and ovarian cancers. When activated in tumor cells, Akt has multiple effects that promote disease progression, including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis (4Hanada M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 5Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The PDK1/Akt signaling pathway thus represents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of cancer. Akt comprises a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases containing three highly homologous members (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) (2Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Koutsilieris M. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 6Downward J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt in cells by PDK1 requires stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) whose activity becomes highly elevated in many tumors through the up-regulation or mutation of upstream signaling molecules such as epidermal growth factor receptors, Ras, Src, and c-ABL or by overexpression of PI 3-kinase itself (2Mitsiades C.S. Mitsiades N. Koutsilieris M. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Hanada M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC1 is also a common mechanism of Akt activation in tumor cells (7Sansal I. Sellers W.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2954-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). PTEN has D-3 phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and acts as a negative regulator of PI 3-kinase function by removing its products, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-3,4-P2 or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (8Simpson L. Parsons R. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides produced by PI 3-kinase bind directly to the regulatory pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt, driving a conformational change in the molecule which enables the activation loop of AKT1 to be phosphorylated by PDK1 at Thr308 (Thr309 for AKT2 and Thr305 for AKT3) (9Milburn C.C. Deak M. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Alessi D.R. Van Aalten D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Activation of AKT1 is also associated with phosphorylation of Ser473 (Ser474 for AKT2 and Ser472 for AKT3) within a C-terminal hydrophobic motif characteristic of kinases in the AGC kinase family. This modification serves to further enhance the kinase activity of Akt (11Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Although the role of PDK1 in Thr308 phosphorylation is well established, the mechanism of Ser473 phosphorylation is controversial. A number of candidate enzymes responsible for this modification have been put forward, including integrin-linked kinase (12Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), PDK1 when in a complex with the kinase PRK2 (13Balendran A.

Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar). Besides Akt, many other kinases in the AGC kinase superfamily, including PKC, PKA, S6K1, RSK1, SGK, and PRK1, have a homologous region of their activation loops containing a consensus substrate recognition site for PDK1 (19Storz P. Toker A. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 886-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). S6K1 is an important regulator of cell growth which controls the synthesis of ribosomal and other proteins in response to growth factors and nutrients (20Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Activation of S6K1 requires two PDK1-dependent modifications: phosphorylation of Thr389 (21Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), which can be mediated by PDK1 through activation of Akt, and the direct phosphorylation of Thr229 within the activation loop of S6K1 by PDK1 (22Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 23Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Promising preclinical and clinical studies with rapamycin analogs that block S6K1 through inhibition of mTOR (e.g. CCI-779) also implicate S6K1 as a cancer target (24Atkins M.B. Hidalgo M. Stadler W.M. Logan T.F. Dutcher J.P. Hudes G.R. Park Y. Liou S.H. Marshall B. Boni J.P. Dukart G. Sherman M.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). PDK1 can phosphorylate several isoforms of PKC (e.g. PKCδ, PKCζ, and PKCβII) in vitro or in cells cotransfected with PKC isoforms together with PDK1 (25Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 26Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S.

Consistent with these studies, deletion of both PDK1 alleles in embryonic mouse fibroblast cells results in impaired phosphorylation and activation of Akt, S6K1, and PKCζ (28Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Other isoforms of PKC, including PKCα, PKCβII, and PKCδ, showed reduced protein levels (29Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The established role of PDK1 in the regulation of Akt, S6K1, SGK, and PKC points to its importance as a critical regulator of cell signaling in cancer cells and tumor progression. In light of the compelling evidence for the role of PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt signaling in cancer progression, we sought to discover novel small molecule inhibitors that block this pathway for evaluation as anticancer drugs. Our strategy was to screen chemical libraries for lead compounds using a coupled assay measuring PtdIns-3,4-P2- and PDK1-mediated activation of AKT2, with the final assay readout being phosphorylation of a peptide substrate by activated AKT2. From our screen, we identified different mechanistic classes of compounds that blocked PDK1 or AKT2 or that interfered with phosphoinositide-dependent activation of AKT2, possibly through inhibition of the PH domain function. In this paper, we report on the biological characterization of optimized compounds that directly inhibit the activity of PDK1 in vitro and in cells while showing selectivity against a panel of other kinases. These compounds block the growth of a variety of tumor cell lines in culture, in soft agar, and in an animal model, supporting their further evaluation as anticancer agents. Materials—Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Thr308-Akt, phospho-Ser473-Akt, Akt, phospho-Thr389-S6K1, S6K1, phospho-Ser241-PDK1, PDK1, phospho-Thr505-PKCδ, PKCδ, and phospho-Ser21/9-GSK3β, were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Recombinant AKT2 and PDK1, containing N-terminal His tags, were expressed in insect cells and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. λ-Phosphatase was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals were of reagent grade quality. BX-320, BX-795, and BX-912 were synthesized as disclosed previously (42.Bryant, J., Kochanny, M., Yuan, S., Khim, S.-K., Buckman, B., Arnaiz, D., Bömer, U., Briem, H., Esperling, P., Huwe, P., Kuhnke, J., Schäfer, M., Wortmann, L., Kosemund, D., Eckle, E., Feldman, R., and Phillips, G. (June 10, 2004) International Patent WO2004048343Google Scholar). Cell Culture Conditions—The cell lines MDA-468, MDA-453, HCT-116, U87-MG, U2OS, PC-3, B16F10, and MiaPaCa were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). LOX amelanotic human melanoma cells were obtained as a gift from the Norwegian Cancer Institute (Oslo, Norway), and HeLa cells were obtained from the Institute of Molecular Biology (Zurich, Switzerland). Growth media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen and Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA) and were combined following ATCC guidelines. Primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and prostate epithelial cells (PrECs) and their respective growth media were purchased from Clonetics/Cambrex (Baltimore, MD). Kinase Assays—PDK1 was assayed in a direct kinase assay and a coupled assay format measuring PDK1- and PtdIns-3,4-P2-mediated activation of AKT2. For the coupled assay, the final assay mixture (60 μl) contained: 15 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 18 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.7 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgOAc, 7.5 μm ATP, 0.2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 7.5 μm biotinylated peptide substrate (biotin-ARRRDGGGAQPFRPRAATF), 0.5 μl of PtdIns-3,4-P2-containing phospholipid vesicles (3Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 60 pg of purified recombinant human PDK1, and 172 ng of purified recombinant human AKT2. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the biotin-labeled peptide was captured from 10 μl of the assay mixture on streptavidin-coated SPA beads, and product formation was measured by scintillation proximity in a Wallac MicroBeta counter. The product formed was proportional to the time of incubation and to the amount of PDK1 and inactive AKT2 added. PDK1 was added at suboptimal levels so that the assay could sensitively detect inhibitors of AKT2 activation as well as direct inhibitors of PDK1 or AKT2. To measure PDK1 activity directly, the final assay mixture (60 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgOAc, 10 μm ATP, 0.2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 7.5 μm substrate peptide (H2N-ARRRGVTTKTFCGT), and 60 ng of purified recombinant human PDK1. After 4 h at room temperature, we added 25 mm EDTA and spotted a portion of the reaction mixture on Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. The filter paper was washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. After drying, the filter-bound labeled peptide was quantified using a Fuji phosphorimager. Immunoblotting—After treating cells (roughly 80% confluent) as described in the figures, we washed them once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed them with MPER reagent (Pierce), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt protease inhibitor mixture, Pierce; 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated in the figures. Growth Assays—Cells seeded at a low density (1,500–3,000 cells/well, 0.1 ml/well, 96-well plates) were incubated overnight. Compound treatments were made by adding 10 μl/well of the compound in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and growth medium (final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1%), followed by brief shaking. Treated cells were incubated for 72 h, and viability was measured by the addition of 10 μl of the metabolic dye WST-1 (Roche Applied Science). The WST-1 signal was read in a plate reader at 450 nm, and a no cell, or zero time cell, background was subtracted to calculate the net signal. Results are reported as the average ± S.E. of two or more replicates. Apoptosis Assays—Cells were seeded and treated identically to cells in the proliferation assay. After a 48-h treatment, apoptosis was measured by the addition of 0.1 ml/well Apo-One reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Plates were read in a fluorescence plate reader (Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter) after 1 h. The fluorescent readout measured the cleavage of a specific caspase-3/caspase-7 fluorescent substrate (excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm), indicating cells that were undergoing apoptosis. Results are reported as the average ± S.E. of two or more replicates. Soft Agar Assays—Sterile 35-mm plates were prepared with bottom layers of 0.5% agar in growth medium (1.5 ml/plate, agar temperature 48 °C). Trypsinized cells, dispersed into single cells using a 21-gauge needle, were seeded in a 1.5-ml volume of 0.3% agar in growth medium (42 °C temperature) added over the bottom agar layer and allowed to incubate overnight. Compound treatments were applied by adding 1 ml of 0.3% agar in growth medium (containing the compound) on top of the previously established agar layers. Cells incubated for 1 week were treated a second time (1 ml/well). After the 2nd week of treatment, colony growth was measured by adding 0.3 ml nitro blue tetrazolium (0.5 mg/ml stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline) (Sigma). Viable colonies stained dark blue after 24–48 h of incubation. Digitally scanned plates were assessed for total stained area using ImagePro 4.0 software (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Plotted results are the averages of duplicate plates. Cell Cycle Analyses—Subconfluent cells (0.5–2 million cells/100-mm plate, 5 ml/plate) were allowed to incubate overnight. Compound treatments were applied by adding 50 μl of compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (final vehicle concentration, 1%) per plate. After 18 h, cells were fixed, stained for DNA with propidium iodide, and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur cell sorter. The data were quantitated using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Blood-borne Metastasis Animal Model—Athymic (nu/nu) female mice (Simonsen, Gilroy, CA), 6–8 weeks old, were inoculated intravenously (lateral tail vein) on day 0 with 1 × 106 LOX cells, suspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in 10 mm glucose in phosphate-buffered saline (calcium and magnesium-free). Groups (n = 26) were dosed by oral gavage twice daily (12 h apart) with vehicle (20% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, Cavitron 82005, Cargill, Cedar Rapids, IA) or BX-320 dissolved in vehicle (20 mg/ml) adjusted to pH 4. The dose volume was 10 ml/kg (200 mg/kg), and dosing began 2–4 h before cell inoculation and continued until the end of the study. A small, but equal, number of animals died in the vehicle- and BX-320-treated groups during the study, which was related to the dosing regimen and not to compound toxicity. Animals showed no observable side effects of compound treatment. On day 21 (22 days of dosing), mice were euthanized, and the lungs were removed and frozen for future DNA extraction. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures approved by the Berlex Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical analyses were performed with Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Significance was determined by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Quantification of Tumor Burden by Quantitative Real Time PCR—We determined the tumor burden in the mouse lungs by extracting total DNA, then measuring the amount of the human CCR5 gene present by quantitative real time PCR. To extract and purify total DNA, each lung was homogenized in 1 ml of Qiagen ATL buffer (Valencia, CA) with a Mini-Bead Beater-8 (BioSpec) using zirconia silicate beads (2.5 mm; BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK). We performed DNA extractions using the Qiagen QiaAmp DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative PCR, we used the following human CCR5-specific primer set and probes: forward primer, 5′-CCTCTTAGTCTTCTTCCAAAAGCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCGGGAGCCTCTTGCTG-3′; and probe, 5′-FAM-CCAAACGCTTCTGCAAATGCTGTTCTATT-TAMRA-3′. Thermocycling was performed for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 63 °C for 1 min after initial UNG treatment at 50 °C for 2 min with subsequent UNG inactivation and TaqGold activation for 10 min at 95 °C. A standard curve was generated using human genomic DNA (Promega), which was used to calculate the number of human cells/mouse lung, assuming two copies of the gene/diploid cell. Data Curve Fitting—Data were curve fit to a four-parameter logistic equation using Kaleidagraph software, version 3.51 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Identification of Novel Aminopyrimidine Compounds That Block PDK1 Activity in Vitro and in Cells—From screening of compound libraries and lead optimization, we identified three potent and selective inhibitors of PDK1 termed BX-795, BX-912, and BX-320 which contain a common aminopyrimidine backbone (Fig. 1). The compounds were identified in a coupled assay measuring PDK1- and PtdIns-3,4-P2-mediated Akt activation, which could detect inhibitors of PDK1, AKT2, or other steps critical for activation of AKT2 (Fig. 2). We also found that the compounds potently inhibited PDK1 enzyme activity in a direct kinase assay format (IC50 values for BX-795, BX-912, and BX-320 were 11, 26, and 30 nm, respectively), although they failed to block preactivated AKT2 activity (IC50 > 10 μm) (not shown). These data indicate that BX-795, BX-912, and BX-320 are direct inhibitors of PDK1.Fig. 2Potencies of compounds for inhibiting PDK1 kinase activity in vitro. BX-320 (○), BX-795 (□), and BX-912 (▵) were assayed for inhibition of PDK1-mediated AKT2 activation and the direct inhibition of PDK1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative assay data are shown in the figure. The IC50 values for inhibition of the coupled PDK1/AKT2 assay, averaged from n independent experiments, are BX-320, 39 nm (n = 12); BX-795, 6 nm (n = 2); BX-912, 12 nm (n = 14). The average IC50 values for inhibition of the direct PDK1 assay are BX-320, 30 nm (n = 5); BX-795, 11 nm (n = 2); BX-912, 26 nm (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also performed kinetic studies indicating that BX-912, BX-320, and BX-795 are competitive inhibitors of PDK1 activity with respect to its substrate, ATP, suggesting that they bind to the ATP binding pocket of PDK1 (data not shown). To investigate further how the inhibitors bind to PDK1, we prepared crystals of the PDK1 kinase domain (residues 51–359), as described by Biondi et al. (30Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. Van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We then introduced compounds into PDK1 crystals and determined the structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes by x-ray diffraction methods. These studies confirmed that BX-912 and BX-320 bind to the ATP binding site of PDK1. The structure of BX-320 in the active site of PDK1, shown in Fig. 3, reveals two hydrogen bonds between two aminopyrimidine nitrogens and the amino acid backbone of Ala162, which lies in the hinge region of the molecule. The aminopyrimidine backbone of BX-912 adopts a similar orientation in the active site of PDK1 (data not shown). Several published structures of aminopyrimidines bound to the active site of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 show an analogous mode of binding (31Beattie J.F. Breault G.A. Ellston R.P. Green S.

Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3079-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine the kinase selectivity of our PDK1 inhibitors, we determined their effects on the in vitro activity of 10 different Ser/Thr and tyrosine kinases, including the related AGC kinases PKA and PKCα. As shown in Table I, BX-912, BX-320, and BX-795 displayed greater than 20-fold selectivity for PDK1 relative to the kinases in this panel, with one exception; BX-912 was 9-fold selective for PDK1 relative to PKA. BX-795 and BX-320 displayed significantly higher selectivity against PKA (140- and 35-fold, respectively).Table IPotencies of compounds for inhibition of PDK1 and other kinases in vitroKinaseBX-912BX-795BX-320IC50-Fold selectiveIC50-Fold selectiveIC50-Fold selectiveμmμmμmPDK1aCoupled AKT2 activation assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Other kinase assays with purified recombinant enzymes used an ATP concentration at or below its Km value0.01210.00610.0391Chck10.83690.51900.8221PKA0.1190.841401.435PKC1.251059.316005.7146GSK3β7.46000.621004.0102CDK2bCDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E0.651050.43701.538EGFRcEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor>10>850>10>1,700>10>256Insulin receptor6.1500>10>1,700>10>256c-Kit0.85700.32500.8923T-Fyn2.11756.41,100>10>256KDRdKDR, kinase insert domain-containing receptor0.41351.11901.421a Coupled AKT2 activation assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Other kinase assays with purified recombinant enzymes used an ATP concentration at or below its Km valueb CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase 2c EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptord KDR, kinase insert domain-containing receptor Open table in a new tab BX-320, BX-795, and BX-912 Block PDK1 Activity in Cells— We next characterized the effect of our compounds on the PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt/S6K1 pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. PTEN-negative PC-3 cells display constitutive activation of Akt which is reflected in high levels of the PDK1 product, phospho-Thr308-Akt. PC-3 cells also express high levels of phospho-Thr389-S6K1, whose formation is dependent on PI 3-kinase and is thought to result from Akt signaling, although there are conflicting results in some situations (20Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 33Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol.

We treated PC-3 prostate cancer cells with and without compounds for 18 h and then determined the level of phospho-Thr308-Akt and phospho-Thr389-S6K1 in cell extracts by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, BX-795 and BX-320 greatly reduced the amount of both phospho-Thr308-Akt and phospho-Thr386-S6K1. BX compounds were as effective in blocking Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation as the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002 (100 μm) (Fig. 4A). We also saw similar effects after shorter times of compound treatment (2 h or 15 min, not shown). Quantification of Western blot signals revealed that BX-795 inhibited both Thr308-Akt and Thr389-S6K1 phosphorylation with an IC50 value of 300 nm, whereas BX-320 showed IC50 values of 1–3 μm (Fig. 4B). The more potent cell-based activity of BX-795 is consistent with its lower IC50 for inhibition of PDK1 activity in vitro. BX-912 displayed intermediate potencies (not shown). As a control, we stained Western blots for total Akt and S6K1 proteins. Compound treatment had no significant effect on Akt levels, whereas we observed a slight decrease in the level of total S6K1 protein which was too small to account for the dramatic loss of phospho-Thr389-S6K1 which we observed. In addition to the phosphorylation of Thr308 within the activation loop by PDK1, full activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation of Ser473, which is located in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif. The kinase responsible for this modification has not been clearly identified. As shown in Fig. 4A, we analyzed the effect of BX-795 and BX-320 on phospho-Ser473 levels in extracts prepared from compound-treated PC-3 cells. Both compounds reduced the levels of phospho-Ser473, although the potency of this effect appeared to be lower than that for inhibition of phospho-Thr308-Akt levels (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that PDK1 activity is critical for phosphorylation of both Ser473 and Thr308 of Akt, at least in PC-3 cells. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the less potent inhibition of Ser473 phosphorylation displayed by BX compou"
https://openalex.org/W2099040322,"Autotaxin (ATX) or nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2 (NPP2) is an NPP family member that promotes tumor cell motility, experimental metastasis, and angiogenesis. ATX primarily functions as a lysophospholipase D, generating the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine. ATX uses a single catalytic site for the hydrolysis of both lipid and non-lipid phosphodiesters, but its regulation is not well understood. Using a new fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based phosphodiesterase sensor that reports ATX activity with high sensitivity, we show here that ATX is potently and specifically inhibited by LPA and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in a mixed-type manner (Ki ∼ 10–7 m). The homologous ecto-phosphodiesterase NPP1, which lacks lysophospholipase D activity, is insensitive to LPA and S1P. Our results suggest that, by repressing ATX activity, LPA can regulate its own biosynthesis in the extracellular environment, and they reveal a novel role for S1P as an inhibitor of ATX, in addition to its well established role as a receptor ligand.

Moolenaar W.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Expression analysis has further suggested a normal physiological role for ATX in neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and myelination (9Fuss B. Baba H. Phan T. Tuohy V.K. Macklin W.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9095-9103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bachner D. Ahrens M. Betat N. Schroder D. Gross G. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mode of action of ATX/NPP2 has long been elusive because the biological effects of ATX could not be explained by nucleotide hydrolysis. The surprise came when it was discovered that ATX is identical to plasma lysophospholipase D (lyso-PLD) and acts by hydrolyzing lysophospatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (11Umezu-Goto M.

It has now become clear that de novo production of LPA can fully account for the biological effects of ATX observed in cell culture. The lysophospholipid substrate range of ATX has recently been broadened by showing that the enzyme can also hydrolyze sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) to yield sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (14Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar), a bioactive lipid with signaling properties very similar to those of LPA while acting on distinct receptors (15Postma F.R. Jalink K.

The physiological significance of the SPC-to-S1P conversion is debatable, however, because the reported Km of ATX for SPC (14Clair T. Aoki J. Koh E. Bandle R.W. Nam S.W. Ptaszynska M.M. Mills G.B. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar) is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the normal SPC levels in plasma and serum (18Liliom K. Sun G. Bunemann M. Virag T. Nusser N. Baker D.L. Wang D.A. Fabian M.J. Brandts B. Bender K. Eickel A. Malik K.U. Miller D.D. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Pott L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Rather than through SPC hydrolysis, S1P is thought to originate largely from the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases (19Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has revealed that the lyso-PLD and nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities of ATX originate from the same catalytic site (20Koh E. Clair T. Woodhouse E.C. Schiffmann E. Liotta L. Stracke M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2042-2045PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gijsbers R. Aoki J. Arai H. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the other two members of the NPP family (NPP1 and NPP3) lack intrinsic lyso-PLD activity despite their close homology to ATX (21Gijsbers R. Aoki J. Arai H. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given the differences in substrate specificity, it is not surprising that the NPPs appear to have largely unrelated physiological functions. The founding member, NPP1, hydrolyzes ATP into pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of calcification, and thereby regulates bone mineralization, whereas the third member, NPP3, promotes differentiation and invasion of glial cells by an unknown mechanism (3Goding J.W. Grobben B. Slegers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). An unresolved question concerns the regulation of ATX activity. One puzzling observation is that LPA levels in plasma or freshly isolated blood are very low (22Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 23Baker D.L. Morrison P. Miller B. Riely C.A. Tolley B. Westermann A.M. Bonfrer J.M. Bais E. Moolenaar W.H. Tigyi G. J. Am. Med.

Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This suggests that ATX is negatively regulated in vivo, but physiological or pharmacological inhibitors of ATX have not been identified to date. In the present study we sought to examine how ATX activity is regulated in the extracellular milieu. To this end, we used a newly invented fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based phosphodiesterase sensor (termed CPF4; see Ref. 26Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Nagano T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that, as we show here, reports ATX activity in conditioned media with superior sensitivity. Using this assay system, we demonstrate that ATX, secreted by the classical export route, is potently and specifically inhibited by LPA and S1P at biologically relevant concentrations. These results have important implications for lysophospholipid action and signaling in general and ATX targeting in particular. Cell Culture and Materials—HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Brefeldin A, monensin, BSA, fatty acid-free BSA (99%), para-nitrophenyl thymidine-5′-monophosphate (pNP-TMP), and bis(para-nitrotrophenyl) phosphate (bis-pNPP) were from Sigma. Highly purified PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus, sphingomyelinase D from Loxosceles laeta, and sphingomyelinase D from Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were kindly provided by M. Roberts (Boston College), D. Tambourgi (Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and S. Billington (University of Arizona), respectively. cDNA Cloning—RNA extracted from human diploid foreskin fibroblasts was used to generate cDNA using Invitrogen reverse transcriptase. ATX cDNA was isolated using ATX-specific primers. The stop codon was removed and KpnI and NotI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′ and 3′ sites, respectively. After digestion, ATX was ligated in pcDNA3 vector with 3′ Myc tag (ATX-Myc), 5′ HA tag (HA-ATX), or 5′ HA tag and 3′ Myc tag (HA-ATX-Myc), and in pEGFP-N3 (ATX-GFP). Sequencing showed that the ATX inserts were identical to human ATX (GenBank™ accession number BC034961). The catalytically inactive mutant ATX(T210A) (27Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C.

Transfection and Western Blotting—HEK293T cells were transfected with ATX constructs using the calcium phosphate method. At 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 h. Conditioned medium was centrifuged (5000 rpm for 30 min) to remove cell debris. Medium was used without further purification and analyzed for the presence of ATX by Western blotting and activity assays. There was very little variation in ATX activity between different batches of conditioned medium. For Western blot analysis, nitrocellulose filters were blocked using 5% nonfat powdered milk and probed with primary antibodies (9E10 anti-Myc and 3F10 anti-HA; Roche Applied Science) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant ATX—The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used for ATX production. ATX cDNA fused to the honeybee melittin signal sequence at the 5′ end was cloned into the pFastBac I vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was then used for generating recombinant baculovirus to infect Sf9 insect cells, which were grown in SF-900 II medium (Invitrogen); the multiplicity of infection was ∼5. After 60 h of infection, medium containing secreted ATX was collected by low speed centrifugation and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through was applied onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad), and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear potassium phosphate gradient. The ATX-containing fractions were applied onto an isopropyl column (Amersham Biosciences), and bound proteins were eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate. Purity of ATX-containing fractions was > 95% as shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The approximate yield was about 3 mg of pure protein from 10 liters of culture supernatant. Recombinant NPP1—A soluble secreted form of human NPP1 was made by in-frame ligation of its extracellular domain to the BamHI site of the cleavable signal sequence from influenza hemagglutinin, and cloned into a mammalian expression vector driven by the SR-α promoter. After linearization, the DNA was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and a highly expressing stable transfectant was isolated by single cell cloning. The soluble enzyme was purified from culture supernatants by sequential chromatography consisting of large scale anion exchange chromatography, Blue-Sepharose, AMP-Sepharose, and final polishing on a Uno-Q column (Bio-Rad). Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. lyso-PLD Assay—To measure lyso-PLD activity, radiolabeled LPC (1-[1-14C]palmitoyl, Amersham Biosciences) and unlabeled LPC (1 μm) were dried under nitrogen, and the mixture was reconstituted in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1 mm MgCl2, adn 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and sonicated, and BSA (2 mg/ml) was added. The reaction was started by the addition of ATX-containing conditioned medium. Lipids were extracted with butan-1-ol. All of the solutions were made 0.02 m in acetic acid and extracted with 0.5 volume of butan-1-ol as described previously (22Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In brief, after thorough mixing and centrifugation, the butan-1-ol phase was removed, and the water phase was extracted once again. Butanol fractions were washed with 1 volume of butan-1-ol-saturated water and dried under nitrogen. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel-60 plates in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:4). Lipids were detected by autoradiography. Phosphodiesterase Assays—Phosphodiesterase activity toward pNP-TMP and bis-pNPP was measured by light absorbance. 40 μl of HEK293T-conditioned medium was added to 160 μl of Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing pNP-TMP or bis-pNPP in 96-well plates. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C,the amount of liberated para-nitrophenolate (pNP) was determined by reading the absorbance at 405 nm in a Victor Wallac plate reader. CPF4 FRET Assay—CPF4 was synthesized as described previously (26Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Nagano T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and maintained as a 10-mm stock solution in Me2SO. Recombinant ATX in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) or ATX-Myc-containing conditioned Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (buffered with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) was incubated with or without the indicated reagents, and CPF4 was added at a concentration of 2 μm unless indicated otherwise. CPF4 fluorescence was monitored (at 37 °C) in a BMG Fluorstar 96-well plate reader (excitation at 355 nm, emission at 460 and 520 nm). Curve fitting was carried out using GraphPad software. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells transfected with ATX-GFP or LPA1-GFP (28van Meeteren L.A. Frederiks F. Giepmans B.N. Pedrosa M.F. Billington S.J. Jost B.H. Tambourgi D.V. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10833-10836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were fixed with ice-cold methanol at 24 h after transfection. ATX and LPA1 were detected by anti-GFP antibody using a Leica confocal microscope. ATX Processing in HEK293 Cells—ATX is synthesized as a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of ∼125 kDa, consisting of a very short N-terminal region, a single transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic ectodomain. ATX undergoes membrane-proximal cleavage to yield a soluble enzyme (29Stracke M.L. Clair T. Liotta L.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), yet little is known about ATX biosynthesis and proteolytic processing. In particular, it remains unclear whether the transmembrane form of ATX is expressed on the cell surface. As a starting point for the present studies, we expressed full-length ATX in HEK293T cells using three differently HA- and Myc-tagged constructs and analyzed ATX expression in cell lysates as well as in the culture medium. As shown in Fig. 1A, full-length ATX is detected only in cell lysates, whereas ATX in the medium lacks the N-terminal HA tag, consistent with secreted ATX being produced by cleavage of the N terminus. The Golgi-disturbing agents brefeldin A and monensin blocked ATX secretion, indicating involvement of the classical export route (supplemental Fig. 1A). When analyzed by confocal microscopy, ATX is detected in intracellular vesicles but not at the plasma membrane; in contrast, LPA1 receptors localize primarily to the cell surface under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). From these results we conclude that ATX follows the classical secretory pathway and that proteolytic removal of its N terminus, including the transmembrane region, occurs intracellularly rather than at the plasma membrane. ATX Activity toward Lipid and Non-lipid Substrates—Having established that ATX is not detectable as a plasma membrane-anchored ecto-enzyme, we set out to examine the catalytic activity of soluble ATX. To this end, we used conditioned medium from ATX-Myc-transfected HEK293T cells without further purification or, in some experiments, ATX purified from Sf9 cell supernatant (supplemental Fig. 1B). The catalytically inactive mutant ATX(T210A) served as a negative control (27Lee H.Y. Clair T. Mulvaney P.T. Woodhouse E.C. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24408-24412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The lyso-PLD activity of ATX was measured by the conversion of LPC(16:0) to LPA using thin layer chromatograpy (Fig. 2A). LPC hydrolysis by ATX proceeded at a constant rate for at least 90 min (Fig. 2C, left panel). The Km for LPC was estimated at ∼150 μm, in agreement with previously reported values (100–260 μm) (11Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 12Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol.

Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar) and in the range of normal LPC levels in plasma (25Croset M. Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When screening multiple lipids as potential modulators of lyso-PLD activity, we observed that ATX-catalyzed LPC hydrolysis was significantly inhibited by LPA and S1P (1 μm, complexed to albumin). Other phospholipids tested, including phosphatidic acid, did not show such an effect (Fig. 2 and results not shown). This suggests that ATX is subject to product inhibition by LPA. Detailed analysis of lyso-PLD inhibition is obscured, however, by limitations with the standard LPC hydrolysis assay, which generates concentrations of LPA in excess of its inhibition constant (see below). As a result, formation of LPA during the course of the assay causes the apparent inhibition of ATX by added LPA to be less pronounced than the true inhibition. To avoid the complications of lipid product inhibition and the limitations of end-point LPC hydrolysis assays, we took advantage of the fact that ATX uses a common reaction mechanism for the hydrolysis of lipid and non-lipid substrates (20Koh E. Clair T. Woodhouse E.C. Schiffmann E. Liotta L. Stracke M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2042-2045PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gijsbers R. Aoki J. Arai H. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As non-lipid substrates, we tested pNP-TMP, a standard NPP substrate, and the symmetric phosphodiester bis-pNPP, a substrate for type I phosphodiesterases and certain bacterial PLDs (30Kelly S.J. Dardinger D.E. Butler L.G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Rudolph A.E. Stuckey J.A. Zhao Y. Matthews H.R. Patton W.A. Moss J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52282-52289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The liberated product, pNP, was quantified colorimetrically. As shown in Fig. 3A, hydrolysis of pNP-TMP followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 0.9 mm, somewhat lower than the value reported by others (12Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39436-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). ATX was also capable of hydrolyzing bis-pNPP (Fig. 3C), in keeping with a previous report (21Gijsbers R. Aoki J. Arai H. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). bis-pNPP hydrolysis rates were half-maximal at ∼0.5 mm but did not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics, apparently because of substrate inhibition at higher concentrations (>1 mm; results not shown). Similar to what is observed with LPC as a substrate, the hydrolysis of pNP-TMP and bis-pNPP by ATX was significantly inhibited by LPA and S1P (1 μm) (Fig. 3, B and C). It thus appears that, importantly, LPA and S1P exert their inhibitory effect regardless of the nature of the substrate. Effects of BSA—Using pNP-TMP as a substrate, we observed that ATX activity was strongly inhibited by normal serum albumin (BSA) at concentrations of >50 μg/ml (0.75 μm; ∼0.1% of the concentration in fetal calf serum). In marked contrast, delipidated BSA (Fig. 3B, faf-BSA) had no inhibitory effect, even when added at high concentrations (5 mg/ml; 75 μm). The observation that albumin is the major binding protein for LPA and S1P strongly suggests that ATX inhibition by “normal” BSA is largely due to these lysophospholipids. When LPA was complexed to delipidated albumin (at a 1:1 molar ratio), we found that its ability to inhibit ATX was not affected. As can be inferred from Fig. 3D, the IC50 value for the LPA·BSA (1:1) complex to inhibit ATX was close to 0.1 μm, using a substrate concentration of 1 mm (i.e. equal to the Km). CPF4, a FRET-based Sensor of ATX Activity—Because the pNP-TMP colorimetric assay showed only moderate sensitivity (detection limit, ∼0.15 μg of ATX/ml), we explored a newly developed FRET-based phosphodiesterase sensor termed CPF4 (26Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Nagano T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CPF4 is a bis-pNPP-derived probe, in which both phenyl moieties are linked to coumarin and fluorescein, respectively, resulting in FRET with high efficiency (Fig. 4A). Cleavage of the phosphodiester group by a nonspecific phosphodiesterase from snake venom causes loss of FRET, providing a convenient ratiometric readout of enzyme activity (26Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Nagano T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Notably, the CPF4 fluorescence ratio is insensitive to pH in the physiological range (pH 7.0–8.0) (26Takakusa H. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Nagano T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A major advantage of fluorescence-based sensors like CPF4 is their high sensitivity, allowing detection of very low concentrations of enzyme. We examined whether CPF4 serves as a substrate for ATX. As shown in Fig. 4B, ATX-Myc causes a prominent loss of FRET (increased donor fluorescence and a concomitant decrease in acceptor fluorescence), indicative of substrate hydrolysis, which can be monitored in real time (Fig. 4C). No CFP4 signal change was detected with the inactive mutant ATX(T210A). A plot of the initial hydrolysis rates versus CPF4 concentration revealed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an average Km as low as ∼4 μm (range, 2.5–6 μm) for ATX-Myc in HEK293 cell-conditioned medium (Fig. 4D). About the same Km value was found with highly purified ATX from Sf9 cell supernatant (see below and Fig. 6), suggesting that conditioned medium does not contain significant amounts of competitive inhibitors of ATX (which would increase the apparent Km). It is noteworthy that the apparent affinity of ATX for CPF4 is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that for lysophospholipids and nucleotides (Km = 0.1–1.0 mm; one notable exception is diadenosine triphosphate with an apparent Km of 8 μm (33Vollmayer P. Clair T. Goding J.W. Sano K. Servos J. Zimmermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2971-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). Also with bis-pNPP, a “non-Michaelis-Menten” substrate, half-maximal hydrolysis rates are observed at concentrations as high as ∼0.5 mm. Thus attachment of the coumarin-fluorescein tandem to bis-pNPP, which increases hydrophobicity and disturbs structural symmetry, converts bis-pNPP into a high-affinity substrate for ATX, suggesting that the coumarin-fluorescein tandem fits into a hydrophobic pocket involved in substrate binding. Although the overall catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of CPF4 hydrolysis was about 3-fold lower than that observed with the other substrates, the FRET-based assay showed superior sensitivity; even at a 5000-fold dilution of HEK293T cell-conditioned medium, ATX activity was still detectable. The estimated detection limit of the CFP4 assay was 3 ng of ATX/ml, exceeding that of the standard colorimetric assay by at least 50-fold. This makes CPF4 the preferred probe for measuring ATX activity in conditioned media and body fluids, although it remains to be seen to what extent the presence of binding proteins and/or nonspecific phosphodiesterases may limit the usefulness of CPF4 in assessing ATX activity in complex biological fluids. We also examined whether CPF4 is a substrate for nonmammalian secreted lyso-PLDs, notably the broad specificity PLD from S. chromofuscus and the sphingomyelin- and LPC-specific PLDs from C. pseudotuberculosis and Loxosceles laeta (28van Meeteren L.A. Frederiks F. Giepmans B.N. Pedrosa M.F. Billington S.J. Jost B.H. Tambourgi D.V. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10833-10836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When assayed under the conditions used for ATX, none of these exogenous PLDs (10 nm) was able to cleave CPF4 (results not shown). It thus appears that among the known secreted PLDs, only ATX can hydrolyze CPF4. Inhibition of ATX by LPA and S1P—Because of its superior sensitivity and convenient readout, the CPF4 assay was used in our further analysis of ATX inhibition. We determined the concentration dependence of LPA and S1P for inhibiting ATX activity using a substrate concentration close to the Km. Under those conditions, the IC50 value for 1-oleoyl-LPA is ∼0.1 μm (Fig. 5A), very similar to the value found with pNP-TMP or LPC as substrate (Fig. 3D and results not shown). S1P inhibited ATX activity with the same dose dependence as observed for LPA (Fig. 5A). Other natural lipids, including dioleoylphosphatidic acid, 1-oleoyl-glycerol, sphingosine (10 mm), glycerol 3-phosphate (1 mm), and free fatty acids, did not affect ATX activity. Although AMP has been reported to inhibit the NPP reaction (1Bollen M. Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Stefan C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 393-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Clair T. Lee H.Y. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 996-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we did not observe any effect of either AMP or ATP (1 mm) on ATX activity (results not shown). Importantly, the inhibitory effects of LPA and S1P were specific for ATX in that the activity of the structurally related ecto-phosphodiesterase NPP1 was insensitive to either lipid (Fig. 5A). Inhibition of ATX by LPA was dependent on the length of the acyl chain; maximal inhibition was induced by 1-oleoyl-LPA, 1-palmitoyl-LPA, and 1-myristoyl-LPA, whereas short-chain LPA(6:0) had no measurable effect (Fig. 5B). The apparent requirement of a long acyl chain suggests that LPA and S1P directly interact with a hydrophobic pocket on ATX. The inhibitory effects of LPA and S1P were nonadditive (Fig. 5B), suggesting that both lipids act on the same regulatory site. We conclude that, in marked contrast to the G protein-coupled receptors (17Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), ATX does not discriminate between LPA and S1P as ligands. We next examined the mechanism of inhibition by LPA and S1P. Substrate titration studies revealed that LPA and S1P are mixed-type inhibitors, producing a reduction in Vmax and an increase in Km (Fig. 6). In other words, inhibition of ATX by LPA/S1P has both a noncompetitive and a competitive component, resulting from a combination of a decreased turnover number and decreased affinity of the active site for its substrates. Double-reciprocal plot analysis (Fig. 6) yielded an inhibition constant (Ki) of 110 nm for LPA and 50 nm for S1P, values well within the biologically active range of LPA and S1P. We note that these Ki values are ∼1000-fold lower than the reported Km for the LPC substrate (100–200 μm) (11Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 12Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol.

Stracke M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5446-5453PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that ATX binds LPA and S1P much more strongly than it binds its physiological substrate(s). Conclusion—We have employed a novel and highly sensitive FRET-based phosphodiesterase sensor to show that the catalytic activity of ATX, secreted by the classical export pathway, is potently and specifically inhibited by LPA and S1P. Kinetic analysis revealed that LPA and S1P act as mixed-type inhibitors with an inhibition constant (Ki) of ∼0.1 μm. The inhibition of ATX by LPA and S1P is specific in that (i) short-chain LPA(6:0) and other lipids have no effect, and (ii) the closely related ecto-phosphodiesterase NPP1, which lacks lyso-PLD activity, is insensitive to LPA and S1P. Because ATX primarily functions as an LPA-generating lyso-PLD, our findings imply that LPA is capable of controlling its own biosynthesis in the cellular environment. Product inhibition of ATX will prevent excessive accumulation of bioactive LPA in the extracellular milieu and may explain why steady-state plasma levels of LPA are very low despite the abundance of its precursor LPC. That serum LPA levels rapidly increase following platelet activation (24Sano T. Baker D. Virag T. Wada A. Yatomi Y. Kobayashi T. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21197-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) suggests that plasma ATX may also be positively regulated by as yet unknown factors, an important issue that needs to be further explored. Our findings point to a novel role for S1P as an inhibitor of ATX, in addition to its well documented role as a receptor agonist. The important implication is that changes in extracellular S1P levels may greatly influence LPA production and signaling. Because the S1P concentrations in blood are significant (16Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 34Yang L. Yatomi Y. Miura Y. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), close to the inhibition constant for ATX reported here (∼ 0.1 μm), ATX activity in plasma could be permanently suppressed by S1P under basal conditions. Our results further imply that ATX has a unique binding site for LPA and S1P, not present in NPP1. Interestingly, a photo-affinity labeling study has shown that, in addition to its catalytic site, ATX contains an isoform-specific sequence that can be cross-linked to ATP (35Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments, in combination with structural studies, should reveal whether this second nucleotide-binding region is in fact an allosteric site for LPA and S1P. Identification and characterization of the LPA/S1P binding site(s) is a major challenge for future studies and will likely facilitate the development of selective ATX inhibitors that could be of value in anticancer therapy.

We previously identified the prototypical thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), as part of a novel APC-endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Experiments in wild-type and PAR1-/- mice demonstrated that intravenous injection of APC leads to PAR1-dependent gene induction in the lung. The vascular endothelium undergoes profound changes in severe sepsis, the approved therapeutic indication for APC. Similar to PAR1, APC activated PAR2 through canonical cleavage. Although PAR2 was up-regulated in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells, APC signaling remained PAR1-dependent. Large scale gene expression profiling documented marked differences in both up- and down-regulated genes between APC and thrombin signaling in cytokine-stimulated cells. APC down-regulated transcripts for proapoptotic proteins including p53 and thrombospondin-1, but p53 was unchanged, and thrombospondin was even up-regulated by thrombin. Concordant PAR1-dependent effects on protein levels were found. Thus, by signaling through the same receptor PAR1, APC, and thrombin can exert distinct biological effects in perturbed endothelium. These data may explain how APC can be therapeutically protective through the EPCR-PAR1 signaling despite ongoing thrombin generation due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

The serine protease thrombin is not only the central procoagulant enzyme in the blood-clotting cascade, but it also activates the anticoagulant protein C pathway. Two receptor proteins on the endothelial cell surface are involved in protein C activation, thrombomodulin and endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR). 1The abbreviations used are: EPCR, endothelial protein C receptor; APC, activated protein C; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; PAR, protease activated receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Recruitment of protein C to EPCR enhances its activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (1Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Esmon C.T. Xu J.

Activated protein C (APC) down-regulates thrombin generation in a negative feedback loop. Results from animal models and clinical trials indicate that APC has potent protective effects in systemic inflammation, which are independent from its well established anticoagulant function. Recombinant APC is approved to treat patients with sepsis, but reduction in mortality is most pronounced in severe sepsis (3Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F.

The molecular basis for the anti-inflammatory effects of APC is incompletely understood. We have demonstrated recently that APC can induce protective genes in endothelial cells by activating the prototypical thrombin receptor protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) dependent on binding to EPCR. Subsequent studies have implicated this APC-EPCR-PAR1 signaling cascade in anti-apoptotic APC signaling in a transformed endothelial cell line (4Mosnier L.O. Griffin J.H. Biochem.

The coagulation protease pathway is up-regulated in systemic and local inflammation and contributes to the inflammatory process in complex ways. For example, thrombin-PAR1 signaling has been shown to have proinflammatory effects in a murine model of glomerulonephritis (8Cunningham M.A. Rondeau E. Chen X. Coughlin S.R. Holdsworth S.R. Tipping P.G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and APC therapy is particularly efficient in severe sepsis where thrombin is formed intravascularly. These findings raise important questions. Is APC signaling contributing to the protective effects in sepsis? If APC signals through PAR1, can the same receptor mediate the proinflammatory effects of thrombin and the protective effects of APC? APC selectively activates PAR1 in quiescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but in heterologous expression systems PAR2 supports signaling by APC-EPCR as well (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Here we show that although PAR2 is up-regulated under inflammatory conditions in endothelial cells, APC-mediated regulation of gene induction remained PAR1-specific. However, PAR1-dependent signaling by thrombin and APC-EPCR produced distinct gene expression profiles in cytokine-perturbed cells, and in the regulation of apoptotic genes, APC and thrombin even produced opposite biological effects. Agonists, Inhibitors, and Antibodies—Thrombin and specific agonist peptides for PAR1 (TFLLRNPNDK) and PAR2 (SLIGRL) were as described (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W.

All experiments involving stimulation with APC included hirudin (Calbiochem) to block any thrombin signaling. Control experiments demonstrated that hirudin alone had no effect in any of our assays. Doxorubicin was from Calbiochem. The PAR1 antagonist RWJ58259 was from Dr. Patricia Andrade-Gordon (Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Spring House, PA). PAR1 cleavage-blocking monoclonal antibodies ATAP2 and WEDE15 were used in combination at 10 and 25 μg/ml, respectively, as described (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W.

Mouse monoclonal anti-PAR2 SAM11 antibody was from Dr. Lawrence Brass and anti-EPCR JRK1494 from Dr. Charles Esmon. Monoclonal rat anti-EPCR RCR-92 (non-blocking) and RCR-252 (blocking) antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Kenji Fukudome (Saga Medical School, Saga, Japan) and were used at 25 μg/ml (13Ye X.

Reporter Gene Assay and Mutagenesis—The spontaneously transformed M6-11 fibroblast cell line from PAR-1-deficient mice was kindly provided by Dr. Patricia Andrade-Gordon. Cells were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected using the GenePORTER reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) with expression constructs for human PAR2 and EPCR as well as a reporter construct containing 1.2 kb of mouse egr-1 5′ flanking sequence upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the promoterless pXP2 as described (9Riewald M.

Luciferase activity in the cell lysate was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). A mutant PAR2 construct with substitution of Arg36 with Glu at the P1 position was generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (15Liaw P.C. Mather T. Oganesyan N. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. J.

Flow Cytometry and Gene Expression in HUVECs—Primary HUVECs (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in EGM-2 medium (basal endothelial cell medium supplemented with hydrocortisone, bovine brain extract, human epidermal growth factor, gentamicin/amphotericin, and 10% fetal bovine serum). They were passaged for no more than seven generations. For flow cytometry cells were detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and kept on ice for all subsequent steps. Cells were pelleted in serum-free EGM-2, washed, and resuspended in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). Cells were stained with a 1:300 dilution of the indicated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min followed by washing and a 30-min incubation with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). After another washing step, cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) real-time reverse transcription-PCR 4 μg of total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed followed by RNase treatment using the superscript kit (Invitrogen). TaqMan primers and probes for GAPDH and TR3 were as described (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar).

Animals used for experiments were between 8 and 12 weeks of age. All studies in mice were approved by The Scripps Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee and comply with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Carrier control or human APC (2 mg/kg in 100 μl) were injected into the retro-orbital sinus in groups of anesthetized wild-type, PAR1-deficient, or PAR2-deficient C57/Bl6 mice. Preparations of activated protein C contain traces of thrombin because thrombin is the only known activator of protein C. Hirudin (100 nm) was added to the injected APC to block contaminating thrombin. The amount of hirudin injected per mouse (70 ng) is not expected to have biological effects because it is more than 100 times lower than a dose that leads to prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time in the mouse (18Pawlinski R. Pedersen B. Schabbauer G. Tencati M. Holscher T. Boisvert W. Andrade-Gordon P. Frank R.D. Mackman N. Blood. 2004; 103: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Hirudin was also included at the same concentration in all control injections. Three h after the bolus injection the mice were sacrificed, and the lower lobe of the left lung was rapidly surgically dissected. Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent using a tissue homogenizer; reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed as described above. TaqMan primers and probes for murine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and GAPDH were custom-designed. Microarray Analysis—Confluent HUVEC-derived HUV-EC-C (ATCC CRL 1730) were serum-deprived for 5 h in the presence of 2 nm tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) followed by incubation for 90 min with control, 10 nm APC, 10 μm PAR1 agonist TFLLRNPNDK (sP1), or 10 nm thrombin (sIIa). Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by hybridization to the HG-U95Av2 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The array contains 12,625 probe sets representing ∼7000 different human genes. Every gene on the array is represented by a probe set of 16 pairs of oligonucleotide spots, one perfectly matched with the target sequence and the other one with a single mismatch. Based upon the relative hybridization signal intensities for the perfect match versus mismatch pairs, a detection p value (between 0 and 1) and a signal value is calculated for each probe set on the array. A low detection p value indicates that the gene is reliably detected, e.g. p < 0.05 is the default cut-off for a “present” call. In the comparison analysis (agonist-induced versus buffer control arrays) a change p value (between 0 and 1) and a signal log ratio are calculated from the differences between the perfect match and mismatch intensities comparing the individual pairs in each probe set from the two arrays. A change p value of <0.05 or >0.95 indicates genes that are likely expressed at increased or decreased levels in the agonist-treated sample, respectively. The log scale used is base 2; thus a signal log ratio of 1 or -1 indicates a 2-fold increase or decrease in signal intensity, respectively. Three independent experiments analyzing the effect of stimulation with APC and two experiments with the PAR1 agonist and thrombin analyzing their effect on gene expression levels were performed. Genes were selected based on average change p value and average signal log ratio from the repeat experiments. Western Blotting for Change in p53 and Thrombospondin Protein Levels—Expression of p53 and thrombospondin-1 were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p53 DO-7 (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) and anti-thrombospondin-1 N-20 (sc-12312, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Staining with anti-actin (Sigma) served as a loading control, and expression levels were quantified using laser densitometry as described (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—A two-sample two-tailed homoscedastic t test was used to calculate indicated p values. Canonical Cleavage Is Required for PAR2 Activation by APC—PARs are typically activated by proteolytic cleavage of a specific scissile bond in the N-terminal extracellular domain followed by binding of the newly generated N terminus (“tethered ligand”) to a ligand binding site on the receptor body (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that APC cleaves the canonical scissile bond in PAR1 (20Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To establish that APC activates PAR2 by canonical cleavage we generated a variant of PAR2 with an Arg36 → Glu substitution at the P1 position of the scissile bond (PAR2/P1) to block proteolysis by proteases with trypsin-like specificity, including APC and factor Xa. Wild-type PAR2 or PAR2/P1 was co-expressed with EPCR in PAR-deficient fibroblasts. Both human and mouse APC as well as factor Xa led to reporter gene induction in the wild-type PAR2- but not the PAR2/P1-transfected cells (Fig. 1). Cleavage-independent signaling induced by PAR2 agonist peptide confirmed expression of functional receptors. These results demonstrate that APC activates PAR2 through canonical scissile bond cleavage and that PAR2 is also a potential signaling receptor for murine APC. PAR1 Mediates APC Signaling in the Mouse—To establish an in vivo role for PAR1 or PAR2 in mediating APC signaling, gene expression was analyzed in the lung after intravenous injection of APC in wild-type, PAR1-, or PAR2-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 2, APC injection up-regulated expression of the transcript for MCP-1 significantly less in PAR1-deficient mice compared with the wild type. The difference between PAR2-deficient mice and wild type was not statistically significant. Because delivery through the retro-orbital sinus likely leads to first passage delivery to the endothelium of the lung, these results are consistent with the in vitro studies, demonstrating that APC in unperturbed endothelial cells specifically activates the prototypical thrombin receptor PAR1. Enhanced PAR2 Signaling in TNFα-induced HUVECs—Because endothelial cell PAR2 expression is known to be strongly up-regulated by stimulation with inflammatory cytokines (21Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), the signaling specificity of APC may change in TNFα-induced HUVECs. We analyzed whether PAR2 can support APC signaling in cytokine-perturbed cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated that treatment of HUVECs for 5 h with TNFα leads to increased PAR2 expression (Table I), whereas the PAR1 level was unchanged. EPCR expression was reduced to 60% of unstimulated control cells, consistent with previous results (22Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggested that these cells might still be responsive to APC signaling. Time course experiments using real-time PCR indeed demonstrated up-regulation of the transcript for the nuclear receptor TR3 by PAR1- and PAR2-specific agonist peptides as well as APC in TNFα-induced HUVECs with peak levels after 90 min of stimulation (not shown). Compared with quiescent HUVECs, the ratio of TR3 induction by PAR1 and PAR2 was shifted in favor of PAR2, consistent with enhanced expression of functional PAR2 upon TNFα stimulation (Fig. 3).Table IExpression of PAR1, PAR2, and EPCR on TNFα-stimulated HUVECs HUVECs were incubated for 5 h in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of 2 nm TNFα. The TNFα-dependent change in surface expression of PAR1, PAR2, and EPCR (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies WEDE15, SAM11, and JRK1494, respectively.

Cleavage-blocking antibodies to PAR1 completely inhibited TR3 induction by APC, whereas signaling by factor Xa was only partially blocked (Fig. 3). These data are in line with previous studies showing that Xa proteolytically activates both PAR1 and PAR2 (10Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 23Bono F. Schaeffer P. Herault J.P. Michaux C. Nestor A.L. Guillemot J.C. Herbert J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16081-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and they show that APC signaling in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells requires PAR1 cleavage. Thrombin-cleaved PAR1 has been shown to cross-activate PAR2 in endothelial cells, based on the finding that a small molecule PAR1 antagonist only partially blocks thrombin-mediated signaling (12O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To determine whether APC-cleaved PAR1 can cross-activate PAR2 in a similar manner, the effect of the indole-based PAR1 antagonist RWJ-58259 on APC signaling was analyzed. RWJ-58259 binds to the receptor body and inhibits signaling without blocking cleavage of the scissile bond in the N-terminal exodomain (26Zhang H.C. Derian C.K. Andrade-Gordon P. Hoekstra W.J. McComsey D.F. White K.B. Poulter B.L. Addo M.F. Cheung W.M. Damiano B.P. Oksenberg D. Reynolds E.E. Pandey A. Scarborough R.M. Maryanoff B.E. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As expected, RWJ-58259 acted as a competitive inhibitor of PAR1 agonist peptide induction of TR3. Thrombin signaling was abrogated by cleavage-blocking anti-PAR1 but only partially inhibited by RWJ-58259, consistent with PAR2 cross-activation by thrombin-cleaved PAR1. APC-mediated signaling was completely inhibited by RWJ-58259, indicating that APC-cleaved PAR1 cannot cross-activate PAR2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that APC leads to gene induction in endothelial cells entirely through PAR1 activation and signaling even when PAR2 is up-regulated upon TNFα stimulation. Distinct Effects of APC and Thrombin on Gene Expression Profile in TNFα-induced HUVECs—Because APC is particularly beneficial in severe sepsis, we reasoned that APC signaling may show distinct differences from thrombin signaling in inflammatory cytokine-perturbed endothelial cells. To define the specificity of PAR1 signaling induced by thrombin and APC-EPCR, large scale gene expression profiling was performed in TNFα-primed HUVECs that were stimulated with thrombin, APC, or a PAR1-specific agonist peptide. Probably because of the greater signaling strength of thrombin, thrombin stimulation caused significant up- or down-regulation of a larger number of genes as compared with APC signaling. Table II summarizes a manual grouping of 199 or 151 genes selected based on stringency criteria of the average signal log ratios. The complete gene list is provided as supplemental data. Although some genes were induced to a similar extent by thrombin and APC, in general thrombin was a much more potent inducer of transcript changes. Moreover, both thrombin and APC selectively induced transcripts that were not induced by the other protease.Table IIAPC- and thrombin-regulated genes in TNFα-stimulated HUVECs Genes regulated by APC and thrombin with an average p value of <0.05 or >0.95.

A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13267) Google Scholar) of the more stringent subset of genes with signal log ratios of >0.5 or <-0.5. Consistent with signaling through the same PAR, thrombin and APC signaling concordantly induced or down-regulated several genes (see IIa-induced and -suppressed genes in Fig. 4). Because the gene profiling was performed after 90 min of stimulation, transcription factors and signaling intermediates accounted for a large portion of the changed transcripts. Mediators of potential significance for inflammatory processes, including tissue factor, interleukin 6, or the urokinase receptor, were induced by thrombin as well as APC. However, thrombin was a much more potent inducer of tissue factor in particular. It is therefore likely that thrombin signaling is a major mediator for the coagulant and proinflammatory exacerbation in severe sepsis. In addition, several thrombin-induced or -suppressed genes were little changed by APC, indicating signaling specificity. For example, thrombin but not APC induced interleukin 8 and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, which can increase vascular permeability. A small group of genes was selectively induced by APC but not by thrombin (see APC-induced in Fig. 4). One of these genes showed concordant up-regulation by APC and PAR1 agonist in our previous gene profiling study on non-stimulated endothelial cells (9Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). More significantly, a large group of genes was suppressed by APC (see APC-suppressed in Fig. 4), and most strikingly, several of these genes were even up-regulated by thrombin. The APC-suppressed genes include proinflammatory and proapoptotic genes such as members of the NFκB family and the proapoptotic p53 (Fig. 4). By suppressing inflammatory signaling intermediates, APC may counteract proinflammatory cytokine signaling and potentiate effects of thrombin signaling that cooperate with these pathways. PAR1-dependent Down-regulation of p53 and Thrombospondin-1 by APC but Not Thrombin in TNFα-induced HUVECs—Because the most striking differences between thrombin and APC were observed in genes down-regulated by APC, we focused on specific examples to confirm concordant changes in the protein levels. To test whether APC regulates p53, cells were treated with doxorubicin to increase p53 protein levels. Western blotting for p53 shows that p53 levels in doxorubicin-treated cells were significantly lower when the cells were pretreated with APC (Fig. 5A). Antibody-blocking experiments demonstrate that this suppressive effect on p53 expression was dependent on APC binding to EPCR as well as PAR1 cleavage (Fig. 5B). APC suppressed thrombospondin-1 mRNA levels, which were increased upon thrombin stimulation. Cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells were treated with either APC or thrombin in the presence or absence of a cleavage-blocking antibody, and thrombospondin-1 protein levels were determined by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 6). APC reduced thrombospondin-1 protein levels in a PAR1 cleavage-dependent manner. In contrast, thrombin induced thrombospondin-1 levels in a PAR1-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that thrombin and APC by activating the same receptor can mediate opposite biological effects and suggest that EPCR cosignaling may modify PAR1-dependent APC signaling in endothelial cells.Fig. 6PAR1-dependent down-regulation of thrombospondin-1 by APC. HUVECs were serum-starved for 5 h in the presence of 2 nm TNFα. The indicated agonists were added for 15 h to the TNFα-induced cells in the absence (solid bars) or presence of blocking anti-PAR1 (open bars) followed by analysis of thrombospondin-1 expression by Western blotting and densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs. Expression was normalized to GAPDH (means ± S.D., n = 3).View Large Image"

The polyadenylation of mt mRNAs is known to be a key process needed to create UAA stop codons that are not encoded in mtDNA. In some cases, polyadenylation is required for the tRNA maturation by editing of its 3′ terminus. However, little is known about the functional roles the poly(A) tail of mt mRNAs plays in mt translation and RNA turnover. Here we show human mt PAP (hmtPAP) and human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPase) control poly(A) synthesis in human mitochondria. Partial inactivation of hmtPAP by RNA interference using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in shortened poly(A) tails and decreased steady state levels of some mt mRNAs as well as their translational products. Moreover, knocking down hmtPAP generated markedly defective mt membrane potentials and reduced oxygen consumption. In contrast, knocking down hPNPase showed significantly extended poly(A) tails of mt mRNAs. These results demonstrate that the poly(A) length of human mt mRNAs is controlled by polyadenylation by hmtPAP and deadenylation by hPNPase, and polyadenylation is required for the stability of mt mRNAs.

Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, control of poly(A) tail synthesis is a key regulatory step in gene expression in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Polyadenylation in mitochondria is very varied among organisms. In plant mitochondria, polyadenylation promotes mRNA degradation as in bacteria and chloroplasts (10Gagliardi D. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In yeast mitochondria, mRNAs lack the poly(A) tail, and mt gene expression seems to be regulated by the mtDNA-encoded conserved dodecamer sequence at its 3′ terminus (11Butow R.A. Zhu H. Perlman P. Conrad-Webb H. Genome. 1989; 31: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is known that the stability of yeast mitochondrial (mt) mRNA is controlled by mRNA-binding proteins (12Ellis T.P. Helfenbein K.G. Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15728-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Dieckmann C.L. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

In trypanosome mitochondria, the length of the poly(A) tail is dependent on the edited status of the mRNA (15Read L.K. Myler P.J. Stuart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1123-1128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bhat G.J. Souza A.E. Feagin J.E. Stuart K. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1994; 68: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The role of long poly(A) is unknown, whereas short poly(A) seems to stimulate mRNA degradation (18Ryan C.M. Militello K.T. Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In animal mitochondria, polyadenylation is a key process in the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes at the post-transcriptional level. It has been suggested that in some mt mRNAs, the polyadenylation creates the UAA stop codons during the maturation of mRNAs, because some of the mRNAs encoded by mtDNA lack stop codons. Thus, polyadenylation generates functional mRNAs that can be translated in mitochondria (19Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that polyadenylation is involved in editing the 3′-acceptor region of some mt tRNAs (20Yokobori S. Paabo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Tomita K. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4987-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the functional roles the poly(A) tails play in mt translation and RNA turnover of animal mt mRNAs. Recently, Lightowlers and co-workers (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) show that the decreased steady state level of human mt ATP6 mRNA harbors a microdeletion (μΔ9205) at its 3′ end, which is associated with human mt cytopathies. This microdeletion resulted in shortening the poly(A) tail of mt ATP6 mRNA. Normally, precursor ATP6 mRNA is processed so that its 3′-terminal nucleotide is a uridine. This terminal uridine serves as the 1st letter of the UAA codon, which is subsequently completed by the polyadenylation of the mRNA. The μΔ9205 microdeletion removes this terminal uridine and thus results in aberrant ATP6 mRNA that lacks a stop codon. This non-stop mRNA is degraded rapidly in a deadenylation manner, suggesting that the poly(A) tail is required for human mt mRNA stability as in eukaryotic cytoplasm (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conversely, Stepien and co-workers (23Tomecki R. Dmochowska A. Gewartowski K. Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6001-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) reported that long poly(A) is not required for mt mRNA stability. Several mt mRNAs were shown to be relatively stable if they were significantly deadenylated by knocking down human mt poly(A) polymerase (hmtPAP). This suggests that the long poly(A) tails do not act directly as the determinants of mt mRNA stability (23Tomecki R. Dmochowska A. Gewartowski K. Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6001-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). They argue against the direct role of long poly(A) tails in the stabilization of human mt mRNAs. In this study, we demonstrate the regulatory mechanism and functional role of polyadenylation in human mt mRNAs. Materials—[α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. T4 RNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs. E. coli PAP and E. coli PNPase were obtained from Takara and Sigma, respectively. Expression Vectors—The full-length coding region of the candidate gene for human mt PAP (hmtPAP) cDNA was amplified from human poly(A)+ mRNA using primers designed to bind outside of the coding region. The sense and antisense primers were 5′-ttagcaatggcggttcccggcgtggggctc-3′ and 5′-gaccatttgataggctaagcccagttctttacacaatgtagcagccatca-3′, respectively. A second round of PCR was performed by using an upstream primer with an NdeI site (5′-aaaaggggcatatgcttaggagagacgagcagccttcagggagc-3′) and a downstream primer with a SalI site (5′-cctttgtcgactgtctgagtactaattgttctcttcccactggtttttgtgaaattttct-3′). The first codon of the predicted mature enzyme (GAC) in the upstream primer was changed to ATG to create an initiation codon (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of the pET-29a(+) vector (Novagen) to obtain the expression vector pET-hmtPAP, which produces C-terminal His tag-fused hmtPAP. To analyze cellular localization, a nested PCR product was generated by using an upstream primer with a SacI site (5′-aaaagggggagctcatggcggttcccggcgtggggctcttgacc-3′) and a downstream primer with a SacII site (5′-cctttccgcggtgtctgagtactaattgttctcttcccactggtttttgtgaaattttct-3′) and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate pEGFP-hmtPAP. Construction of expression vector containing hPNPase was performed as described above. The sense and antisense primers used for amplification of hPNPase cDNA from human poly(A)+ mRNA were 5′-gaccgcgtgccgggtgtcatggcggcctgcaggtactgctgctcgtgcctccggct-3′ and 5′-cacaatggaagatactactaaaatgttgctctacagcacatcaccctagaca-3′, respectively. A nested PCR product was generated by using an upstream primer with a SalI site (5′-cctttgtcgacgctgtggccgtggacttaggcaacaggaaattagaaatatcttct-3′) and a downstream primer with a NotI site (5′-aaggaaaagcggccgctcactgagaattagatgatgactgtgaaataggttctcccattacaatact-3′) and inserted into pET-28b(+) vector (Novagen) to obtain the expression vector pET-hPNPase, which produces N-terminal His tag-fused hPNPase. Cell Culture and RNA Interference—HeLa cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The sequences of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting hmtPAP and hPNPase were designed by an RNA interference activity-predicting algorithm. 2T. Katoh and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. The sequence of the sense strand of each siRNA is as follows: 5′-cucugagaugcaaaaugaa-3′ for siRNA-hmtPAP, which targets nucleotide position (np) 189–207 of hmtPAP; and 5′-gaaacagguguaacuauua-3′ for siRNA-hPNPase, which targets np 1900–1918 of hPNPase. These siRNAs were synthesized by a method used to synthesize siRNAs derived from in vitro-transcribed short hairpin RNA (iGENE Therapeutics, Inc.) (24Katoh T. Susa M. Suzuki T. Umeda N. Watanabe K. Suzuki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 3: 249-250Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As a control, siRNA-scramble (Qiagen) was also used. 1.5 × 105 cells/well were inoculated in 6-well plates and cultivated for 24 h. The medium was then changed to 1 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) per well. The cells were transfected with each siRNA (final concentration 200 nm) by using 10 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and incubated for 4 h, after which 500 μl of DMEM with 30% fetal bovine serum was added. 72 h after the transfection, the total RNAs were extracted from the cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was carried out to measure the hmtPAP and hPNPase mRNAs using a One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The region amplified by RT-PCR corresponds to np 38–904 of hmtPAP, np 1496–2441 of hPNPase, and np 578–1029 of human GAPDH, respectively. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—To determine the location of EGFP-fused hmtPAP, HeLa cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1.5 μg of pEGFP-hmtPAP using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). 24 h after the transfection, MitoTracker CMXRos dye (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 20 nm, and the cells were incubated for 30 min and then washed with fresh DMEM. The red fluorescence of the dye and the green fluorescence of EGFP were simultaneously observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMIRB). To analyze the mitochondrial morphotype and membrane potential, 20 nm MitoTracker CMXRos and 100 nm MitoTracker GreenFM (Molecular Probes) were used and observed as described above 48 h after siRNA transfection. PAT Assay—This assay is based on the method described by Temperley et al. (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). First, 2.5 μg of total RNAs from each cell were ligated with 200 pmol of linker DNA oligonucleotide that had been 5′-phosphorylated and 3′-aminated (5′-phospho-atgtgagatcatgcacagtcata-3′-NH2). 12% PEG6000 was then added, and a ligation reaction was performed using 20 units of T4 RNA ligase at 37 °C for 3 h. The ligated RNA was then amplified by RT-PCR using a One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and using 0.6 μm of an anti-linker primer (5′-gactgtgcatgatctcac-3′) and a gene-specific forward primer (upper primer). A second round of PCR was then carried out using a forward primer internal to the first PCR product (lower primer) and the anti-linker. A five-cycle PCR was performed as above with the first PCR product using 30 nm of both the anti-linker and 5′-32P-labeled lower primer. An aliquot of the product was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel containing 7 m urea and visualized by an imaging analyzer (BAS-5000, Fuji Film). Primers used for this assay are as follows: cytochrome c oxidase (CO) 1 upper (5′-gtaaatctaactttcttcccacaacactttc-3′) and CO1 lower (5′-caaccccatggcctccatgactttt-3′); CO2 upper (5′-ggccaccaatggtactgaacctacg-3′) and CO2 lower (5′-tttgaaatagggcccgtatttaccc-3′); CO3 upper (5′-ggagtatcaatcacctgagctcacc-3′) and CO3 lower (5′-tgtatgtctccatctattgatg-3′); ATP synthase F0 subunit 6 (ATP6) upper (5′-gtgattataggctttcgc-3′) and ATP6 lower (5′-agtaagcctctacctgcacg-3′); ND3 upper (5′-caacaccctcctagccttactac-3′) and ND3 lower (5′-ggcctatgagtgactacaaaaaggattagactgagc-3′); actin upper (5′-cgagcatcccccaaagttcacaatgtggcc-3′) and actin-lower (5′-tgagaccagttgaataaaagtgcacacctt-3′). Northern Blotting—5 μg of total RNA from each transfectant were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and then UV crosslinked to the membrane. The membrane was pre-hybridized for 15 min at 65 °C in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and then hybridized in the same buffer containing 32P-labeled cDNA probe for 1 h at 65 °C. The radiolabeled cDNA probes were prepared from the DNA templates of the corresponding region in mtDNA by random priming with a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara). The DNA templates were obtained by PCR and included CO1 (np 5905–7446), CO2 (np 7587–8270), CO3 (np 9361–9864), ATP6 (np 8528–9208), and ND3 (np 10060–10405). As a control, a probe for β-actin (np 300–502) was also prepared. To detect 16 S mt rRNA, the 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, 5′-aagtaagagacagctgaacc-3′, was used for hybridization at 42 °C. The hybridized membrane was washed with 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl and 30 mm sodium citrate) and with 5× SSC (0.75 m NaCl and 75 mm sodium citrate) only for 16 S mt rRNA containing 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature, and then with 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS, and subsequently with 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl and 1.5 mm sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C (at 42 °C only for 16 S mt rRNA). The membranes were then dried and analyzed by an imaging analyzer BAS5000 (Fuji Film). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed essentially as described (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted from each siRNA-treated cell, and the protein concentration was determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of total protein were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the proteins were detected specifically using antibodies against CO1, CO2, and CO4 (Molecular Probes), heat shock 60-kDa protein (HSP60), and β-actin (Sigma). Oxygen Consumption Rate—The O2 consumption rate by cells 72 h after each siRNA transfection (0.3–0.6 × 107 cells in 3 ml of DMEM) was measured at 37 °C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI 5300A Biological Oxygen Monitor System) as described previously (26Umeda N. Suzuki T. Yukawa M. Ohya Y. Shindo H. Watanabe K. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1613-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Recombinant hmtPAP and hPNPase—The transformed E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) carrying pET-hmtPAP or pET-hPNPase was cultured in LB broth (50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37 °C, and the expression was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. Both of the proteins were expressed as a soluble form and purified by BD TALON™ Resin (zco;clontechClontech) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Glycerol was added to the enzyme to a final concentration of 30%, frozen quickly with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. In Vitro Transcription of mt mRNA—The full-length coding region of bovine mt ND6 DNA was amplified from bovine mtDNA using a sense primer with ApaI site (5′-gcagggcccatgatactatacattgtatttattc-3′) and an antisense primer with HindIII site (5′-gccaagcttttaatttccacgagtaatttctataataac-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGEM-7Zf(+) Vector (Promega). The cloned plasmid linearized with HindIII was used as a template for T7 transcription, and the transcripts obtained were purified by RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen). In Vitro PAP Assay—The assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.033 μm [α-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 A260 units of oligo(A), or 0.05 A260 units of bovine mt ND6 mRNA, and 300 ng of hmtPAP or 500 ng of hPNPase. After the reaction, the RNA substrate was subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and the gel was exposed to an imaging plate. The radioactivity was analyzed by an imaging analyzer BAS5000 (Fuji Film). Retrieval of a Candidate Gene Encoding Human mt PAP in Silico—Previously, while we were purifying the mt CCA-adding enzyme from bovine liver mitochondria, we detected mt PAP activity for 5 S rRNA as a substrate along with mt CCA-adding activity for tRNAs (28Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, we were not able to purify PAP from bovine mitochondria because its purification through several column chromatographic steps caused the enzyme to lose its activity. This induced us to turn to a reverse genetics approach to identify mt PAP. Many mt proteins show high homology to bacterial counterparts. In particular, it is known that mt CCA-adding enzyme (28Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which, like PAP, belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, is an apparent homolog of its bacterial counterparts. Consequently, we speculated that mt PAP may show high sequence similarity to bacterial type PAP, which belongs to the class II proteins of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. However, we were not able to detect bacterial PAP-like sequences in the human and mouse EST data base except for one encoding an mt CCA-adding enzyme (28Nagaike T. Suzuki T. Tomari Y. Takemoto-Hori C. Negayama F. Watanabe K. Ueda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40041-40049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, when we searched for a gene having homology to the family of regulatory cytoplasmic PAPs that was recently identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (GLD-2 (29Wang L. Eckmann C.R. Kadyk L.C. Wickens M. Kimble J. Nature. 2002; 419: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cid1 (30Read R.L. Martinho R.G. Wang S.W. Carr A.M. Norbury C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12079-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Cid13 (31Saitoh S. Chabes A. McDonald W.H. Thelander L. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2002; 109: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)), we identified an apparent human regulatory cytoplasmic PAP homolog bearing an mt targeting pre-sequence. We have designated this protein hmtPAP. While our study on hmtPAP was in progress, Stepien and co-workers (23Tomecki R. Dmochowska A. Gewartowski K. Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6001-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) also identified and reported the same gene. Orthologs of hmtPAP were found in mice, rats, chickens, flies, mosquitoes, and ascidians. All had the mt transit peptide at their N terminus (data not shown). Shorter forms bearing the mt transit peptide were also readily identified in Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (data not shown). The hmtPAP orthologs diverge from the canonical bacterial class II or eukaryotic class I PAPs and lack the apparent RNA-recognition motif region thought to be critical for substrate RNA binding (29Wang L. Eckmann C.R. Kadyk L.C. Wickens M. Kimble J. Nature. 2002; 419: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All orthologs bear a conserved putative DXD motif essential for the coordination of the metal ions during the nucleotidyltransfer reaction. Therefore, we speculated that all these gene products may function as PAPs in the mitochondria of the organisms listed above. We could not find regulatory cytoplasmic PAP homologs with an mt targeting signal peptide in yeast, which is consistent with the report that yeast mt RNAs lack a poly(A) tail (11Butow R.A. Zhu H. Perlman P. Conrad-Webb H. Genome. 1989; 31: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subcellular Localization of hmtPAP in HeLa Cells—To determine whether hmtPAP is in fact targeted to mitochondria, HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-hmtPAP, which transiently expresses hmtPAP with GFP fused to its C-terminal end. Confocal microscopy of the cells showed that GFP-hmtPAP (Fig. 1, left panel) co-localized with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker CMXRos (Fig. 1, right panel), indicating that hmtPAP mainly localizes to mitochondria, as expected. hmtPAP Is Responsible for Polyadenylating mt mRNAs— Next, we examined whether hmtPAP in mitochondria is involved in the polyadenylation of mt mRNAs. Thus, we used siRNA to knockdown hmtPAP in HeLa cells and measured the poly(A) tails of the mt mRNAs by using the PAT assay (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also knocked down hPNPase because PNPase is reported to have polyadenylation activity in bacteria (32Rott R. Zipor G. Portnoy V. Liveanu V. Schuster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15771-15777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Mohanty B.K. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11966-11971Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Bralley P. Jones G.H. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and spinach chloroplasts (35Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PNPase is a reversible enzyme that can degrade RNA by using inorganic phosphate or synthesize RNA by using any nucleotide diphosphate as substrate. Nucleotide triphosphate can also be used as a substrate for polymerization activity (32Rott R. Zipor G. Portnoy V. Liveanu V. Schuster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15771-15777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because hPNPase is localized in mitochondria (36Piwowarski J. Grzechnik P. Dziembowski A. Dmochowska A. Minczuk M. Stepien P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it may be possible that hPNPase can also polyadenylate human mt mRNAs. To estimate the efficacy of the siRNA-mediated knockdown, RT-PCR for the target mRNAs was carried out, and the PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining. This showed that both the hmtPAP and hPNPase genes were specifically targeted by their respective siRNAs because hmtPAP mRNA was barely detectable even after 25 cycles of RT-PCR, whereas hPNPase mRNA could not be detected after 20 cycles (data not shown). The GAPDH mRNA levels were not affected by either siRNAs. Thus, these siRNAs were employed in the following experiments. We employed PAT assay (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to examine the poly(A) length of the mt mRNAs CO1, CO2, CO3, ATP6, and ND3 in the cell, which was transfected by siRNA targeting for hmtPAP. As a control, the poly(A) tail of cytoplasmic β-actin mRNA was analyzed at the same time. The wild type cells and the siRNA-scramble-treated cells show two populations of poly(A)+ mt mRNAs (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), namely mt mRNAs with longer tails consisting of 40–50 adenines, and mt mRNAs with shorter tails consisting of 0–15 adenines (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the siRNA-hmtPAP-treated cells, the lengths of the longer poly(A) tails were slightly shortened, and the population of shorter poly(A) tails of mt mRNAs had increased (Fig. 2, lanes 3). This pattern was similar to that observed when the ATP6 gene had pathogenic micro-deletions that caused severe deadenylation (22Temperley R.J. Seneca S.H. Tonska K. Bartnik E. Bindoff L.A.

The knockdown of hmtPAP did not affect the length of the poly(A) tail of cytoplasmic β-actin mRNA. These data, together with those shown in Fig. 1, showed that hmtPAP is involved in the polyadenylation of mt mRNAs but not cytoplasmic mRNAs. In contrast, in the siRNA-hPNPase-treated cells, the population of mRNAs with the longer poly(A) tails apparently extended about 20 adenines, on average, than those in the wild type cells (Fig. 2, lanes 4). The poly(A) tail of the cytoplasmic β-actin mRNA was not affected by the knockdown of hPNPase. This result indicates hPNPase functions primarily in vivo in human mitochondria as an exonuclease rather than as a polymerase.

Several recent studies have shown that these proteins are partly localized in lipid rafts, domains of the plasma membrane enriched in sphingolipids, and cholesterol. Here, we have employed cysteine mutants of SNAP25/SNAP23, which have modified affinities for raft domains, to examine whether raft association of these proteins is important for the regulation of exocytosis. PC12 cells were engineered that express the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin; in these cells all of the SNAP25 was cleaved to a lower molecular weight form, and regulated exocytosis was essentially absent. Exocytosis was rescued by expressing toxin-resistant SNAP25 or wild-type SNAP23, which is naturally toxin-resistant. Remarkably, a mutant SNAP25 protein with an increased affinity for rafts displayed a reduced ability to support exocytosis, whereas SNAP23 mutants with a decreased affinity for rafts displayed an enhancement of exocytosis when compared with wild-type SNAP23. The effects of the mutant proteins on exocytosis were dependent upon the integrity of the plasma membrane and lipid rafts. These results provide the first direct evidence that rafts regulate SNARE function and exocytosis and identify the central cysteine-rich region of SNAP25/23 as an important regulatory domain.

Exocytosis, the fusion of intracellular vesicles with the plasma membrane, mediates the secretion of molecules from the cell and the insertion of proteins and lipids into the plasma membrane. This membrane fusion event needs to be tightly regulated when vesicles contain molecules such as neurotransmitters, adrenaline, or insulin. A large number of proteins have been identified that function in exocytosis (1Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 2Burgoyne R.D.

Membrane fusion requires the interaction of Q-SNAREs present on the plasma membrane with R-SNAREs residing on the vesicle membrane. In neuronal and neuroendocrine cells, the Q-SNAREs that function in regulated exocytosis are syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, whereas the R-SNARE is VAMP/synaptobrevin (5Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recently, there has been significant interest in the domain distribution of Q-SNAREs present at the plasma membrane. A number of studies have suggested that Q-SNAREs are partly localized in lipid rafts, lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane enriched in sphingolipids, and cholesterol (6Lafont F. Verkade P.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As rafts have been proposed to function in the regulation of numerous signal transduction (15Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar) and membrane traffic pathways (16Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), these observations raise the intriguing possibility that rafts may regulate SNARE function and, hence, exocytosis. As yet, the importance of the raft association of SNARE proteins for exocytosis has not been examined. Recent work from our group has reported that raft association of SNAP25 and its ubiquitous homologue, SNAP23, is mediated by the cysteine-rich domains of these proteins (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We identified mutations within SNAP23 that decreased its raft association by ∼2.5-fold and a point mutation in SNAP25 that increased raft association of this protein by 3-fold. Here, we have used these mutant proteins to directly test the importance of raft association of SNARE proteins for exocytosis. The results of this study show that an increased association of SNAP25/23 with rafts leads to a decrease in the extent of exocytosis. These results provide the first demonstration that rafts regulate the function of SNARE proteins, and suggest that the spatial distribution of SNAREs at the plasma membrane may play a prominent role in regulating exocytosis. Materials—Rat HA antibody and human growth hormone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Mouse HA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SNAP23 and SNAP25 antibodies were from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). Anti-GFP was from Chemicon (Hampshire, UK). Digitonin was purchased from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). Triton X-100, n-octylglucoside, cadmium chloride, and all other reagents were of an analytical grade from Sigma. Plasmids—All constructs used were N-terminally tagged. HA-SNAP25, HA-SNAP25 (F84C), and GFP-SNAP23 plasmids were described previously (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HA-SNAP25 botulinum toxin E-resistant was obtained from R. Burgoyne. It contained the mutations R180W, I181E, and E183I. The F84C mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid encoding botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) light chain fused to GFP was a gift of R. Burgoyne (18Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The pXGH5 plasmid (gift from R. Burgoyne) contains the human growth hormone cDNA under a metallopromoter inducible by the addition of CdCl2 in the growth medium. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were analyzed 2 days posttransfection. Growth Hormone Assays and Western Blotting—PC12 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of human growth hormone (hGH) plasmid and 1 μg of test plasmid. The transfection medium was replaced 6 h later with fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml CdCl2. 48 h later, the cells were washed twice in Krebs buffer (20 mm Hepes, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), and exocytosis was measured in response to 0 or 300 μm ATP. Alternatively, cells were permeabilized in KGEP/MgATP buffer (139 m potassium glutamate, 20 mm Pipes, 5 mm EGTA. 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2,pH 6.5) supplemented with 20 μm digitonin for 6 min, and exocytosis was measured in either 0 or 10 μm free calcium in KGEP/MgATP buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Secreted and cell-associated hGH was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the supplier's instructions. The amount of hGH released was calculated as a percentage of the total cell content. Maximal responses in each experiment were set to 100% to allow data to be averaged from several different experiments. For immunoblotting analysis, cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% n-octylglucoside to fully solubilize raft proteins. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for the expression of the transfected proteins by Western blotting. Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t test and assuming equal variance. Membrane Preparation, Detergent Solubilization, and Sucrose Gradient Flotation—PC12 cells (20 × 106) were washed three times in HES buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 1 ml of HES buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 196,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of MBS (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and supplemented with protease inhibitors. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The solubilized membranes were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and 0.4 ml of the homogenate was added to an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MBS. The lysates (in 40% sucrose) were placed at the bottom of a centrifuge tube and overlaid successively with 2.2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1.4 ml of 5% sucrose. After centrifugation at 240,000 × g in a Beckman SW60 rotor for 18 h, 400-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient (designed fraction 1 (top) through 11 (bottom)). The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of MBS. For digitonin treatment, cells were incubated in KGEP/MgATP buffer in the presence or absence of 20 μm digitonin. Cells were then solubilized in Triton X-100, and rafts were purified by sucrose gradient flotation. Generation of Stable PC12 Cell Lines Expressing BoNT/E—PC12 cells were transfected by electroporation (360 V, 950 μF, 3 pulses) with 10 μg of the GFP-BoNT/E plasmid and plated on a collagen IV (Sigma) coated 10-cm plate. 1 mg/ml of G418 was added to the growth medium to select clones. Separated clones were isolated and screened for the appearance of the botulinum toxin-cleaved form of SNAP25 in cell lysates. Positive clones were further cultured in normal PC12 growth medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418 and used between passage 3 and 8 for exocytosis assays. Immunoprecipitation of SNAP25 and SNAP23—Cells were transfected with GFP-SNAP23, GFP-SNAP23 (C79F), HA-SNAP25, or HA-SNAP25 (F84C). Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Thesit, and 0.5% saponin, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with either 50 μl of mouse HA antibody or 5 μl of rabbit GFP antibody at 4 °C overnight. HA antibody was captured on a mixture of protein G and protein A-Sepharose, and GFP antibody was immobilized on protein A. The Sepharose was washed several times in buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS dissociation buffer. The association of proteins with detergent-resistant membranes is thought to reflect their association with lipid raft domains present in living cells (19Chamberlain L.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We recently showed that SNAP23 is significantly enriched in detergent-insoluble rafts compared with its homologue SNAP25 (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This difference in raft association is because of an extra cysteine residue in the membrane-targeting domain of SNAP23. SNAP23 has 5 cysteines in this domain, whereas SNAP25 has 4 cysteine residues. Mutating specific cysteines in the membrane-targeting domains of SNAP25 and SNAP23 has a marked effect on the raft association of these proteins without affecting plasma membrane delivery (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to compare the ability of these raft-targeting mutants of SNAP25/23 to support exocytosis in PC12 cells. Isolation of Botulinum Neurotoxin E-expressing PC12 Clones—To directly compare the effects of wild-type and a raft-targeting mutant of SNAP25 on exocytosis it was important to first inactivate endogenous SNAP25 protein. For this, PC12 cells were transfected with the light chain of BoNT/E fused to GFP. This toxin cleaves the C-terminal 26 amino acids from SNAP25 and causes a complete inhibition of exocytosis (20Schiavo G. Santucci A. DasGupta B.R. Mehta P.P. Jontes J. Benfenati F. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A clone (number 38) was selected in which no intact SNAP25 was detectable (Fig. 1A). Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding hGH, which is packaged into secretory vesicles and can be assayed to measure secretion specifically from transfected cells. ATP-stimulated hGH release in this clone was essentially absent and was not rescued by transfection of wild-type SNAP25 (Fig. 1B). It has previously been shown that introducing mutations into the toxin-cleavage site of SNAP25 renders the protein resistant to cleavage by BoNT/E without affecting the exocytic function of SNAP25 (21Washbourne P. Bortoletto N. Graham M.E. Wilson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. Montecucco C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Graham M.E. Washbourne P. Wilson M.C. Burgoyne R.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that a previously described BoNT/E-resistant form of SNAP25 was able to rescue exocytosis from cells expressing BoNT/E (Fig. 1B). This system is thus suitable for the analysis of the effects of SNAP25 mutants on exocytosis in PC12 cells. SNAP25 (F84C) Displays a Reduced Ability to Restore Exocytosis in BoNT/E-expressing PC12 Cells—We previously described a cysteine mutant of SNAP25 (F84C) displaying a 3-fold increased affinity for detergent-resistant rafts compared with the wild-type protein (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This increased raft association is because of the addition of an extra cysteine in the central domain of SNAP25B (Fig. 2A), which makes the number and distribution of cysteines in this protein identical to SNAP23. Lipid raft association of the BoNT/E-resistant forms of wild-type and F84C SNAP25 in BoNT/E-expressing PC12 cells was determined by detergent solubilization and sucrose gradient flotation. Fig. 2B shows that SNAP25 (F84C) is significantly more enriched in rafts than SNAP25 (wt) (6.6 + 1.5% for toxin-resistant SNAP25, 30.9 + 1.3% for toxin-resistant F84C in rafts, n = 3, p < 0.0002). Interestingly, the level of raft association of BoNT/E-resistant SNAP25 (6.6%) was reduced compared with non-toxin-resistant SNAP25 (20%, see Refs. 7Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and 17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We also detected a similar difference in the raft association of these two proteins in wild-type PC12 cells (data not shown), implying that mutations in the toxin-cleavage site of SNAP25 directly modulate raft association. Nevertheless, as the toxin-resistant forms of wild-type SNAP25 and the F84C mutant displayed significantly different levels of raft association, we were able to test the effect of these proteins (and hence of raft association of SNAP25) on release of hGH. Interestingly, toxin-resistant SNAP25 (F84C) displayed a significantly reduced ability to restore exocytosis in BoNT/E-expressing PC12 cells (Fig. 2C). Although this effect was relatively modest we noted that transfection of the BoNT/E-resistant SNAP25 proteins was accompanied by a partial restoration of full-length endogenous SNAP25 expression (Fig. 2C, inset, asterisk). This is presumably caused by BoNT/E-resistant SNAP25 “mopping up” some of the toxin light chain (these mutants are mutated in the toxin cleavage site, not the binding site). The recovery of endogenous SNAP25 expression was similar to the expression level of the BoNT/E-resistant proteins (Fig. 2C inset, arrowhead). This suggests that only ∼50% of the hGH secretion measured in Fig. 2C is mediated by the BoNT/E-resistant proteins. Thus, the results shown in this figure are likely to underestimate the difference between wild-type SNAP25 and the F84C mutant. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged SNAP25 and F84C revealed that both proteins interacted equally well with their SNARE partner, syntaxin 1A (Fig. 2D). Wild-type and Mutant SNAP23 Proteins Rescue Exocytosis in BoNT/E-expressing PC12 Cells to Different Extents—SNAP23 is able to replace SNAP25 and rescue insulin secretion in BoNT/E-treated HIT cells (23Sadoul K. Berger A. Niemann H. Weller U. Roche P.A. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33023-33027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Murine SNAP23 is naturally toxin-resistant (24Macaulay S.L. Rea S. Gough K.H. Ward C.W. James D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We recently generated SNAP23 mutants displaying a decreased raft affinity compared with the wild-type protein because of the mutation of cysteines at amino acid positions 79 or 83 to phenylalanine (Fig. 3A and Ref. 17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As reported previously for wild-type PC12 cells, these mutants display a decreased raft association when expressed in BoNT/E-expressing PC12 cells (Fig. 3B; raft association of wild-type SNAP23 was 49 + 4.1%, SNAP23 (C79F) was 26.6 + 0.4%, SNAP23 (C83F) was 22 + 1.8%, n = 4). Importantly, SNAP23 expression in BoNT/E-expressing cells did not allow the recovery of full-length endogenous SNAP25 (Fig. 3C). Also, immunoprecipitation of GFP-SNAP23 or the C79F mutant from PC12 cells co-precipitated similar amounts of both syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 4 but no SNAP25 or transferrin receptor (Fig. 3D). Thus, SNAP23 may support exocytosis in PC12 cells by SNARE pairing with syntaxin 1A and/or syntaxin 4. We then examined the ability of SNAP23 to restore exocytosis in the toxin-expressing cells. All SNAP23 proteins were found to rescue exocytosis in toxin-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). Intriguingly, however, the C79F and C83F mutants supported substantially more exocytosis than wild-type SNAP23. The Increased Level of Exocytosis Supported by the SNAP23 Cysteine Mutants Depends upon Membrane Integrity—Importantly, we found that the enhanced level of regulated exocytosis supported by the C79F and C83F mutants was not recapitulated in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Digitonin interacts with cholesterol in membranes and creates pores, allowing exocytosis to be stimulated directly by the addition of calcium. The extent of calcium-stimulated exocytosis was similar in cells expressing either wild-type SNAP23 or the cysteine mutants (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that digitonin treatment reduced the raft association of SNAP23; digitonin treatment of BoNT/E cells reduced the raft association of the endogenous SNAP23 by an average of 70% (n = 5, p < 0.0004). This result demonstrates that digitonin (as other cholesterol-binding agents) not only permeabilizes cell membranes but also disrupts raft structure. Thus, the effects of the mutant proteins on exocytosis depend upon membrane integrity, arguing strongly that their stimulatory effects on intact cells are a consequence of their altered localization within the membrane and not caused by intrinsic differences in the ability of the proteins to support exocytosis. SNARE proteins are partly associated with detergent-resistant raft domains present in several distinct cell types (6Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Disruption of raft domains by the cholesterol-binding agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin decreased ATP or depolarization-induced exocytosis in PC12 cells (7Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 8Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that raft (or cholesterol-rich) domains of the plasma membrane were sites for fusion and exocytosis. Recent studies, however, argue against this hypothesis. For example, cyclodextrin treatment of pancreatic β cells enhances insulin secretion (13Xia F. Gao X. Kwan E. Lam P.P.L. Chan L. Sy K. Sheu L. Wheeler M.B. Gaisano H.Y. Tsushima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24685-24691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, disruption of lipid rafts by the action of an exogenously added sphingomyelinase activates Glut4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (25Liu P. Leffler J.B. Weeks L.K. Chen G. Bouchard C.M. Strawbridge A.B. Elmendorf J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C317-C329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover these studies do not provide a direct measure of the role of raft domains in regulating SNARE function. In the present study we tested this directly by delocalizing from or enriching SNARE proteins in rafts. We showed that increasing the association of SNAP25 to lipid rafts resulted in a decrease in regulated exocytosis. Conversely, reducing SNAP23 partitioning into lipid rafts increased exocytosis. The equalizing of exocytosis levels in digitonin-permeabilized cells expressing wild-type or mutant SNAP23 proteins shows that the membrane integrity is required to maintain the differences in the ability of these proteins to support exocytosis. Recent work has shown that SNAP25A/B and SNAP23 differ in their ability to support exocytosis in chromaffin cells (26Sorensen J.B. Nagy G. Varoqueaux F. Nehring R.B. Brose N. Wilson M.C. Neher E. Cell. 2003; 114: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In particular, exocytosis in SNAP23-expressing cells lacked a release component arising from a primed vesicle pool, and SNAP25B supported a larger primed vesicle pool than SNAP25A. Although these results may reflect differences in protein-protein interactions of the SNARE homologues, we speculate that the distinct affinities of these proteins for rafts impacts on their function in exocytosis in these cells. The central cysteine-rich domain of SNAP25 has previously been implicated in the plasma membrane targeting of SNAP25 (27Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and in the efficient concentration of SNAP25 at the plasma membrane (28Koticha D.K. McCarthy E.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that the distinct cysteine-rich domains of SNAP25 and SNAP23 are also directly related to the efficiency of exocytosis. It is striking that such a difference in the efficiency of exocytosis (and in raft association) is because of a single mutation in the cysteine-rich domain of SNAP25 and SNAP23. These central cysteines are modified by S-acylation (29Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Vogel K. Roche P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this study stresses the importance of the addition or removal of a single acyl chain residue within a domain already containing four or five other fatty acids at steady state. This suggests a possible modulation of SNAP25 and SNAP23 function by inducible palmitoylation/depalmitoylation. It is indeed known that that chemical deacylation does not remove SNAP25 from membranes (31Gonzalo S. Linder M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and we showed recently that four cysteine residues (as compared with five) do not compromise the plasma membrane association of SNAP23 (17Salaün C. Gould G.W. Chamberlain L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1236-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The importance of the exact position of a single cysteine within the central domain is revealed by the study of the two SNAP23 mutants. Although the raft association of SNAP23 (C79F) and SNAP23 (C83F) is comparable, the C79F mutant is significantly more efficient than C83F at supporting exocytosis. Thus, the distinct cysteine-rich domains of these proteins may be important for some other aspect of exocytosis not related to raft association, or, alternatively, these different cysteine-rich domains may target to distinct raft-like domains present in the plasma membrane. This is of particular importance because the position of the cysteines (and phenylalanines) within the two SNAP23 mutant proteins is similar to that found within the two isoforms of SNAP25. Recent studies have shown a difference in the ability of SNAP25A and B to support exocytosis (26Sorensen J.B. Nagy G. Varoqueaux F. Nehring R.B. Brose N. Wilson M.C. Neher E. Cell. 2003; 114: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 32Bark C. Bellinger F.C. Kaushal A. Mathews J.R. Partridge L.D. Wilson M.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8796-8805Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SNAP25B seems to be more efficient than SNAP25A, and this difference is reflected in the present study by the SNAP23 (C79F) (whose central domain is comparable to SNAP25B) and SNAP23 (C83F) (whose central domain is comparable to SNAP25A) mutants. This could suggest that the position of one cysteine within SNAP25 may actually contribute to the functional differences between the two isoforms. In contrast to previous models (7Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 14Salaün C. James D.J. Chamberlain L.H. Traffic. 2004; 5: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), our results implicate rafts as negative regulators of neuronal exocytosis. Many levels of regulation exist to ensure that exocytosis in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells is tightly regulated. There is a wealth of published data describing different protein-protein interactions that may regulate SNARE function and exocytosis, but little is known about the regulation of SNARE function imposed by compartmentalization of the plasma membrane. In this regard, the results presented here provide clear evidence that SNAP25/23 association with lipid rafts inhibits exocytosis; as these SNARE proteins are highly enriched in rafts purified from unstimulated cells, this suggests that lipid rafts are important physiological regulators of SNARE function.

Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re15PubMed Google Scholar). TOR proteins consist of several functional domains (see Fig. 1a) (3Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal ∼1200 residues consist of stretches of HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, regulatory subunit A of PP2A, TOR1) repeats, which typically mediate protein-protein interactions. Recently, it was also suggested that the ∼550-amino acid-long FAT (FRAP, ATM, TTRAP) domain that follows the HEAT repeats is composed of HEAT repeat-like α-helical structures and could also serve as a protein interaction platform (4Perry J. Kleckner N. Cell. 2003; 112: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The known interactions of TOR with other proteins have been reviewed recently (1Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re15PubMed Google Scholar). The FKBP12-rapamycin binding site is flanked by the FAT domain and the catalytic kinase domain. Binding of the FKBP12·rapamycin complex to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain specifically inhibits TOR (5Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The catalytic kinase domain is highly homologous to that of phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinases. Thus, TOR and its relatives have been termed phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases. TOR has been shown to fulfill its functions by directly phosphorylating serine and threonine residues of target proteins and by regulating protein phosphatases (1Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re15PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal ∼33 residues of TOR form the FATC domain. In all phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases, the FATC domain always occurs in tandem with the FAT domain (6Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the FATC domain is indispensable for TOR function in vivo and in vitro (7Takahashi T. Hara K. Inoue H. Kawa Y. Tokunaga C. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Kuroda Y. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7416-7423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Here, we report the solution structure of y1fatc, the FATC domain of yeast TOR1 (residues 2438–2470), which showed a new structural motif consisting of an α-helix and a disulfide-bonded loop. Reduction of the disulfide bond resulted in strong conformational changes and increased flexibility of the loop region. The structural data, together with the determined intermediate range redox potential (–0.23 V) and the biochemical characterization of a Cys to Ser mutant of the full-length protein, suggest that the cellular stability of TOR toward degradation and possibly its function can be redox-regulated. Protein Expression—Constructs of the yeast TOR1 FATC (y1fatc) domain were designed based on sequence conservation. Residues 2438–2470 were cloned into GEV2 (9Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using the BamHI and XhoI sites and overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) in M9 minimal medium. About 40% of the IgG-y1fatc fusion protein was in the soluble fraction obtained after sonication of the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5. The remaining 60% of the protein was extracted from inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m urea, pH 7.5, and extracted using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7.5, with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. The extract was dialyzed to TST buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; equilibration buffer for the IgG-Sepharose, see below). IgG-y1fatc fusion protein was extracted from the cleared lysate and from the dialyzed inclusion body extract using an IgG-Sepharose 6 fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences) as described in the manufacturer's manual. The purified fusion protein was lyophilized, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8, and desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8, and, after the addition of 2 mm CaCl2, digested with Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. After digestion, the fusion partner was removed by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid buffer system, and fractions containing pure y1fatc were lyophilized. Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that y1fatc had the correct molecular weight. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments of air oxidized y1fatc in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, showed that y1fatc was monomeric. NMR Sample Preparation—Lyophilized 15N- or 15N, 13C-labeled y1fatc was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8 (in 95% H2O/5% D2O or in 100% D2O), and the pH was adjusted to 6. Reduced samples were obtained by adding 20 mm Tris(2-carboxylethyl)phosphine-HCl. The sample for measuring residual dipolar couplings contained about 25 mg/ml PF1 phages (ASLA Biotech). The protein concentration was always ∼0.5 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on Bruker DRX600 and 800 spectrometers. The data were processed with NMRPipe (10Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (11Johnson B.R. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Assignments for 13C, 15N, and 1H nuclei were based on three-dimensional CBCANH, CBCA-(CO)NH, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, CCONH-TOCSY (12Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 101: 114-119Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and HCCH-TOCSY, and HNCO spectra. Stereospecific assignments and dihedral angle information were derived from 3D-HACAHB-COSY, 3D-15N-ROESY, 3D-HNHA, and 13CO-{13Cγ}-SED- and 15N-{13Cγ}-SED-15N-1H-HSQC spectra. Distance restraints were obtained from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Information about the backbone dynamics was derived from the measurement of 15N relaxation experiments including T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation rate), T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation rate), and (1H)-15N NOE. If not explicitly mentioned elsewhere, references for all experiments are given in Ref. 13Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and references therein. 15N-1H residual dipolar couplings were obtained from the analysis of 15N-1H IPAP-HSQC data (14Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) acquired on the sample containing PF1 phages. The maximal 1DN-H was –17.4 Hz. Structure Calculation—All structure calculations were performed with XPLOR-NIH (15Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Marius Clore G. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) using torsion angle molecular dynamics. Distance restraints were generated in NMRView and classified according to NOE cross-peak intensities. Upper bounds were 2.8, 3.4 (3.5 for 15N-bound protons), 4.5, and 5.5 Å. The lower bound was always 1.8 Å. For all NOE restraints, r–6 sum averaging was used. Backbone dihedral angle restraints for ϕ were derived based on 3JHNHα and the chemical shift index (16Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments were obtained for 14 β-methylene proton pairs. Based on 3JHαHβ2/3 coupling constants and NOE/ROE data, side chain χ1 angles were restrained to one of the staggered conformations (60°, 180°, –60°) ± 30°. N-H residual dipolar couplings were included using the SANI statement and an error bound of 0.2 Hz. The distance between the Cα atoms of the disulfide bond-forming cysteines was restrained to be within 4.2–7.0 Å and the dihedral angle around the disulfide bond to be 0° ± 105°, because the dihedral angle χ3 is always 95° or –95° ± 10° (17Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). Determination of the Redox Potential—The redox potential of y1fatc was determined by following the protein fluorescence at 350 nm for different ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione ([GSH]2/[GSSG]) and analyzing the data as described previously (18Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples contained 1.1 μm y1fatc in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm GSSG, and concentrations of GSH ranging from 10 μm to 90 mm. All buffers were degassed and flushed with argon. The concentration of reduced glutathione in the buffer was verified with an Ellman assay (19Creigthon T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 157-158Google Scholar). All samples were prepared under nitrogen atmosphere. All measurements were performed at 25 °C (298 K) on an Aminco Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer using 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvettes (right angle arrangement), an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, and a bandwidth of 4 nm. The bandwidth for detection was 8 nm. Mutagenesis Studies—Plasmid pJM244 (pTOR2C→S) was constructed by PCR amplification of a 1300-bp fragment of the COOH-terminal region of yeast TOR2 using the primers TOR2D (5′-GGT AAA CAG TTG CCA CAA TTA CAA TTA CAA ACT CTT GAA CTA CAA CAT GTG TCG CC) and TOR2Rmut (5′-GAA CTC GAG TAC AAC TAA GTG ATT TTC AAT ACA TTA AAA CTA CCA GAA TGG AGA CC) containing an artificial XhoI restriction site and a single base change (underlined) compared with the TOR2 wild-type sequence resulting in the C2470S mutation. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with SpeI and XhoI and used to substitute the SpeI-XhoI fragment of plasmid p206 (20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), a yeast centromeric plasmid containing an NH2-terminal hemagglutinin epitope-tagged TOR2 expressed under the control of its own promoter. Plasmid pJM232 (pTOR2) was constructed in a similar way, but with primer TOR2Rnat as TOR2Rmut and with a C instead of the underlined G, to amplify the wild-type sequence. As a control, the same centromeric plasmid without the TOR2 sequence (pRS314 = pVector) was used. No additional mutations were introduced in plasmids pJM232 and pJM244 as confirmed by sequencing of the SpeI-XhoI fragment. These plasmids were used to transform the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains SH121 and SH221 (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in rich medium (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) or synthetic minimal medium complemented with the appropriate nutrients for plasmid maintenance as described previously (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Paromomycin and rapamycin were added at the indicated concentration from a concentrated stock to autoclaved yeast extract/peptone/dextrose with 2% agar prior to gelation. Spot tests of yeast growth were performed as described previously (23Mulet J.M. Alejandro S. Romero C. Serrano R. Yeast. 2004; 21: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but plates were incubated at a restrictive temperature (37 °C) for the thermosensitive allele of TOR2. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (24Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). The FATC Structure—The FATC domain of the family of TOR kinases is highly conserved. Fig. 1b shows an alignment of the carboxyl-terminal 33 residues of TOR proteins from different species. One-third of the residues are completely conserved, including two cysteines in an i to i + 7 spacing. To elucidate the role of the two cysteines for the structure of the FATC domain, we first acquired 15N-HSQC spectra of oxidized and reduced y1fatc (Fig. 2). Oxidized y1fatc shows a spectrum characteristic for a folded protein with well dispersed amide proton nitrogen cross-peaks for the majority of residues. In the spectrum of the reduced form, resonances for the carboxyl-terminal 15 residues (2456–2470) were broadened beyond detection, indicating increased conformational flexibility because of the reduction of the disulfide bond in this region. To understand the molecular basis of the differences between the oxidized and the reduced forms, we have determined the structure of the oxidized form using standard NMR techniques. The NMR structure of oxidized y1fatc is shown in Fig. 3, and structural statistics are given in Table I. The structure consists of a long, NH2-terminal α-helix extending from residue Glu2444 to the first cysteine, Cys2460 (Fig. 3, a and b), and a COOH-terminal disulfide-bonded loop from Cys2460 to Cys2467 that folds the protein chain back onto itself. This chain reversal is facilitated by the completely conserved glycine at position 2465. Contacts within the loop are dominated by interactions involving aromatic side chains (Fig. 3d). Pro2468 makes hydrophobic as well as C-H···π interactions with the aromatic rings of Tyr2463, Trp2466, and Phe2469. The C-H···π interactions are very similar to hydrogen bonds and depend on the orientation and distance of the planes of the involved pyrrolidine and aromatic rings (25Bhattacharyya R. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In y1fatc, many of the pyrrolidine ring protons of Pro2468 have distances of <4.5 Å to the aromatic carbons of Trp2466 and Phe2469 and orientations of their ring planes that are commonly found in such C-H···π interactions. Additional hydrophobic contacts involving aromatic and aliphatic side chains occur between the conserved carboxyl-terminal residues Phe2469 and Trp2470, Leu2459 and Ile2456, as well as between Trp2466, Typ2463, and Ile2464. The side chains of Ile2456 and Leu2459 make further contacts to the methyl groups of Ala2453 and Thr2454, respectively.Table IStatistics for the final 20 of 200 calculated y1fatc structures (trans-Pro2468)Experimental restraintsDistance restraintsAll (assigned + ambiguous)Total824 (727 + 97)Intraresidue399 (390 + 9)Sequential + medium389 (315 + 74)Long range (|i-j| > 4)36 (22 + 14)ϕ angle restraints26χ1 angle restraints201DN-H residual dipolar coupling restraints29Structural statisticsaNone of the structures had distance restraints violations >0.3 Å, dihedral angle violations >5°, or residual dipolar coupling violations >1 Hz.r.m.s.broot mean square. deviations from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.0161 ± 0.0016Dihedral angle (°)0.347 ± 0.177Residual dipolar coupling (Hz)0.144 ± 0.024r.m.s.broot mean square. deviations from idealized geometryBonds0.0038 ± 0.0001Angles0.496 ± 0.017Improper0.365 ± 0.019Lennard Jones energy (kcal mol-1)-95 ± 5ProcheckcRef. 55. statistics (%)Residues in most favored regions82.0Residues in additional allowed regions18.0Residues in generously allowed regions0Residues in disallowed regions0Average r.m.s. deviationbroot mean square. to mean structure (Å)Residues 6-33 (backbone/heavy)0.39/0.88α-Helical = 7-23 (backbone/heavy)0.22/0.83a None of the structures had distance restraints violations >0.3 Å, dihedral angle violations >5°, or residual dipolar coupling violations >1 Hz.b root mean square.c Ref. 55Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab From a comparison of the 15N-HSQC (Fig. 2) and circular dichroism (not shown) spectra of oxidized and reduced y1fatc, it can be deduced that part of the α-helix is also populated in the reduced form. The 1H-15N cross-peaks for the α-helical residues Glu2444 to Leu2449 do not shift significantly (Fig. 2), indicating that their chemical and structural environment is maintained. In contrast, the COOH-terminal region from Ile2456 to Trp2470 becomes clearly more flexible upon reduction of the Cys2460–Cys2467 disulfide bridge. The absence of NOEs for the first five NH2-terminal residues preceding Pro2443 indicates a random coil conformation for this part of the sequence. Indeed, the 15N relaxation data (Fig. 4) give evidence of large amplitude backbone motions on the subnanosecond time scale from V2442 onward to the NH2 terminus because of a strong increase in the T2 and T1 relaxation times and a strong decrease of the (1H)-15N NOEs. T1 values for the helical and loop part are more uniform, with an average of 0.57 ± 0.08 s, which is close to values expected for an isotropically tumbling molecule of the size of y1fatc (4 kDa) at 25 °C. In contrast, T2 values (average = 0.10 ± 0.04 s) within this structured part are much smaller (∼0.4 s) than expected for a rigid molecule of this size and indicate the presence of considerable line broadening because of chemical exchange on the microsecond time scale. Note also that the asymmetry of the helical molecule contributes to a certain extent to the shortening of the amide 15N T2 values. However, the effect of even very pronounced asymmetry of the diffusion tensor would be too small to account for the observed shortening of t2. A more extended analysis using the program TENSOR (26Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and an isotropic model as a first approximation for the rotational diffusion of y1fatc showed that the chemical exchange contributions (Rex) increase strongly from the beginning to the end of the structured part (Fig. 4, bottom panel). The subnanosecond order parameter S2 also increases from values around 0.3 at the NH2 terminus to values around 0.8 at the COOH terminus (Fig. 4, fourth panel). Thus on the subnanosecond time scale, there are large amplitude motions at the NH2 terminus but only small amplitude motions at the COOH-terminal end of the structure. In contrast, micro- to millisecond time scale motions are stronger in the COOH-terminal half. Therefore, albeit folded, the helix and loop parts of the FATC structure are partly flexible, with the time scale of motions becoming longer toward the COOH terminus. This observation is not surprising because the FATC domain is stabilized by only a few tertiary contacts at the COOH-terminal end that are mediated by the disulfide bridge. The 13Cα and 1Hα resonances of Cys2467 are not visible in the NMR spectra of y1fatc, and its side chain and the one following residue Pro2468 show only few and broad NOE contacts. Presumably, this is because of additional conformational exchange from disulfide bond crankshaft motions like the ones that have been characterized in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (27Grey M.J. Wang C. Palmer III, A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14324-14335Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the structure calculations, the left-hand conformation (17Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar) of the disulfide bond is only slightly more favored (13 of the 20 best structures) than the right-hand conformation. A second minor set of resonances was observed for the backbone amides of residues Phe2469 and Trp2470 (Fig. 2) and for the Pro2468 Cδ/Hδ nuclei in the 13C-HSQC spectrum. These resonances indicate the presence of a minor cis-form of Pro2468 in addition to the predominant trans-form. As judged from the spectral intensities, this cis-form is populated to 15–20%. Very similar structures for the rest of FATC were obtained when Pro2468 was constrained to the cis-instead of the trans-conformation (data not shown). Determination of the Redox Potential—Because both tryptophans of y1fatc are in the vicinity of the disulfide bond-forming cysteines (Fig. 3d), the redox state-dependent fluorescence at 350 nm was used to determine the redox potential (18Grauschopf U. Fritz A. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3503-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) of the Cys2460–Cys2467 disulfide bond of y1fatc. For y1fatc equilibrated in buffers containing different ratios of oxidized and reduced glutathione, we detected a two-state transition curve (Fig. 5a) that corresponds to an equilibrium constant (Keq) of 0.45 m. Using the Nernst equation E′0 y1fatc = E′0 GSH/GSSG – (RT/2F) ln Keq, with E′0 GSH/GSSG = –0.24 V, this results in a redox potential of –0.23 V for y1fatc. Apparently, this value is very close to the one for glutathione. Other cellular components (Fig. 5b) are more reducing or more oxidizing than y1fatc, such as thioredoxin (–0.27 V) or cytochrome c (0.22 mV), respectively. Mutagenesis Studies—In yeast, two highly homologous TOR proteins have been identified. TOR1 is only found as part of TOR·C1 (complex 1), a multiprotein complex that regulates cell growth in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. In contrast, TOR2 can be found as part of TOR·C1 but additionally can participate in a second protein complex called TOR·C2. The known function of the complex TOR·C2 is to regulate the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton in a rapamycin-insensitive manner (24Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). To study the influence of the FATC disulfide bonds on both complexes, mutagenesis studies were carried out on the TOR2 protein. In detail, the second of the disulfide bond-forming cysteines in TOR2 (Cys2470 = Cys2467 in TOR1) was changed to serine (C2470S). To investigate the effect of this TOR2 mutation on the function of the rapamycin-insensitive complex TOR·C2, a plasmid containing the C2470S mutation (pTOR2C→S) was introduced into the yeast strain SH121 (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that carries a thermosensitive allele of TOR2. The pTOR2C→S plasmid was able to complement the thermosensitive phenotype under restrictive temperature conditions (37 °C), where expression of wild-type TOR2 protein is suppressed (data not shown). Experiments with an isogenic wild-type plasmid (pTOR2) yielded identical results. Thus, the function of complex TOR·C2 is not affected by the C2470S mutation. To investigate the effect of the C2470S mutation on the function of the rapamycin-sensitive complex TOR·C1, the pTOR2C→S plasmid was introduced into the yeast strain SH221 that is deleted in TOR1 and carries a thermosensitive allele of TOR2 (21Helliwell S.B. Howald I. Barbet N. Hall M.N. Genetics. 1998; 148: 99-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Switching from the permissive (30 °C) to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) under normal or stressful conditions, including oxidative or osmotic stress, did not lead to a growth defect (data not shown). However, at the restrictive temperature, the strain carrying plasmid pTOR2C→S was unable to grow on medium containing sublethal concentrations of paromomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, or of rapamycin, a TOR-C1-specific inhibitor (Fig. 6a). In contrast, controls at the permissive temperature or on the same strain transformed with the plasmid pTOR2 showed normal growth (Fig. 6a). Thus the C2470S mutation affects the activity of the rapamycin-sensitive complex TOR·C1 in the presence of paromomycin or rapamycin. This effect on the activity could be caused by a structural change within the complex or by a general destabilization of TOR2 that leads to smaller cellular concentrations. To investigate this effect further, we performed an immunoprecipitation of TOR2 extracted from yeast cells that were grown identically at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) and that were expressing either wild-type or mutated TOR2. The amount of C2470S TOR2 was ∼3-fold less than that of wild-type TOR2 (Fig. 6b). Thus, the C2470S mutation reduces the amount of TOR2 protein, which may explain the paromomycin- and rapamycin-hypersensitive phenotypes described above. To make sure that the mutation does not simply affect the amount of TOR2 on the mRNA level, we performed reverse transcription-PCR experiments (data not shown) using the same strains, genetic constructs, and growth conditions as for the immunoprecipitation. These experiments showed that the mutation does not change either the transcription or, presumably, the expression level of TOR2 (data not shown). We also performed immunofluorescence experiments on whole fixed cells to determine the cellular location of the mutant TOR2, but no changes in localization compared with wild-type TOR2 were detected (data not shown). In the present study, we investigated the structure of the highly conserved yeast TOR1 FATC domain. In its oxidized form, FATC consists of an α-helix and a well structured disulfide-bonded loop between two completely conserved cysteines (Cys2460 and Cys2467). The NH2-terminal half of the helix and the loop region next to the COOH terminus are rather acidic (Fig. 3c), whereas the remaining part of the loop is more hydrophobic. Therefore, oxidized FATC could bind to a hydrophobic surface of complementary shape surrounded by polar residues. Reduction of the disulfide bond dramatically increases the flexibility within the COOH-terminal loop region and presumably the accessibility of several hydrophobic side chains in this region. Thus the reduction may alter the binding behavior of FATC to other parts of TOR or other cellular partners. The redox potential of the Cys2460–Cys2467 disulfide bridge was determined as –0.23 V. This value is very similar to the one for glutathione (Fig. 5b). In yeast, a C2470S TOR2 mutation had no significant effect on growth under normal or stressful conditions. However, cells ca"

The PUS1 gene encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1p) that is known to pseudouridylate tRNAs in other species. Total RNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patients, parents, unaffected siblings, and unrelated controls, and the tRNAs were assayed for the presence of pseudouridine (Ψ) at the expected positions. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic tRNAs from MLASA patients are lacking modification at sites normally modified by Pus1p, whereas tRNAs from controls, unaffected siblings, or parents all have Ψ at these positions. In addition, there was no Pus1p activity in an extract made from a cell line derived from a patient with MLASA. Immunohistochemical staining of Pus1p in cell lines showed nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial distribution of the protein, and there is no difference in staining between patients and unaffected family members. MLASA is thus associated with absent or greatly reduced tRNA pseudouridylation at specific sites, implicating this pathway in its molecular pathogenesis.

MLASA is thus associated with absent or greatly reduced tRNA pseudouridylation at specific sites, implicating this pathway in its molecular pathogenesis. Following transcription, all stable RNAs are processed, and nucleotides are modified. The most abundant modification is pseudouridine (Ψ), formed by the action of pseudouridine synthases. A number of these modification enzymes have been characterized from several species, and one that has been particularly well studied is pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1p). 1The abbreviations used are: Pus1p, pseudouridine synthase 1; Pus3p, pseudouridine synthase 3; Pus4p, pseudouridine synthase 4; hPus1p, human Pus1p; mPus1p, mouse Pus1p; CMCT, 1-cyclohexyl-3(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate; MLASA, mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia; Ψ, pseudouridine; RT, reverse transcriptase; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus. Pus1p has been characterized from yeast (1Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), mouse (2Chen J.

Additional sites in tRNAs have been identified for yeast Pus1p in vivo (1Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N.

ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 569-576Google Scholar). In yeast, if the deletion of the PUS1 gene is combined with deletions of the gene for pseudouridine synthase 4 (Pus4p, tRNA Ψ55 synthase) or with the gene for Los1p (part of the nuclear pore complex), either combination is lethal (4Simos G.

In addition, when Pus1p and Pus4p are deleted in yeast, there is a defect in the transport of certain tRNAs out of the nucleus (8Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol.

This mutation, a replacement of an arginine with a tryptophan at position 116, affects an amino acid in Pus1p that is highly conserved throughout evolution. This amino acid is part of the active site of the enzyme and is near a critical aspartate (position 118) that has been shown to be necessary for catalysis in several families of pseudouridine synthases (11Huang L.

We speculated that Pus1p in patients with MLASA was likely to be enzymatically inactive, and therefore cellular tRNAs would lack Ψs that are formed by the enzyme. We found that tRNAs from patients do lack Ψs that are known to be formed by Pus1p and that there is no Pus1p activity in an extract made from a cell line derived from a patient. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of Pus1p in cells showed nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial distribution of the protein, and there was no difference in the pattern of staining between patients and unaffected family members. Assays for Pseudouridine—Total RNA (10 μg) from lymphoblastoid cell lines (10Bykhovskaya Y. Casas K. Mengesha E. Inbal A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Am. J. Hum.

Ofengand J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar, 15Baumstark T. Ahlquist P. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1652-1670PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of these treated RNAs (1 μg) were used in primer extension reactions using avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (RT) and the 32P-end-labeled primers 5′-ATTCGAACCTGCGCGGGGAAAC-3′ for cytoplasmic tRNASer(UGA) and 5′-GAGTTGGTTCTCTTAATC-3′ for mitochondrial tRNALys(UUU) as described (15Baumstark T. Ahlquist P. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1652-1670PubMed Google Scholar). The products were separated on denaturing (8.3 m urea) 10% polyacrylamide gels (19:1; acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Sequencing reactions using the labeled primer and a plasmid containing the human tRNA gene were electrophoresed along with the primer extension reactions (3Patton J.R. Padgett R.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Baumstark T. Ahlquist P. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1652-1670PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR film. The plasmids used in the sequencing reactions were constructed by generating a fragment using the PCR with primers from the 5′ and 3′ ends of human tRNA genes and human DNA from one of the control cell lines as the template (17Mullis K. Faloona F. Scharf S. Saiki R. Horn G. Erlich H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). The primers used to generate the fragments are as follows: for cytoplasmic tRNASer(UGA), 5′-GTAGTCGTGGCCGAGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTAGTCGGCAGGATTCG-3′ (reverse); for mitochondrial tRNALys(UUU), 5′-CACTGTAAAGCTAACTTAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACTGTAAAGAGTTGGTTC-3′ (reverse); for mitochondrial tRNASer(UGA), 5′-GAAAAAGTCATGGAGGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGGAAGGAATCGAACC-3′ (reverse); and for cytoplasmic tRNALys(UUU), 5′-GCCCGGATAGCTCAGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCCCGAACAGGGACTTG-3′ (reverse). These fragments were inserted into pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequences of the resultant recombinants were confirmed by sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were made as described (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) from cell lines derived from a MLASA patient (-/-), a heterozygote (+/-), and an unaffected sibling (+/+). Labeled tRNASer(UGA) was transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]GTP, using the plasmid pHtS (20Wu X.Q. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5589-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) digested with BstNI as a template (21Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). This labeled substrate (43,000 cpm, 0.41 ng) was incubated with each of the extracts (30 μg of total protein in 20 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), recombinant mouse Pus1p (mPus1p) (0.7 μg), or Lac protein (0.7 μg) for 2 h at 37 °C as described (2Chen J. Patton J.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Chen J. Patton J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12723-12730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The RNA was isolated from the reactions and gel-purified on a 10% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea gel (23Sambrook J. Rusell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 776Google Scholar). The recovery of counts was variable for the five samples and was considerably worse for the samples in which the tRNASer was incubated with extracts (see the legend for Fig. 4 for relative values). Each RNA sample was then digested with RNaseT2 and chromatographed on TLC plates using isobutyric acid:ammonium hydroxide (25%):water (50:1.1: 28.9; v/v/v) in the first dimension and isopropanol:concentrated HCl: water (70:15:15; v/v/v) in the second dimension (2Chen J. Patton J.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Nishimura S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1972; 12: 49-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The TLCs were then exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 48 h and scanned using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX™ system. Immunohistochemistry—To experimentally determine the intracellular localization of the human Pus1p protein, polyclonal antibodies against human Pus1p were raised by immunization of rabbits with the synthetic peptide CEKYNQRFGNDGLHE (GenBank™ accession number NP_079491, internal amino acids 313–326) using PolyQuick™ custom antibody services of Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from a patient with MLASA, a parent, and an unaffected sibling, as well as the K-562 cell line (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and human skeletal muscle cells (Cell Applications Inc, San Diego, CA) were cultured and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Pus1p antibody and mouse anti-human mitochondria monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The signals were visualized using secondary goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 568 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 488 antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies). An Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Apogee KX-2E digital camera and Image Pro and Focus Control computer programs were used to visualize and capture the cells mounted in Vectashield mounting 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The confocal images were taken with an Olympus EV300 confocal unit attached to the microscope. Excitation was made with an ArKr ion laser at 488 and 567 nm. Cw laser power was maintained in the range of 3–7 milliwatt. To determine the pseudouridylation state of the tRNAs in affected and unaffected individuals, total RNA was isolated from the 12 lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patients with MLASA, their unaffected parents and siblings, as well as unrelated controls (10Bykhovskaya Y. Casas K. Mengesha E. Inbal A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were used in a primer extension assay for Ψ that involves chemically treating the total RNA with CMCT, which modifies N-3 of uridine and Ψ and N-1 of guanosine. This chemical modification is then reversed with mild base on U and G residues but not Ψ residues. This modification of Ψ will cause RT to stop during the specific primer extension phase of the assay. The products are electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea gel along with sequencing lanes using the same end-labeled primer (14Bakin A.V. Ofengand J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 77: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar, 15Baumstark T. Ahlquist P. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1652-1670PubMed Google Scholar). Two tRNAs that were assayed in the samples were human cytoplasmic tRNASer(UGA) and human mitochondrial tRNALys(UUU) (Fig. 1). With tRNASer(UGA), there are three Ψs at positions 28, 39, and 55 (25Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The Ψ at 28 is formed by Pus1p (1Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N.

Y.). 1999; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the other two modifications are formed by Pus3p and Pus4p, respectively (22Chen J. Patton J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12723-12730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human mitochondrial tRNALys(UUU) has two Ψs at 27 and 28 of the tRNA (28Suzuki T. Wada T. Saigo K. Watanabe K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6581-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); both residues are potentially the product of Pus1p modification. The results of the primer extension assay using a primer specific for tRNASer(UGA) are shown in Fig. 2. Stops to RT that are found in the CMCT+ lanes but not in the CMCT-lanes are indicative of a Ψ at positions 28 and 39 (see the arrows on the side of the panel). RT stops just before the covalently modified nucleotide, and additional stops to RT found in both lanes are due to the secondary structure of the tRNA. The stop to RT at position 28 is missing in RNA samples 3, 4, 7, and 9, indicating that the tRNASer(UGA) from those samples is lacking Ψ at position 28. These RNA samples are from patients with MLASA (-/-). All of the other RNA samples (1Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N.

There is a stray spot in CMCT+ lane for sample 9 in the approximate position where the strong stop for Ψ28 should be, but when this sample was assayed again, there was no band at this position (data not shown). All of the samples have a Ψ at position 39, which was expected since this uridine is modified by Pus3p (22Chen J. Patton J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12723-12730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primer used hybridizes to the region of the tRNA that contains position 55, formed by Pus4p (27Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and so the modification state of that position was not determined. Next the primer extension assay was used to determine whether the modification of mitochondrial tRNALys(UUU) was affected by the loss of Pus1p activity. Fig. 3 shows the results with the 12 RNA samples and, as with tRNASer(UGA), the tRNAs from the patients (samples 3, 4, 7, and 9) do not have strong stops to RT just before position 27 and 28. The other samples do have very strong stops prior to position 28 and slightly weaker but still prominent stops prior to position 27. In the patient samples, there is a very slight increase in band intensity in the CMCT+ lanes before position 27, but that may be due to the possibility that the unmodified tRNA adopts a slightly different secondary structure from the modified tRNALys(UUU). Nevertheless, it is obvious that the intensity of the band increases in samples 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13. In addition, there is no hint of a stop just before position 28 in the patient samples, so the loss of modification at position 28 is unequivocal. Two other tRNAs were assayed, mitochondrial tRNASer(UGA) and cytoplasmic tRNALys(UUU), and again, the modifications formed by Pus1p are missing in RNA samples from the MLASA patients and present in the samples from the parents, unaffected siblings, and controls (data not shown). The Pus1p activity of nuclear extracts (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) made from three cell lines was tested by incubating [32P]GTP-labeled tRNASer(UGA) with the extracts, recombinant mPus1p, or a control recombinant Lac protein isolated under the same conditions as mPus1p (2Chen J. Patton J.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The isolated RNA from the reactions was digested with RNaseT2 and chromatographed on TLC plates in two dimensions (2Chen J. Patton J.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Nishimura S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1972; 12: 49-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A phosphorimaging device scan of the five TLCs is shown in Fig. 4. Although tRNASer(UGA) has three Ψs (Fig. 1), only the Ψ at position 28 has a G residue 3′ to the modified nucleotide. This is important because RNaseT2 leaves 3′ phosphates, and therefore the Ψ at position 28 will be the only one labeled in this experiment. If enzymes such as Pus3p or Pus4p in the extracts modify the other uridines at 39 and 55 (22Chen J. Patton J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12723-12730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these will not appear on the TLC since they will not be labeled. A spot for Ψ can be seen in the TLC where tRNASer(UGA) was incubated with mPus1p, as well as in the TLCs where the extracts made from cell lines from +/+ and +/- individuals were used. However, there is no spot for Ψ on the TLC where the extract made from the cell line from a -/- individual or when the Lac control protein was used in the reaction. To determine the cellular localization of human Pus1p, dual-label immunohistochemistry was employed. Previously published experiments using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and mouse homologues of human Pus1p have shown their predominantly nuclear localization (4Simos G.

Cell. 2004; 15: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Publicly available prediction programs classified Pus1p as a likely mitochondrial enzyme (10Bykhovskaya Y. Casas K. Mengesha E. Inbal A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and Pus1p activity was found in a mitochondrial extract that was shown to be free of cytosolic contaminants (31Helm M. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, a and b, the distribution of Pus1p is shown with red fluorescence, whereas the location of the mitochondria is indicated with green fluorescence. Pus1p is found in all the cells including cells from patients with MLASA (Fig. 5a, LB Pt row). Human Pus1p protein is clearly present in the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm and appears to co-localize with the mitochondrial marker (panels C and D) in all cell types, as shown on Fig. 5a. The presence of Pus1p in mitochondria was confirmed using confocal microscopy of EBV-transformed lymphocytes from an unaffected family member (Fig. 5b). Clearly, mitochondrial marker (shown in green (panel A)) and Pus1p (shown in red (panel B)) co-localize when merged (panel C), as demonstrated by the yellow color of the mitochondria organelles. These results support Pus1p involvement in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA processing, which occur in the nucleus and mitochondria respectively. Why might the absence of Ψ in tRNAs result in MLASA? The tRNA data base2 (25Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) shows that 29 cytoplasmic tRNA genes (out of 36 listed) and 18 mitochondrial tRNA genes (out of 27 listed, including variants) will have uridines at positions 27 and/or 28 of the tRNA and are potential substrates for Pus1p. Of the sequenced cytoplasmic tRNAs listed (17 total), there are eight with Ψs identified at positions 27 or 28 and three more with uridines in at least one of those positions. Pseudouridine is known to affect the structure of tRNAs, affecting base-stacking (5Davis D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5020-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) in the anticodon loop, and when it appears in stems or the anticodon, it strengthens base-pairing (6Auffinger P. Westoff E. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 103-112Google Scholar, 32Davis D.R. Poulter C.D.

When modeled with RNA oligomers, the presence of Ψ in U2 small nuclear RNA causes a change in the structure of the lariat branch point of pre-messenger RNA (35Newby M.I. Greenbaum N.L. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Newby M.I. Greenbaum N.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A functional requirement for Ψ in U2 small nuclear RNA has also been shown in reconstitution of splicing systems (37Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5783-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Zhao X. Yu Y.-T. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Donmez G. Hartmuth K. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The loss of Ψ in tRNAs may alter the structure of the tRNA and have an impact on its role in the translation process. This impact may affect the interaction of the tRNA with its cognate amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and the fit of the unmodified tRNA in the P or A site of the ribosome. It may also affect the transport of the tRNA out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm since it has been shown that tRNA transport is affected after the combined loss of Pus1p and Pus4p activities in yeast (8Grosshans H. Lecointe F. Grosjean H. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46333-46339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, the role of Pus1p may even be more important. Several tRNA genes in human mitochondria (Gly, one Leu, Lys, Phe, one Ser, Thr, and Tyr) have no uridine at position 55. By contrast, every gene for cytoplasmic tRNAs predicts that there will be a uridine at this position, and all sequenced cytoplasmic tRNAs have a Ψ at position 55 (25Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Therefore these mitochondrial tRNAs will not have a Ψ at position 55, and four of these mitochondrial tRNAs (Gly, one Leu, Lys, and Phe) are potential substrates for Pus1p. If the modification at positions 27 or 28 is also missing, as in the patients with MLASA, then the structure and function of the tRNA may be compromised. This is not the first human disorder that can be attributed to a defect in pseudouridylation. One form of dyskeratosis congenita (X-linked) has been shown to be due to the loss or mutation of the dyskerin protein (40Heiss N.S. Knight S.W. Vulliamy T.J. Klauck S.M. Wiemann S. Mason P.J. Poustka A. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), which is a homologue of the yeast protein Cbf5p, the pseudouridine synthase responsible for ribosomal RNA modification (41Zebarjadian Y. King T. Fournier M.J. Clarke L. Carbon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7461-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Dyskerin is part of the telomerase complex, and its loss results in a destabilization of the complex (42Mitchell J.R. Wood E. Collins K. Nature. 1999; 402: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). However, a mouse model of the disease was created when mutations affecting the pseudouridylation activity of Dyskerin but not telomerase binding activity were engineered (43Ruggero D. Grisendi S. Piazza F. Rego E. Mari F. Rao P.H. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 2003; 299: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loss of rRNA pseudouridylation contributes to the disorder. Recently it was shown that mPus1p acts as a regulator of nuclear receptor activity through the modification of steroid receptor RNA activator (30Zhao X. Patton J.R. Davis S.L. Florence B. Ames S.J. Spangaard R.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The pseudouridine synthase activity of mPus1p is required for this co-activation. The synthase modifies steroid receptor RNA activator, and it is part of the nuclear receptor complex that interacts with the response element on DNA (30Zhao X. Patton J.R. Davis S.L. Florence B. Ames S.J. Spangaard R.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded that some aspects of MLASA may be due to the loss of this activity of Pus1p. Future studies will focus on whether the loss of modification affects the function, location, or quantity of certain tRNAs in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or mitochondria. Using the cell lines from MLASA patients and controls, the efficiency of the cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial translational machinery will be investigated. We thank the individuals with MLASA and their families for their cooperation. We also thank H. Gross for the pHtS plasmid, D. Acuna for help with immunohistochemistry, and Dr. S. Wachsmann-Hogiu for help with confocal microscopy."

Several studies have also described ceramide (CER), a lipid second messenger, as a major contributor in mediating UV light-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and cell death. It is demonstrated here that UV-C light irradiation of U937 cells results in the activation and translocation of a Zn2+-independent acid sphingomyelinase, leading to CER accumulation in raft microdomains. These CER-enriched rafts aggregate and play a functional role in JNK activation. The observation that UV-C light also induced CER generation and the externalization of acid sphingomyelinase and JNK in human platelets conclusively rules out the involvement of a nuclear signal generated by DNA damage in the initiation of a UV light response, which is generated at the plasma membrane.

Mammalian cells respond to UV light irradiation by activating a complex signaling network that implies radical oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, radical oxygen species; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CER, ceramide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MβCD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; P-JNK, phosphorylated JNK; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; A-SMase, acid SMase; N-SMase, neutral SMase.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, radical oxygen species; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CER, ceramide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MβCD, methyl β-cyclodextrin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; P-JNK, phosphorylated JNK; SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; A-SMase, acid SMase; N-SMase, neutral SMase. production, activation of transcription factors, and stimulation of kinases (1Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Among the latter, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a main regulator of the AP-1 transcription factor, is considered as one of the most critical components of the UV light response. Indeed, the JNK/AP-1 pathway has been implicated in various UV light effects depending on the cellular model, including tumor promotion (2Barthelman M. Chen W. Gensler H.L. Huang C. Dong Z. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 711-716PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis (3Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.F. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and cell cycle arrest (4Goss V.L. Cross J.V. Ma K. Qian Y. Mola P.W. Templeton D.J. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that the characterization of the signal transduction pathway leading to JNK activation has attracted a great deal of attention. From these studies, ceramide (CER), a lipid second messenger, has emerged as a major contributor in mediating UV light-induced JNK activation (5Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Further studies have confirmed the general function of CER in stress-activated JNK activation and in mediating cell death (6Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CER is produced upon UV light activation has been investigated. Hitherto, two main metabolic pathways have been identified for CER accumulation, namely hydrolysis from sphingomyelin (SM) through sphingomyelinase (SMase) stimulation and de novo synthesis by CER synthase activation. The latter appears not to be involved in UV light-induced CER production. Indeed, UV-A, -B, and -C light induce SM hydrolysis in most cellular models because of SMase stimulation (7Zhang Y. Mattjus P. Schmid P.C. Dong Z. Zhong S. Ma W.Y. Brown R.E. Bode A.M. Schmid H.H. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11775-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although in human keratinocytes a third, nonenzymatic mechanism of CER formation has been described (8Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G. Schmitt-Brenden H. Felsner I. Timmer A. Sies H. Johnson J.P. Piette J. Krutmann J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5793-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite some controversies, it appears that both neutral SMase (N-SMase) and acid SMase (A-SMase) have been implied in UV light-induced CER production and apoptosis, depending on the cellular origin and experimental conditions (9Chatterjee M. Wu S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 219: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Magnoni C. Euclidi E. Benassi L. Bertazzoni G. Cossarizza A. Seidenari S. Giannetti A. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2002; 16: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of A-SMase, but not N-SMase, in UV light-induced JNK activation has been established (11Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although A-SMase stimulation appears to be a critical upstream event for JNK activation, the enzyme and how it operates following UV light irradiation have not been determined. The A-SMase gene encodes for at least two forms of A-SMase produced by post-translational processing, namely a lysosomal form (L-A-SMase), which is lacking in Niemann-Pick disease, and a so-called secretory form (S-A-SMase) identified by Schissel et al. (12Schissel S.L. Keesler G.A. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18250-18259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). S-A-SMase targets the plasma membrane, requires exogenous Zn2+ for activity, and has been involved in the cellular response to inflammatory cytokines (13Schissel S.L. Jiang X. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Finally, a third form of Zn2+-independent A-SMase has been identified recently that is present on the cell membrane surface of CD95- or CD40-stimulated cells (14Gulbins E. Grassme H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Finally, it remains to be determined what role, if any, does UV-C light-mediated DNA damage and, hence, a potential intranuclear signaling cascade have in initiating A-SMase activation. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that UV light irradiation may induce the activation and translocation of a Zn2+-independent A-SMase independently of a nuclear signal, resulting in CER formation in raft microdomains. We also hypothesized that CER-enriched membrane platform formation plays a role in JNK activation. Drugs and Reagents—Silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Aquasafe 300 scintillation mixture was purchased from EG & G Wallac (Evry, France). SR33557 was kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Herbert (Sanofi-Synthélabo, Toulouse, France), and maltose-binding protein·lysenin was provided by Dr. T. Kobayashi (Lipid Biology Laboratory, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan.) All other drugs and reagents, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma (St. Quentin Fallavier, France) or Alexis Biochemicals (Paris, France). Cell Culture—The human myeloblastic cell line U937, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Human blood platelet concentrates were obtained from the local blood bank (Centre Régional de Transfusion Sanguine, Toulouse, France). Normal human lymphoblast cells or Niemann-Pick disease lymphoblast MS1418 was a generous gift from Prof. T. Levade (INSERM U466, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France). Cell Irradiation—U937 cells were irradiated with UV-C light (254 nm) in PBS for 30 s, corresponding to 30 joules/m2 at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml. Sphingomyelin Hydrolysis—SM quantitation was performed by labeling cells to isotopic equilibrium with 0.5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline (81 Ci/mm; Amersham Biosciences, Sarclay, France) for 48 h in complete medium. Cells were then washed and resuspended in complete medium for kinetic experiments. Radiolabeled SM was extracted and quantified by scintillation counting as described previously (15Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Metabolic Cell Labeling and Quantitation of Ceramide—Total cellular CER was processed by labeling cells to isotopic equilibrium with 1 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h in complete medium as described previously (16Jaffrézou J.P.

Cells were then washed and resuspended in serum-free medium for kinetic experiments. Lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography developed in chloroform/methanol/acidic acid/formic acid/water (65: 30:10:4:2, by volume) in up to two-thirds of the plate and then in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (94:5:5, by volume). CER was scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Lipid standards were used to identify the various metabolic products. Alternatively, total cellular CER quantitation was performed using Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (Amersham Biosciences) according to previously published procedures (17Van Veldhoven P.P. Matthews T.J. Bolognesi D.P. Bell R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelinase Activities—Each fraction (150 μl aliquot) was assayed for the presence of different SMase activities (18Bodin S. Giuriato S. Ragab J. Humbel B.M. Viala C. Vieu C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15290-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Volumes were adjusted to 250 μl, and reactions were started by adding 250 μl of substrate solution. For the measurement of the A-SMase activity, this solution consisted of [choline-methyl-14C]SM (54.5 mCi/mol; 1 × 105 dpm/assay (∼1 nmol/assay); PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA in 200 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5). For the N-SMase assay, the substrate solution consisted of [choline-methyl-14C]SM (1 × 105 dpm/assay) and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm MgCl2. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by adding 300 μl of H2O and 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). Phases were separated by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min), and the amount of released radioactive phosphocholine was determined by subjecting 700 μl of the upper phase to scintillation counting. The amount of radiolabeled substrate that was hydrolyzed during an assay never exceeded 10% of the total amount of substrate added. For calculation of the specific activities in total cell homogenates, values were corrected for protein content, reaction time, and specific activity of the substrate. Isolation of Membrane Raft Microdomains—Raft microdomains were isolated from cells as described (19Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold MES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 25 mm MES, pH 6.5), containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. After 30 min on ice, cells were further homogenized by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer on ice. 1.5 ml of ice-cold MES-buffered saline was added, and 2 ml of this suspension was mixed with 2 ml of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MES-buffered saline. This mixture was subsequently loaded under a linear gradient consisting of 8 ml of 5–40% (w/v) sucrose in MES-buffered saline. All solutions contained the protease inhibitors 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 swinging rotor at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C. 12 fractions of 1 ml each were collected (from top to bottom), vortexed, and stored at -80 °C. The protein content of both fractions and the total initial cell suspension were measured using bovine serum albumin as standard (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Slot Blot—20 μl of light, heavy, and raft fractions was blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences) using a slot blot apparatus from Bio-Rad Laboratories. After blocking with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (0.1%) for 2 h, the filter was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the β-subunit of cholera toxin, which has an affinity for GM1. The filter was then washed, and bound proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Cells were irradiated with 30 J/m2 of UV-C light, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS. Cells were then washed and further incubated for 45 min with a rabbit polyclonal anti-A-SMase or rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 2 μg/ml. Cells were then washed in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and stained for 45 min with 7.5 μg/ml FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After a final PBS-BSA wash, cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScalibur, BD Biosciences). Determination of ROS—Production of ROS was detected using a C2938 fluorescent probe (Molecular Probes). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were labeled with 0.5 μm C2938 for 1 h and then irradiated with 30 J/m2 UV-C light. The cells were washed in PBS, and cell fluorescence was determined using flow cytometry on a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—Cells were irradiated with 30 J/m2 of UV-C light and incubated with 15 μg/ml cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to Cy5 (Molecular Probes) for 20 min. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS and washed with PBS containing 3% BSA (w/v) and 1 mm HEPES (PBS-BSA). Cells were then incubated for 45 min with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-A-SMase, mouse monoclonal anti-CER 15B4 (Alexis (Coger), Paris, France), or maltose-binding protein-conjugated lysenin followed by mouse anti-maltose-binding protein antiserum (New England Biolabs) (43Kiyokawa E.

Cells were then washed in PBS-BSA and stained for 45 min with 200 ng/ml FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse (green emission), or Cy3-labeled goat antimouse (red emission) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After a final PBS-BSA wash, cells were mounted on glass coverslips with Dako mounting medium (Dako, Trappes, France). Control staining were performed with secondary antibodies alone. Slides were examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a Plan-Apochromat 63× objective (1.4 oil). An argon laser at 488 nm was used to excite FITC (emission 515–540 nm), and a helium-neon laser was filtered at 633 or 550 nm to excite Cy5 and Cy3, respectively (emission 680 and 570 nm), as regulated by LSM software (Zeiss). For co-localization, images were recorded in multitracking mode, and images were obtained using IMARIS co-localization software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Western Blotting—Each aliquot was subjected for 5 min at 95 °C to denaturation buffer (62.5 mm Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 5% mercaptoethanol). The extracts were resolved by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences), and blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (0.1%) at 4 °C for 2 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Bound proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Kinase Assays—Cells extracts were prepared by lysing cells in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 12 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells extracts (150–250 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with 0.3 μg of anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm NaCl). Kinase assays were performed for 15 min at 30 °C using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as a substrate for JNK activity in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Orsay, France). Reactions were stopped with the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (9%). Phosphorylated MBP was visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, the dried gel was analyzed by autoradiography, and the corresponding bands were scraped and quantitated by scintillation counting. Statistics—The Student's t test was performed to evaluate the statistical significance. UV-C Light-induced CER Generation Through A-SMase but Not N-SMase Activation—U937 cells were prelabeled with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid or [methyl-3H]choline to equilibrium for 48 h and then irradiated in PBS with UV-C light at 30 J/m2.As shown in Fig. 1A, UV-C light induced an increase in CER levels (which peaked at 5–15 min after irradiation; data not shown). Concomitant with CER generation we observed significant SM hydrolysis (Fig. 1B), which suggested the involvement of a SMase. To determine which enzyme was responsible for SM hydrolysis and the subsequent CER generation, we evaluated the effect of UV-C light on both N-SMase and A-SMase activities. We observed that UV-C light did not affect N-SMase but led to a ∼30% increase of a zinc-independent A-SMase activity, which peaked within 5–15 min after irradiation (Fig. 1, C and D). To confirm this result, U937 cells were preincubated for 1 h with SR33557, a potent A-SMase inhibitor (23Jaffrézou J.P. Chen G. Duran G.E. Muller C. Bordier C. Laurent G. Sikic B.I. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and then irradiated with 30 J/m2 UV-C light. As expected, SR33557 significantly abrogated UV-C light induced A-SMase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Table I and Fig. 1D) and also abrogated CER generation (data not shown).Table IEffect of SR33557 on UV-C light-induced A-SMase externalization U937 cells were preincubated or not preincubated with SR33557 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then irradiated with UV-C at 30 J/m2. 12 min after UV-C, A-SMase externalization was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis on non-permeabilized cells using FITC-rabbit anti-A-SMase.SR33557FluorescenceaResults are expressed as the percentage of total cell surface fluorescence compared to nonirradiated controls and the mean of three independent experiments ± S.D.μm%None167 ± 151171 ± 86116 ± 910107 ± 113096 ± 7a Results are expressed as the percentage of total cell surface fluorescence compared to nonirradiated controls and the mean of three independent experiments ± S.D. Open table in a new tab UV-C Light-induced Activation of A-SMase in Rafts—To evaluate the potential role of plasma membrane rafts in UV-C light-induced A-SMase activation, cells were irradiated with UV-C light at 30 J/m2. 12 min post-UV-C light irradiation (corresponding to the peak of UV light-C light-triggered A-SMase stimulation), cells were lysed in cold Triton X-100 and fractionated on a sucrose density gradient. We observed basal A-SMase activity throughout the gradient (Fig. 2, A and B). Under UV-C light treatment, A-SMase was observed to increase exclusively in raft fractions. We have previously characterized U937 rafts whereby the Triton-insoluble material (fractions 4–6) expressed high levels of SM that co-migrated, as shown in Fig. 2C, on the density gradient with the raft marker ganglioside GM1 (24Grazide S. Maestre N. Veldman R.J. Bezombes C. Maddens S. Levade T. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Again, no significant increase in raft-associated N-SMase activity was observed (data not shown). To confirm the role of rafts microdomains, we pretreated U937 cells with the cholesterol-sequestering agent MβCD under conditions where it is still possible to isolate rafts but with their content in cholesterol significantly reduced (∼50% decrease; data not shown) (18Bodin S. Giuriato S. Ragab J. Humbel B.M. Viala C. Vieu C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15290-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Grazide S. Maestre N. Veldman R.J. Bezombes C. Maddens S. Levade T. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the CER generation induced by UV-C light was significantly decreased in MβCD-treated cells. These results strongly suggest that raft microdomains were essential for UV-C light-triggered CER generation. UV-C Light-induced A-SMase Translocation to the Plasma Membrane Outer Leaflet—We next investigated the subcellular distribution of A-SMase in UV-C light-treated cells, UV-C light induced a time-dependent recruitment of A-SMase to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane as revealed by flow cytometry analysis performed with a FITC-coupled anti-A-SMase antibody on non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 3A). Confocal analysis of A-SMase accumulation on the cell surface was detected as early as 10 min and peaked at 12 min, after which the fluorescence signal decreased and returned to basal level after 15 min (data not shown). These results suggested that, upon UV light activation, a fraction of internal A-SMase was rapidly and transiently externalized to the cell surface. Moreover, the temporal association between A-SMase stimulation and externalization suggested that activation was a critical event for enzyme relocalization. To clarify this important issue, we evaluated the effect of SR33557 on A-SMase externalization. As shown in Fig. 3B, inhibition of the enzyme resulted in significant inhibition of its relocalization. Because SR33557 at 30 μm inhibits basal SMase activity by >75% but does not lead to A-SMase degradation (23Jaffrézou J.P. Chen G. Duran G.E. Muller C. Bordier C. Laurent G. Sikic B.I. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), one can rule out an artifactual event. This result does suggest, however, that for the enzyme to be externalized and reach the SM-enriched outer membrane (40Bettaieb A. Record M. Come M.G. Bras A.C. Chap H. Laurent G. Jaffrézou J.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it must be in an active form. We next evaluated the effect of brefeldin A on A-SMase externalization. As shown in Fig. 3C, inhibition of the vesicular trafficking by brefeldin also abrogated the enzyme externalization. UV-C Light-induced A-SMase Translocation to Raft Microdomains—Based on our biochemical studies, we hypothesized that upon UV-C light activation, A-SMase relocalization was not a random process but that A-SMase was redirected toward raft microdomains. We first investigated whether UV-C light activation could interfere with raft distribution by using a Cy3-coupled antibody directed against flotillin (data not shown) or Cy5-coupled cholera toxin, which specifically binds the raft component ganglioside GM1. As shown in Fig. 4A, UV light irradiation induced a rapid and marked reorganization of rafts into larger platforms, producing a capping effect on the cells at 12 min post-irradiation (<10% GM1 clustering in controls (depending on the experiment) compared with >80% in irradiated cells). Moreover, in irradiated cells A-SMase colocalized with cholera toxin, suggesting that the enzyme translocated into raft microdomains (Fig. 4B). Based on these results, we hypothesized that CER production preferentially occurred at the raft level. Indeed, upon UV-C light activation CER co-localized with GM1 as shown in Fig. 4C. These results strongly suggested that plasma membrane microdomains are essential constituents in UV-C light-mediated A-SMase activation and externalization. Because SM is an essential constituent of plasma membrane rafts, we elected to investigate SM distribution in irradiated U937 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, the SM-specific toxin lysenin (here coupled to maltose-binding protein) bound uniformly to the plasma membrane of control U937 cells, as described previously for normal fibroblasts (41Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, there appeared to be a modest redistribution after irradiation that colocalized with GM1 aggregation. To further confirm the role of rafts in our study, we pretreated U937 cells with MβCD. As shown in Table II, UV-C light-induced A-SMase externalization was completely inhibited in MβCD-treated cells. Moreover, we observed, using confocal microscopy, that both CER and GM1 redistribution in UV-C light-treated cells were inhibited (as expected) in MβCD-treated cells (data not shown). These results suggested that UV-C light activated an ordered signaling cascade consisting of A-SMase activation and relocalization into raft microdomains, SM consumption, and CER release, resulting in the formation of large CER-enriched platforms. To further confirm this hypothesis, we compared A-SMase externalization under UV-C light treatment in normal and Niemann-Pick disease lymphoblasts. Again, UV-C light treatment induced significant A-SMase externalization in normal lymphoblasts, which was comparable with that observed in U937 cells but not in Niemann-Pick disease cells (Table II).Table IIEffect of cholesterol depletion and A-SMase deficiency on UV-C induced A-SMase externalizationPercentage of fluorescenceaCells were irradiated with UV-C light at 30 J/m2. 12 min after UV-C light irradiation, A-SMase externalization was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter cytometry on non-permeabilized cells using FITC-rabbit anti-A-SMaseU937 cellsbU937 cells were pretreated or not pretreated with MβCD as described under “Materials and Methods,” followed by UV-C light irradiationLymphoblastscNormal and Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A (cell line MS1418) Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoid cells–MβCD+MβCDNormalNPD type A142 ± 15dResults are expressed as the percentage of total cell surface fluorescence compared to untreated controls and the mean of three independent experiments ± S.D.90 ± 13ep < 0.02154 ± 18100 ± 11ep < 0.02a Cells were irradiated with UV-C light at 30 J"

Robust IFN production in cell culture requires positive feedback expression of inducible signaling components, such as the transcription factor IRF7. However, the role of positive feedback and IRF7 in vivo may be more complex. We found that IFN produced locally in the respiratory tract of influenza virus-infected mice displayed characteristics of positive feedback, including Stat1-dependent induction of IRF7 and IFN gene expression. IRF7 expression was similarly stimulus-dependent in most tissues. However, lymphoid tissue constitutively expressed high levels of IRF7 in the absence of induction or positive feedback, and this expression was largely confined to plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC). These cells rapidly produced large quantities of multiple IFNα species following viral infection without positive feedback, whereas other hematopoietic cells, including other DC subtypes, expressed little IRF7 and were poor IFN producers in the absence of positive feedback. These data reveal a dual mechanism for the regulation of IFN production by differential expression of IRF7, involving positive feedback at local sites of infection combined with robust systemic production by IRF7-expressing plasmacytoid DC.

These cytokines play important roles in the response to both local and systemic infections by signaling through the type I IFN receptor complex (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2). Type I IFN induces numerous genes known generally as IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) that encode proteins involved in innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses (reviewed in Ref. 1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The type I IFN receptor is associated with the Janus protein tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2 that target the STAT transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 for phosphorylation.Phosphorylation-dependent dimerization of STAT1 and STAT2 and interaction with the DNA-binding protein IRF9 lead to assembly of the transactivation complex ISGF3 responsible for induction of immediate-early target genes. Among the immediate-early class of IFN-stimulated genes is the transcription factor IRF7. IRF7 along with the related protein IRF3 controls the production of type IIFN in most infected cells following phosphorylation-dependent activation (reviewed in Ref. 2Levy D.E. Marie I. Prakash A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Current models for IFNα induction following viral infection invoke activation of cellular protein serine kinases by viral signals, leading to a kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of IRF3 (3Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Activated IRF3 is sufficient to induce expression of one subtype of IFNα (IFNα4 in mice, IFNA1 in human) and collaborates with activated AP1 and NFκB transcription factors to induce IFNβ. However, transcription of additional IFNα subtype genes requires IRF7, which must first be synthesized in response to this early limited IFN production, thus establishing a positive feedback loop (4Marié I.

The kinase complex implicated in both IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation consists of the enzymes TBK1 and IκB kinase ϵ (6Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J.

Like IRF7, IκB kinase ϵ, RIG-I, and MDA-5 are also IFN-inducible proteins, as are the ISGF3 components STAT1 and IRF9. Although ISGF3 is not directly involved in IFN gene transcription, it is required for the induction of all these IFN-responsive components of the positive feedback amplification loop (10Durbin J.E.

The importance of feedback and the role of IRF7 were investigated by Kalinke and colleagues (14Barchet W. Cella M. Odermatt B. Asselin-Paturel C. Colonna M. Kalinke U. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), who studied IFNα production by splenocytes following infection with vesicular stomatitis virus or UV-irradiated Herpes simplex virus. They observed that at early time points (<6 h post-infection), marginal zone splenocytes produced similar quantities of IFN irrespective of whether the mice expressed IFN receptors or not. Coupled with an inability to detect significant levels of IRF7 mRNA in uninfected splenocytes, they concluded that early IFN production in vivo did not require IFN feedback amplification and questioned the role of IRF7 in this process (14Barchet W. Cella M. Odermatt B. Asselin-Paturel C. Colonna M. Kalinke U. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, understanding induction of IFN in vivo and the requirement for positive feedback may be complicated by cell type-specific differences. For instance, a blood cell has been identified, known as the interferon-producing cell (15Diebold S.S. Montoya M. Unger H. Alexopoulou L. Roy P. Haswell L.E. Al-Shamkhani A. Flavell R. Borrow P.

Adding complexity to the issue, the exact cell type that makes type I IFN may depend on the nature of the infectious agent. Biron and colleagues (20Dalod M. Salazar-Mather T.P. Malmgaard L. Lewis C. Asselin-Paturel C. Briere F. Trinchieri G. Biron C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) showed that both murine cytomegalovirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections resulted in IFN production, but IFN induced by the former originated from splenic pDC, whereas IFN in response to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus came from a non-splenic non-pDC source. Moreover, further work suggested that the infected cell and the IFN-producing cell may not necessarily be the same (21Dalod M. Hamilton T. Salomon R. Salazar-Mather T.P. Henry S.C. Hamilton J.D. Biron C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Interestingly, non-replicating inducers (such as soluble toxoplasma antigen) provoked cytokine production from distinct subsets of DC when compared with infections with live replicating microbes (21Dalod M. Hamilton T. Salomon R. Salazar-Mather T.P. Henry S.C. Hamilton J.D. Biron C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In an attempt to resolve these divergent results, we have previously hypothesized that the route of infection may influence the responsive cell type (22Levy D.E. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: F15-F18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Systemic infections (e.g. intravenous) may lead to efficient activation of splenic pDC, whereas peripheral infections (e.g. respiratory) may only target localized responsive cell types. To further investigate this hypothesis, we have used in vivo and in vitro infection models and investigated the role of IRF7 induction and positive feedback in IFN production in response to negative-strand RNA viruses. We found that IFN production correlated with IRF7 production in infected lungs, which was drastically impaired in STAT1-deficient mice, consistent with a requirement for positive feedback. However, although most mouse tissues examined displayed induction-dependent production of IRF7, pDC in the spleen or differentiated in vitro expressed high levels of constitutive IRF7 protein and responded rapidly to virus infection by robust production of multiple IFNα species. Thus, our results pinpoint differential regulation of IRF7 expression as the underlying mechanism of positive IFN feedback regulation in peripheral tissues and as an important element of cell type-specific differences in IFN production. Mice—Mice deficient for STAT1 (stat1–/–) or for Rag1 (rag1–/–) and wild type controls on the same inbred background (BALB/c and C57BL6/J) were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions, in accordance with approved protocols at New York University School of Medicine. All mice were 8–12 weeks of age. In some experiments, IFN was induced in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg of poly(I-C) per mouse 1 day before collecting organs for protein extraction. Individual whole organ protein extracts were obtained by crushing tissue between frosted glass slides and lysing the resulting released cells in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Enrichment of Splenic Subsets Using Magnetic Beads—Isolated spleens were disrupted by digestion with Liberase CI (1 ml/spleen of 1.67 Wunsch units/ml; Roche Applied Science) and DNase I (0.2 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. Single cell suspensions were passed through a cell strainer (70 μm), and red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mm ammonium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12 mm sodium bicarbonate). Cell subtype enrichment involved anti-CD11c- and anti-CD11b-coupled magnetic beads and positive selection column MS+, according to the manufacturer's instructions (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec). Positive MACS bead selections typically yielded cells that were greater than 90% pure after one round of selection, as judged by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometric Analyses—Cell surface staining was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA unless otherwise stated. Cells were incubated with the following fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies: CD11b-fluorescein isothiocyanate, CD11c-phycoerythrin, and IgM-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde before analysis. Hematology—Splenic cell preparations or in vitro differentiated bone marrow (BM) were prepared by Cytospin centrifugation and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. Cell Isolation and Culture—BM cells were flushed from femurs and tibiae with RPMI 1640 medium with 25 mm Hepes. Red blood cells were lysed, and nucleated cells were plated in the appropriate medium. FLT3L-differentiated cells were plated at 106/ml (day 0) and expanded in RPMI 1640 containing 1% syngeneic normal mouse serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), HEPES (25 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (2 mm), and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin; Cellgro), and were grown for 8 days in 24-well plates in the presence of 25 ng/ml FLT3L (Peprotech) and 10 ng/ml stem cell factor (Peprotech) with 80% of the medium replenished on day 5. GM-CSF-differentiated DC cultures were generated essentially as described by Inaba et al. (23Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). In brief, BM cells were plated at 700,000 cells/ml (day 0) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, HEPES (25 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and antibiotics (penicillinstreptomycin; Cellgro) and supplemented with 40 ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech). On day 2, 70% of the medium was replenished. On day 3, non-adherent cells were removed, retaining the loosely adherent DC progenitor cells. The resulting differentiated and expanded cells were collected on day 5. Other cytokines used in some cultures were interleukin-3 (10 ng/ml; Peptrotech) and IFNα/β (500 units/ml; Access Biomedical). Virus Infections—Mice were infected with influenza A virus (WSN strain) by inhalation, as described previously (12Durbin J.E. Fernandez-Sesma A. Lee C.K. Rao T.D. Frey A.B. Moran T.M. Vukmanovic S. Garcia-Sastre A. Levy D.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4220-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In brief, 105 plaque-forming units in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were instilled intranasally into each anesthetized wild type or STAT1 mutant mouse, and lungs of infected mice were harvested 1–3 d later. RNA was isolated from disrupted lungs by the TRIzol method, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In vitro differentiated BM-derived cells (1 × 106) were cultured in 50 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm Hepes and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, either in the presence or in the absence of 50 μl (128 hemaglutination units/ml) of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). After 1 h at 37 °C, cells were plated in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 4–12 h, as indicated, and cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. For RNA analysis, 2 × 106 BM-derived cells were used for each infection, and medium, virus, and reagents were scaled up appropriately. Antibodies—Immunoblotting was performed using the following polyclonal antibodies: anti-IRF7, anti-IRF3, anti-IRF4, and anti-IRF8 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and monoclonal α-tubulin (Sigma). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted from at least 2 × 106 BM-derived cells using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using 3 μg of total RNA, and the resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR analysis, using gene-specific primer pairs in the presence of Sybr® Green dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Each target transcript was quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated by serial dilution of an abundant sample following normalization to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or ribosomal protein L32 mRNA. Sequences of real-time PCR primers are available upon request. Gene Transduction—STAT1-deficient fibroblasts were reconstituted with IRF7 by recombinant retroviral infection, which was performed using Phoenix cells, following the Nolan laboratory protocol. In brief, Phoenix cells, which are 293T cells stably expressing ecotropic packaging proteins, were transfected with retroviral constructs (green fluorescent protein or empty vector retroviruses as controls) in the presence of 25 μm chloroquine using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. 48 h later, supernatants were collected, spun, and used directly for infection of 3T3 cells preplated a day earlier at 1 × 105/6 wells in the presence of 40 μg/ml polybrene. Effective IFN Expression in Lungs following Infection Requires Intact IFN Signaling—An essential role for type I IFN in resolving respiratory infections and coordinating an appropriate T cell response has been documented previously (12Durbin J.E. Fernandez-Sesma A. Lee C.K. Rao T.D. Frey A.B. Moran T.M. Vukmanovic S. Garcia-Sastre A. Levy D.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4220-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Garcia-Sastre A. Durbin R.K. Zheng H. Palese P. Gertner R. Levy D.E. Durbin J.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8550-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, those studies revealed a role for IFN locally at the site of infection to orchestrate the inflammatory response as well as systemically to limit the spread of virus to peripheral tissues. In contrast to wild type animals, IFN-unresponsive mice (STAT1- or IFNAR-deficient) failed to contain influenza virus within the respiratory tract or establish an effective Th1-biased immune response. We investigated whether impaired IFN production at the site of infection due to the absence of positive feedback contributed to the phenotype of STAT1-deficient mice. Induction of IFN was compared in wild type and STAT1 mutant mice following intranasal influenza viral infection in vivo. Although IFN was readily detected in infected lungs from wild type mice, IFN production was markedly impaired in STAT1-null lungs when compared with the wild type lungs (Fig. 1A, black squares). Additionally, the mutant lungs failed to induce the accumulation of IRF7 message to levels equivalent to wild type controls (Fig. 1A, open triangles). Thus, the inability to support positive feedback in vivo via induction of IRF7 within the respiratory epithelium likely contributed to the failure of STAT1 mutant mice to mount an effective IFN response in response to respiratory infection. IRF7 Protein Is Inducible in Most Tissues but Constitutively Expressed in Spleen—IRF7 was initially identified as an IFN-inducible transcription factor in hematopoietic cells (24Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Given its induction in response to virus infection in lung, we examined its expression in multiple organs. To mimic systemic viral infection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with poly(I-C), a well characterized type I IFN inducer (25Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar), and 1 day after poly(I-C) injection, selected organs were examined for IRF protein expression. Abundance of IRF7 protein increased in response to poly(I-C) injection in most tissues (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, IRF7 protein was expressed at relatively high levels in thymus and spleen, even in the absence of poly(I-C) treatment. In contrast, IRF3 was expressed in all tissues examined, and its expression was not affected by IFN induction (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Similar results were obtained after infection of mice with negative-strand RNA viruses (data not shown). Thus, like lung, most peripheral tissues required induction to accumulate significant levels of IRF7 protein expression and would likely exhibit positive feedback-dependent production of IFN following viral infection. However, constitutive IRF7 accumulation in lymphoid organs indicated the possibility of a distinct type of response to infection in these tissues. IFN Feedback Does Not Account for IRF7 Protein Levels in the Spleen—A possible explanation for elevated constitutive levels of IRF7 in spleen and thymus could be the low levels of type I IFN observed in lymphoid organs even in the absence of viral infection (26Tovey M.G. Content J. Gresser I. Gugenheim J. Blanchard B. Guymarho J. Poupart P. Gigou M. Shaw A. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3106-3110PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hata N. Sato M. Takaoka A. Asagiri M.

Med. 1999; 190: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, IRF7 protein expression was quantified in multiple organs, including spleens and thymi of stat1–/– mice that are incapable of responding to IFN. Stat1–/– mice expressed levels of IRF7 in spleen and thymus comparable with wild type mice, whereas in other tissues, such as lung, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, IRF7 accumulation strictly required STAT1-dependent induction (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Therefore, IFN feedback does not appear to be required for abundant constitutive IRF7 protein expression in lymphoid organs. Mature T Cells and B Cells Are Not Required for Splenic IRF7 Expression—The mouse spleen is composed largely of B and T cells, together constituting ∼90% of splenic cellularity. To determine whether B and T cells were the origin of the abundant resting IRF7 levels observed in spleen, mice deficient for Rag1 protein and therefore lacking mature B and T cells were examined (Fig. 1D). Rag1–/– mouse spleen expressed equivalent levels of IRF7 protein when compared with wild type spleen, indicating that mature B and T cells were not the exclusive source for splenic IRF7 expression. IRF7 protein expression was also directly measured in lymphocytes. T and B cells from wild type spleens were purified by magnetic bead selection using anti-CD3 and anti-CD19 antibodies, respectively. Little IRF7 protein was detected in lymphocytes not treated with IFN (data not shown), suggesting that splenic IRF7 expression was localized to a non-T non-B splenocyte population. Kinetics of IFN Production and IRF7 Induction in Fibroblasts and Splenocytes—We examined how constitutive expression of IRF7 in lymphoid tissue impacted the kinetics of IFN production following virus infection. Comparing fibroblasts (inducible IRF7) with splenocytes (constitutive IRF7), we measured the rate of IFN induction and the role of positive feedback in response to infection. As shown in Fig. 2A, IRF7 mRNA was expressed at least 3 orders of magnitude higher in uninfected splenocytes (triangles) when compared with uninfected fibroblasts (squares). The presence or absence of STAT1 did not significantly affect constitutive IRF7 expression in spleen (compare open and closed symbols), confirming the lack of a role for constitutive IFN in maintaining high basal IRF7 expression in spleen. IRF7 levels were further induced following viral infection, but to a significant extent only in wild type cells, suggesting that positive feedback can further augment IRF7 production in response to autocrine IFN. As shown previously, IRF7 was also highly inducible in wild type fibroblasts, reaching levels equivalent to induced splenocytes but only at late times post-infection (p.i.). However, IRF7 induction in STAT1-deficient cells was significantly impaired. Expression of high levels of constitutive IRF7 protein in wild type splenocytes correlated with accelerated and enhanced induction of type I IFN following virus infection (Fig. 2, B and C). IFN levels produced by infected splenocytes at 4 h p.i. were comparable with those induced in infected wild type fibroblasts at 8–12 h p.i., subsequent to IRF7 induction. At 4 h p.i., IFN production by STAT1 mutant splenocytes was equivalent to that produced by wild type cells, which was consistent with their equivalent IRF7 levels. Greater IFN production was observed in wild type splenocytes at later time points, reflecting the induction of IRF7 (Fig. 2A), presumably in response to autocrine IFN. Little IFN was produced by STAT1-deficient fibroblasts, the IRF7 levels of which started out and remained low throughout the course of the infection. Expression of IFNα subtypes other than IFNα4 is completely dependent on the presence of IRF7 and therefore on IFN sensitivity, at least in fibroblasts (4Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar correlation with the presence of IRF7 was observed in splenocytes (Fig. 2C). The non-α4 IFN subset was induced in both wild type and STAT1-deficient splenocytes that expressed IRF7. Equal levels of IFN induction were observed at 4 h, although wild type cells expressed higher levels at later time points, subsequent to further induction of IRF7. Thus, expression of IFNα was dependent on IRF7 in both fibroblasts and splenocytes; however, the higher initial set point of IRF7 abundance in splenocytes allowed robust IFN production prior to feedback induction of IRF7 following autocrine IFN stimulation. A DC Subset Is the Source of Abundant IRF7 in Splenocytes—To identify the cell type that accounted for high levels of IRF7 expression in spleen, individual non-B and non-T splenic cell populations were isolated and assayed for IRF7 expression. Splenic CD11c+ DC expressed relatively high levels of IRF7 protein, as well as moderately elevated levels of IRF8 (Fig. 3A, left panel). In contrast, other IRF proteins, such as IRF3, were expressed equally by both CD11c+ and CD11c– cell populations. To further characterize the IRF7-expressing splenocyte population, subset enrichment was carried out by sequential positive selection. CD11b+ cells were first selected to isolate CD11b+CD11c+ DC along with CD11b+ splenic macrophages. Subsequently, CD11c+ cells were selected from the CD11b– population, to isolate the CD11b–CD11c+ DC subset. The remaining double negative cells after CD11c isolation were also examined. FACS staining confirmed the effectiveness of the selections through the expression of CD11b and CD11c markers on the appropriate cell populations (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A (right panel), CD11b–CD11c+ DC expressed greater levels of IRF7 protein when compared with CD11b+ or double negative cell populations. Again, IRF8 was also enriched in CD11b–CD11c+ cells, whereas other IRF proteins were expressed at similar levels in all subsets. Thus, IRF7 is expressed at highest levels in CD11b–CD11c+ cells, suggesting that it is highly expressed in a DC subset. FLT3L-differentiated Bone Marrow Generates IRF7-expressing DC—Dendritic cells can be broadly divided into distinct subtypes, including myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC).

Deletion of the yeast frataxin homolog (YFH1) was combined with deletions of MRS3 and MRS4, mitochondrial carrier proteins implicated in iron homeostasis. As previously reported, the Δyfh1 mutant accumulated iron in mitochondria, whereas the triple mutant (ΔΔΔ) did not. When wild-type, Δmrs3/4, Δyfh1, and ΔΔΔ strains were incubated anaerobically, all strains were devoid of heme and protected from iron and oxygen toxicity. The cultures were then shifted to air for a short time (4–5 h) or a longer time (15 h), and the evolving mutant phenotypes were analyzed (heme-dependent growth, total heme, cytochromes, heme proteins, and iron levels). A picture emerges from these data of defective heme formation in the mutants, with a markedly more severe defect in the ΔΔΔ than in the individual Δmrs3/4 or Δyfh1 mutants (a “synthetic” defect in the genetic sense). The defect(s) in heme formation could be traced to lack of iron. Using a real time assay of heme biosynthesis, porphyrin precursor and iron were presented to permeabilized cells, and the appearance and disappearance of fluorescent porphyrins were followed. The Mrs3/4p carriers were required for rapid iron transport into mitochondria for heme synthesis, whereas there was also evidence for an alternative slower system. A different role for Yfh1p was observed under conditions of low mitochondrial iron and aerobic growth (revealed in the ΔΔΔ), acting to protect bioavailable iron within mitochondria and to facilitate its use for heme synthesis.

Consistent with a role in heme synthesis, a high affinity interaction of frataxin and ferrochelatase has been described (4Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10He Y.A. Proteasa S.V. Zhang Y. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. Stemmler T.L.

Mrs3p and Mrs4p are homologous proteins located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. These proteins belong to the mitochondrial carrier family and have been implicated in iron metabolism (23Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Some data suggest that these carriers are able to transport iron into mitochondria (24Muhlenhoff U. Stadler J.A. Richhardt N. Seubert A. Eickhorst T. Schweyen R.J. Lill R. Wiesenberger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40612-40620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), although the mutant phenotypes resulting from deletions of both genes (Δmrs3/4) are mild. Complex regulatory changes occurring in the Δmrs3/4 mutant strains make it difficult to ascertain which effects are primary and which are secondary (25Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33653-33661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Knockouts of the major mitochondrial carriers involved in delivery of iron for heme synthesis would be expected to cause heme deficiency, yet this has not been observed in the Δmrs3/4 mutant. Cytochrome levels are often good indicators of heme synthesis, and these are low or abnormal in mutants involved in heme biosynthesis (26Labbe-Bois R. Camadro J.M. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 413-454Google Scholar). Cytochromes in the Δmrs3/4 mutant were reportedly normal (23Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel genetic and biochemical interaction implicating frataxin and Mrs3/4p in heme synthesis. In some cases, the various yeast strains were grown in the absence of oxygen and shifted to air, thereby providing a uniform starting point for experiments without heme and without iron toxicity. The roles of the Mrs3/4p carriers and frataxin in iron handling for heme synthesis could then be distinguished by biochemical assays. By using these types of experiments, the Mrs3/4p carriers were implicated in iron delivery into mitochondria, whereas Yfh1p was implicated in making iron bioavailable within mitochondria. Strains and Genotypes—53–76 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 cyh2) was derived from strain YPH500 by growth in the presence of cycloheximide and selection for resistant clones. Similarly, 53–75, referred to here as “wild type” (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 cyh2), was derived from YPH499 by a similar procedure. 85–74, referred to here as Δmrs3/4 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 cyh2 Δmrs4::KAN Δmrs3::URA3), was made by introducing deletions for MRS4 (using a G418 cassette) and MRS3 (using URA3) into strain 53–75 (27Petracek M.E. Longtine M.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Correctness of the genomic insertions was verified by PCR. 59–32, called the Δyfh1 shuffle strain (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 cyh2 Δyfh1::TRP1 [pRS318-LEU2-CYH2-YFH1]) was constructed from 53–75 as described. In this strain, the Δyfh1 mutation is covered by the CEN and CYH2-containing plasmid pRS318 with the YFH1 HindIII genomic fragment (28Gordon D.M. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Dancis A. Pain D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The plasmid was removed by counterselection on medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, which is toxic in the presence of the CYH2 allele. The mutant following removal of the covering plasmid was called simply Δyfh1. 82–43 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801(amber) ade2–101(ochre) his3-Δ200 cyh2 Δyfh1::TRP1 Δmrs4::KAN Δmrs3::URA3 [pRS318-YFH1-LEU2]) was a shuffle strain derived from 59–32 in which deletions for MRS4 (using a G418 cassette) and MRS3 (using URA3) have been introduced. The pRS318 plasmid was removed by treatment with cycloheximide, and the mutant was referred to as ΔΔΔ or Δmrs3/4/Δyfh1. Genetic Procedures—Crosses were performed by patching strains of opposite mating types and picking zygotes with a micromanipulator after 4 h. Crossing of the shuffle strains with the 53–76 parental strain was performed in this manner, and the YFH1 plasmid was removed from the diploid by counterselection on cycloheximide before sporulation. Experiments with Δyfh1 or ΔΔΔ mutants were initiated with the shuffle strains, and the covering plasmid was removed by counterselection. Complete removal of the covering plasmid was verified for each experiment by testing for leucine auxotrophy, since the YFH1-bearing pRS318 plasmid also carried a LEU2 marker gene. For most experiments, counterselection was performed anaerobically by streaking shuffle strains on agar plates consisting of YPAD with 0.2% Tween 80, 40 μg/ml ergosterol, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide in an anaerobic chamber. Media Composition—Rich YPAD medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% d-glucose, and 0.01% adenine. YPAR contained 2% raffinose instead of glucose. Defined medium contained 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, 0.8 g/liter amino acid supplements, and 1.5% Difco agar as a solidifying agent for agar plates. Iron-buffered plates consisted of modified defined medium to which pH buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.1) and iron chelator (1 mm ferrozine) were added. Different amounts of ferrous iron (0, 20, 50, and 350 μm) were added back to establish windows of available free iron as described (29Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the following additions were included: 0.2% Tween 80, 40 μg/ml ergosterol, 40 μg/ml methionine, and 20 or 50 μm hemin. Hemin stocks were made by dissolving powder in a small amount of 1 m KOH and diluting into a larger volume of buffer (0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and then adjusting the volume and pH to 7.8 with concentrated HCl to give a final concentration of 10 mm. For anaerobic growth, agar plates were placed in an anaerobic chamber with a BBL GasPak (BD Biosciences). For anaerobic growth of liquid cultures, argon gas (Airgas) was bubbled through the medium in sealed glass flasks. Cells were grown at 30 °C as stationary cultures (anaerobic) or with circular agitation (aerobic). Ferric Reductase—The assay was performed as described (30Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Courel M. Santos R. Camadro J.-M. Dancis A. Genetics. 2005; 169: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Iron Levels—Samples of permeabilized cells (800 μg of equivalent protein) or mitochondria (80 μg of equivalent protein) were placed in microcentrifuge tubes. Following treatment with iron-free nitric acid, these were subjected to metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (laboratory of Dr. Robert Poppenga, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center, Kennett Square, PA). Catalase—Potassium phosphate buffer (1 ml, 30 mm, pH 7.0) was added to a quartz cuvette. H2O2 (10 μl, 1.3 m) was then added to give a 13 mm final concentration. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of lysate from 30 × 106 cells, and absorbance at 240 nm was measured for 2 min. The rate of decrease, reflecting catalase activity, was converted to activity by the extinction coefficient 4.36 × 104 cm2/mol (31Roggenkamp R. Sahm H. Wagner F. FEBS Lett. 1974; 41: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Aconitase—Activity was measured in permeabilized cells (10 μl) in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm isocitrate) with or without 0.6 m sorbitol. The assay follows conversion of isocitrate to cis-aconitate over time measured by absorbance at 240 nm (32Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferrochelatase Activity in Mitochondrial Lysate (from Added Iron)— Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX 1The abbreviations used are: PPIX, protoporphyrin IX; PPO, protoporphyrinogen; MES, α-[N-morphilino]ethanesulfonic acid. ; 200 ng) was added to mitochondrial lysates (prepared in air) in 2 ml of assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 80). The lysate was rendered anaerobic by bubbling with argon for 5 min in a cuvette with a rubber septum. A base-line fluorescence tracing was obtained with excitation at 410 nm and emission at 632 nm. The assay was initiated by injection of 10 μm ferrous iron (final concentration) from a 200 μm stock of ferrous ammonium sulfate in an anaerobic stoppered vial. A time trace was collected, and the initial decrease in slope of the PPIX fluorescence represented the ferrochelatase activity in the lysate (33Camadro J.-M. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11675-11682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shi Z. Ferreira G.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cell Permeabilization—Cells were grown anaerobically in sealed flasks containing YPAD supplemented with 0.2% Tween 80 and 20 μg/ml ergosterol bubbled with argon. After 48 h, the cultures were washed in water and resuspended in an equal volume of YPAR at an A600 of about 1. Cultures were grown in air for an additional 4 h at 30 °C with shaking and then harvested. After washing with water, cells were treated with 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.4, SO42−, 100 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were formed by digestion with zymolyase (1 mg/g, wet weight; Seikagaku) in 10 ml of spheroplasting buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation (1,500 × g), washed with buffer at room temperature, and allowed to metabolically recover in 20 ml of recovery solution (0.35 volumes of 2 m sorbitol per 0.75 volumes of YPAD medium) by incubating at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 20 min. Recovered spheroplasts were then pelleted by centrifugation (1,500 × g) at room temperature and gently resuspended in permeabilization buffer (20 mm Hepes KOH, pH 6.8, 400 mm sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm manganese acetate). The spheroplast suspensions were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes and suspended over liquid nitrogen vapors to allow slow freezing (35Achleitner G. Zweytick D. Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Daum G.

Biochem. 2001; 293: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Heme Synthesis in Permeabilized Cells (from Endogenous Iron)—An aliquot of permeabilized cells (100 μl of 0.5 g/ml, wet weight) was thawed and very gently added to assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m sorbitol in a water-jacketed fluorescence cuvette at 30 °C. Protoporphyrinogen, a nonfluorescent heme precursor (37Camadro J.-M. Chambon H. Jolles J. Labbe P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was added at 50 or 250 nm final concentration. Time traces were collected to monitor the appearance of PPIX (excitation 410 nm, emission 632 nm) and the appearance of zinc protoporphyrin (excitation 410 nm, emission 587 nm). Heme Synthesis in Permeabilized Cells (from Exogenous Iron)—Ferrous ammonium sulfate (10 μm) was prepared by dissolving in water and bubbling with argon in a septum-sealed vial. Iron was removed with a syringe and injected into the assay cuvette to give a final concentration of 10 μm. NADH (5 mm final concentration) was added at the same time as the iron and preincubated with the permeabilized cells for 2 min at 30 °C before each assay. Time traces (180 s) at 632 nm or repeated emission scans from 550 to 650 nm (each requiring 100 s) were collected. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity was measured fluorimetrically (38Camadro J.-M. Thome R. Brouillet N. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32085-32091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by treating the permeabilized cells with the iron and zinc chelator bipyridyl (10 mm added from a 1 m stock in ethanol) and dithiothreitol (5 mm) prior to the addition of the protoporphyrinogen. Heme Synthesis in Permeabilized Cells Measured by Radiolabeling with 55Fe—An aliquot of permeabilized cells (100 μl) was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge tube at 1500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, 0.6 m sorbitol, pH 7.5), and the volume was adjusted to 83 μl. NADH (5 mm) and ferrous ascorbate (10 μm) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. Protoporphyrinogen (0.5 nmol) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for an additional 3 min. The reaction was stopped by immersing the tube in ice water, and then 300 μl of HCl (0.2 m) was added. The tube was vortexed for 30 s. Methyl ethyl ketone (500 μl) was added, and the tube was vortexed for 30 s. The sample was centrifuged (20,000 × g) for 5 min, and 200 μl of the supernatant fraction was removed and subjected to scintillation counting. Other Procedures—Low temperature spectra (-191 °C) of cell extracts were obtained as described previously (39Labbe P. Chaix P. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. (Paris). 1969; 51: 1642-1644PubMed Google Scholar), with an optical path length of 1 mm with one sheet of wet filter paper in the reference path. Total heme content of the cells was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method (40Porra R.J. Jones O.T. Biochemistry. 1963; 87: 181-185Google Scholar). Cell fractionation was performed by subjecting the permeabilized cells to Dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation in order to obtain mitochondrial fractions as described (41Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Whole cell or mitochondrial lysates were obtained by exposing the permeabilized cells or mitochondria to lysis buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 80, followed by gentle bath sonication. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Synthetic Slow Growth Phenotype from Combining Δmrs3, Δmrs4, and Δyfh1—The pleiotropic Δyfh1 phenotype, characterized by accumulations of toxic iron in mitochondria and deficiencies of iron proteins, has been difficult to tease apart in terms of cause and effect. Deletions of MRS3 and MRS4 in the Δyfh1 context (ΔΔΔ) have been reported to revert the mitochondrial iron accumulation phenotype (23Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, in this mutant strain, deficiencies resulting from toxic mitochondrial iron overload should be ameliorated, whereas, by contrast, phenotypes resulting from interruption of iron trafficking or iron utilization should be exacerbated. A haploid parental strain was transformed with constructs to delete MRS4 and then to delete MRS3. The single and double mutants grew normally in the rich or defined medium used for selection of the knock-out transformants, and secondary genetic changes were not observed. By contrast, the Δyfh1 strain was slow growing and genetically unstable in air. More rapidly growing suppressor mutations appeared with high frequency, and in many of the suppressor mutants, a severe global heme deficiency, associated with the Δyfh1 mutation, was reverted (4Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In a previous report describing the triple mutant (Δmrs3/4/Δyfh1; ΔΔΔ), a Δyfh1 strain with normal cytochromes was used as the starting point, and therefore phenotypes of this strain or its derivatives due to heme deficiency may have been obscured by the presence of suppressor mutations (23Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To minimize such problems from suppressors, shuffle strains were created in which the Δyfh1 deletion was “covered” by a plasmid carrying a wild-type YFH1 genomic allele. Three crosses were performed between the parental strain and the Δyfh1 shuffle, the Δmrs3/4 mutant, or the ΔΔΔ shuffle strain, respectively. The covering YFH1 plasmids were removed from the diploid shuffle strains by counterselection with cycloheximide, exposing the Δyfh1 allele. The diploids, which appeared uniform in their growth properties, were then sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. Tetrad clones were photographed after 5 days, and genotypes were determined by PCR with appropriate primers. The backcross of Δyfh1 yielded two larger wild-type and two smaller Δyfh1 tetrad colonies (Fig. 1A). The backcross of the Δmrs3/4 strain yielded tetrads of all expected genotypic combinations (MRS3 and MRS4 are unlinked), and colony sizes were indistinguishable from wild-type in all cases (Fig. 1B). In the cross involving Δmrs3/4 and Δyfh1, tiny colonies were observed (Fig. 1C). In all cases, these were confirmed to carry three mutations: Δmrs3, Δmrs4, and Δyfh1. Congenic strains were grown in 96-well plates containing rich YPAD medium, and growth was followed by frequent turbidity measurements using a plate reader. Wild type was indistinguishable from Δmrs3/4 (short lag phase and 2-h doubling time in logarithmic phase). The Δyfh1 strain grew more slowly (much longer lag time and 5-h doubling time in logarithmic phase). The ΔΔΔ strain was the most severely impaired (longest lag phase and 8-h doubling time in logarithmic phase) (Fig. 2A). The small colony size of the triple mutant tetrad clone was thus not due to delayed germination but rather to genuine slow growth. In the final hours of the experiment (hours 30–40), growth of the triple mutant appeared to accelerate (Fig. 2A), perhaps due to outgrowth of suppressor mutant clones. These suppressors of the ΔΔΔ slow growth were also apparent as larger colonies surrounded by pinpoints in serial dilutions of the triple mutant grown on solid agar plates (Fig. 2B, ΔΔΔ). Effects of Oxygen Exposure, Heme, and Iron Availability on the Mutant Growth Phenotypes—A variety of growth conditions were tested to further characterize the cause of the severe slow growth of the ΔΔΔ mutant. Interestingly, all strains, including the triple mutant, grew at similar rates and formed similar sized colonies when grown anaerobically in rich YPAD medium with Tween 80 and ergosterol (Fig. 3A). The explanation for this observation is unknown at this time, but it could be due to less iron toxicity, different iron requirements of anaerobically grown cells, or activation of alternative and functionally redundant iron utilization systems under anaerobiosis. In any case, this surprising observation was useful, because it enabled us to initiate experiments with healthy, uniformly grown cells of different genotypes. Wild-type, Δmrs3/4, Δyfh1, and ΔΔΔ strains were grown anaerobically for 48 h in liquid medium allowing uniform growth, and serial dilutions were then inoculated on rich medium agar anaerobically (Fig. 3A) or defined medium agar plates in air (Fig. 3, B–F). After 3 days, photographs were taken. After switching to aerobic conditions, the wild type grew best, followed by Δmrs3/4, Δyfh1, and ΔΔΔ, respectively. The red color of the wild-type strain is due to accumulation of adenine precursor, which occurs as a consequence of the ade2–101 mutation. The decreased pigmentation apparent in the Δyfh1 and ΔΔΔ spots may be due to slower growth and/or decreased respiratory activity in these strains (42Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W.

https://openalex.org/W2068627962,"In contrast to caspase-8, controversy exists as to the ability of caspase-10 to mediate apoptosis in response to FasL. Herein, we have shown activation of caspase-10, -3, and -7 as well as B cell lymphoma-2-interacting domain (Bid) cleavage and cytochrome c release in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat (I9-2) cells treated with FasL. Apoptosis was clearly induced as illustrated by nuclear and DNA fragmentation. These events were inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, indicating that caspases were functionally and actively involved. Benzyloxycarbonyl-AEVD-fluoromethyl ketone, a caspase-10 inhibitor, had a comparable effect. FasL-induced cell death was not completely abolished by caspase inhibitors in agreement with the existence of a cytotoxic caspase-independent pathway. In subpopulations of I9-2 cells displaying distinct caspase-10 expression levels, cell sensitivity to FasL correlated with caspase-10 expression. A robust caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and DNA fragmentation were observed in cells with high caspase-10 levels but not in those with low levels. In vitro, caspase-10, as well as caspase-8, could cleave Bid to generate active truncated Bid (p15). Altogether, our data strongly suggest that caspase-10 can serve as an initiator caspase in Fas signaling leading to Bid processing, caspase cascade activation, and apoptosis.

Cell death is an essential process in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of the mechanisms involved can lead to human diseases such as cancers, autoimmune diseases (in the case of death defect), and neurodegenerative and immune deficiency diseases (in the case of death excess) (reviewed in Refs. 1Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 2Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 699-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two types of cell death have been clearly distinguished, apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis (3Wyllie A. Nature. 1998; 391: 20-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be characterized by typical sets of changes including plasma membrane blebbing, cellular and chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation are biochemical features of apoptosis. Most of these processes are mediated by caspases that cleave and inactivate proteins essential for cell survival (for review, see Ref. 4Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is an “accidental” cell death characterized by profound plasma membrane alterations and oncosis. Intermediate forms of programmed cell death, namely apoptosis- and necrosis-like cell death, have been recently described (for review, see Ref. 5Jaattela M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Programmed cell death is essential for elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and down-regulation of the immune response. Stimulation of Fas receptor (CD95) by FasL (CD95L or CD178) plays a crucial role in inducing lymphocyte programmed cell death. Fas cross-linking triggers activation of both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways (6Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J.

Caspase-independent cell death requires receptor-interacting protein (RIP) as an effector molecule, but cytotoxic signaling pathways activated by RIP remain largely unknown (6Holler N. Zaru R.

Once activated, effector caspases specifically cleave and inactivate proteins leading to apoptosis. In addition, caspase-8 cleaves Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the B cell lymphoma-2 superfamily (16Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

The terminal part of Bid containing a B cell lymphoma-2 homology (BH) 3 domain, namely truncated Bid, translocates to mitochondria and promotes cytochrome c release into the cytosol (16Li H. Zhu H.

In association with APAF-1 and pro-caspase-9, another initiator caspase, cytochrome c forms the apoptosome complex leading to the activation of caspase-9 that cleaves and activates effector caspases (18Li P.

In analogy with caspase-8, caspase-10 has two DEDs (death effector domains) and the QACQG sequence containing the catalytic cysteine residue (4Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10301-10308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast to caspase-10c, caspase-10a, -10b, and -10d have large and small catalytic subunits. Strong homology between caspase-8 and -10 might suggest that both enzymes share similar substrate specificity and biological function. However, in contrast to caspase-10, caspase-8 can cleave receptor-interacting protein in FasL-treated Jurkat cells (20Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M. Lenardo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13884-13888Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Jurkat T lymphoma cells contain caspase-8 and -10, and caspase-8 has been shown to be essential for apoptosis induction in response to Fas stimulation (21Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pathway involving cytochrome c release was reported to be critical for caspase cascade activation in Jurkat cells, classified as type II cells (22Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). More recently, Ashkenazi and co-workers (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) reported that endogenous caspase-10 could be recruited to and activated at the DISC level in FasL-treated Jurkat cells. Similar findings were described in activated PBL upon Fas ligation (20Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M. Lenardo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13884-13888Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the role of caspase-10 in Fas signaling remains controversial. Overexpression of caspase-10 complemented caspase-8 deficiency in FasL-treated Jurkat cells in two independent studies (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M. Lenardo M.J. Proc.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4520-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, there is no direct evidence in the literature that caspase-10 is able to cleave Bid and trigger cytochrome c release. Herein, we have shown that FasL can induce apoptosis of caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells, which was associated to endogenous caspase-10, -3, and -7 activation, as well as Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release. Cell sensitivity to FasL correlated with caspase-10 expression in caspase-8-deficient cells. A caspase-10 inhibitor prevented Bid processing, caspase cascade activation, and apoptosis. In addition, evidence is provided for the first time that Bid is a direct substrate of caspase-10, strongly indicating that, like caspase-8, caspase-10 can lead to activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Reagents—Final concentrations or dilutions used of the following reagents are indicated: Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (40 μm) and Z-AE(OMe)-VD(OMe)-fmk (10 μm) were purchased from Bachem (Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, France) and RD systems (Lille, France), respectively; monoclonal anti-FADD (clone A66-2; 0.5 μg/ml), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12; 1 μg/ml), and anti-caspase-8 (clone B9-2; 0.5 μg/ml) antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences; polyclonal anticaspase-8 (1/5 dilution) was a kind gift from Dr. G. Cohen (Leicester, UK); monoclonal anti-caspase-10 (clone 4C1; 1 μg/ml) was purchased from MBL (Meudon, France); polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (10 μg/ml) was obtained from Dako; polyclonal anti-caspase-7, anti-PARP, and anti-Bid antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used at 1/1000 dilution; monoclonal anti-β-actin (clone AC-15; 5 μg/ml) was obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-CD95 (clone 7C11; 1/5 dilution) and IgM irrelevant antibody (10 μg/ml) coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France) and Santa Cruz, respectively. Human recombinant FasL was obtained from Abcys (Paris, France). Alternatively, mouse FasL produced in the supernatant of Neuro-2A cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding FasL was used (24Shimizu M. Fontana A. Takeda Y. Yagita H. Yoshimoto T. Matsuzawa A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7350-7357PubMed Google Scholar). Similar data were obtained with mouse and human FasL. Human recombinant caspase-8 (6000 units/mg) and -10 (8000 units/mg) were purchased from Abcys. Cell Lines—Parental Jurkat T lymphoma cells (clone A3) and derived cell lines deficient for FADD (clone I2-1) or caspase-8 (clone I9-2) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Blenis (Boston, MA). Cells were cultured in RPMI containing Glutamax and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. In limiting dilution experiments, I9-2 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in 96-well plates. From serial dilutions, five cell cultures were isolated and named I9-2a, I9-2b, I9-2c, I9-2d, and I9-2e. Flow Cytometry Analyses—CD95 cell surface expression was determined after incubation of cells for 30 min at 4 °C with or without anti-CD95-PE or an irrelevant antibody coupled to PE. To allow study of phosphatidylserine externalization, cells were labeled with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (250 ng/ml) and propidium iodide (12.5 μg/ml) (Immunotech) for 10 min at 4 °C. To allow study of hypodiploidy, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in ethanol (70%) for 10 min at -20 °C. Cells were next incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase (1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml). Percentage of hypodiploid cells carrying DNA content below cells in G0/G1 was quantified by flow cytometry. Analyses were performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Morphological Analyses—Cells were co-incubated with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) (Sigma) and Syto 13 (2.5 μm) (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed under a Leica fluorescence-equipped microscope (25Segui B. Andrieu-Abadie N. Adam-Klages S. Meilhac O. Kreder D. Garcia V. Bruno A.P. Jaffrezou J.P. Salvayre R. Kronke M. Levade T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37251-37258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At least 300 cells were examined. MTT Assay—Viability was evaluated by the tetrazolium-based MTT assay. Cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates (106 cells/ml, 100 μl/well) for 16 h at 37 °C. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added during 4 h. Formazan crystals were solubilized overnight at 37 °C by adding 100 μl of solubilization buffer (HCl 0.01 N, 10% SDS) and spectrophotometrically quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (λ = 590 nm). Cell-free System Assay—Mitochondria-free cytosolic protein extracts (250 μg) from A3 or I9-2 cells were incubated in the presence of one unit (as defined by the manufacturer) of recombinant caspase-8 or -10 for different times up to 90 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. At the indicated times, reaction was stopped by freezing on dry ice. 20 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Alternatively, 1 μg of His-tagged mouse recombinant Bid (26Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) was incubated in the presence of one unit of recombinant caspase at 37 °C in a final volume of 60 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. At the indicated times, 100 ng of protein were immediately frozen on dry ice and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-His antibody (clone sc8036, Santa Cruz). Alternatively, extracts were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Of note, mouse and human Bid proteins share 63.5% identity and the LQTD ↓ G caspase cleavage motif (16Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Western Blotting Analyses—For total protein extraction, 5-20 × 106 of cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and protein content determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Cytosolic protein extracts were prepared from 20 × 106 of cells as described previously (27Cuvillier O. Edsall L. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15691-15700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, equal amount of proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. FasL Can Trigger Apoptosis in Caspase-8-deficient Jurkat Cells—Caspase-8 has previously been reported to be essential in anti-Fas-induced Jurkat apoptosis (21Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, two different groups have recently shown that caspase-8-independent cell death occurs in response to high FasL concentration (6Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 7Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both studies reached the conclusion that this caspase-8-independent cell death is a form of necrosis rather than apoptosis. Herein, we have re-examined caspase-8-independent cell death in Jurkat cells. First, we compared the sensitivity to FasL of parental (clone A3), caspase-8-deficient (clone I9-2), and FADD-deficient (clone I2-1) Jurkat cell lines (21Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-8 and FADD expression was analyzed by Western blotting to confirm respective protein deficiency in I9-2 and I2-1 clones (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the various cell lines exhibited similar Fas expression on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). When incubated at a low FasL concentration (15 ng/ml), apoptotic features were seen only in A3 cells in agreement with previous reports (21Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 797-804PubMed Google Scholar). When a higher FasL concentration (500 ng/ml) was used, caspase-8-deficient cells displayed an apoptotic phenotype with pronounced cellular condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that 54.4 ± 4.4% and 11.5 ± 3.6% (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments) of caspase-8-deficient cells were scored Annexin-V-positive when incubated in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml FasL, respectively. FADD-deficient cells completely resisted FasL-induced apoptosis at all doses tested (up to 500 ng/ml) (Fig. 1C). FasL Induces Caspase-dependent and Caspase-independent Cell Death in Caspase-8-deficient Jurkat Cells—DNA fragmentation in caspase-8-deficient cells was next assessed by measuring hypodiploidy. Although 15 ng/ml FasL did not induce hypodiploidy in these cells, 14.4 ± 1.6% (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments) of them displayed DNA fragmentation in response to 500 ng/ml FasL (Fig. 2A). This process was completely abolished by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, indicating involvement of caspases in DNA fragmentation. In accordance with a previous study (6Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), cell death was not fully impaired by Z-VAD-fmk in caspase-8-deficient cells even though caspase activation was completely inhibited (Fig. 3B and data not shown). As a matter of fact, 45.9 ± 3.4% (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments) of cells were still Annexin-V-positive in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk and FasL (Fig. 2B). The cell size was reduced as evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C) and microscopic examination (Fig. 2D). It is of interest that Z-VAD-fmk abrogated nuclear fragmentation, but not nuclear condensation and membrane alterations, as illustrated by propidium iodide uptake (Fig. 2D). Thus, Z-VAD-fmk weakly affected FasL-induced cytotoxicity, but the latter was shifted into cell death without nuclear fragmentation.Fig. 3FasL induces caspase activation and Bid processing in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. A, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence or absence of the indicated FasL concentration. B, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml FasL and 40 μm Z-VAD-fmk as indicated. A and B, cells were then harvested, and 50 μg of total protein extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-caspase-10, -7, -3, anti-Bid, anti-PARP, or anti-β-actin antibodies. Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FasL Promotes Bid Cleavage, Cytochrome c Release, and Caspase Activation in Caspase-8-deficient Jurkat Cells— Caspase activation in I9-2 cells was next analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Cleavage of caspase-3, -7, and PARP was observed in I9-2 cells incubated for 16 h with FasL at concentrations higher than 60 ng/ml (Fig. 3A). Because caspase-10 can be recruited to and activated at the DISC in Jurkat cells (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H. Virmani A. Schow P. Gazdar A. Blenis J. Arnott D. Ashkenazi A. J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4520-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we examined caspase-10 expression using a specific anti-caspase-10 antibody (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Tinel A. LeBlanc H.

The level of pro-caspase-10 clearly decreased in I9-2 cells incubated with FasL, in a dosedependent manner. Interestingly, Bid content also decreased in I9-2 cells treated with 500 ng/ml FasL. The disappearance of caspase-10 and Bid in I9-2 cells treated with FasL was completely abolished in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, strongly suggesting a caspase-dependent proteolytic processing of both proteins (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined the effect of Z-AEVD-fmk, a caspase-10 inhibitor (29Park S.J. Wu C.H. Gordon J.D. Zhong X. Emami A. Safa A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51057-51067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Z-AEVD-fmk (10 μm) inhibited the processing of caspase-10, Bid, and PARP (Fig. 4A) as well as caspase-3 activation (data not shown) and hypodiploidy at 16 h (Fig. 4B). A time course experiment of I9-2 cells incubated with 500 ng/ml indicated that caspase-10 and -7 and PARP were cleaved at as early as 4 h of treatment with FasL (Fig. 5). As a consequence, apoptosis as evaluated by the quantification of hypodiploid cells increased to reach a maximum at 8 h. Cytochrome c efflux was also observed but only at late time points (8 and 16 h). This phenomenon might indicate that early caspase activation did not require cytochrome c release. Alternatively, our assay might not be sensitive enough to detect low amounts of cytochrome c released at early time points. Together, our data strongly support the notion that FasL can promote caspase activation, Bid processing, and cytochrome c release even in the absence of caspase-8 and that caspase-10 is likely involved in these events.Fig. 5FasL induces cytochrome c release in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. Caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml FasL for the indicated times. Cells were harvested, and 20 μg of cytosolic protein extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-caspase-10, -7, anti-cytochrome c, anti-PARP, or anti-β-actin antibodies. Percentages of hypodiploid cells were determined by flow cytometry. Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sensitivity to FasL Correlates with Caspase-10 Concentration in I9-2 Cells—All the above-mentioned experiments indicated that only about half of I9-2 cells were sensitive to FasL. We hypothesized that I9-2 cells were heterogeneous and contained a mixture of both sensitive and non-sensitive cells. In limiting dilution experiments, different subpopulations of I9-2 cells (I9-2a, I9-2b, I9-2c, I9-2d, I9-2e) were isolated. The various cell lines displayed distinct sensitivity to FasL (Fig. 6A) and exhibited low (I9-2a and I9-2e), intermediate (I9-2b and I9-2c), and high (I9-2d) caspase-10 levels but comparable caspase-3 and -7, FADD (Fig. 6B), and CD95 expression (Fig. 6C). Of note, caspase-10 expression in I9-2 parental cells was similar to that of I9-2b and I9-2c cells (data not shown). Interestingly, although all the subpopulations died similarly in response to staurosporine (data not shown), their sensitivity to FasL correlated with caspase-10 content. Indeed, although I9-2a and I9-2e cells strongly resisted FasL-induced toxicity, I9-2d cells were highly sensitive and I9-2b and I9-2c cells displayed an intermediate response. By comparison, A3 cells that expressed not only caspase-10 but also caspase-8 similarly to I9-2d cells were more sensitive to FasL than I9-2d cells (Fig. 6A). Z-VAD-fmk efficiently impaired FasL-induced toxicity in I9-2d cells, but not in I9-2e cells, suggesting a stronger caspase activation in the high caspase-10-expressing cells (data not shown). Accordingly, caspase-3 (data not shown) and PARP cleavage occurred in I9-2d and, to a lesser extent, in I9-2b and I9-2c cells treated with FasL (Fig. 7A). In contrast, caspases were not or were weakly activated in I9-2a and I9-2e cells. Caspase-10 was processed in the various cell lines, whereas Bid was cleaved proportionally to caspase-10 content (Fig. 7A). Similarly, FasL-induced hypodiploidy correlated with the amount of caspase-10 and was strongly impaired by Z-VAD-fmk and Z-AEVD-fmk (Fig. 7, B and C). Altogether, our data indicate that caspase-10 can cleave Bid a"
https://openalex.org/W1971776069,"Siglec-5 (CD170) is a member of the recently described human CD33-related siglec subgroup of sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins and is expressed on myeloid cells of the hemopoietic system. Similar to other CD33-related siglecs, Siglec-5 contains two tyrosine-based motifs in its cytoplasmic tail implicated in signaling functions. To investigate the role of these motifs in Siglec-5-dependent signaling, we used transfected rat basophil leukemia cells as a model system. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-5 led to recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, as seen in both pull-down assays and microscopy. Siglec-5 could efficiently inhibit FcϵRI-mediated calcium fluxing and serotonin release after co-cross-linking. Surprisingly, a double tyrosine to alanine mutant of Siglec-5 could still mediate strong inhibition of serotonin release in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas a double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant lost all inhibitory activity. In comparison, suppression of Siglec-5-dependent adhesion to red blood cells was reversed by either tyrosine to alanine or tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of the membrane proximal tyrosine-based motif. Using an in vitro phosphatase assay with synthetic and recombinant forms of the cytoplasmic tail, it was shown that a double alanine mutant of Siglec-5 had weak, but significant SHP-1 activating properties similar to those of wild type, non-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail, whereas a double phenylalanine mutant was inactive. These findings establish that Siglec-5 can be classified as an inhibitory receptor with the potential to mediate SHP-1 and/or SHP-2-dependent signaling in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Siglec-5 (CD170) is a member of the recently described human CD33-related siglec subgroup of sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins and is expressed on myeloid cells of the hemopoietic system. Similar to other CD33-related siglecs, Siglec-5 contains two tyrosine-based motifs in its cytoplasmic tail implicated in signaling functions. To investigate the role of these motifs in Siglec-5-dependent signaling, we used transfected rat basophil leukemia cells as a model system. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-5 led to recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, as seen in both pull-down assays and microscopy. Siglec-5 could efficiently inhibit FcϵRI-mediated calcium fluxing and serotonin release after co-cross-linking. Surprisingly, a double tyrosine to alanine mutant of Siglec-5 could still mediate strong inhibition of serotonin release in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas a double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant lost all inhibitory activity. In comparison, suppression of Siglec-5-dependent adhesion to red blood cells was reversed by either tyrosine to alanine or tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of the membrane proximal tyrosine-based motif. Using an in vitro phosphatase assay with synthetic and recombinant forms of the cytoplasmic tail, it was shown that a double alanine mutant of Siglec-5 had weak, but significant SHP-1 activating properties similar to those of wild type, non-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail, whereas a double phenylalanine mutant was inactive. These findings establish that Siglec-5 can be classified as an inhibitory receptor with the potential to mediate SHP-1 and/or SHP-2-dependent signaling in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Regulation of responses by cells in the hemopoietic and immune systems depends on a balance between activatory signaling and inhibitory signaling. Their relative strengths set an appropriate activation threshold that helps fine-tune the response. Inhibitory signals are typically initiated by receptors containing one or more cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) 1The abbreviations used are: ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; Ig, immunoglobulin; RBL, rat basophil leukemia; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CT, cytoplasmic tail; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; RBC, red blood cells; WT, wild type. (1Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for ITIMs is (V/I/L)XYXX(L/V), where X is any amino acid. A recent bioinformatics study showed that the human proteome contains ∼109 membrane proteins with cytoplasmic ITIMs, and many of these have been shown already to function as inhibitory receptors (2Staub E. Rosenthal A. Hinzmann B. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 435-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The established dogma is that Src family tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the tyrosine residue in ITIMs during cellular activation and create high affinity docking sites for SH2 domain-containing phosphatases such as protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and the 5′ inositol phosphatase, SHIP (1Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The recruited and activated phosphatases can then dephosphorylate relevant substrates in the vicinity and regulate cellular activation (3Stebbins C.C. Watzl C. Billadeau D.D. Leibson P.J. Burshtyn D.N. Long E.O. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6291-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The human CD33-related siglecs are a recently described subgroup of the siglec family of sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins (4Crocker P.R. Varki A. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). All eight human CD33-related siglecs are expressed by cells of the hemopoietic and immune systems and contain in their cytoplasmic tails a membrane proximal ITIM and a membrane distal ITIM-like motif. The extracellular region is made up of varying numbers of Ig domains, including an N-terminal V-set Ig domain that mediates binding of sialylated glycans (5Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Where studied, CD33-related siglecs can become tyrosine phosphorylated and recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 after treatment of cells with pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (6Taylor V.C.

In addition, CD33 and Siglecs-7 and -9 have been shown to exhibit enhanced siglec-dependent adhesion after tyrosine mutation of the proximal ITIM (6Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J.

Siglec-5 (CD170) is a typical member of the CD33-related Siglec subfamily, with four extracellular Ig-like domains and two tyrosine-based motifs in the cytosolic region (15Cornish A.L. Freeman S.

Crocker P.R. Immunobiology. 2004; 209: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but there are currently no reports on the potential inhibitory signaling functions of this receptor. In the present study we have used transfected rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells as a model system to investigate the inhibitory activity of Siglec-5 and determine the importance of the two tyrosine-based motifs in recruitment of phosphatases, inhibitory signaling, and suppression of Siglec-5-dependent adhesion. We demonstrate that Siglec-5 can recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 after tyrosine phosphorylation and mediate inhibitory signaling, as measured by calcium flux and serotonin release after co-ligation with the activatory FcϵRI. Surprisingly, however, mutagenesis studies showed that inhibition of serotonin release could still occur efficiently after a double tyrosine to alanine substitution, whereas suppression of Siglec-5-dependent adhesion required an intact tyrosine residue at the membrane proximal ITIM. A potential mechanism for tyrosine phosphorylation-independent inhibitory signaling was provided by results of in vitro phosphatase assays, which demonstrated low level activation of SHP-1 by the Siglec-5 cytoplasmic tail in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation.

The 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine hybridoma was a gift from L. Nitschke (University of Wurzburg, Germany). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgGs were from Vector Laboratories (Peterborough, UK). Cells—RBL-2H3 cells expressing KIR2DL3 (20Blery M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L.

Vivier, Marseille, France) and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Stable clones of RBL cells expressing wild type (WT), and mutant forms of Siglec-5 were generated by electroporation and selection in G418 (15Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The U937 myelomonocytic cell line used for preparing lysates was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with antibiotics Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (10Angata T. Kerr S.C. Greaves D.R. Varki N.M. Crocker P.R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24466-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated or not with pervanadate (0.5 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Pre-cleared cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1A5 (anti-Siglec-5) mAb and then analyzed by immunoblotting with sheep pAb anti-Siglec-5, with 4G10 mAb anti-phosphotyrosine, or with rabbit pAbs C-19 anti-SHP-1 or C-18 anti-SHP-2. Fluorescence Microscopy—Siglec-5-expressing RBL clones were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding GFP chimeras by electroporation and cultured overnight on glass coverslips (BDH). Cells were then stained with anti-Siglec-5 sheep pAb (10 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with TRITC-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)2 anti-sheep IgG to generate patched Siglec-5. Cells were then treated or not with pervanadate (0.5 mm) for 10 min at 37 °C and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For the FcϵRI-mediated activation of RBL cells, GFP-transfected cells were stained with mouse IgE (0.1 μg/ml) and 1A5 mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, incubated with goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then labeled with sheep anti-Siglec-5 pAb (10 μg/ml) and TRITC-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)2 anti-sheep IgG (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C to create clusters. Images were acquired using the AxioVision imaging system (Imaging associates, Bicester, UK) and a Zeiss Axioskop immunofluorescence microscope equipped with a Zeiss X40 objective (Jena, Germany). Flow Cytometry—All incubations were carried out on ice. Cells were incubated with primary mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 30 min followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig for 30 min and then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Calcium Mobilization—Cells were labeled with 4.5 μm Indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Cambridge, UK) in the presence of 0.045% (v/v) pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in media, resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and labeled on ice for 30 min with IgE (0.1 μg/ml) alone or in combination with anti-MHC class I, anti-KIR2DL3, or anti-Siglec-5 mAbs (10 μg/ml). After washing cells were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min immediately before analysis, and goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig (at 50 μg/ml) was added to the samples to induce cross-linking of antibodies and cell activation. Calcium mobilization was analyzed using an LSR flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) by measuring the ratio of 400/510 nm fluorescence with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). Serotonin Release Assay—The serotonin release assay was performed as described in (20Blery M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daeron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly [3H]serotonin-labeled RBL cells were incubated with mouse IgE in the absence or presence of varying amounts of anti-MHC class I molecules (OX-18), anti-Siglec-5 (1A5), or anti-KIR2DL3 (GL183) mAbs. After washing cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig (at 50 μg/ml). Released radioactivity in the supernatants was analyzed using a WinSpectral liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Milton Keynes, UK). Each assay was set up in triplicate, and the results were expressed as a percentage of specific serotonin release: (cpm test - cpm spont)/(cpm max - cpm spont) × 100, where cpm “spont” is the spontaneous release of [3H]serotonin from cells incubated in absence of antibodies, and cpm “max” is the maximum release of [3H]serotonin from cells lysed using 1% Triton X-100. For comparative analysis results were expressed as a mean percentage of inhibition of serotonin release: 100 - (% test × 100/% IgE), where % IgE is the percentage of specific serotonin release obtained with cells incubated with mouse IgE alone. Immunoprecipitation with GST-Siglec-5 Cytoplasmic Tail Constructs—10 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 15 units of c-Src kinase (Oncogene, Nottingham, UK) in 500 μl of tyrosine kinase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm ATP) at room temperature for 2 h. 10 μg of GST fusion proteins with or without tyrosine phosphorylation were incubated with 1 ml of U937 cell lysate (Triton-soluble fraction of 107 unstimulated cells) overnight at 4 °C. The GST fusion protein complexes were captured using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS reducing sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Red Blood Cell (RBC) Binding Assay—RBC binding assays were performed as described (19Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL or COS cells were treated or not with sialidase for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with human RBC for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound RBCs were gently washed off, cells were fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, and rosetting was assessed by microscopy. To quantify RBC binding, the percentage of cells forming rosettes (defined as cells binding more than 10 RBC) was scored from counting at least 200 cells per field in 5 different fields per experiment. Results were expressed as the mean percentage obtained in three independent experiments. Phosphatase Assay—Wild type and mutant forms of Siglec-5CT-GST and WT SHP-1-GST were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21pLysS cells (Novagen, Nottingham, UK), and the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Siglec-5CT-GST fusion proteins were cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the Siglec-5CT was purified by gel filtration and either left untreated or phosphorylated with c-Src kinase. Irrelevant peptide from tetanus toxin (amino acids 871-887) was a kind gift from C. Watts (University of Dundee, UK). Non-phosphorylated and doubletyrosyl-phosphorylated synthetic peptides of Siglec-5 (amino acids 514-551) were synthesized by G. Bloomberg (University of Bristol, UK). Peptides and proteins were incubated with purified GST-SHP-1 (0.02 μm) and 32P-labeled Raytide (30,000 cpm) (Upstate, Dundee, UK) for 1 h at 37 °C. A constitutively active form of SHP-1 lacking SH2 domains (ΔSH2-SHP-1) was a generous gift from J. Matthews (University of Cardiff, Cardiff, UK) and was used as a positive control with substrate alone. Phosphatase assays were stopped by the addition of charcoal solution (0.9 m HCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium phosphate, 4% (w/v) activated charcoal). After centrifugation, the released radioactivity was analyzed by scintillation counting. Each assay was set up in duplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean of 32P release from three independent experiments. Statistics—Values represent the mean ± 1 S.D. of 3 or more different experiments. Student's t test was applied using a two-tailed distribution of two samples of equal or unequal variances. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Siglec-5 and Recruitment of SHP-1 and -2—In common with other CD33-related Siglecs, the cytoplasmic tail of Siglec-5 contains two conserved tyrosine-based motifs at amino acids 520 and 544, here designated Y1 and Y2. Y1 conforms to the consensus ITIM motif, whereas Y2 is ITIM-like (15Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Augustus M. Carter K.C. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether Siglec-5 can become tyrosyl-phosphorylated and recruit SHP-1 and/or SHP-2, Siglec-5-transfected RBL (RBL-5WT) or control non-transfected RBL cells were either untreated or treated with pervanadate, and Siglec-5 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to Siglec-5, phosphotyrosine, SHP-1, or SHP-2 (Fig. 1A). Specific bands of ∼100 kDa corresponding to Siglec-5 were observed with antibodies to Siglec-5 (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Siglec-5 was undetectable in untreated cells but was readily observed after pervanadate treatment. This was accompanied by recruitment of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Fig. 1A). To visualize the interaction of protein-tyrosine phosphatases with Siglec-5 in living cells, RBL-5WT cells were transfected with SHP-1-GFP or SHP-2-GFP cDNAs and Siglec-5 capped at the cell surface using sheep anti-Siglec-5 pAb followed by TRITC-conjugated rabbit F(ab′)2 anti-sheep Ig. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, upper panels, no co-localization was observed with untreated cells, whereas co-localization was clearly evident when the cells were treated with pervanadate. To investigate if co-localization also occurred after physiological activation signals, Siglec-5 was co-cross-linked with the activatory FcϵRI receptor in the absence of pervanadate. Both SHP-1-GFP and SHP-2-GFP co-localized with Siglec-5 under these conditions (Fig. 1, B and C, upper panels). In a previous study (6Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Douglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11505-11512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) it was shown that mAb-induced clustering of CD33 led to transient phosphorylation and recruitment of SHP-1 and -2 followed by dephosphorylation of CD33. To investigate whether the failure to observe co-localization of clustered Siglec-5 with SHP-1- and SHP-2-GFP in untreated cells could be due to SHP-mediated dephosphorylation of Siglec-5, RBL-5WT cells were transfected with catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-1(C453S)-GFP and SHP-2(C459S)-GFP (mutSHP-1-GFP and mutSHP-2-GFP, respectively). These mutants retain the ability to bind substrates via their SH2 domains but are unable to dephosphorylate them (21Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Science. 1991; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 22Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, clustered Siglec-5 co-localized with mut-SHP-1 and mutSHP-2 in untreated cells (Fig. 1, B and C, lower panels), and this was not significantly enhanced by pervanadate treatment (data not shown). Therefore, in the absence of pervanadate treatment Siglec-5 may become phosphorylated on clustering and recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to dephosphorylation of Siglec-5 and rapid dissociation. Co-cross-linking of Siglec-5 Inhibits FcϵRI-mediated Calcium Fluxing and Serotonin Release—To assess the potential inhibitory function of Siglec-5, we used two assays of cellular activation, namely calcium fluxing and serotonin release. In both systems a putative inhibitory receptor expressed in RBL cells is cross-linked with FcϵRI, and the effect on cellular activation measured. The RBL cells used in this study had already been transfected with the well characterized inhibitory receptor, KIR2DL3, thereby providing a useful internal reference in the inhibition assays (20Blery M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daeron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, similar levels of Siglec-5 and KIR2DL3 were expressed in RBL-5WT. Cross-linking of KIR2DL3 or Siglec-5 with FcϵRI reduced the calcium fluxing in RBL-5WT cells in a time-dependent manner when compared with a control antibody that binds MHC class I molecules on RBL cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The inhibitory activity of Siglec-5 was investigated further using the serotonin release assay (20Blery M. Delon J. Trautmann A. Cambiaggi A. Olcese L. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Chavrier P. Moretta A. Daeron M. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8989-8996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Co-cross-linking of Siglec-5 with FcϵRI was carried out over a range of anti-Siglec-5 mAb concentrations, revealing a dose-dependent inhibition of serotonin release that was very similar to that produced by co-cross-linking KIR2DL3 (Fig. 2C). No inhibition was seen with the control antibody against MHC class I (Fig. 2C). To define which tyrosine motif(s) on Siglec-5 is required for SHP-1 and SHP-2 association and inhibitory signaling function in RBL cells, we generated tyrosine to alanine mutants at Y1 and Y2 either individually or in combination (Fig. 2A and Table II). With RBL-5Y1A, RBL-5Y2A, and the double tyrosine mutant, RBL-5Y12A, strong inhibition was still observed after co-cross-linking of Siglec-5 with FcϵRI (Fig. 2C). In contrast, truncation of the cytoplasmic tail resulted in a complete loss of inhibition (Fig. 2C). These results show, surprisingly, that the tyrosine residues are not essential for mediating the inhibitory function of Siglec-5.Table IIConstructs used in this study Cytoplasmic tail sequences are shown for Siglec-5 wild type (5WT) with amino acid substitutions shown for the mutants.

Whereas upon stretching a single chromatin fiber in a solution of very low chromatin concentration the statistical distribution of DNA length released upon nucleosome unfolding shows only one population centered around ∼25 nm, in nucleosome stabilizing conditions a second population with average length of ∼50 nm was observed. Using radioactively labeled histone H3 and H2B, we demonstrate that upon lowering the chromatin concentration to very low values, first the linker histones are released, followed by the H2A-H2B dimer, whereas the H3-H4 tetramer remains stably attached to DNA even at the lowest concentration studied. The nucleosomal arrays reconstituted on a 5 S rDNA tandem repeat exhibited similar behavior. This suggests that the 25-nm disruption length is a consequence of the histone H2A-H2B dimer dissociation from the histone octamer. In nucleosome stabilizing conditions, a full ∼145 bp is constrained in the nucleosome. Our data demonstrate that the nucleosome stability and histone octamer integrity can be severely degraded in experiments where the sample concentration is low.

Our data demonstrate that the nucleosome stability and histone octamer integrity can be severely degraded in experiments where the sample concentration is low. The genomic DNA of all eukaryotes is packed in the cell nucleus in the form of chromatin. It has been well established that beside compaction of the important amount of genomic DNA in the restricted nuclear volume, the chromatin organization is the key element in the control of gene expression (e.g. see Refs. 1Katsani K.R. Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 113-141PubMed Google Scholar and 2Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Its most abundant part is represented by association of the DNA with a specific class of proteins, the histones, forming a basic repetitive unit of the chromatin, the nucleosome. 145 bp of DNA is associated in ∼1.65 left-handed turns with the histone octamer, composed of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, to form the nucleosome core particle (NCP) 1The abbreviations used are: NCP, nucleosome core particle; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; pN, piconewtons; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: NCP, nucleosome core particle; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; pN, piconewtons; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Linker DNA interconnects NCPs and is usually associated with the linker histones. The complex of the histone octamer, linker histone, and 166 bp of nucleosomal DNA is termed chromatosome (3van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Consecutive nucleosomes tend to organize into ∼30-nm-thick irregular fiber, whose level of compaction and organization alters with ionic conditions and the presence of linker histones and core histone N-terminal domains (4Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 5Wolffe A.P. Khochbin S. Dimitrov S.

Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The gene regulation function of the chromatin is directly related to mechanisms underlying the chromatin conformation changes that involve, among others, the nucleosome stability and its structural alterations linked to nucleosome remodeling mechanisms. Because of this, the elasticity of the chromatin fiber and of individual nucleosome has become an intensively studied topic over the last few years. Measuring the elastic properties of chromatin arrays using optical tweezers is one of the most direct methods assessing the forces involved in the nucleosome stability and chromatin fiber organization. Several studies were recently reporting on the elastic response of the chromatin fiber to stretching forces. Traction of chromatin segments assembled in nuclear extract of Xenopus laevis yielded a “saw tooth” pattern stretching profile with typical disruption length of 65 nm at forces around 20 pN (9Bennink M.L. Leuba S.H. Leno G.H. Zlatanova J. de Grooth B.G. Greve J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Similar force value was observed for nucleosomal arrays reconstituted on a tandem repeat of 5 S rDNA sequence (without linker histone), and the length of DNA released upon the nucleosome disruption was found to be 27 nm (10Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L. Wang M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1960-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither of these values corresponds to those expected from the known NCP and chromatosome structure. The first contains ∼49 nm of DNA (145 bp) in contact with histone octamer, and 56 nm (∼166 bp) of DNA are in contact with the histones within the chromatosome. It was proposed (11Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 377-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the observed 65-nm disruptions in nuclear extract experiments may reflect the binding of both B4 (the embryonic form of linker histone) and high mobility group proteins to chromatin. The experiments with 5 S reconstituted arrays suggested (10Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L. Wang M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1960-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) that the DNA unwrapping from the H2A-H2B dimer occurred progressively in low force regime (∼5 pN), and the major disruption event was associated with the dissociation of the remaining DNA from the H3-H4 tetramer. This is in good agreement with the ∼80 bp of unwrapped DNA (i.e. the 27 nm observed) (10Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L. Wang M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1960-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Taking into account the distribution and type of DNA-histone bonds within the NCP (12Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6885) Google Scholar), it is, however, difficult to justify the ∼3-fold difference in threshold forces for H2A-H2B dimer and H3-H4 tetramer, respectively. Moreover, the force values necessary for the total nucleosome disintegration far exceed the theoretical estimates (13Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2173-2178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and results obtained by thermodynamic considerations (14Ausio J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Ausio J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Cotton R.W. Hamkalo B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to deal with these controversies, several explanations were proposed. Kulic and Schiessel (17Kulic I.M. Schiessel H. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004; 92: 228101-228104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) suggested that the major part of nucleosome disruption energy is absorbed by flipping of the NCP around its dyad, and only a minor part is consumed by the DNA unwrapping. This can potentially equilibrate the contribution from the H2A-H2B dimer and the H3-H4 octamer and bring the unwrapping energy down to the predicted values. Another proposition (18Marko J.F. Poirier M.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) pointed out the possible effect of the loading rate. Removal of the whole octamer probably needs to pass over a large energy barrier, which can be achieved by thermal fluctuations only on long time scales. It is therefore possible that the stretching velocities so far exploited are much too fast, bringing the system far from its thermodynamic equilibrium. This work reports our data on the nucleosome unfolding upon external stress and sample dilution. We have studied and compared the elastic behavior of native chromatin isolated from chicken erythrocytes and nucleosomal arrays reconstituted on a tandem repeat of 5 S rDNA sequence. In order to establish the contribution of the H3-H4 tetramer, we also investigated the elastic response of the chromatin segments reconstituted with histone H3-H4 tetramer only. Our data allow us to understand in depth the mechanism of nucleosome unfolding upon applying external forces and to clarify the contradictions in the literature. Reconstitution of 5 S Nucleosomal Arrays—Plasmid p2085S-G5E4 (a kind gift from J. L. Workman) was restricted with Acc65I (Asp718): G*GTAC*C, CaiI (AlwNI), SspI, ClaI: AT*CG*AT (Fermentas), and restriction fragments were purified by 4% native PAGE and electroelution and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. The 2539-bp-long fragment consists of an ∼400-bp E4 promoter DNA, flanked by two DNA sequences each containing five 208-bp tandem repeats of the 5 S rRNA sea urchin gene (19Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Purified fragments were end-labeled either at the ClaI side by biotin-dCTP or [α-32P]dCTP in the presence of 100 μm of dGTP using exo– Klenow fragment. A fraction of biotin-dCTP-labeled fragments was labeled at the Acc65I end by digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche Applied Science). Conventional recombinant X. laevis histones were expressed in bacteria and purified according to the protocol of Luger et al. (20Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). For reconstitution, the end-labeled DNA fragments were mixed in 2 m NaCl with a 1:0.8 molar ratio of the recombinant core histones and reconstituted by salt dialysis as described in Ref. 21Angelov D. Molla A. Perche P.Y. Hans F. Cote J. Khochbin S. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar. Typically, 1 μg of biotin-labeled DNA fragments, containing 10–16% of doubly (biotindigoxigenin) labeled fragments were used for reconstitution. For the micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis of the nucleosomal arrays, 32P-labeled fragments were used instead. 100 ng of 32P-end-labeled free DNA and nucleosomal array were partially digested with 0.03 and 0.1 units of micrococcal nuclease, respectively, in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by 100 μl of 0.2% SDS and 1 μg of Proteinase K. DNA was extracted by phenol chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The EcoRI ladder was obtained by partial digestion of DNA with 2 units of EcoRI for 1 min (lane 1, Fig. 1B). Positions of nucleosomes within the 5S-5GE4 array are indicated. Native Chromatin Preparation—The isolated chicken erythrocyte nuclei were washed twice with digestion buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Micrococcal nuclease (Fermentas) was added to final concentration 1 unit/1 A260 of DNA, and nuclei were digested for 1 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to 5 mm final concentration. Nuclei were centrifuged at 400 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Pellet of nuclei was resuspended in 1 mm EDTA and left on ice for 45 min to release the chromatin. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g, and the supernatant containing chromatin was removed and placed into new tubes. This procedure yielded chromatin segments ranging from 2 to ∼15 kb with the highest proportion around 7 kb and a low amount of short oligonucleosomes. For biotinylation, the chromatin was washed twice in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, using Microcon YM 100 tubes (400 × g, 25 min, 4 °C). One unit of T4 DNA polymerase/1 μg of DNA was added to solution and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to form 3′ overhangs. The mix of nucleotides (biotin-14-dCTP, biotin-14-dATP, dGTP, and dTTP) was added to the reaction to a final concentration of 100 μm each and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a 5 mm final concentration. The sample was placed into 1× TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) buffer using a Microcon YM 100 concentrator. Nucleosome Dissociation Experiments—For the nucleosome dissociation experiments, wild type H3 and swapped tail H3-H2B mutant histones were used. The swapped tail H3-H2B is a fusion between the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and the histone fold domain of H2B (22Angelov D. Verdel A. An W. Bondarenko V. Hans F. Doyen C.M. Studitsky V.M. Hamiche A. Roeder R.G. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3815-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both the wild type H3 and the fusion H3-H2B were radioactively labeled using Aurora A kinase (23Scrittori L. Hans F. Angelov D. Charra M. Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30002-30010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). End-positioned nucleosomes contained either labeled H3 or labeled fusion H3-H2B, and the H3-H4 tetrameric particles were reconstituted on a nonlabeled 241-bp fragment comprising the 601 positioning sequence as previously described (22Angelov D. Verdel A. An W. Bondarenko V. Hans F. Doyen C.M. Studitsky V.M. Hamiche A. Roeder R.G. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3815-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nucleosome dissociation experiments were carried out in either TE, 10 mm NaCl, or PBS. Briefly, aliquots of nucleosomes were diluted with the appropriate buffer in a 10-μl final volume to the concentrations indicated (from 40 to 5 nm) and left for 45 min at room temperature. Then the samples were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay carried out in 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 29:1 (w/w)), 0.3× TBE at 4 °C (21Angelov D. Molla A. Perche P.Y. Hans F. Cote J. Khochbin S. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For the native chromatin dissociation experiments, 2–4 μg of chromatin at a concentration 0.25 mg/ml (measured as double-stranded DNA A260) were diluted in appropriate volumes of 1× PBS to the concentrations indicated and left at room temperature for 1 h. Then MgCl2 was added (final concentration 15 mm) to the chromatin samples, and they were additionally incubated for 5 min on ice to complete the MgCl2-induced chromatin aggregation. The aggregated chromatin samples were quantitatively pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Each pellet was dissolved in 15 μl of 1× loading buffer for SDS electrophoresis, and the samples were loaded on 18% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. After completing the electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie. Stretching Experiments—In stretching experiments, an experimental flow cell with micropipette was used similar to that described in Ref. 24Cui Y. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar. Reconstituted chromatin fragments (A260 = 0.5) were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.005% (w/v) of solid matter streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) functionalized beads (3.36 μm; Spherotec) in 1× PBS, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 50 μl. The beads were functionalized according the standard protocol for COOH-activated beads (25Wuite G.J. Davenport R.J. Rappaport A. Bustamante C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A solution of digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science) functionalized 1.5-μm Sicastar® beads (Micromod) was introduced into the experimental cell and one bead was fixed by suction in the micropipette. The solution of beads incubated with chromatin was 100× diluted in 1× TE, 100 mm NaCl and introduced into the experimental cell (the additional dilution was necessary in order to lower the bead concentration to a level compatible with the stretching experiment). A selected bead was immobilized in the optical trap, and by approaching the bead held in the micropipette, the chromatin fragment was tethered between the two beads. For native chromatin, the tethering procedure was identical with the exception of using both beads (large and small) activated with streptavidin. The chromatin fragment and bead concentration were adjusted depending on the experimental conditions. Typical data acquisition frequency was 3 kHz, and weak averaging was applied in order to increase signal/noise ratio. The speed of the traction was 100 nm/s with a trapping constant of 70 pN/μm. Lower speeds down to 10 nm/s were applied to study the effect of the loading rate. For each material and set of experimental conditions, a large statistical set of data were collected and analyzed (number of disruption ∼500 for native chromatin, ∼460 for reconstituted chromatin, corresponding to ∼50 stretched segments for each, ∼80 for reconstituted tetramers, and ∼120 for native chromatin in the presence of MgCl2) in order to obtain a representative value. For optimized conditions, the above protocol was modified in order to preserve the native chromatin concentration sufficiently high throughout the whole procedure to prevent the concentration-driven histone octamer dissociation. A relatively high quantity of beads (0.05% solid w/v final concentration for 3.36-μm beads) was added to the chromatin at A260 > 4 and left to incubate overnight at 4 °C. Prior to the stretching, the solution was diluted in order to obtain the same conditions (bead concentration and ionic conditions) as above, and a stretching experiment was completed. The length of DNA released upon the individual nucleosome unfolding was evaluated similarly as described in Ref. 9Bennink M.L. Leuba S.H. Leno G.H. Zlatanova J. de Grooth B.G. Greve J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar. Statistical sets were fitted with a Gaussian (or linear combination of Gaussian) using Kaleidagraph data analysis software. Elasticity of Reconstituted 5 S rDNA Nucleosomal Arrays— Nucleosomal arrays were reconstituted by using core histones purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A) and a fragment of DNA containing 208-bp repeats comprising the 5 S rRNA sea urchin gene nucleosome positioning sequence. This allowed us to reconstitute, under optimal conditions, arrays containing 12 nucleosomes (19Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Wallberg A.E. Steger D.J. Cairns B.R. Wright A.P. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 649-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The reconstituted arrays were analyzed by digestion with microccocal nuclease (Fig. 1B). The clear ∼200-bp repeat observed upon microccocal nuclease digestion represents evidence of a proper organization of the reconstituted samples. Once the arrays were characterized, we carried out the elasticity measurements. The force/extension curve showed a typical “saw tooth” profile (Fig. 2A) similar to the one described earlier, where the discontinuities in elastic response correspond to the unfolding of individual nucleosomes (10Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L. Wang M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1960-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Contrary to previously published data, we have, however, observed a rather large spread of threshold forces, with the average at the position of 17.6 ± 3.5 pN (Fig. 2B, inset, and Table I). Although there were cases where nearly all disruptions occurred at approximately the same force, we believe that a certain spread of values is normal, and we interpret it as a natural fluctuation of the nucleosome conformation. The statistical distribution of the DNA length released upon the nucleosome disruption showed a main, very narrow peak around a central value of 24.1 ± 3.9 nm (Fig. 2B). In addition, some longer disruptions were observed, which is expressed by a very weak shoulder in the statistical distribution (Fig. 2B) with the central value of 47.5 ± 5.4 nm. The main peak at ∼24 nm was described previously in Ref. 10Brower-Toland B.D. Smith C.L. Yeh R.C. Lis J.T. Peterson C.L. Wang M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1960-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar and was attributed to the unwrapping of the central 80-bp nucleosomal DNA stabilized by the interactions with the H3-H4 histone tetramer (10Brower-Toland B.D.

The addition of MgCl2 (to 1 mm final concentration) has no effect on the stretching profile of reconstituted segments, and the statistical distribution of disruption lengths remains identical (Fig. 2B). Elasticity Measurements of Native Chromatin—The reconstituted chromatin arrays, although well defined, represent only an incomplete substitute of the native chromatin. The presence/absence of the linker histone may significantly modify the stability of the entire nucleosome or alter eventually the stability of the histone octamer. We have therefore decided to study the elastic response of native chromatin. High molecular weight native chromatin segments were isolated from chicken erythrocyte nuclei by mild digestion with microccocal nuclease (see “Materials and Methods”). The native chromatin contained a full complement of the core as well as linker histones (data not shown, but see Fig. 6). The stretching experiments were carried out under identical experimental conditions as in the case of reconstituted nucleosomal arrays. For the native chromatin, the disruption discontinuities varied both in threshold force and length of released DNA (Fig. 3A). The distribution of disruption lengths is clearly biphasic, comprising a main peak and a well pronounced shoulder (Fig. 3B). Although the disruption length varies rather widely, the statistical evaluation reveals the main peak exhibiting a value of 23.2 ± 3.5 nm (Fig. 3B and Table I), whereas the average length of the unwrapped DNA of the shoulder corresponds to 40.1 ± 5.5 nm (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the dominant value of the DNA length released upon the disruption is identical (within the error margin) to the one obtained for the reconstituted chromatin (Table I, Fig. 2B). In addition, the average measured value of the disruption force was 19.6 ± 4.6 pN (Fig. 3B, inset, and Table I), which is equal, within the error, to that measured for the reconstituted chromatin segments.Fig. 3Stretching profile of the chromatin isolated from the chicken erythrocyte nucleus in 1× TE, 100 mm NaCl buffer.

If this was correct, the distribution of disruption lengths of an array of reconstituted H3-H4 tetramers should be identical to that of the complete octamer. To test if this was the case, we reconstituted 5 S arrays of H3-H4 particles and studied their elastic properties. The stretching profile of these samples was very similar to that of the arrays reconstituted with the complete core histone octamer (results not shown). The average disruption length was found again to be ∼25 (25.1 ± 4.8) nm. However, contrary to the native segments or reconstituted chromatin, the disruption length distribution contained no long disruptions (Fig. 4), and they were completely absent in the stretching profiles. The average measured force was 14.7 ± 1.8 pN (i.e. slightly lower than in the case of arrays reconstituted with the whole histone octamer but still within the error margin of its average threshold force (17.8 ± 5.5 pN; see Table I)). All of these data suggest that the peak at ∼24 nm might really reflect the unwrapping of the central 80 bp of nucleosomal DNA bound by the histone H3-H4 tetramer. Bearing in mind this and the fact that the 24-nm peak was the major peak in the disruption length distribution of both native chromatin and arrays reconstituted with histone octamers, one could think that there might be no contribution of H2A-H2B dimer or of the linker histone to the stability of the nucleosome. Native Chromatin and Reconstituted Nucleosomal Array Stability at Very Low Sample Concentrations—Why is there no detectable contribution of H2A-H2B dimer or linker histone to the stability of the nucleosome? One explanation is that the binding forces and energies of the H2A-H2B dimer are much weaker than those of the remaining tetramer, and therefore their contribution to the stretching profile is not expressed in the form of apparent discontinuities, but rather in the form of nearly continuous DNA unfolding at low force values (10Brower-Toland B.D.

However, as mentioned above, the overall distribution of the DNA histone contacts as revealed by the crystal structure cannot easily explain the nearly 3-fold increase in the threshold force for the H3-H4-nucleosomal DNA complex and especially the all-or-none mode of the nucleosome disintegration. An alternative explanation could be suggested. Detailed studies on the stability of the NCPs within a large interval of the monovalent ion concentrations (10–4-2 m) were reported (15Ausio J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Libertini L.J. Small E.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3517-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The data showed that the mechanisms of histone release from the NCPs involved (i) a highly cooperative release of the histones from the DNA, consisting of complete eviction of the histone octamer from DNA (this mechanism is realized at NaCl concentrations <0.75 m) and (ii) a stepwise release of histones from the NCP DNA at NaCl concentrations >0.75 m, the histone H2A-H2B dimers being released more readily than the histone H3-H4 tetramers (27Burton D.R.

Biomimetic reactions produced a variety of testosterone oxidation products with 6β-hydroxylation being only a minor reaction, indicating that P450 3A4 has considerable control over the course of steroid hydroxylation because 6β-hydroxylation is not dominant in a thermodynamically controlled oxidation of the substrate. Several isotopically labeled testosterone substrates were prepared and used to probe the catalytic mechanism of P450 3A4: (i) 2,2,4,6,6-2H5; (ii) 6,6-2H2; (iii) 6α-2H; (iv) 6β-2H; and (v) 6β-3H testosterone. Only the 6β-hydrogen was removed by P450 3A4 and not the 6α, indicating that P450 3A4 abstracts hydrogen and rebounds oxygen only at the β face. Analysis of the rates of hydroxylation of 6β-1H-, 6β-2H-, and 6β-3H-labeled testosterone and application of the Northrop method yielded an apparent intrinsic kinetic deuterium isotope effect (Dk) of 15. The deuterium isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km in non-competitive reactions were only 2-3. Some “switching” to other hydroxylations occurred because of 6β-2H substitution. The high Dk value is consistent with an initial hydrogen atom abstraction reaction. Attenuation of the high Dk in the non-competitive experiments implies that C-H bond breaking is not a dominant rate-limiting step. Considerable attenuation of a high Dk value was also seen with a slower P450 3A4 reaction, the O-dealkylation of 7-benzyloxyquinoline. Thus P450 3A4 is an enzyme with regioselective flexibility but also considerable regioselectivity and stereoselectivity in product formation, not necessarily dominated by the ease of C-H bond breaking.

A view frequently expressed for smaller substrates is that binding is relatively loose and the regioselectivity of oxidation of substrates is largely a function of the ease of C-H bond breaking (16Smith D.A.

Chem. 2003; 46: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Relatively little information is available regarding what step is rate-limiting in P450 3A4 reactions. The addition of the first electron in the catalytic cycle (step 2 of Scheme 1) is apparently relatively fast in the presence of an optimal concentration of NADPH-P450 reductase (18Guengerich F.P. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14741-14750Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Only limited information has been obtained regarding steps 1 and 3-9 (Scheme 1) with P450 3A4 reactions. Without information on the extent to which chemical steps (e.g. substrate oxidation) limit catalysis, it will not be possible to understand or predict the behavior of this system. One long-standing approach to understanding the kinetics of individual reaction steps is the application of kinetic isotope effects, particularly involving hydrogen isotopes (19Jencks W.P.

However, the use of kinetic isotope effect methods with enzymes is subject to the complexity of these multi-step systems and the isotope effect on the chemical step can be masked by the contributions of other steps (27Northrop D.B. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2644-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Northrop D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Kinetic isotope effect studies have been used with P450 reactions for >30 years (29Mitoma C. Yasuda D.M. Tagg J. Tanabe M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 136: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Björkhem I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 27: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Foster A.B. Jarman M. Stevens J.D.

In many of the early studies, the experimental designs were not always most appropriate for mechanistic interpretation. However, more sophisticated studies with bacterial P450 101A1 (34Gelb M.H. Heimbrook D.C. Mälkönen P. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and mammalian P450s (35Harada N. Miwa G.T. Walsh J.S. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol.

A number of theoretical treatments of P450 kinetic isotope effects were done by the Gillette group (38Gillette J.R. Darbyshire J.F. Sugiyama K.

Although many of the expressed kinetic isotope effects cited in the literature are low and there has been a tendency to regard C-H bond breaking as generally being relatively rapid, our own work (40Guengerich F.P.

Reports of kinetic isotope effect studies with P450 3A4 reactions are very limited (46Obach R.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1599-1607PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the reactions are not amenable because of the nature of the substrates (e.g. nifedipine ring dehydrogenation (involving N), 17β-estradiol 2-hydroxylation), and isotope effects in N-dealkylation reactions are dominated by the deprotonation event (47Okazaki O.

Beaune P.H. Kremers P. Wolff T. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5051-5060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and should be amenable to such analysis. However, the synthesis of the appropriately isotopically labeled testosterones had not been reported and, in our own experience, was not trivial. We prepared a series of H-6 isotopically labeled forms of testosterone and used these as substrates with P450 3A4 enzyme systems. The results reveal stereospecific abstraction of the 6β-hydrogen and a high intrinsic kinetic hydrogen isotope effect that is strongly attenuated with partial switching of oxidation to other (β) positions. The results provide a view of this enzyme that differs from some current conceptions regarding P450 3A4 selectivity and the nature of rate-limiting steps in the catalytic cycle. All of the reagents used for synthesis and product analysis (generally from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) were of ACS grade or better unless specified otherwise. HPLC solvents were of HPLC grade (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Steroids were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI).

Fluorescence assays (7-hydroxyquinoline formation) were done using an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument in the steady-state mode (with a cuvette accessory and manual mixing).

https://openalex.org/W2078949302,"Overexpression of androgen receptor (AR) decreases estrogen receptor α (ERα) transactivation, which plays a basic role in hormone-dependent breast cancer. This transcriptional interference can be due to shared coactivators. Here we demonstrated that in MCF-7 cells ARA70, an AR-specific coactivator, interacted with endogenous ERα, increasing its transcriptional activity, and it was recruited to the pS2 gene promoter. Moreover, a dominant negative ARA70 down-regulated ERα transcriptional activity as well as pS2 mRNA. ARA70 overexpression reversed the AR down-regulatory effect on ERα signaling. However, in the presence of a progressive increase of transfected AR, ARA70 switched into enhancing the inhibitory effect of AR on ERα signaling. These opposite effects of ARA70 were further evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation assay in MCF-7wt, MCF-7-overexpressing AR, and HeLa cells, exogenously expressing an excess of ERα with respect to AR or an excess of AR with respect to ERα. Thus, ARA70 is a coactivator for ERα and may represent a functional link between ERα/AR modulating their cross-talk in models of estrogen signaling in MCF-7 and HeLa cells.

In the last decade, the molecular mechanism involved in breast cancer hormone dependence has been extensively investigated. The growth of breast cancer cells is responsive to various growth factors and steroid hormones and also reflects the cross-talk between the respective signaling pathways. The role of nuclear receptors in breast cancer is an intriguing area of investigation, which continues to broaden as the number of coactivators and corepressors influencing the link between steroid receptors and the cell transcriptional machinery has grown. The prognostic impact of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR) 1The abbreviations used are: PR, progesterone receptor; AR, androgen receptor; ERα, estrogen receptor α; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; OHFl, hydroxyflutamide; dARA70fl, dominant negative full-length ARA70; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ERE, estrogen-responsive element; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; E2, estradiol. in breast cancer is well established because they both do predict a good response rate of breast cancer to hormonal treatment (1Thorpe S.M. Acta Oncol. 1988; 27: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Foekens J.A. Portengen H. Van Putten W.L.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5823-5828PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, even though the androgen receptor is present in 70–90% of primary breast tumors, and it is often coexpressed with the ERα and PR in human breast tumors, its clinical significance and functional role in breast cancer is poorly understood (3Birrell S.N. Hall R. Tilley W. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ARs are expressed in normal mammary gland, which is also an androgen target tissue. Androgens often antagonize the effects of estrogens in mammary gland development and could be considered to be endogenous anti-estrogens under some circumstances (4Murphy L.C. Watson P. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2002; 56: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the idea that this interplay is biologically meaningful. 1) Reduced or impaired AR signaling has been implicated in the development of hereditary male breast cancers (5Lobaccaro J.M. Lumbroso S. Belon C. Galtier-Dereure F. Baringer J. Lesimple T. Heron J.F. Pujol H. Sultan C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 2) Women who have AR alleles that encode for short polyglutamine tracts in the AR protein have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer (6Giguere Y. Dewailly E. Brisson J. Ayotte P. LaLaflamme N. Demers A. Forest V.I. Dodin S. Robert J. Rousseau F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5869-5874PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that androgen signaling in the breast might protect against cancer development and progression. On the basis of such findings, androgens have been used successfully to treat metastatic female breast cancers with comparable efficacy to tamoxifen, but the treatment was not well tolerated because of its masculinizing side effects (7Goldenberg I.S. Sedransk N. Volk H. Segaloff A. Kelly R.M. Haines C.R. Cancer. 1975; 36: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because androgens have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of AR-positive breast cancer cell lines in culture (8Hackenberg R. Schulz K.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in our previous studies we attempted to evaluate the role of the AR in the control of the proliferation of the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line MCF-7. These experiments demonstrated that the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) inhibits both basal and estrogen-induced cell proliferation. This effect of DHT on MCF-7 cell proliferation was reversed by the androgen receptor antagonist, hydroxyflutamide (OHFl), indicating that it was mediated via an interaction with the AR. Moreover overexpression of the AR in MCF-7 cells markedly decreased ERα transcriptional activity, suggesting a functional cross-talk between the two transduction pathways (9Andò S. De Amicis F. Rago V. Carpino A. Maggiolini M. Panno M.L. Lanzino M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 193: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transcriptional interference or “squelching” between various steroid receptors has been interpreted as a reflection of the involvement of shared coactivator proteins that mediated functional interactions between nuclear receptors, the basal transcriptional machinery, and the chromatin environment (10Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 11Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of overexpressed AR to inhibit ERα-dependent signaling in MCF-7 suggests that these transcription factors utilize a common pool of coactivators that are present in limiting cellular concentration. Here we evaluated the role of ARA70, previously identified as an AR specific coactivator (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 95: 5517-5521Crossref Scopus (530) Google Scholar), in the modulation of ERα signal by the AR.

Cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (serum-free medium), for 24 h before each experiment. Hormone stimulation was performed in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum to reduce the endogenous steroid concentration (19van der Burg B. Rutteman G.R.

Immunocytochemical Staining—Paraformaldehyde-fixed MCF-7 cells (2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min) were used for immunocytochemical staining. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide (3% in absolute methanol for 30 min), and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with normal horse serum (10% for 30 min). ARA70 immunostaining was then performed using as primary antibody a goat polyclonal antiserum (1:40, overnight at 4 °C), whereas a biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG (1–600, for 1 h at room temperature) was utilized as secondary antibody. Avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC complex/horseradish peroxidase complex) was applied (30 min), and the chromogen 3–3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride dihydrate was used as the detection system (5 min). TBS-T (0.05 m Tris-HCl plus 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.05% Triton X-100) served as washing buffer. The primary antibody was replaced by normal goat serum at the same concentration in control experiments on MCF-7 cultured cells. Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay—Total cellular RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells using Triazol reagent as suggested by the manufacturer. 2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using 200 IU of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase in a reaction volume of 20 μl (0.4 μg of oligo(dT), 0.5 mm deoxy-NTP, and 24 IU of RNasin) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by heat denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C. 2 μl of cDNA were then amplified with a pair of 5′ and 3′ 50-pmol primers for either ARA70, pS2, or 36B4 by using 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The primers used are as follows: ARA70: forward, 5′-AAGACCAGAGTGGCAGCTCCAGTAAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTAGCATGAGCCATCAAGTGCTCA-3′, to amplify a 520-bp fragment; pS2: forward, 5′-TTCTATCC-TAATACCATCGACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTGAGTAGTCAAAGTCAGAGC-3′, to amplify a 210-bp fragment; ribosomal RNA 36B4: forward, 5′-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3′, to amplify a 408-bp fragment. PCR amplification was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm each dNTP. The cycling conditions for ARA70 were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The cycling conditions for pS2 and 36B4 were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of PCR product were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To check out for the presence of DNA contamination, a reverse transcription-PCR was performed without Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (negative control). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 3 μm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifugation to remove the insoluble material. For Western blotting assay, 50 μg of the protein lysates were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated 1 h with 5% non fat dry milk in 0.2% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) at room temperature and then probed with an appropriate dilution of the various antibodies as indicated in the figure legends, followed by anti-goat or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Blots were developed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation assay, 500 μg of the protein lysates were incubated for 2 h with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, to avoid nonspecific binding. The supernatants were incubated overnight with 10 μl of anti-ARA70 and 500 μl of HNTG (IP) buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) for each. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with protein A/G-agarose. The beads containing bound proteins were washed three times by centrifugation in IP buffer, then denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot to identify the coprecipitating effector proteins. Immunoprecipitation with protein A/G alone was used as the negative control. Membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in glycine 0.2 m, pH 2.6, for 30 min at room temperature. Prior to reprobing with different primary antibodies, stripped membrane were washed extensively in TBS-T and placed in blocking buffer (TBS-T containing 5% milk) overnight. Transfection Assay—MCF-7 and HeLa cells were grown into 24-well plates. The medium was replaced with DMEM lacking phenol red as well as serum on the day of transfection, which was performed using the FuGENE 6 Reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. All transfection mixture contained 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid XETL. XETL was cotransfected alone or in combination with ERα and/or AR full-length, AR (Cys-574 → Arg), AR-(1–707), ARA70 expression plasmids. Empty vectors were used to ensure that DNA concentrations were constant in each transfection. In addition, to assess transfection efficiency, each DNA mixture contained 5 ng of pRL-TK-Luc, a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase. Upon transfection, the cells were shifted to serum-free medium for 6 h and then treated with 10–7 m E2 or 10–7 m DHT or left untreated for 18 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the dual luciferase assay system following the manufacturer's instructions. The firefly luciferase data for each sample were normalized on the basis of transfection efficiency measured by Renilla luciferase activity. For whole cell extracts, cells were plated on a 10-cm dish and transfected, using the FuGENE 6 reagent, with an appropriate amount of the various plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. Upon transfection cells were shifted to serum-free medium for 6 h and then treated with 10–7 m E2 or 10–7 m DHT or left untreated in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum for 48 h. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay samples, cells were grown in 150-mm plates and transfected, using the FuGENE 6 reagent, with an appropriate amount of the various plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. ChIP and Re-ChIP Assay—We followed the ChIP methodology described by Shang et al. (20Shang Y. Hu X. Di Renzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. MCF-7 cells were grown in 100-mm plates. 90% confluent cultures were shifted to serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with 10–7 m E2 for 45 min or were left untreated in serum-free medium. Following treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Next the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, collected, and resuspended in 200 μl of Lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1) and left on ice for 10 min. Then the cells were sonicated four times for 10 s at 30% of maximal power and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected and diluted in 1.3 ml of IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 16.7 mm NaCl) followed by immunoclearing with 80 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated for 12 h either with anti-ARA70 goat antibody or with normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the negative control. After that, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added, and precipitation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. After pelleting, precipitates were washed sequentially for 5 min with the following buffers: Wash A (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), Wash B (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and Wash C (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1), and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). The immune complexes were eluted with Elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The eluates were reverse cross-linked by heating at 65 °C for 12 h and digested with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. DNA was obtained by phenol and phenol/chloroform extractions. 2 μl of 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA were added to each sample, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol for 12 h at –20 °C and resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. 5 μl of each sample were used for PCR with the following pS2 promoter primers: upstream 5′-GATTACAGCGTGAGCCACTG-3′ and downstream 5′-TGGTCAAGCTACATGGAAGC-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C. The amplification products, obtained in 35 cycles, were analyzed in a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In Re-ChIP experiments, complexes were eluted by incubation for 30 min in Re-IP buffer (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl) and subjected again to the ChIP procedure, using anti-ERα antibody (F10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and normal mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for the negative control. Statistical Analysis—Each datum point represents the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance test using the STATPAC computer program. Prolonged Exposure to DHT Increases AR Content and Decreases ERα Expression in MCF-7 Cells—We demonstrated previously (9Andò S. De Amicis F. Rago V. Carpino A. Maggiolini M. Panno M.L. Lanzino M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 193: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that DHT inhibits both basal and estrogen-induced cell proliferation of a hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (9Andò S. De Amicis F. Rago V. Carpino A. Maggiolini M. Panno M.L. Lanzino M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 193: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The effect of DHT addition on AR and ERα content in MCF-7 cells was evaluated by a time course study (Fig. 1). An increase of endogenous AR protein expression, and a decrease in ERα content, can be observed after 6 h of androgen exposure, and it lasts until the 6th day of treatment. Both changes reflect alterations that would be expected following stimulation with the respective ligand (e.g. AR with DHT and ERα with estradiol). However, the use of DHT, which cannot be converted into estrogens by aromatase, suggests that the down-regulation of ERα, observed in such circumstances, is because of activation of the AR with its own ligand. ERα Transcriptional Activity Is Inhibited by Overexpressed AR—We investigated whether the down-regulatory effect of AR on estrogen signaling may be related not only to the induced reduction of the ERα content but also to a direct interference on ERα transcriptional machinery. The ability of AR to modulate ERα transcriptional activity was examined in MCF-7 cells, expressing endogenous ERα and AR, and HeLa cells, ectopically expressing the two steroid receptor proteins (Fig. 2). A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (XETL), containing an estrogen-responsive element (ERE) sequence upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter, was transiently transfected in MCF-7 (Fig. 2B) and HeLa cells expressing ectopic ERα (Fig. 2C) in the presence of an expression plasmid encoding the full-length AR. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with 10–7 m E2. After 18 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 2B, in MCF-7 cells the overexpression of AR decreased the E2-induced signal by about 60% when compared with hormone stimulated activity in the absence of exogenous AR. This effect was partially reversed by the addition of OHFl (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). To examine whether the effect of transfected AR on ERα-dependent transcription is because of its transactivation properties, luciferase gene expression was determined in MCF-7 and HeLa cells (expressing ectopic ERα) cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding an AR carrying a mutation (ARCys-574 → Arg) in the DNA binding domain (DBD), which disrupts the ability of the AR to bind to target DNA sequences. In these circumstances, there was no significant decrease in luciferase activity. By contrast, the inhibitory effect on the E2-induced signal is evident in cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a constitutively active mutant AR in which the LBD has been deleted (AR-(1–707)) (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, the addition of androgen receptor antagonist OHFl had no effect on the activity of the AR-(1–707) (data not shown). MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line Expresses the ARA70 Protein—The negative interference of AR on ERα transcriptional activity led us to explore whether shared cofactors might be involved in such inhibitory effect. In this concern, we investigated the role of the ARA70 reported to be decreased in breast and prostate cancer (21Gao X. Logie B.W. Nawadz Z. Mol. Cancer. 2002; 1: 1-7Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine the localization of the endogenous ARA70 protein in MCF-7 cells. Representative results of immunostaining experiments utilizing a polyclonal antibody to ARA70 are shown in Fig. 3A. In MCF-7 cells, immunoreactivity was observed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. No change in the intracellular distribution of ARA70 expression was observed at 24 h following treatment with 10–7 m DHT. Immunostaining was not observed in the cells processed without primary antibody. The expression of ARA70 in MCF-7 cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR using a combination of primers amplifying 520 bp of the N-terminal region of ARA70. The expected reverse transcription-PCR product was clearly detected as shown in Fig. 3B. Finally, we performed Western blotting analysis using an antibody against ARA70 protein. As shown in Fig. 3C, an immunoreactive 70-kDa band was detected either in absence or presence of 10–7 m E2 or DHT treatment. ARA70 Physically Interacts with ERα—To assess the possibility that endogenous ARA70 can interact with ERα in MCF-7 intact cells, coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out. Protein complexes associated with ARA70 were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-ARA70 antibody, and the precipitated proteins were then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ERα antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, a protein of 67 kDa corresponding to ERα was recognized both in the absence and presence of E2, with a stronger coprecipitation under treatment, demonstrating an interaction between endogenous ARA70 and ERα. Similar results were obtained when the coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed using an ERα antibody followed by Western blotting with ARA70 antibody (data not shown). This ERα/ARA70 association appears not to be specifically restricted to the breast cancer cells MCF-7 because similar results were obtained in HeLa cells transfected with an ARA70 expression plasmid in the absence or presence of ERα-expressing vector. A polyclonal anti-ARA70 antibody was employed for coimmunoprecipitation, and the resulting immune complexes were subjected to Western blotting analysis with ERα antibody. A 67-kDa protein corresponding to ERα was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both ARA70 and ERα but not from cells expressing ARA70 in the absence of ERα. ARA70 Stimulates ERα-mediated Transcription—Because the coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that ARA70 can interact with ERα in an E2-dependent manner, we were interested in determining whether such an interaction can affect ERα transcriptional activity. To test the possible role of ARA70 in modulating ERα-dependent transactivation, we performed transient transfection experiments in MCF-7 cells and HeLa cells expressing ectopic ERα. An estrogen-dependent reporter construct (XETL) was transfected into MCF-7 cells either in the absence or presence of an expression vector encoding ARA70. After transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with 10–7 m E2. After 18 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined. The result of such an experiment is shown in Fig. 4B. Under our experimental conditions in the absence of E2, the basal level of luciferase activity did not change, whereas in the presence of E2, XETL expression was increased by about 13 ± 0.9-fold. Ectopic expression of ARA70 increased E2-stimulated ERE-luciferase gene expression by ∼80% when compared with the hormone stimulated activity in the absence of exogenous ARA70. No increase in ERα transcriptional activity was observed when exogenous ARA70 was expressed in the absence of exogenous ligand. A similar pattern of results, but with a lesser level of stimulation by E2, was obtained when ERα and ARA70 expression plasmids were cotransfected in HeLa cells. These patterns are similar whether expressed in terms of absolute level of stimulated reporter gene activity or as fold induction of reporter gene activity. ERα-ARA70 Complex Binds the Promoter Region of the Estrogen Target Gene pS2 in MCF-7 Cells—After showing that ARA70 is able to modulate ERα transcriptional activity, to explore further whether the ERα-ARA70 interaction may be important in vivo, we next investigated the recruitment of ERα-ARA70 complex to the promoter of the well characterized estrogen-responsive target gene pS2, either in presence or absence of E2. MCF-7 cells were grown in the absence of estrogen for 24 h followed by either no treatment or treatment with saturating levels of E2 for 45 min. The status of the endogenous transcription complex present on the estrogen-responsive region of the pS2 promoter was determined by using ChIP assay. The presence of the specific promoter in the chromatin immunoprecipitates, obtained using an anti-ARA70 antibody, was analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the estrogen-responsive region of pS2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with E2 induced an increase in the occupancy b"

We report here that toxin A induces expression of COX-2 and secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured NCM460 human colonocytes and in human intestinal xenografts. This induction was blocked by SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, which also decreased the phosphorylation of MSK-1, CREB/ATF-1, and COX-2 promoter activity following toxin A stimulation. Gel shift assays indicated that CREB/ATF-1 was the major proteins binding to the COX-2-CRE. Moreover, colonocytes exposed to toxin A produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated p38 MAPK, MSK-1, and CREB/ATF-1, leading to subsequent COX-2 induction and PGE2 secretion. In intact mice, blockage of p38 MAPK inhibited toxin A-mediated induction of COX-2 in enterocytes as well as lamina propria cells, and significantly blocked the toxin A-induced ileal secretion of fluid and PGE2. Furthermore, a selective COX-2 inhibitor also diminished toxin A-associated ileal fluid and PGE2 secretion. The main signaling pathway for toxin A induction of human COX-2 involves ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK, MSK-1, CREB, and ATF-1.

We found that toxin A, but not toxin B, induced COX-2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels through ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), ATF-1, and CREB. We also demonstrate that a p38 inhibitor and a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduced toxin A-induced fluid and PGE2 secretion in vivo. C. difficile Toxin A—Toxin A and toxin B were purified from culture supernatants of C. difficile strain VPI 10463 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) using anion exchange chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography as previously described (13Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin.

The luciferase reporter constructs for human COX-2 were previously described (27Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). All plasmids were prepared using the Endo Free plasmid kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The polyclonal antibodies for IκB, COX-1, and COX-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phospho-p38, p38, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-ATF-2, ATF-2, phospho-CREB, CREB, and phospho-MSK1 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The MAPK/ERK kinase specific inhibitor, PD98059, the JAK inhibitor, AG490, the NF-κB inhibitor, 6-amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenylethylamino)quinazoline, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 and the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, were from Calbiochem. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), sodium formate, and 2,7-dichlorofluorescin-diacetate (DCFH-DA) were from Sigma. The human non-transformed colonocytes NCM460 and the culture medium M3D were obtained from INCELL Corp. (San Antonio, TX) (28Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44464-44471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NCM460 cells were cultivated in M3D media supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in air supplemented with 5% CO2. PGE2 and cAMP Measurements in Cultured Colonocytes—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the level of human PGE2 using the appropriate kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Colonocytes were plated 1 day prior to the experiment and then incubated with toxin A (3 nm) and/or the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (100 μm), or toxin B (20 nm). Conditioned medium was used for ELISA following the manufacturer's protocol. To measure intracellular cAMP, cells were initially treated with toxin A and lysed in 500 μl of HCl (0.1 n, 10 min). The suspension was centrifuged (4 min, 3,000 × g), and the supernatant was assayed for cAMP by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.5), and then lysed for 60 min on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations of the lysates were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and equal amounts of total protein were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies (1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin/in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (150 mm NaCl, 10 nm Tris at pH 8.0, 0.005% Tween 20 [TBST]), then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with TBST. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with LumiGlo reagent (New England Biolabs). Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—NCM460 cells were plated in 6-well plates (0.4 × 106 cells/well) and transfected with 1 μg of the human COX-2 promoter (27Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with 0.1 μg of the pRL-CMV plasmid containing the Renilla gene (Promega, Madison WI). One day after transfection, cells were incubated with toxin A (3 nm) and toxin B (20 nm) for 12 h, and firefly luciferase values were standardized to the Renilla values. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant by adding the empty vector for each transfection. All assays were performed in triplicate, and data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Measurement of ROS Generation—DCFH-DA is a non-polar compound, which enters the cell and is cleaved to form DCFH. Trapped DCFH is oxidized by oxygen free radicals to produce fluorescent DCF. NCM460 cells were preincubated on a 96-well microplate (2 × 103 cells per well) in M3D medium lacking serum for 1 h at 37 °Cinthe presence of 10 μm DCFH-DA. Cells were washed three times in pre-warmed PBS and then exposed to toxin A (3 nm). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by fluorospectroscan (Fluoroscan Ascent FL, Labsystems) using 485 nm excitation and 538 nm emission filters. DCF fluorescence was also measured by fluorescence microscopy. To avoid photo-oxidation of DCFH, fluorescent images were collected by a rapid scan (total scan time, 3 s). Five groups of 10–20 subconfluent cells were randomly selected for analysis from each sample. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The following sequences derived from the human COX-2 promoter containing the CRE was used: CRE-sense, 5′-AAACAGTCATTTCGTCACATGGGCTTG-3′; CRE-antisense, 5′-CAAGCCCATGTGACGAAATGACTGTTT-3′. Probes were annealed and 5′-overhangs were labeled by incorporation of [32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with T4 polynucleotide kinase. For gel shift assays, 2 μg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with a mixture containing 6 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mm EDTA, 125 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dIdC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 50 mg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin. Approximately 1 ng of labeled probe was added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for another 20 min. In antibody supershift experiments, mixtures were preincubated with various amounts of antibodies on ice for 1 h before the addition of probe. DNA·protein complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength Tris borate buffer, dried under vacuum, and visualized with a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was conducted according to Nakayama et al. (29Nakayama H. Yokoi H. Fujita J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 1hin20 μl of the reaction mixture containing mouse Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) primers. Thereafter, the resultant cDNA was amplified together with Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the specific sets of primers. The primers used were: human COX-2 (300 bp), 5′-ATGAGATTGTGGGAAAATTGCT-3′ (sense), 5′-GATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATC-3′ (antisense), and mouse COX-2 (333 bp), 5′-GCAAATCCTTGCTGTTCCAATC-3′ (sense) 5′-GGAGAAGGCTTCCCAGCTTTTG-3′ (antisense). β-Actin amplification was used as the control, respectively. PCR of each molecule was conducted with the optimal numbers of cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, optimal annealing temperature for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 3 min. The generated PCR products did not reach a saturable level with the determined optimal cycle numbers. The amplified PCR products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Effects of SB203580 and NS-398 on Toxin A-induced Secretion of PGE2 and Fluid and Immunohistochemistry for COX-2 in Mouse Intestine in Vivo—This study was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee (Boston, MA). CD1 male mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) weighing 30–35 g had free access to food and water in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were acclimated to these conditions at least 7 days before the experiment. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and ileal loops (3–4 cm) were prepared and injected with buffer alone or with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 hydrochloride (100 μg in water) and the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398 (1 mg/kg), in a volume of 200 μl. After 30 min, toxin A (10 μg in PBS) or PBS alone was injected intraluminally, and animals were sacrificed 2 h later by CO2. Ileal loop fluid was collected and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 15 min. Secretion of PGE2 was assayed in the supernatant with specific ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ileal loops were excised and weighed, and length was measured. Fluid secretion was expressed as the loop weight-to-length ratio (mg/cm). Ileal tissue samples were quick frozen for immunohistochemical analysis and for protein determination. Frozen intestinal sections were placed on Fisher Superfrost slides, fixed in 80% acetone at room temperature for 60 s, and air-dried. Before labeling, sections were rehydrated in PBS and incubated with 10% normal goat serum for 20 min. Sections were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti-COX-2 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, sc-1745-fluorescein isothiocyanate) (1:100) for 16 h. The slide was then counter-stained for 30 min in propidium iodide staining solution at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS. After final washing, slides were coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed on a fluorescence microscopy (MRC 1024, Bio-Rad). To confirm expression of COX-2 mRNA, tissue samples (100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a power homogenizer, total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR performed using a specific mouse COX-2 primer. Human Intestinal Xenografts—Human fetal intestine was obtained from Brigham and Woman's Hospital (Boston, MA) (mean age, 14.2 ± 1.6 weeks) after therapeutic abortion as previously described (30Savidge T.C. Morey A.L. Ferguson D.J.P. Fleming K.A. Shmakov A.N. Phillips A.D. Differentiation. 1995; 58: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Procurement and procedures involving xenografting of human fetal tissues into C.B.-17 SCID/SCID mice were performed with full approval from the Institutional Review Board. Fetal small intestine and colon were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and xeno-transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice. Twelve weeks after xenografting, the graft lumen was injected subcutaneously with 400 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 40 nm purified toxin A (n = 4) or medium control (n = 2). Mice were killed after 6 h, and the xenografts were excised. We isolated total proteins from these tissue and performed immunoassays with specific COX-2 antibody and loading control, β-actin antibody (Sigma). Induction of COX-2 by C. difficile Toxin A in Colonocytes— Because COX-2 has been associated with intestinal inflammation, monocyte infiltration, and prostaglandin production, we examined COX-2 expression levels and PGE2 synthesis in colonocytes exposed to purified toxin A (3 nm). Toxin A induced the expression of COX-2, but had no effect on the expression of COX-1 (Fig. 1A). This response was evident at 1–3 h and peaked at 6 h. Under basal conditions, we observed weak expression of COX-2 mRNA in cultured colonocytes. Toxin A also increased COX-2 mRNA in a time pattern that paralleled the COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 1B). The effect of toxin A on COX-2 protein levels was concentration-dependent between doses of 0.8 and 3 nm (Fig. 1C). Despite the close structural relationship between toxins A and B and their common enzymatic activity against rho proteins, toxin B at 20 nm showed no effect on COX-2 expression (Fig. 1D). Colonocytes were transiently transfected with a construct containing the nucleotide sequence from –1432 to +59 of the human COX-2 promoter and then treated with 1.5 and 3 nm of toxin A or with 10 and 20 nm of toxin B. Toxin A, but not toxin B, increased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Next, we examined whether toxin A induces prostaglandin E2 secretion in colonocytes and determined the COX-2 dependence of this response using the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. The basal concentration of secreted prostaglandin E2 was ∼17 pg/ml/2 × 106 cells (Fig. 1F). Toxin A increased PGE2 secretion by 2- to 3-fold at 6–12 h (Fig. 1F), which was completely blocked by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. As expected, toxin B did not induce PGE2 secretion up to 12 h (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that toxin A-mediated secretion of PGE2 in colonocytes required COX-2 induction. Toxin A Induction of COX-2 Expression in Human Intestinal Xenografts—To confirm the induction of COX-2 by toxin A in human intestine, we injected toxin A into the lumen of human intestinal xenografts growing subcutaneously in SCID mice. We previously reported (26Savidge T.C. Pan W.H. Newman P. O'Brien M. Anton P.M. Pothoulakis C. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that epithelial cells in the grafted intestine are exclusively of human origin and that injection of toxin A induces an acute inflammatory response, similar to that seen in animal models and in the colon of patients with C. difficile-associated colitis. We found no expression of COX-2 in control xenografts, but robust increases of COX-2 expression 6 h after toxin A exposure (Fig. 2), similar to the results observed in cultured colonocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). Phosphorylation of CREB, ATF-1, ATF-2, MSK-1, and p38 by Toxin A in Colonocytes—We next investigated toxin A-associated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its downstream transcription factors ATF-1, ATF-2, and CREB. Toxin A strongly increased the phosphorylation of p38, CREB, ATF-1, and ATF-2 after 1 and 3 h of exposure with return to basal levels at 6 h (Fig. 3A). Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1) is directly activated by p38 MAPK and may mediate activation of CREB, as shown in embryonal human kidney cells activated by growth factors and oxidative stress (31Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We therefore determined phosphorylation of threonine 581 of MSK-1 following toxin A stimulation. We observed phosphorylation of MSK-1 at 1 and 3 h after toxin A exposure, similar to the time course of CREB/ATF-1 phosphorylation. Because NF-κB, and ERK1/2 are known regulators of COX-2 expression (32Wu D. Marko M. Claycombe K. Paulson K.E. Meydani S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10983-10992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Jones M.K. Sasaki E. Halter F. Pai R. Nakamura T. Arakawa T. Kuroki T. Tarnawski A.S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2186-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we examined phosphorylation of IκB, and ERK1/2 in colonocytes exposed to toxin A. As shown in Fig. 3B, we did not observe phosphorylation of IκB and only slight phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Activation Pathways for COX-2 in Colonocytes Exposed to Toxin A—To define specific induction pathways of COX-2 by toxin A, we treated colonocytes with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the JAK1 (Janus tyrosine kinase 1) inhibitor AG490, the NF-κB inhibitor 6-amino-4-quinazoline, the ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059, and toxin A for 6 h. We found that inhibition of p38 by SB203580 completely prevented the expression of COX-2 by toxin A (Fig. 4A). None of the other inhibitors had any significant effect on toxin A-induced COX-2 expression, apart from the JAK1 inhibitor AG490, which slightly inhibited COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 4A). Similarly, only the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 reduced the secretion of PGE2 in supernatants (from 49 pg/ml/2 × 106 cells to 21 pg/ml/2 × 106 cells, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B), whereas, none of the other inhibitors exerted any significant effect at the doses used. Blockage of JAK1 by AG490 weekly inhibited toxin A-induced COX-2 protein (Fig. 4A), but failed to inhibit toxin A-mediated PGE2 secretion (Fig. 4B). In view of the lack of inhibition of COX-2 expression by the ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 4A) as well as by the weak phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by toxin A (Fig. 3B), we conclude that the ERK1/2 and JAK1 pathways are not significantly involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression by toxin A. We next examined the involvement of p38 MAPK on toxin A-induction of COX-2 mRNA. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, at 10 μm completely blocked the toxin A effect on COX-2 mRNA in colonocytes (Fig. 4C). Because weak expression of COX-2 mRNA was detected in basal condition of cultured colonocytes and previous studies report that p38 activation stabilizes COX-2 messenger RNA (34Mifflin R.C. Saada J.I.

Using a ′lacZ fusion to the ttgG promoter, we show that the most efficient in vivo inducers were 1-naphthol, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 4-nitrotoluene, benzonitrile, and indole. The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of different effector molecules to purified TtgV were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. For the majority of effectors, the interaction was enthalpy-driven and counterbalance by unfavorable entropy changes. The TtgV-effector dissociation constants were found to vary between 2 and 890 μm. There was a relationship between TtgV affinity for the different effectors and their potential to induce gene expression in vivo, indicating that the effector binding constant is a major determinant for efficient efflux pump gene expression. Equilibrium dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicated that a TtgV dimer binds one effector molecule. No evidence for the simultaneous binding of multiple effectors to TtgV was obtained. The binding of TtgV to a 63-bp DNA fragment containing its cognate operator was tight and entropy-driven (KD = 2.4 ± 0.35 nm, ΔH = 5.5 ± 0.04 kcal/mol).

Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E is a paradigm of solvent-tolerant microorganisms because it can grow in the presence of high concentrations of extremely toxic and harmful compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons (1Ramos J.L.

In P. putida DOT-T1E, the cooperative action of up to three efflux pumps, TtgABC, TtgDEF, and TtgGHI, is needed to achieve maximal tolerance against toluene, one of the most toxic aromatic hydrocarbons. TtgGHI appears to be the most important extrusion element since, in contrast to the other two efflux pumps, a knock-out mutant in which this efflux pump is not functional was not able to withstand a sudden 0.3% (v/v) toluene shock regardless of the growth conditions (14Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TtgGHI, like other multidrug-resistant pumps, possesses a broad substrate specificity reflected in its capacity to extrude not only aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylenes, or styrene but also aliphatic alcohols such as octanol, nonanol, and decanol, as well as antibiotics of different chemical structure, e.g. ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid (14Rojas A.

The ttgV gene is transcribed divergently from the ttgGHI operon, and the corresponding promoters, called PttgV and PttgG, overlap each other. The two start codons are separated by only 210 bp, 40 bp of which constitute the TtgV operator so that TtgV covers the -10 region of ttgG promoter and the -35 region of ttgV promoter (16Rojas A.

Furthermore, the binding of 1-naphthol, one of the most potent effectors, by free TtgV and the protein complexed to its operator DNA has been compared using ITC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Medium—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table I. Bacterial strains were grown in LB medium at 30 °C as described before (14Rojas A. Duque E. Mosqueda G. Golden G. Hurtado A. Ramos J.L. Segura A. J.

P. putida DOT-T1E (pANA96) was grown overnight on LB medium with tetracycline. Cultures were diluted to an initial OD660 of 0.05 in the same medium supplemented or not with the chemicals under study at 1 mm. These compounds were dissolved in Me2SO when needed (note that the latter did not interfere with the induction assays performed in this study). When cultures reached an OD660 of 0.9–1.0, β-galactosidase activity was determined in triplicate in permeabilized cells (19Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TtgV Expression and Purification—Plasmid pTGF2 was constructed by cloning a 784-bp NdeI-BamHI fragment bearing the ttgV open reading frame in the Kmr pET29a(+) plasmid (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes to allow the expression of the native TtgV protein. Plasmid pTGF2 was transformed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) cells. The cells were grown in two-liter conical flasks containing 500 ml of 2×YT culture medium with 50 μg/ml Km, incubated at 30 °C with shaking, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the turbidity of the culture was around 0.7. Then cultures were grown at 22 °C for 3 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 4000 × g). The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.2 m sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 40 min, the supernatant was loaded onto an S-cation column (16/10, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a sodium chloride gradient. The fraction containing TtgV was then dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, concentrated to 2 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) for gel filtration. The proteins were then concentrated to 4 mg/ml as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—A 228-bp DNA fragment containing the wild-type PttgG promoter was amplified by PCR from pGG1 using appropriate primers, isolated from agarose gels, and end-labeled with 32P as described before (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar, 20Terán W. Felipe A. Segura A.

About 1 nm labeled DNA (∼1.5 × 104 cpm) was incubated with the indicated amounts of purified TtgV for 10 min at 30 °C in 10 μl of TAPS binding buffer (50 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.0; 100 mm potassium acetate; 8 mm magnesium acetate; 27 mm ammonium acetate; 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyses were as described before (17Guazzaroni M.E. Terán W. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Single-round in Vitro Transcription Assays with Supercoiled Plasmid DNA—Reactions (20 μl) were performed in STA buffer (25 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, 10 mm KCl) containing 100 nm σ70-holoenzyme (Epicenter), 20 units of RNAsin (Promega), 0.1 mm GTP, and 10 nm supercoiled pTE103-PttgG DNA template (10Schnappinger D. Schubert P. Berens C. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6405-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C before the addition of the following elongation mixture: 0.1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP; 0.3 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (20 μCi/μl); and 100 μg/ml heparin. After incubation for a further 10 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by chilling to 4 °C, and the product was precipitated with 0.25 volumes of 10 m ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The pellets were washed with 80% (v/v) ethanol. Dried pellets were resuspended in 8 μl of water and 4 μl of formamide sequencing dye. Samples were submitted to electrophoresis using a 6.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gel. The results were analyzed using Personal FX equipment software (Bio-Rad).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Measurements were performed on a VP-Microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 30 °C. The protein was thoroughly dialyzed against 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Stock solutions of 1-naphthol, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, indole, and 4-nitrotoluene at a concentration of 500 mm were prepared in Me2SO and subsequently diluted with dialysis buffer to a final concentration of 0.3 mm (1-naphthol and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene), 1.5 mm (indole), and 1 mm (4-nitrotoluene). The appropriate amount of Me2SO (0.1%) was added to the protein sample in each assay. Solutions of benzonitrile (4 mm) and hexanol and toluene (5 mm) were directly prepared in dialysis buffer. All chemicals were manipulated in glass vessels, and effector samples were neither degassed nor filtered, to avoid evaporation or nonspecific binding. Each titration involved a single 2-μl injection and a series of 4-μl injections of effector molecules into the protein solution. For DNA binding studies, oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the TtgV operator were synthesized (5′-GGAATTCTCAAGAGTATCACATAATGCTACACTCTACCGCATTACGATTCAGCAACTGCAGAA-3′ and its corresponding complementary oligonucleotide). Annealing was carried out by mixing equimolar amounts (at a concentration of 60 μm) of each complementary oligonucleotide in 0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was incubated 95 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice and dialyzed in the buffer used for ITC studies. The mean enthalpies measured from injection of the ligand in the buffer were subtracted from raw titration data before data analysis with ORIGIN software (MicroCal). Titration curves were fitted by a nonlinear least squares method to a function for the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule (21Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). From the curve thus fitted, the parameters ΔH (reaction enthalpy), KA (binding constant, KA = 1/KD), and n (reaction stoichiometry) were determined. From the values of KA and ΔH, the change in free energy (ΔG) and in entropy (ΔS) were calculated with the equation: ΔG = -RT lnKA = Δ - TΔS, where R is the universal molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.Measurements of TtgV/Ligand Binding Ratio Using Equilibrium Dialysis Assays—Four samples of TtgV with different protein concentrations were dialyzed against protein buffer containing effectors using Slide-a-Lyzer (Pierce) equipment for 5 days at 4 °C with stirring to ensure equilibrium. The proteins inside the cassette were then denatured by incubating at 100 °C for 5 min to release the bound effectors into the buffer. The denatured proteins were then centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 × g. Ultraviolet light absorption at the appropriate wavelength was then measured in the supernatants that contained the effectors, and the effector concentrations were determined using the corresponding ϵ extinction coefficients. The concentration of protein-bound effectors was obtained after correction for the effector concentration in the buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (Pierce). The binding ratio and dissociation constant were obtained with the following equation: binding ratio = [protein bound]/[effectors bound], KD = [effectors free][protein free]/[effectors bound].RESULTSIn Vivo Effector Profile of TtgV—As an initial approach to the identification of the effectors recognized by TtgV, we used a PttgG::′lacZ fusion (pANA96) to measure β-galactosidase activity in P. putida DOT-T1E cells grown in the absence or in the presence of 1 mm compounds (Fig. 1). The basal level of expression from the ttgG promoter was 438 ± 34 Miller units, and expression increased up to 5-fold in response to 1 mm tested chemicals. The effectors that yielded the highest induction levels (4–5-fold increase) were two-ring aromatic compounds such as 1-naphthol, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, and indole and one-ring aromatic compounds such as benzonitrile and 4-nitrotoluene (Fig. 1). Other compounds such as alkylphenols, halogenated aromatic rings, and aliphatic and aromatic alcohols also behaved as effectors and increased expression from the PttgG promoter by at least 2-fold.In Vitro TtgV-Effector Interactions—Equilibrium dialysis experiments were carried out to shed light into the effector-TtgV stoichiometry. The results for the binding of 1-naphthol and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene to TtgV, as shown in Tables II and III, indicated that one effector molecule binds to the TtgV dimer. The apparent affinity for these molecules was in the low micromolar range. The thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of these two effectors as well as those of other effectors (biaromatic, monoaromatic compounds, and aliphatic alcohols) were subsequently determined by ITC at 30 °C. These effectors were chosen to cover the spectrum of chemically different compounds that behaved as inducers in vivo.Table IICharacterization of 1-naphthol binding to TtgV determined by equilibrium dialysis TtgV at the different concentrations given below were dialyzed against buffers containing effectors for 5 days at 4 °C with stirring to ensure equilibrium.

This was exemplified by the titration with 1-naphthol shown in Fig. 2 (left-hand panel). ITC data were analyzed using n fixed at 0.5 (one effector molecule/dimer) determined by equilibrium dialysis experiments (see above), and satisfactory curve fits were obtained. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters are shown in Table IV. For all tested effectors, with the exception of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, the binding was driven by favorable enthalpy changes and counterbalanced by unfavorable entropy changes (Table IV). In contrast, the thermodynamic mode of the binding of 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene was different from that of the other effectors. Binding gave rise to only very small exothermic heat changes and was thus driven by entropy changes. It should be noted that dissociation constants for the binding of naphthol and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene determined by ITC and equilibrium dialysis were very close (3.0 ± 0.15 and 2.2 ± 0.8 μm for 1-naphthol and 2.3 ± 0.42 and 1.2 ± 0.6 μm for 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, respectively). These two bi-aromatic compounds are clearly bound by TtgV with the highest affinity, which is also reflected in its superior in vivo efficiency (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Isothermal titration calorimetry data for the binding of 1-naphthol to TtgV (left-hand panel) and to TtgV saturated with a 63-bp DNA fragment containing the operator (right-hand panel).

Although benzonitrile and indole were shown to be efficient effectors in vivo, the affinity of TtgV for these two chemicals was lower (in the range of 50–70 μm) than for 1-naphthol. Substantially lower affinities were determined for toluene (KD = 118 μm) and 1-hexanol (KD = 892 μm), which may account for the relatively modest activity of these effectors in vivo. The nitro substitution of toluene at position 4 resulted in a substantial increase in ΔH (-6.3 to -14.9 kcal/mol) and an 8-fold increase in affinity (Table IV), which is in agreement with 4-nitrotoluene being a more efficient effector than toluene in vivo. This is compatible with a potential direct recognition of the nitro group at position 4 by TtgV since a nitro group at position 2 or 3 resulted in a less efficient effector.Different effectors have been shown to bind to different sites in the large binding pocket of the QacR protein (22Grkovic S.

Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether the effector binding pocket of TtgV can accommodate different molecules at a time. We carried out a series of sequential ITC experiments that involved the initial saturation of TtgV with a first effector followed by the titration with a second effector. In a first series of experiments, TtgV (6.4 μm) was saturated by the addition of aliquots of 300 μm 1-naphthol. This complex was titrated with 300 μm 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. In a second series of experiments, TtgV (6.7 μm) was saturated with 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and subsequently titrated with 1 mm benzonitrile. In both cases, heat changes were very small and corresponded to the competition of two effectors to a single site and not to the simultaneous binding of both effectors to the protein with a physiological relevant affinity (data not shown). We were thus unable to provide evidence for the simultaneous binding of multiple effectors to TtgV.ITC Binding Studies of 1-nNaphthol to the TtgV-DNA Complex—As stated above, TtgV exerts its biological function by an up-regulation of gene expression as a result of the effector-mediated dissociation of the regulatory protein from its operator. ITC experiments were carried out to study the interaction of 1-naphthol with the TtgV-DNA complex. Synthetic 63-bp oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the operator sequence protected by DNaseI footprint experiments were synthesized and annealed (see “Experimental Procedures”) (17Guazzaroni M.E. Terán W. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a first series of ITC assays, 8.1 μm TtgV was titrated with 10-μl aliquots of 32 μm DNA at 30 °C in STA buffer. Binding was entropy-driven (ΔH = 5.5 ± 0.04 kcal/mol, TΔS = 17.5 ± 0.09 kcal/mol) and very tight (KD = 2.4 ± 0.35 nm). Experiments were designed so that the protein concentration after saturation with DNA corresponded exactly to the protein concentration used for the titration of unliganded protein with 1-naphthol. After saturation, the TtgV-DNA complex was titrated with 1-naphthol in a similar fashion as the titration of the unliganded protein (Fig. 2, right-hand panel). The resulting heat changes corresponded to the binding of the effector to the protein and to the dissociation of the protein from DNA. Peaks were narrow, indicating that operator/TtgV dissociation occurred immediately upon effector binding by TtgV. After titration, the sample was subjected to EMSA, which demonstrated that protein has dissociated quantitatively from its target operator DNA (data not shown). In a control assay, free DNA at the same concentration as in the titration of the DNA-protein complex was titrated with 1-naphtho"

Here, we show that the parasite epimerase is a homodimer that can interconvert UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal but not UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. The epimerase was localized to the glycosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation, suggesting a novel compartmentalization of galactose metabolism in this organism. The epimerase is encoded by the TbGALE gene and procyclic form T. brucei single-allele knockouts, and conditional (tetracycline-inducible) null mutants were constructed. Under non-permissive conditions, conditional null mutant cultures ceased growth after 8 days and resumed growth after 15 days. The resumption of growth coincided with constitutive re-expression epimerase mRNA. These data show that galactose metabolism is essential for cell growth in procyclic form T. brucei. The epimerase is required for glycoprotein galactosylation. The major procyclic form glycoproteins, the procyclins., were analyzed in TbGALE single-allele knockouts and in the conditional null mutant after removal of tetracycline. The procyclins contain glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors with large poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine side chains. The single allele knockouts exhibited 30% reduction in procyclin galactose content. This example of haploid insufficiency suggests that epimerase levels are close to limiting in this life cycle stage. Similar analyses of the conditional null mutant 9 days after the removal of tetracycline showed that the procyclins were virtually galactose-free and greatly reduced in size. The parasites compensated, ultimately unsuccessfully, by expressing 10-fold more procyclin. The implications of these data with respect to the relative roles of procyclin polypeptide and carbohydrate are discussed.

The tsetse fly-transmitted protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is responsible for human sleeping sickness and the cattle disease Nagana in sub-Saharan Africa. The organism undergoes a complex life cycle between the mammalian host and the insect vector. The bloodstream (trypomastigote) form of the parasite lives in the blood, lymph, interstitial fluids and, ultimately, the cerebrospinal fluid of the host. It avoids the innate immune system of the host through the expression of a dense monolayer of 107 variant surface glycoprotein molecules, and it avoids specific immune responses through antigenic variation (1Cross G.A.M. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Vanhamme L. Pays E. McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Parasitol. Today. 2001; 17: 338-343Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, each parasite expresses only one of a repertoire of several hundred variant surface glycoprotein genes at a time. The bloodstream form parasites exist as dividing “slender” forms and non-dividing “stumpy” forms that are preadapted for survival in the tsetse fly. Following ingestion in a blood meal, the stumpy trypomastigote form differentiates into the dividing procyclic form that colonizes the tsetse midgut. The procyclic trypanosomes express a radically different cell surface coat made up of about 3 × 106 procyclin glycoproteins (3Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M.

GPEET and EP procyclins contain similar glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchors. These are the largest and most complex known and are characterized by the presence of large poly-disperse branched poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc)-containing side chains (with an average of about 8–12 repeats, depending on the preparation) that can terminate with α2–3-linked sialic acid residues (6Treumann A.

In vivo, the N termini of the procyclins are removed by tsetse fly gut proteases, and it is thought that the underlying (protease-resistant) anionic repeat units and associated GPI anchor side chains might protect the parasite from the approach tsetse fly gut hydrolases (19Acosta-Serrano A.

In this study, we describe the nature and subcellular location of T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase, an essential enzyme required for galactose metabolism in bloodstream form T. brucei (24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also describe the changes in the cell surface molecular architecture of procyclic form T. brucei when they undergo partial and complete galactose starvation by genetic manipulation. Cell Culture—Procyclic form T. brucei cells (strain 29:13; a gift from G. A. M. Cross), referred to herein as wild-type cells, were grown in SDM-79 medium (25Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection for the constitutively expressed T7RNAP and TETR genes, respectively. Bloodstream form T. brucei cells (strain 427, variant 221) were grown in HMI-9 medium (26Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as described in Ref. 24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. Gel Filtration and Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Recombinant T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase—Bacterial expression and purification of recombinant epimerase have been described previously (24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein (100 μg at 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR30 HPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted at 0.5 ml/min in PBS and monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and the presence of the epimerase in peak fractions was verified by SDS-PAGE. Molecular mass standards (cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; and thyroglobulin, 669 kDa) were run under the same conditions to calibrate the column. Recombinant T. brucei epimerase (1 mg/ml PBS) was analyzed by sedimentation velocity using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical Ultracentrifuge with an AN50-Ti rotor at 32,000 rpm at 20 °C. Absorbance data (72 scans at 280 nm) were collected and analyzed using the SEDFIT program (27Schuck P. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The epimerase was assumed to be globular, and its density was predicted from its amino acid composition. HPLC Assay of T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase—Epimerase reactions were performed with UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc, UDP-GalNAc, or UDP-GlcNAc (0.8 mm final concentration) for 16 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 8.7), 1 mm β-NAD+ containing 500 ng (2.95 mU) recombinant epimerase. Samples containing 10 nmol of sugar nucleotide from each reaction were loaded onto a Partisil P10 strong anion exchange column (25 × 0.46 cm; HiChrom) and analyzed under conditions that separate UDP-hexoses (28Schneider P. McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18332-18337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column was eluted at 1.5 ml/min with 5 mm Na2B4O7 for 2 min and then with a linear gradient to 200 mm Na2B4O7 over 40 min, held for 10 min. The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 262 nm. Standards of NAD+, UMP, UDP, UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc (10 nmol) were run under the same conditions to calibrate the system. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cultured procyclic form and bloodstream form T. brucei cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed and resuspended in ice-cold trypanosome dilution buffer (25 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 100 mm glucose) at a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. The parasites were air-dried on coverslips (13 mm) at room temperature, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in trypanosome dilution buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. After washing four times with PBS, fixed parasites were treated with 0.5% fish skin gelatin in PBS for 1 h to block nonspecific binding and incubated for 1 h with preimmune rabbit serum or rabbit antiserum (diluted 1/500 with 0.1% bovine serum albumen in PBS) raised against T. brucei glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or against recombinant T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase (24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The coverslips were washed six times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with Alexa 488 conjugated to anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1/500 with 0.1% bovine serum albumen in PBS. After six washes with PBS, specimens were mounted in Hydromount, and single optical sections were collected on a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope (alpha-Plan-Fluor x100). Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Bloodstream form T. brucei (strain 427, variant 117) were isolated from infected rats, purified over DEAE-cellulose (29Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and fractionated into large granular, small granular, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions according to Ref. 30Steiger R.F. Opperdoes F.R. Bontemps J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. Aliquots of these fractions (equivalent to 2.9 × 108 cells) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% NuPage (Invitrogen) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase and affinity-purified on immobilized recombinant UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.01 μg/ml antibody in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumen, washed three times with the same buffer, incubated 1 h with anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Scottish Antibody production Unit) diluted 1/5000 with the same buffer, washed three times, and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of TbGALE Single-allele Knock-out and Conditional Null Mutant Procyclic Form T. brucei Clones—Puromycin acetyl transferase (PAC) and blasticidin (BSR) antibiotic resistance genes were cloned into TbGALE-targeted gene replacement plasmids as described in Ref. 24Roper J.R.

The tetracycline-inducible expression plasmid (pLew100) containing the TbGALE open reading frame has been described previously (24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Linearized plasmids (10 μg) were introduced into mid-log (4–8 × 106 cells/ml) procyclic cells that had been washed and resuspended in cytomix (31van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) at 4 × 107 cells/ml, by electroporation at 1.7 kV (three pulses) using a BTX830 square-wave electroporator with a 630B shocking chamber and 0.4-cm gap cuvettes. Antibiotic selection (1 μg/ml for puromycin and 10 μg/ml for blasticidin) was added after overnight recovery in 10 ml of SDM-79. From this stock, aliquots of 2 ml were plated in each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate, and a series of doubling-dilutions in SDM-79 was made across the remaining rows. The remaining 2 ml was retained in a T10 flask and diluted 1:5 with SDM-79. Epimerase expression from the inducible pLew100 vector was maintained by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. To test whether TbGALE was essential, conditional epimerase-null cells were washed three times in medium without tetracycline, and cultures (with and without 1 μg/ml tetracycline) were inoculated at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were counted daily, and cultures were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml when densities were around 1 × 107 cells/ml. Southern and Northern Blotting—Genomic DNA for Southern blotting was prepared from 1–2 × 108 cells using DNAzol (Helena Biosciences). BSR, PAC, TbGALE, and TbGALE 5′-untranslated region probes were PCR-amplified, purified, dUTP-fluorescein-labeled by random priming (Gene Images Kit, Amersham Biosciences), and used to probe PstI digests of 5 μg of DNA. Total RNA for Northern blots was prepared using Qiagen RNeasy Midi kits. Samples of RNA (5 μg) were run on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled T. brucei TbGALE probe (Stratagene, Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit). The control β-tubulin probe was used after the TbGALE probe had decayed. Procyclin Extraction and Analysis by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Procyclins were extracted from batches of ∼5 × 107 cells, as described in Ref. 12Acosta-Serrano A. Cole R.N. Mehlert A. Lee M.G.

Aliquots of 9% butanol-extracted procyclins (from the equivalent of 3 × 107 cells) were freeze-dried and treated with 50 μl of ice-cold 50% aqueous hydrogen fluoride (aq.HF) for 24 h at 0 °C to cleave the GPI anchor ethanolamine-phosphate bond. After freeze-drying, aliquots equivalent to 3 × 106 cells were further treated with 50 μl of 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C for 20 min to cleave Asp-Pro bonds and remove N-glycosylated N termini. The samples were dried and redissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of each sample were mixed with 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by negative ion MALDI-TOF. Data collection was in linear mode on a Voyager-DE STR instrument. The accelerating voltage was 2500 V, and grid voltage was set at 94% with an extraction time delay of 700 ns. Data were collected manually at 100 shots/spectrum with the laser intensity set at 2500. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting of Procyclins—Procyclic form T. brucei cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and lysed by the addition of an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. Aliquots, from either total parasite lysates or butanol extracts, equivalent to 5 × 106 cells, were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in a semidry transfer apparatus at 40 mA for 1 h. In the case of the data in Fig. 7A, butanol extracts (2 × 107 cell equivalents) were submitted to mild trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, as described above, before Western blotting. After blocking overnight with 5% milk powder in PBS, the membranes were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 1 h with anti-EP-procyclin mouse monoclonal antibody 247 (5Richardson J.P. Beecroft R.P. Tolson D.L. Liu M.K. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma catalog number A2179) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. The membranes were washed four times with PBS and once with water and then incubated in 10 ml water containing one nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate detection tablet (Roche Applied Science) until bands developed. The membranes were rinsed with water and dried. GC-MS Composition Analyses of Procyclins—Samples of extracted procyclins (from 2 × 107 cells) were mixed with 200 pmol of scyllo-inositol internal standard and subjected (in triplicate) to total GPI quantification according to protocol A of Ref. 32MacRae J.I.

T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase Is a Dimer in Aqueous Solution—The purification and kinetic properties of recombinant T. brucei epimerase have been described previously (24Roper J.R. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5884-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine its oligomeric state, gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation of T. brucei recombinant epimerase were performed. The purified recombinant protein was applied to a calibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column. A major protein and enzyme activity peak corresponding to 85 kDa was observed (data not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation of the same material showed a main component of 79 kDa and a very minor component of 162 kDa (Fig. 1). These molecular masses are similar to those predicted for recombinant T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase homodimer (87 kDa) and homotetramer (174 kDa), respectively. We conclude that T. brucei epimerase is predominantly a homodimer in aqueous solution, consistent with x-ray crystallographic data (34Shaw M.P. Bond C.S. Roper J.R. Gourley D.G. Ferguson M.A. Hunter W.N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity of T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase— The recombinant enzyme was incubated with UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc, and the products were analyzed by strong anion exchange-HPLC in the presence of borate ions, a chromatographic system that allows resolution of UDP-Glc from UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc from UDP-GalNAc (28Schneider P. McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18332-18337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Roper J.R. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The HPLC profiles showed the interconversion of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the T. brucei enzyme was unable to interconvert UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc (Fig. 2, C and D). T. brucei UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase Is Located in the Glycosome—Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised to recombinant T. brucei epimerase and used to stain fixed bloodstream form and procyclic form T. brucei cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The punctate staining pattern throughout the cell body is similar to that observed using polyclonal rabbit antibodies to the glycosome marker enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3, C and D). Preimmune sera did not show immunoreactivity against fixed parasites (Fig. 3, E and F). These data suggest that the T. brucei epimerase is located in the glycosomes in both life cycle stages. This conclusion was supported by subcellular fractionation of bloodstream form parasites. The post-nuclear supernatant from mechanically disrupted trypanosomes was fractionated into a large granular (mitochondria-enriched), small granular (glycosome-enriched), microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi apparatus-enriched), and cytosolic fractions by differential centrifugation according to Ref. 30Steiger R.F. Opperdoes F.R. Bontemps J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. Aliquots of these fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with affinity-purified anti-UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase (Fig. 3G). The results clearly show that the UDP-Glc 4′-epimerase is located predominantly in the small granular, glycosome-enriched fraction. UDP-Glc 4′-Epimerase Is Essential for the Growth of Procyclic Form T. brucei—It was possible to replace one TbGALE allele in procyclic form T. brucei by homologous recombination with either PAC or BSR. However, several attempts to replace the second allele with the complementary drug resistance gene failed, suggesting that TbGALE might be an essential gene in procyclic form T. brucei. To investigate this, a conditional null mutant was created. A trypanosome cell line that constitutively expresses T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (TETR) protein under hygromycin and G418-neomycin selection, respectively, was used, and an ectopic epimerase gene was introduced into the trypanosome rDNA locus using the pLew100 expression vector (36Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Four conditional null mutant clones (TbGALETi ΔTbGALE::PAC/ΔTbGALE::BSR) were obtained, and Southern blots confirmed the replacement of both chromosomal TbGALE alleles with antibiotic resistance genes (Fig. 4). To test whether the TbGALE gene is essential, conditional null mutant cells were washed three times in medium without tetracycline, and cultures (with and without 1 μg/ml tetracycline) were inoculated. Cells were counted daily, and cultures were diluted when densities were around 1 × 107 cells/ml. In the presence of tetracycline, the cells continued to grow with normal (wild-type) kinetics (Fig. 5A), whereas in the absence of tetracycline, the cells grew normally for 8 days followed by a cessation of cell division and some cell death (Fig. 5B) unt"
https://openalex.org/W2019899535,"Many of the biological effects of nitric oxide are mediated by S-nitrosothiols. However, the mechanisms by which S-nitrosothiols transduce their activity across cell membranes are unclear. We show that the pathway responsible for the cellular effects of S-nitrosothiols is specific for S-nitrosocysteine (CSNO), is stereoselective, and requires direct uptake of intact l-CSNO. Transport is independent of extracellular sodium, competitively inhibited by leucine, and blocked by 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, a specific inhibitor of the system L amino acid transporter family. Other nitrosothiols such as S-nitrosoglutathione are not substrates for transport and require reaction with l-cysteine for activity. To show that system L family members mediate uptake, we expressed two members, LAT1 and LAT2, in Xenopus oocytes. Both LAT1 and LAT2, when co-expressed with 4F2 heavy chain, were found to efficiently transport l-CSNO. Mammalian cells were shown to express LAT1 and LAT2. A431 cells express both proteins, whereas T24 cells express only LAT1. Overexpression of LAT1 in T24 cells using recombinant adenoviruses led to increased uptake of l-CSNO, whereas knockdown using a specific small interfering RNA led to decreased uptake. These data definitively identify LAT1 and LAT2 as members of system L that mediate transmembrane movement of l-CSNO and suggest that system L family members are involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols. Many of the biological effects of nitric oxide are mediated by S-nitrosothiols. However, the mechanisms by which S-nitrosothiols transduce their activity across cell membranes are unclear. We show that the pathway responsible for the cellular effects of S-nitrosothiols is specific for S-nitrosocysteine (CSNO), is stereoselective, and requires direct uptake of intact l-CSNO.

Nitrosothiols including the low molecular weight nitrosothiols, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 1The abbreviations used are: GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; CSNO, S-nitrosocysteine; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; MTSES, sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate; MPB, N-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; LAT1, system L amino acid transporter 1; LAT2, system L amino acid transporter 2; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; NO, nitric oxide; BCH, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; CSNO, S-nitrosocysteine; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; MTSES, sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate; MPB, N-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; LAT1, system L amino acid transporter 1; LAT2, system L amino acid transporter 2; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; NO, nitric oxide; BCH, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase. and S-nitrosocysteine (CSNO), have been proposed to be important mediators of nitric oxide signaling (1Foster M.W.

The biological activity of these compounds resides in their ability to reversibly modify critical proteins in cell signaling pathways through targeted oxidation of cysteine thiols (1Foster M.W.

Although their biological activity is well established, the mechanisms by which they transduce their activity from the extracellular space to intracellular targets are largely unknown. Insight into pathways that may participate in the transfer of NO equivalents across cell membranes comes from experiments that show that nitrosothiols are not equivalent in their ability to alter signaling pathways. For example, CSNO but not GSNO or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenacillamine (SNAP) has been shown to modify protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C739-C749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in intact cells. Similarly, CSNO but not GSNO is able to transfer NO equivalents across red cell membranes, leading to the formation of intracellular GSNO and S-nitrosohemoglobin (7Tsikas D. Sandmann J. Rossa S. Gutzki F.M. Frolich J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The transfer of NO equivalents does not appear to involve NO release through the breakdown of nitrosothiols (1Foster M.W.

Rather it seems that transfer requires specific interactions with proteins since the bioactivity of low molecular weight thiols is known to be stereoselective and unrelated to chemical half-life (1Foster M.W.

Nature. 2001; 413: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For example, in the circulation, l-CSNO is a potent vasodilator, but d-CSNO is not (14Davisson R.L. Travis M.D. Bates J.N. Lewis S.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and in the central nervous system, l-CSNO rather than d-CSNO is important in regulating ventilatory signaling (13Lipton A.J. Johnson M.A. Macdonald T. Lieberman M.W. Gozal D. Gaston B. Nature. 2001; 413: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cells that possess γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, GSNO is only active following cleavage to S-nitrosocysteinylglycine (15Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M.E. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggest the existence of a stereoselective mechanism that is characterized either by a receptor-mediated process selective for l-CSNO or by selective transport of intact CSNO from outside to inside the cell. The involvement of a transporter is supported by data from our group and from others demonstrating that amino acids that competitively inhibit members of the system L amino acid transporter family block the biological activity of CSNO in intact cells (5Li S.

Both are sodium-independent exchangers with symmetrical extracellular and intracellular substrate specificities but greatly different extracellular (high) and intracellular (low) affinities (25Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 445: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Importantly, both have been reported to transport mercurial derivatives of cysteine (26Simmons-Willis T.A. Koh A.S. Clarkson T.W. Ballatori N. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated pathways used by exogenous nitrosothiols to modify cellular proteins. We report the existence of a transport mechanism that stereoselectively transports l-CSNO into cells and show that uptake activity is mediated by proteins that constitute system L amino acid transport. In addition, we provide definitive data that show that l-CSNO is a substrate for LAT1 and LAT2. These studies are important since they show that specific mechanisms exist for cellular responses to nitrosothiols and identify a novel pathway for movement of nitrosothiols into cells, where they can efficiently exert their biological effects. Materials—GSNO was synthesized as described previously (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CSNO was prepared by mixing cysteine hydrochloride (pH 2.5) and sodium nitrite at a molar ratio of 2:3 in water. Complete reaction was verified by UV absorption at 335 nm. SNAP was purchased form Alexis Biochemicals. [3H]leucine was from Amersham Biosciences, l-[35S]cysteine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, sodium 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) was from Toronto Research Chemicals, N-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) was from Molecular Probes, and N-ethyl maleimide, 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), α-(methylamino)isobutyrate, l-cysteine, d-cysteine, and sodium nitrite were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—A431 or T24 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (A431) or McCoy's 5a medium (T24) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To begin an experiment, confluent cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) buffered with 25 mm Hepes (HBSH, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C with various agents in HBSH for the indicated times. Determination of PTP1B Oxidation—PTP1B oxidation was determined using MPB as described previously (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSH and then scraped into RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 20 mm N-ethyl maleimide. After incubation on ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess N-ethyl maleimide. The eluate that contained cellular protein was treated with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min to reduce all oxidized thiols. Samples were reapplied to a PD-10 column to remove excess dithiothreitol, and the eluates were treated with 50 μm MPB. Excess MPB was removed by elution from a PD-10 column, and eluates were treated with 50 μm glutathione. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of PTP1B monoclonal antibody (Oncogene) by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation for 2 h with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and collected by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer, dissolved in 20 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerin, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 10% nonfat dried milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20), MPB-labeled PTP1B was visualized by incubation with 1:4000 dilution of NeutrAvidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (avidin-HRP, Molecular Probes) followed by incubation with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped using 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min, reprobed using rabbit polyclonal PTP1B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and visualized using anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by visualization with ECL Plus. Direct Measurement of Amino Acid Uptake—l-[35S]CSNO was prepared by mixing l-cysteine (30 μCi/μmol [35S]cysteine, pH 2.5) and sodium nitrite at a molar ratio of 2:3 in water. The resulting CSNO was neutralized by diluting the reaction mixture in HBSH. Cells were incubated with either l-[35S]CSNO or [3H]leucine (25 μCi/μmol) in HBSH at 37 °C, washed five times with ice-cold HBSH to remove extracellular radioactivity, and lysed into RIPA buffer with 1% SDS. Extracts collected after trichloroacetic acid precipitation produced identical results. Protein concentration was quantified by BCA assay (Pierce), and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Uptake was linear for at least 15 min. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed by oligo(dT) using an Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) at 37 °C for 60 min. A fragment of LAT1 (554 bp) was amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to the partial sequence from nucleotides 418 to 971 of human LAT1 (forward, 5′-ATC CGG CCT TCA TCG CAG TAC ATC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAC ATG ACG CCC AGG TGA TAG TTC-3′). A fragment of LAT2 (706 bp) was amplified using primers corresponding to the partial sequence from nucleotides 4 to 710 of human LAT2 (forward, 5′-GAA GAA GGA GCC AGG CAC CGA AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA GTG CGA CGA GGC CGA TGT CAG-3′). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light in the presence of ethidium bromide. Expression of System L in Xenopus Oocytes and Measurement of l-CSNO Uptake—Xenopus laevis ovarian lobes containing stage V or VI oocytes were purchased from Nasco. Oocytes were treated with collagenase A (2 mg/ml) for 30–50 min at room temperature in Ca2+-free medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) to remove the follicular layer and then maintained in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.6 at 18 °C. 4F2HC cDNA was obtained from human aortic smooth muscle cells by RT-PCR using the following primer pair: forward, 5′-TAA GGA TCC ATG AGC CAG GAC ACC GAG G-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAA GAA TTC TCA GGC CGC GTA GGG GAA-3′. Human LAT2 cDNA was obtained from A431 cells by RT-PCR using the following primer pair: forward, 5′-TA GGA TCC ATG GAA GAA GGA GCC AGG CAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TA GAA TTC GCC AGG GAA TGG TGG TCC TCA-3′. LAT1 cDNA was obtained as described below. The 4F2HC, LAT1, and LAT2 cDNAs were subcloned into WCV vector (a kind gift of Dr. Antonius M. J. VanDongen) under the control of the T7 promoter. Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, purified by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and injected (73.6 nl of cRNA, 200 ng/μl) into the defolliculated oocytes under a dissecting microscope with a micrometer-driven micropipetter. Pure water was injected as control. Two days following injection, oocytes were washed and then incubated in 500 μl of uptake buffer (100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 25 μm l-[35S]CSNO (30 μCi/μmol) with 1 mm MTSES for 15 min at room temperature. The oocytes were then washed five times with ice-cold uptake buffer, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Construction of Recombinant LAT1—Human LAT1 cDNA was obtained from A431 cells by RT-PCR using the following primer pair: forward, 5′-TAG GAT CCA TGG CTG GTG CGG GCC CGA AG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAG AAT TCC TAT GTC TCC TGG GGG ACC AC-3′. cDNA was subcloned into adenoviral shuttle vector pAdtrack-CMV (ATCC) and then transformed into BJ5183-AD-1 cells (Stratagene) by electroporation. The positive adenoviral recombinants were identified by sequencing and transfected to Ad-293 cells (Stratagene) using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated and titrated as described everywhere (27He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). Construction of Vector-based Small Interfering RNA to LAT1—An RNA polymerase III generated hairpin small RNA was used to knock down the expression of LAT1. Oligonucleotides containing sense and antisense 22-nt sequences (underlined) corresponding to nucleotides 1173–1194 of the LAT1 coding region were synthesized as follows: forward, 5′-AGC TTC CGG ACA TCT TCT CCG TCA TCA ACA AGC TTG TTG ATG ACG GAG AAG ATG TCC TTT TTA T-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGA TAA AAA GGA CAT CTT CTC CGT CAT CAA CAA GCT TGT TGA TGA CGG AGA AGA TGT CCG GA-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the linearized pGEM-T-U6 vector with the hairpin sequence under the control of the U6 promoter. The U6 promoter was amplified from Jurkat cells by RT-PCR using the following primer pair: forward, 5′-TA GTC GAC CCC CAG TGG AAA GAC GCG CAG GCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTT TTA TCG ATC CAA GCT TGT CCT TTC CAC AAG ATA TAT AA-3′. The RT-PCR product was inserted into pGEM-T vector (Promega) by T/A cloning, and the positive recombinants were linearized with HindIII and ClaI for ligation with the annealed oligonucleotides described above. The recombinant plasmid was then digested with SalI and NotI, and the fragment containing the U6 promoter and the hairpin sequence was subcloned into an adenoviral shuttle vector pAdtrack (ATCC). The viruses were prepared as above. All the constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Biological Activity of CSNO Is Stereoselective—We have previously shown that l-CSNO oxidatively inhibits PTP1B in intact cells, leading to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Because others have found that the activity of nitrosothiols is stereospecific, it seemed reasonable to propose that PTP1B oxidation is mediated by l-CSNO but not by d-CSNO. As shown in Fig. 1, when A431 cells were treated with freshly prepared l-CSNO or with an equimolar mixture of SNAP and l-cysteine, intracellular PTP1B was rapidly oxidized as indicated by increased labeling with MPB (upper panel). d-CSNO or the combination of SNAP plus d-cysteine were largely inactive. Consistent with previous studies (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), neither l-cysteine nor SNAP when used alone had any effect. In addition, cystine, NaNO2, or spermine NONOate (NO donor) were also inactive (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that l- and d-CSNO have similar half-lives, leading to the formation of cystine and NO. As l- and d-CSNO have such dramatically different abilities to modify PTP1B, these breakdown products are unlikely important. These findings demonstrate that the mechanism is stereoselective and strongly support our earlier conclusion that a specific transporter or protein receptor that is specific for l-CSNO is involved (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CSNO Is Taken Up Intact by Cells—To characterize the mechanism involved in movement of NO equivalents from the extracellular to intracellular space, we examined the effect of MTSES on PTP1B modification. MTSES is well known to rapidly alkylate free thiols but does not enter the cell. Only thiols in the medium or on the extracellular surface are available for modification, leaving intracellular thiols unaffected. The effect of MTSES on PTP1B oxidation was investigated by adding 10 mm MTSES to the medium bathing cells (Fig. 2A). MTSES had no effect on the ability of l-CSNO to oxidize PTP1B, demonstrating that free cell surface thiols are not involved in the bioactivity of l-CSNO and confirming that MTSES does not enter cells and modify PTP1B. The absolute requirement for l-CSNO was further demonstrated by studying the effect of GSNO in this model. We had previously shown that the incubation of cells with GSNO plus l-cysteine rapidly oxidizes PTP1B (5Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, when we added 0.25 mm l-cysteine to medium containing 10 mm MTSES followed immediately by the addition of 0.25 mm GSNO, we saw no PTP1B oxidation, suggesting that MTSES rapidly alkylates free thiols and prevents the formation of CSNO. This is in contrast with the pronounced PTP1B oxidation seen if l-cysteine and GSNO were mixed for 5 min at room temperature immediately prior to addition. Also, since MTSES would alkylate accessible cell surface thiols, it is unlikely that free thiols participate in a transnitrosation mechanism and suggests that movement of NO equivalents into cells occurs via transport of intact l-CSNO. In the following experiments, we investigated direct cellular uptake of l-CSNO. When A431 cells were treated with 25 μm l-[35S]cysteine, rapid uptake was seen (Fig. 2B). Co-incubation with 1 mm MTSES to alkylate free thiols blocked uptake of cysteine by 95%. The remaining 5% is likely nonspecific binding. These results show that MTSES effectively prevents uptake of cysteine and show that alkylated cysteine is not taken up. In similar studies, we prepared l-[35S]CSNO by mixing l-[35S]cysteine with NaNO2 at pH 2.5 followed by dilution into HBSH to neutralize the acid and give a final concentration of 25 μm CSNO on cells. Uptake of 35S-labeled l-CSNO was not different from uptake of l-[35S]cysteine under these conditions. Importantly, when co-incubated with MTSES, uptake of l-[35S]CSNO was largely unaffected. Because MTSES effectively blocks uptake of l-[35S]cysteine, uptake measured when cells are incubated with l-[35S]CSNO in the presence of MTSES represents transport of intact CSNO. Finally, the addition of MTSES did not alter [3H]leucine uptake, demonstrating that system L transport is not affected by this reagent. These results suggest that CSNO is taken up intact by cells. Direct uptake of intact CSNO was further shown in the following experiments in which we investigated the pH dependence of both CSNO formation and uptake. In these experiments, l-cysteine and NaNO2 were mixed at the pH indicated, and CSNO formation was determined spectrophotometrically at 335 nm. To measure uptake, l-[35S]cysteine and NaNO2 were mixed under the same conditions, diluted into HBSH (final pH = 7.4), and added to cells incubated in HBSH containing 1 mm MTSES. Because CSNO formation in solution when l-cysteine and NaNO2 are combined is pH-dependent (28Grossi L. Montevecchi P.C. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 8625-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), uptake measured using this approach should exhibit the same pH dependence. As expected, CSNO formation was nearly 100% reaction at pH < 3 (Fig. 2C). [35S]CSNO uptake showed similar pH dependence (Fig. 2D). In fact, the relationship between CSNO formation and uptake was linear throughout the entire range of pH tested (Fig. 2E), which confirms that CSNO specifically is the molecule responsible for the uptake observed. Cystine uptake is minimal in this model and is unaffected by MTSES (data not shown). Further, cystine is unlikely an important contributor to uptake of label since [35S]CSNO was prepared and immediately added to cells. Role of System L in Biological Effects of l-CSNO—Amino acid transporters were initially characterized based on their selectivity for a range of amino acids. In the case of system L, transport selectivity resides in two proteins, LAT1 (large neutral amino acid transporter) and LAT2 (both large and small neutral amino acid transporter) (21Uchino H.

https://openalex.org/W2061273744,"The coding region determinant-binding protein/insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein (CRD-BP/IMP1) is an RNA-binding protein specifically recognizing c-myc, leader 3' IGF-II and tau mRNAs, and the H19 RNA. CRD-BP/IMP1 is predominantly expressed in embryonal tissues but is de novo activated and/or overexpressed in various human neoplasias. To address the question of whether CRD-BP/IMP1 expression characterizes certain cell types displaying distinct proliferation and/or differentiation properties (i.e. stem cells), we isolated cell subpopulations from human bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and cord blood, all sources known to contain stem cells, and monitored for its expression. CRD-BP/IMP1 was detected only in cord blood-derived CD34(+) stem cells and not in any other cell type of either adult or cord blood origin. Adult BM CD34(+) cells cultured in the presence of 5'-azacytidine expressed de novo CRD-BP/IMP1, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may be responsible for its silencing in adult non-expressing cells. Furthermore, by applying the short interfering RNA methodology in MCF-7 cells, we observed, subsequent to knocking down CRD-BP/IMP1, decreased c-myc expression, increased IGF-II mRNA levels, and reduced cell proliferation rates. These data 1) suggest a normal role for CRD-BP/IMP1 in pluripotent stem cells with high renewal capacity, like the CB CD34(+) cells, 2) indicate that altered methylation may directly or indirectly affect its expression in adult cells, 3) imply that its de novo activation in cancer cells may affect the expression of c-Myc and insulin-like growth factor II, and 4) indicate that the inhibition of CRD-BP/IMP1 expression might affect cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1989483282,"Kinins are vasoactive oligopeptides generated upon proteolytic cleavage of low and high molecular weight kininogens by kallikreins. These peptides have a well established signaling role in inflammation and homeostasis. Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests that bradykinin and other kinins are stored in the central nervous system and may act as neuromediators in the control of nociceptive response. Here we show that the kinin-B2 receptor (B2BKR) is differentially expressed during in vitro neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. Following induction by retinoic acid, cells form embryonic bodies and then undergo neuronal differentiation, which is complete after 8 and 9 days. Immunochemical staining revealed that B2BKR protein expression was below detection limits in nondifferentiated P19 cells but increased during the course of neuronal differentiation and peaked on days 8 and 9. Measurement of [Ca2+]i in the absence and presence of bradykinin showed that most undifferentiated cells are unresponsive to bradykinin application, but following differentiation, P19 cells express high molecular weight neurofilaments, secrete bradykinin into the culture medium, and respond to bradykinin application with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. However, inhibition of B2BKR activity with HOE-140 during early differentiation led to a decrease in the size of embryonic bodies formed. Pretreatment of differentiating P19 cells with HOE-140 on day 5 resulted in a reduction of the calcium response induced by the cholinergic agonist carbamoylcholine and decreased expression levels of M1–M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, indicating crucial functions of the B2BKR during neuronal differentiation.

High molecular weight kininogens are precursors of BK, whereas low molecular weight kininogens give origin to kallidin. Along with other kinins, BK and kallidin elicit a wide range of physiological responses, being classically involved in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis and inflammation. As a matter of fact, altered function of the kallikrein-kinin system has been implicated in the development of various pathological conditions such as arthritis, pancreatitis, and asthma (for a review see Refs. 1Marceau F. Hess J.F. Bachvarov D.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 357-386PubMed Google Scholar and 2Calixto J.B. Cabrini D.A. Ferreira J. Campos M.M. Pain. 2000; 87: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence shows that kinins are stored in neuronal cells of the central nervous system and may act as neuromediators in various functions, including the control of nociceptive information (for a review see Ref. 3Bhoola K.D. Elson C.J. Dieppe P.A. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of kallikrein in developing rat brains (4Iwadate H. Kudo M. Kizuki K. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) supports the notion that kinin-induced receptor activity might be required during neuronal development. BK has also been shown to enhance the release of neurotransmitters such as noradrenalin and neuropeptide Y by sympathetic neurons, chromaffin cells, and pheochromocytoma cells (5Kansui Y. Fujii K. Goto K. Abe I. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Kurz T. Tolg R. Richardt G. J. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, BK implication in the control of calcium homeostasis has already been demonstrated in adult sensory neurons (9Thayer S.A. Perney T.M. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4089-4097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the biological actions of BK and kallidin are mediated by a serpentine receptor coupled to a G-protein, the kinin-B2 receptor (B2BKR), which is constitutively expressed and widely distributed throughout central and peripheral tissues under physiological conditions. However, there is evidence that expression of B2BKRs during development is regulated. For instance, B2BKR expression has been shown to be involved in the development of the urinary and cardiovascular systems (10El-Dahr S.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1997; 39: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Inhibition of B2BKR activity in rat embryos resulted in animals with disturbed kidney development (11El-Dahr S.S. Dipp S. Meleg-Smith S. Pinna-Parpaglia P. Madeddu P. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 14: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Besides being regulated during the ontogenesis of cardiovascular and urinary systems, a large set of evidence exists showing that modulation of B2 receptor expression and function also appears during neuronal development. Thus, it has been detected in central and peripheral noradrenergic neurons, in the spinal cord, in neuronal differentiating PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and in neuroblastoma and glia-derived cell lines (12Schelb V.

A cross-talk between the B2BKR and other hormone and neurotransmitter receptors involved in neuronal development and function has been reported, such as endothelin, serotonin, and purinergic receptors (19Chau L.Y. Lin T.A. Chang W.T. Chen C.H. Shue M.J. Hsu Y.S. Hu C.Y. Tsai W.H. Sun G.Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Reetz G. Reiser G. J.

P19 is an embryonic carcinoma cell line that has been extensively validated as a model of in vitro neuronal differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) induction (21McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M.

Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In these cells, other neuropeptide receptors such as the head activator receptor, the endothelin B receptor, and the substance P receptor are expressed during neuronal differentiation (23Niemann S. Schaller H.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 207: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Monge J.C. Stewart D.J. Cernacek P. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 1994; 58: 735-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways triggered by these receptors include transient increases in cytosolic-free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i by the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores and also induction of calcium influx from the extracellular environment. BK, acting via B2BKRs, also induces a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. The modulation of B2BKR expression during the neuronal differentiation of cultured P19 cells was investigated herein at the levels of mRNA transcription, protein expression, and activity. Moreover, we have examined high and low molecular weight kininogen gene expression as precursors of the B2BKR agonists BK and kallidin as well as secretion of BK by differentiating P19 cells into the culture medium. The influence of the B2BKR antagonist HOE-140 has been tested on early and late stages of neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. Materials—If not otherwise indicated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Neuronal Differentiation—P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cultilab, Campinas, Brazil), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate, in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. To induce neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, cell cultures were stimulated to form embryonic bodies (EBs) in bacterial grade Petri dishes by addition of 1 μm “all-trans”-RA at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in defined medium (26Pyle S.J. Roberts K.G. Reuhl K.R. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 103-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to avoid adhesion of the cell culture to plastic surfaces, dishes were coated with 0.2% agarose prior to cell plating. After 2 days, the EBs were plated in adherent culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with defined medium to allow neuronal maturation. In order to prevent the increase of the percentage of glial cells in cell cultures older than 8 days, cultures were treated on day 8 with 50 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside to allow survival of only post-mitotic neurons. Reverse Transcription and PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from undifferentiated P19, EBs, and differentiated P19 neurons in different time periods. Integrity of the isolated RNA was assessed by separation on a 1% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Contaminating DNA was removed using DNase I (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at a concentration of 1 unit/μg RNA in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl for 15 min at 25 °C. Five μg of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis in a total volume of 20 μl in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 50 ng of random primers with 200 units of RevertAid™ H Minus Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Fermentas Inc, Hanover, MD) for 50 min at 42 °C. For PCR amplifications, 5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction were used as a template. PCRs were performed in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 20 μm each reverse and forward primers, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Primer sequences for amplification of B2BKR, β-actin, M1–M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), and high and low molecular weight kininogen cDNAs are listed in Table I.Table IPrimer sequences used for PCR amplificationsGeneGenBank™ accession no.PrimerSequencebpB2BKRNM009747Forward5′-ATCCTCACTCCTCTTTGTC-3′Reverse5′-GGTCCTGAACACCAACATGG-3′627β-ActinNM007393Forward5′-AGGAAGAGGATGCGGCAGTGG-3′Reverse5′-CGAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAG-3′535M1 AChRNM007698Forward5′-CAGTCCCAACATCACCGTCTT-3′Reverse5′-GAGAACGAAGGAAACCAACCAC-3′441M2 AChRAF264049Forward5′-TGTCTCCCAGTCTAGTGCAAGG-3′Reverse5′-CATTCTGACCTGACGATCCAAC-3′369M3 AChRAF264050Forward5′-GTACAACCTCGCCTTTGTTTCC-3′Reverse5′-GACAAGGATGTTGCCGATG-3′245Kininogen 1AY462056Forward5′-GCCAACTTCTCACAGAGCTGTAC-3′AY462057AY462058AY462059Reverse5′-CATTTGTGAAGCTACCTAGG-3′4007521000Kininogen 2AY462056Forward5′-GCATTAGATAAGACTATTCC-3′AY462057AY462058AY462059Reverse5′-CATTTGTGAAGCTACCTAGG-3′235400854Kininogen LAY462056Forward5′-GCATTAGATAAGACTATTCC-3′AY462057AY462059Reverse5′-TCCCTCTGGGTCATTGCTGG-3′214 Open table in a new tab For B2BKR cDNA amplification, the reaction was cycled 35 times (95 °C for 45 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 105 s) plus a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The 627-bp PCR product was gel-purified and DNA sequenced and confirmed to be identical to mouse B2BKR cDNA. For M1–M3 mAChR and β-actin cDNA amplification, cycling conditions for PCR were 10 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 62 °C, 30 s at 73 °C, followed by a final step for 7 min at 73 °C. PCR conditions for amplification of kininogen cDNAs were one initial cycle for 3 min at 94 °C, 36 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, 45 s at 72 °C, and a final elongation cycle for 5 min at 72 °C (27Cardoso C.C. Garrett T. Cayla C. Meneton P. Pesquero J.B. Bader M. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PCR products were sequenced and confirmed as high and low molecular weight kininogen cDNAs. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV illumination, and verified for their expected size (see Table I). The gel was scanned, and the band intensity was measured by densitometry (TINA software, Covance, North Yorkshire, UK). Variations in cDNA concentrations were normalized with β-actin as an internal control, which is a constitutively expressed gene. Relative mRNA transcription was quantified as the x-fold increase of obtained densitometry values over threshold background levels. Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed in order to quantify B2BKR mRNA transcription in embryonal P19 cells and P19 cells undergoing neuronal differentiation. Total RNAs (750 ng) were reverse-transcribed to cDNA as detailed above. The reaction product was amplified by real time PCR on the 7000 Sequence Detection System (ABI Prism, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the Taqman PCR core reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The thermal cycling conditions composed an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 10 min and 50 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Experiments were performed in triplicates for each data point. B2BKR mRNA abundance was quantified as a relative value compared with an internal reference, β-actin, whose abundance was believed not to change between the varying experimental conditions (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Primers used for real time PCR are as follows: murine B2BKR (GenBank™ accession number NM009747), forward primer 5′-CCCTTCCTCTGGGTCCTCTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAAGAACACGCTGAGGACAAAGA-3′; 6-FAM probe, 5′-CCGCACTGGAGAAC-3′; murine β-actin (GenBank™ accession number NM007393) forward primer 5′-CTGGCCTCACTGTCCACCTT-3′ and reverse primer CGGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTT-3′; 6-FAM probe, 5′-CTGATCCACATCTGCT-3′. Quantitative values for B2BKR and β-actin mRNA transcription were obtained from the threshold cycle number where the increase in the signal associated with an exponential growth of PCR products begins to be detected. Melting curves were generated at the end of every run to ensure product uniformity. The data were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. B2BKR mRNA of undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells was quantified as follows. The relative target gene expression level was normalized on the basis of β-actin expression as an endogenous RNA control. ΔCt values of the samples were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of B2BKR mRNA from the average Ct value of the internal control β-actin. Immunochemical Staining and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—For immunofluorescence detection undifferentiated P19 cells or EBs recovered after 48 h of induction to differentiation with retinoic acid were seeded (2.5 × 105 cells/ml) in chamber slides containing eight wells (Lab-Tek®, Naperville, IL). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at 25 °C. For blocking of unspecific binding of the antibody, cells were incubated for 2 h with nonfat-milk (2%) containing 0.01% saponin and 2% rabbit serum. Then, the cells were incubated either with anti-NF200 rabbit (1:150) (Sigma), anti-β-III-tubulin rabbit (1:100) (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA), or anti-B2BKR goat antibodies (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). The slides were washed three times for 2 min each with 500 μl of nonfat-milk (2%) containing 0.01% saponin and 2% rabbit serum, and were then incubated with anti-goat IgG-Alexa-Fluor 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to detect NF-200 expression, with anti-goat IgG-Cy5 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-goat IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for detection of B2BKR, or with anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 (Abcam) for detection of β-III-tubulin for 30 min at room temperature (at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Counterstaining of cell nuclei was done with 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Following washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on the slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and slides were examined using the Leica Owin program (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) and a ADIMEC MX12P camera coupled to a Optiphot-2 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to determine whether the B2BKR and NF-200 are expressed by the same cells. Double-immunofluorescence staining against the B2BKR and NF-200 was done as detailed above. Cells were observed under an inverted laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens. The Alexa-Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) was excited by using a 488-nm argon laser and NF-200 immunofluorescence emission was detected with a 515–540-nm bandpass filter. Cy5 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) fluorescence was excited at 647 nm using the helium-neon laser, separated from the argon laser line by a FT 510 beam splitter. B2BKR immunofluorescence emission above 655 nm was collected using a long pass filter (RG 665). Control experiments were conducted to exclude any unspecific fluorescence emission. Instead of double-excitation at 488 nm and 647 nm, the absence of fluorescence emission above 655 nm following excitation at 488 nm was verified. No fluorescence emission above 665 nm was detected when only NF-200 immunofluorescence had been excited (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—Partially purified membranes of P19 embryonic cells and EBs following induction to neuronal differentiation were prepared by cell sonication and differential centrifugation. One hundred million cells were collected from culture dishes, washed three times in PBS containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and sonicated on ice until at least 95% of the cells were lysed. The cell extract was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min and 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The obtained plasma membranes were washed twice with PBS containing protease inhibitors and then resuspended in SDS-loading buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml protein. For Western blotting, membrane proteins (40 μg) and molecular weight markers were denatured by boiling for 5 min and then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE according to the Laemmli method (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The proteins separated on the gel were electrophoretically transferred at 400 mA for 80 min onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Transblot, 0.45 μm, Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceau solution in order to verify the transfer of the proteins and to localize the migration of the molecular weight markers. The nitrocellulose membrane was destained and blocked for 2 h with Tris-buffered saline with 0.03% Tween (TBS-T) containing 3% nonfat milk prior to the addition of a 1:200 dilution of a goat polyclonal anti-B2BKR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following 14 h of incubation with the primary antibody at 4 °C, the membrane was washed three times for 15 min with TBS-T. The membrane was blocked again for 30 min with TBS-T containing 3% nonfat milk and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:1,000 dilution of a secondary anti-goat IgG antibody. The labeled proteins were detected by using the Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Quantification of BK in Culture Medium from Differentiating P19 Cells by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—Cell culture supernatants from P19 cells from days 0 to 7 following induction to differentiation were used for quantification of BK concentration as described elsewhere (30Casarini D.E. Boim M.A. Stella R.C. Schor N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F66-F74PubMed Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors were added immediately following collection of culture supernatants to final concentrations of 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, 1.5 mm o-phenanthroline, and 1 μm pepstatin. Cell culture supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use. For BK extraction, 2 ml of cell culture supernatant were loaded on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), which had been equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% H3PO4. The cartridges were eluted with 3 ml of 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% H3PO4. The pre-purified extracts were dried in a Speedvac concentrator (Boc Edwards, Wil-mington, MA), resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1% H3PO4 containing 5% acetonitrile (phase A), and then used for HPLC. For chromatographic identification and quantification of BK, 100 μl of the extracted sample was injected into an HPLC system (Milton Roy, Ivyland, PA), and the separation was performed through a reverse-phase RP18 Brownlee column (4.6 × 250 mm, Millipore, Billerica, MA) equilibrated with 0.1% H3PO4 containing 5% acetonitrile (phase A). After 5 min of isocratic elution, peptides were eluted with a 0–35% linear gradient (v/v) of 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% H3PO4 (phase B) developed for 20 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. BK was identified by elution position and quantified by peak area integration using synthetic BK as a standard. Calcium Measurements in Single Cells by Confocal Microscopy— Measurements of [Ca2+]i in undifferentiated and neuronal differentiated P19 (embryonic carcinoma) cells on days 7 and 8 following induction with RA were performed by using LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Two hundred fifty thousand cells were seeded and allowed to attach on cover slides in p60-mm culture dishes (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) 48 h before the measurements. Cells were loaded with 4 μm fluo-3AM (Sigma) in 0.5% Me2SO and 0.1% of the nonionic surfactant pluronic acid F-127 for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and transferred to defined medium. Fluo-3AM fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and fluorescence was measured at 515 nm using a bandpass filter. [Ca2+]i of undifferentiated cells was measured for 10 s. Then 1 μm BK or 1.5 mm carbamoylcholine (CCh) was added, and changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored for a further 2 min. Images were collected every 1.5 s. At the end of each experiment, 5 μm ionophore (4-Br-A23187) followed by 10 mm EGTA were used to determine maximal (Fmax) and minimal (Fmin) fluorescence values, respectively. The experimental intracellular calcium concentrations from relative fluorescence values (F) obtained upon BK addition were calculated using the following formula: [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), assuming a 450 nm Kd for fluo-3AM (31Hallett M.B. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 115-150Google Scholar). Concentrations were calculated for cell populations containing at least each 10 cells. Treatment of P19 Cells with HOE-140 at the Initial Stage of Differentiation—P19 cells at a density of 105 cells/ml were seeded in nonadherent cell culture dishes and treated with RA (1 μm) and increasing concentrations (0–1 μm) of the B2BKR antagonist HOE-140 (32Hock F.J. Wirth K. Albus U. Linz W. Alpermann H.G. Anagnostopoulos H. Henke S. Breipohl G. Konig W. Knolle J. Scholkens B.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 774-777Google Scholar) at intervals of 24 h. After 48 h, 30 randomly chosen areas of each cell culture dish were photographed, and the sizes of EBs were measured and compared with EBs of cell cultures that had been kept in the absence of HOE-140. Treatment of P19 Cells in Later Differentiation (Days 5–8) with HOE-140 —For determining the effect of B2BKR inhibition on expression of mAChRs, 1 μm HOE-140 was added to the cells on day 5 following induction to differentiation and applied again at intervals of 24 h. Control reactions were set up in the absence of HOE-140. On day 8, total RNA was isolated from the cell cultures, and M1, M2, and M3 mAChR mRNA transcription was quantified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as detailed above. For evaluation of HOE-140 (1 μm) pretreatment on day 5 on cholinergic signal transmission at days 7 and 8, HOE-140 was removed from the cell culture 6 h prior to calcium measurements, by medium change and washing the cell layers twice. Control cultures in absence of HOE-140 were treated the same way. Lys-des-Arg9-Leu8-BK, a kinin-B1 receptor antagonist, which does not bind to the B2BKR (33Regoli D. Nsa Allogho S. Rizzi A. Gobeil F.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), was used as control at 1 μm concentration to confirm the specificity of HOE-140 action. Determination of the Participation of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor in Carbamoylcholine-induced Changes in [Ca2+]i—For studying muscarinic receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization upon carbamoylcholine stimulation, P19 cells on day 8 of neuronal differentiation were pretreated for 30 min with 180 ng/ml thapsigargin prior to calcium measurements in order to deplete the intracellular calcium stores and inhibit muscarinic receptor-induced calcium mobilization. Expression of B2BKRs and Neuron-specific Proteins during RA-induced Differentiation of P19 Cells—Murine P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were induced to the neuroectodermal differentiation by culturing free floating EBs in defined medium containing 1 μm RA (26Pyle S.J. Roberts K.G. Reuhl K.R. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 103-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). After 2 days, EBs were plated into tissue culture flasks, whereupon extensive morphological differentiation occurred after RA treatment (Fig. 1C). After 7 days, cells with neuron-like morphology appeared (Fig. 1D), reaching maximum expression levels of neuron-specific proteins after 7–9 days as detected by staining with antisera against NF-200 (Fig. 1E) and β-III-tubulin (Fig. 1F). In order to avoid contamination of elder P19 neuron cell cultures with glial cells that start to appear on day 8 after induction to neuronal stimulation (23Niemann S. Schaller H.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 207: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), cells were treated on day 8 with the DNA synthesis inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (50 μg/ml) that eliminates glial cells in proliferation but not differentiated post-mitotic neurons. P19 undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells and EBs express the B2BKR, a"

We report here the primary sequence determination and the analysis of the crystal structure of the 1,2-HQD from Nocardioides simplex 3E solved at 1.75 Å resolution using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion of the two catalytic irons (1 Fe/293 amino acids).

Hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene) (HQ) 1The abbreviations used are: HQ, hydroxyquinol; 1,2-CCD, chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase; 5CHQ, 5-chlorohydroxyquinol; 6CHQ, 6-chlorohydroxyquinol; 1,2-CHQD, chlorohydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase; 1,2-CTD, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; 1,2-HQD, hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; 3,4-PCD, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase. is one of the central intermediates in the degradation of a large variety of aromatic compounds. It has been detected in the breakdown of 4-hydroxybenzoate, resorcinol, salicylate, vanillate, benzoate, protocatechuate, and gentisate, by fungi such as Trichosporon cutaneum or Phanerochaete chrysosporium (1Sze I.S. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 353-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rieble S. Joshi D.K. Gold M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4838-4844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Anderson J.J. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 534-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria HQ has been identified as an intermediate in the degradation of mononuclear hydroxyaromatic compounds such as resorcinol and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (4Chapman P.J. Ribbons D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 975-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stolz A. Knackmuss H.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) or amino-hydroxyaromatic compounds such as 4-aminophenol (6Takenaka S. Okugawa S. Kadowaki M. Murakami S. Aoki K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 5410-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as in the degradation of hydroxylated biaryl ethers such as 2-hydroxydibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-hydroxydibenzofuran (7Armengaud J. Timmis K.N. Wittich R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HQ also occurs in the catabolic pathways of aromatic compounds carrying nitro groups such as in 3- and 4-nitrophenol or as 4-nitrocatechol (8Chauhan A. Samanta S.K. Jain R.K. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2000; 88: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Chauhan A. Chakraborti A.K. Jain R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biodegradation. 1996; 7: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HQ and its chloro-substituted derivatives 5-chlorohydroxyquinol (5CHQ) and 6-chlorohydroxyquinol (6CHQ) play an especially important role in the bacterial degradation of phenols or phenoxyacetates carrying a chloro-substituent in para position to the OH or OCH2COO– group, respectively. Thus, pentachlorophenol by rhodococci and mycobacteria has been reported to be degraded via HQ (13Apajalahti J.H. Salkinoja-Salonen M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5125-5130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Uotila J.S. Kitunen V.H. Coote T. Saastamoinen T. Salkinoja-Salonen M. Apajalahti J.H.

Saastamoinen T. Coote T. Häggblom M.M. Salkinoja-Salonen M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5669-5675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in Sphingobium chlorophenolicum (Sphingomonas chlorophenolica) already the 2,6-dichloroquinol appears to be subject to ring cleavage and, in contrast to earlier reports, no 6CHQ is formed (17Xun L. Bohuslavek J. Cai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the contrary, for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol breakdown 6CHQ has been suggested as an intermediate for Streptomyces rochei 303 as well as several Gram-negative bacteria (18Golovleva L.A. Zaborina O. Pertsova R. Baskunov B. Schurukhin Y. Kuzmin S. Biodegradation. 1992; 2: 201-208Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Kiyohara H. Hatta T. Ogawa Y. Kakuda T. Yokoyama H. Takizawa N. Appl. Environ.

In 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate degradation by Burkolderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia AC1100 5CHQ and HQ are formed sequentially as intermediates (25Daubaras D.L. Saido K. Chakrabarty A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4276-4279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although 3,5-dichlorohydroxyquinol was found to be an intermediate of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate degradation by Nocardioides simplex 3E, HQ may also be involved as a ring cleavage substrate (26Kozyreva L.P. Shurukhin I. Finkelshtein Z.I. Baskunov B. Golovleva L.A. Microbiology (translation of Mikrobiologiya). 1993; 62: 78-85Google Scholar, 27Solyanikova I.P. Protopopova Y.Y. Travkin V. Golovleva L.A. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 461-466Google Scholar). HQs are degraded aerobically by specialized intradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenases; the most studied enzymes from this family are the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases (3.4-PCDs), the catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (1,2-CTDs), and the chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenases (1,2-CCDs) which generally possess distinctive substrate specificities (28Lange S.J. Que Jr., L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases (1,2-HQDs hereafter) catalyze the intradiol cleavage of hydroxyquinols to form 3-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconates, which occur in solution in the keto form, i.e. as maleylacetate (Scheme 1) (29Pieper D.H. Pollmann K. Nikodem P. Gonzalez B. Wray V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1466-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several 1,2-HQDs have been purified and characterized from a variety of microorganisms such as Gram-negative bacteria (B. cepacia AC1100, Azotobacter sp. GP1, Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602, Burkholderia sp. strain AK-5), Gram-positive bacteria (S. rochei 303, N. simplex 3E, Arthrobacter sp. strain BA-5-17) and also from fungi (T. cutaneum, P. chrysosporium), but very little is known about the factors controlling substrate specificity for this novel group of intradiol dioxygenases (1Sze I.S.

Jadan A.P. Briganti F. Scozzafava A. Golovleva L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies showed that in the native enzyme as well as in the enzyme-substrate complex, the iron is pentacoordinated, with an average Fe-L distance of 1.93 Å and that histidines are present in the metal coordination sphere (2Rieble S.

Because 1,2-HQDs on one hand and (chloro)catechol dioxygenases on the other belong to different catabolic pathways, and correspondingly, the respective genes belong to different operons, the development of HQD substrate specificity was a very important step in the evolution of pathways for the efficient biodegradation of natural aromatic compounds as well as of xenobiotics. The analysis of the first crystal structure of a 1,2-HQD from N. simplex 3E (hereafter Ns 1,2-HQD), an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of HQ with markedly high selectivity (30Travkin V.M. Jadan A.P. Briganti F. Scozzafava A. Golovleva L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), could shed some light on the structural factors governing substrate specificity in a group of enzymes that catalyze key reactions in the biodegradation of toxic compounds. Strain, Protein Preparation, and Sequencing of N Terminus and Peptides—Growth of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid utilizing strain N. simplex 3E with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as an alternative carbon source has been reported previously (44Golovleva L.A. Pertsova R.N. Evtushenko L.I. Baskunov B.P. Biodegradation. 1990; 1: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 1,2-HQD from N. simplex 3E was purified as reported previously (30Travkin V.M. Jadan A.P. Briganti F. Scozzafava A. Golovleva L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were isolated as described for other enzymes (45Eulberg D.

Sequencing of the N terminus and of tryptic peptides was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 473A sequencer. Cloning and Sequencing of the 1,2-HQD Gene—General methods for isolation and manipulation of DNA and cultivation of Escherichia coli cells were as reported previously (47Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). pBluescript II SK(+) obtained from Stratagene was used as general cloning vector, and a T vector (48Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) derived from it was used for cloning PCR products. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α, bought from Invitrogen. Genomic DNA from N. simplex 3E was prepared by the method of Wilson (49Wilson K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 2.4.1-2.4.5Google Scholar). Primers for the amplification of the 1,2-HQD gene were designed for conserved regions of the 1,2-HQDs of R. pickettii (hadC), Arthrobacter sp. strain BA-5-17, Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (dxnF), B. cepacia (tftH), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (7Armengaud J.

Primer HQD-fw1 (5′-CGS CAG GAR TKS ATC CTG-3′) targets the bases corresponding to amino acid positions 82–87 in the alignment (see Fig. 4), whereas primer HQD-rev1 (5′-CCR TCR KNM GGN ATS GGR TA-3′) is expected to bind to the bases corresponding to positions 219–224 in the alignment (see Fig. 4). Thus, the PCR products had an expected length of about 400 bp. The PCR mixture (50 μl) contained 30 pmol of each primer, 0.5 μgof genomic template DNA, 20 μm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1 × PCR buffer (MBI Fermentas), 1.0 unit of DNA Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The PCR was performed with a touchdown thermocycle program: an initial denaturation (95 °C, 5 min); 10 cycles with decreasing annealing temperature (60–50 °C, 30 s), polymerization (72 °C, 1 min), and denaturation (95 °C, 30 s); 20 more cycles with 50 °C as the annealing temperature; and an additional 5 min of polymerization during the last cycle. After cloning of the 400-bp PCR product into a T vector, giving rise to plasmid pNocSi01, sequencing of the fragment proved it to be homologous to the corresponding segments of other 1,2-HQD genes. Labeling of the 400-bp fragment by a DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit Non-radioactive (Roche Applied Science) was performed as described in the Roche manual. The probe was then used to detect the corresponding fragment on a Southern blot of 0.64 μg of N. simplex 3E DNA digested with BamHI, PstI, SacI, and XhoI, respectively, and run on a 1% agarose gel with 1*TAE buffer (47Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). From a second gel, an area that corresponded in size to the hybridization signal (3 kb, SacI) was excised, and the included DNA was eluted and ligated into the dephosphorylated SacI site of pBluescript II SK(+). After transformation of the ligation mixture into E. coli DH5α, the labeled insert of pNocSi01 was used to identify clone pNocSi89 by colony hybridization. The nucleotide sequence of the 1,2-HQD was determined by preparing subclones of pNocSi89 with the restriction enzymes SacII and XhoI. Two different 650-bp SacII restriction fragments and a 1.2-kb XhoI fragment, respectively, encode the complete sequence of the gene. For sequencing reactions, a MBI Fermentas CycleReader Auto DNA Sequencing Kit was used, with subsequent electrophoresis with a Li-cor 4200 IR2 sequencer and analysis with the e-Seq program (version 1.2). Sequences were assembled using Staden Package version 2002.0. The sequence is available under GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AY822041. Comparisons with data-base entries were performed by using BLASTX (50Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were created using ClustalX (version 1.8) (51Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The enzyme was crystallized at 293 K using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 4% polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm Hepes pH 7.5 (52Benvenuti M. Briganti F. Scozzafava A. Golovleva L.A. Travkin V.M. Mangani S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 901-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The drops consisted of 4 μl of 20 mg/ml protein solution and 6 μl of reservoir solution equilibrated against 50 μl of reservoir solution (Crystal Clear Strips from Molecular Dimension, Inc.). A native data set extending to a maximum resolution of 1.75 Å was collected at the X11 beamline, EMBL, DESY, Hamburg. Data were collected using a MAR CCD165 detector at a wavelength of 0.908 Å. Crystals belong to the primitive monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 46.28, b = 84.98, c = 83.92 Å, β = 92.84°. For all data collections crystals of the native enzyme were cooled at 100 K adding 17% ethylene glycol to the mother liquor solution as cryoprotectant. Crystals suffered from damage if they were transferred in solution different from their mother solution unless they were previously cross-linked adding glutaraldehyde to the drops up to a final concentration of roughly 2% (v/v). Metal Content Analysis—Analysis of the protein metal content was performed by using a PerkinElmer Optima 2000 Inductively Coupled Plasma AES (Atomic Emission Spectrometry) Dual Vision. The metal content analysis revealed the presence of 2 equivalents of iron ions and 1 equivalent of copper ions/mol of protein. Structure Determination and Refinement—All molecular replacements attempts, using coordinates of known intradiol dioxygenases structures as a model, failed to provide a solution for Ns 1,2-HQD. The structure of the enzyme was, therefore, solved by multiple wave-length anomalous dispersion (MAD) using the anomalous signal of the two catalytic irons. MAD data were collected at the BM14 beamline, ESFR, Grenoble. The data collected at three wavelengths (inflection, peak, remote) were processed and integrated with DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK, from the HKL program suite (53Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The program SOLVE (54Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) was used to identify the two iron sites and for phase calculation. The 2.6 Å MAD phases were improved and extended to 2.2 Å by solvent flattening and histogram mapping using the program DM from the CCP4 program suite (55Collaborative Computational P.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Automatic tracing was performed initially with the program RESOLVE (56Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and extended using ARP/WARP version 6.0 (57Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). After 200 cycles of refinement and 20 cycles of autobuilding, 532 amino acids of 586 were found and placed in 16 chains with a global connectivity index of 0.94. After this process manual intervention was required to complete the model. The model was initially refined against 2.2 Å resolution (MAD remote wavelength data set) and finally against 1.75 Å data, using the program Refmac 5.1.24 from the CCP4 program suite (55Collaborative Computational P.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Manual rebuilding of the model was performed using the program QUANTA (58Quanta v. 98 Quanta Simulation, Search and Analysis. Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego1997Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were introduced automatically using ARP (57Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Refinement resulted in R factor and Rfree values of 19.2 and 24.6%, respectively. Data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The overall mean B factor of the structure after refinement was 25.68 Å2 for chain A, 28.23 Å2 for chain B, and 29.15 Å2 for all atoms.Table ISummary of data collection and atomic model refinement statisticsData collectionNativeFe peakFe inflectionFe remoteWavelength (Å)0.9081.7381.7411.001Limiting resolution (Å)1.752.62.62.2Unique reflections61,45418,84118,76835,271Rsym(%)4.6 (11.0)bNumbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.6.4 (21.4)6.2 (19.1)4.7 (31.0)Multiplicity4.35.13.23.7Completeness overall (%)94.1 (69.6)99.5 (95.7)99.1 (91.8)99.8 (98.3)〈I / σ(I)〉22.2 (6.4)18.4 (4.2)14.4 (3.4)23.3 (3.6)Overall figure of meritBefore density modification0.56After density modification0.82RefinementResolution range (Å)20.0-1.75Unique reflections, working/free56,787/2,988R factor (%)19.2Rfree (%)24.6No. of non-hydrogen atoms4,541No. of water molecules837r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square difference. bond length (Å)0.017r.m.s.d. bond angle (°)1.588a r.m.s.d., root mean square difference.b Numbers in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Protein coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1TMX). The final model is composed of residues 2–293 for chain A and 4–293 for chain B, two Fe(III) ions, two benzoate ions, two phospholipids (C13/C17), two sulfate ions, one copper ion, one chloride ion, and 837 water molecules. There are two disordered regions in chain B corresponding to residues 67–72 and 263–275. Electron density was missed for residues B264, B265, and B270 even for the main chain atoms, and they were not introduced in the model. Furthermore, no electron density was visible for the side chains of residues: A2 Ser, A73 Glu, B8 Glu, B71 Thr, B72 Asn, B75 Arg, B95 Asn, B264 Arg, B266 Pro, B276 Gln, and B277 Ile. Double conformations for the side chains of residues A118 Arg, A155 Val, A195 Lys, A222 Leu, A244 Glu, A247 Asp, A285 Arg were modeled. A spheric electron density in the Fo – Fc map at 12σ was found bound to His A42 (2.12 Å) and His B42 (2.02 Å), and it could be easily attributed to a metal ion. A peak at lower height, compared with the iron ones, was present in the Harker section of the anomalous Patterson maps corresponding to the position of the metal ion. The metal should be one close to the iron as number of electrons because of the height of the peak in the Fo – Fc map (assuming a unitary occupancy) and b"

Studies have shown that aberrations of chromosome 18q develop with tumor progression and are associated with significantly decreased survival in head and neck cancer patients. The G-protein-coupled receptor, galanin receptor 1 (GALR1), maps to this region of chromosome 18q. Although the role of GALR1 has been well characterized in neuronal cells, little is known regarding this receptor in non-neuronal cells. In this study, the expression, mitogenic function, and signaling mechanism of GALR1 are investigated in normal and malignant oral epithelial cells. mRNA expression was determined via reverse transcriptase-PCR. Protein quantification was done via immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For functional and signaling studies, an inhibitory antibody was generated to the N-terminal ligand binding domain of GALR1. GALR1 protein and mRNA expression and GAL secretion were detected at variable levels in immortalized human oral keratinocytes and human oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Upon competitive inhibition of GALR1, proliferation was up-regulated in immortalized and malignant keratinocytes. Furthermore, studies with the inhibitory antibody and U0126, the MAPK inhibitor, show that GALR1 inhibits proliferation in immortalized and malignant keratinocytes by inactivating the MAPK pathway. GALR1s inhibitory effects on proliferation in epithelial cells raises the possibility that inactivation or disregulation of this receptor can lead to uncontrolled proliferation and neoplastic transformation.

Aggressive surgery and radiation treatments are physically and emotionally debilitating and are selected on the basis of tumor size and spread rather than on the biology of individual lesions. However, two tumors that receive the same treatment may vary dramatically in biologic behavior. Therefore, identification of the molecular events that predict the biologic behavior of individual head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) 1The abbreviations used are: SCC, squamous cell carcinomas; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; GAL, galanin; GALR1, galanin receptor 1; GALR2, galanin receptor 2; GALR3, galanin receptor 3; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; HOK16B, HPV16-immortalized human oral keratinocytes; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UM-SCC-11A, University of Michigan squamous cell carcinoma cells; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. will facilitate treatment selection, thereby reducing the morbidity of the disease. One such prognostic biomarker has been identified on the long arm of chromosome 18q in head and neck SCC. Studies from Carey and others (3Pearlstein R.P. Benninger M.S. Carey T.E. Zarbo R.J.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 824-827PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that aberrations of chromosome 18q develop with tumor progression and are associated with significantly decreased survival in head and neck cancer patients. The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), galanin receptor 1 (GALR1), maps to this region of chromosome 18q (5Jacoby A.S. Webb G.C. Liu M.L. Kofler B. Hort Y.J. Fathi Z. Bottema C.D. Shine J.

GPCRs activate GTP-binding proteins to trigger signaling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a well established mitogenic pathway (7Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Hence, GALR1 is a candidate protein for regulation of cell proliferation in head and neck SCC. Galanin (GAL), a 30 amino acid neuropeptide, binds to galanin receptors to induce several regulatory functions in neuronal cells, including neuroregeneration, control of endocrine and exocrine secretions, and modulation of sensory and behavioral functions (9Bedecs K.

For example, transgenic mice overexpressing GAL, develop pituitary adenomas (14Perumal P. Vrontakis M.E. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 179: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice with a loss of function mutation in the GAL gene show enhanced apoptosis of ganglion cells upon sectioning of the nerve (12Holmes F.E. Mahoney S. King V.R. Bacon A. Kerr N.C. Pachnis V. Curtis R. Priestley J.V. Wynick D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, GAL knock-out mice have a loss of one-third of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain by 7 days of age (13O'Meara G. Coumis U. Ma S.Y. Kehr J. Mahoney S. Bacon A. Allen S.J.

Yanaihara N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 329: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and exerts anti-proliferative effects on regenerating rat adrenal glands and immature rat thymocytes (16Hochol A. Neri G.

Although these studies increase our understanding of galanin receptor function because of the complexity of the biological systems used, they do not provide mechanistic information of these exciting biological outcomes. The studies presented here investigate the intracellular signaling events responsible for these effects. GAL-mediated events occur via GALR1 as well as two other galanin receptors, GALR2 and GALR3. The latter receptors are products of two different genes on chromosomes 17q25.3 and 22q13.1, respectively (18Iismaa T.P. Fathi Z. Hort Y.J. Iben L.G. Dutton J.L. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Shine J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 863: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the role of GALR1 has been well characterized in neuronal cells, the expression of this GPCR in non-neuronal cells is poorly understood. In fact, few studies describe this receptor outside the neuronal system (19Benya R.V. Marrero J.A. Ostrovskiy D.A. Koutsouris A. Hecht G. Amer. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G64-G72PubMed Google Scholar) and none investigates the mitogenic role of GALR1. Furthermore, previous studies were exclusively correlational or performed with exogenously expressed receptor. In the current study, the expression, mitogenic function, and signaling mechanism of endogenous and exogenously expressed GALR1 are investigated in normal and malignant oral epithelial cells. Cell Culture—Human oropharyngeal SCC cell lines (20Carey T.E. Hay R. Gazdar A. Park J.-G. Atlas of Human Tumor Cell Lines.

HOK and SCC cells were cultured to ∼60–70% confluence in 100-mm dishes. The culture medium was changed and harvested 24 h later. The medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was designated the conditioned medium. The total cell number was determined by trypan blue enumeration. GAL secreted into the medium was measured by a competitive ELISA using a previously described protocol with modification (25Mazarati A.M. Liu H. Soomets U. Sankar R. Shin D. Katsumori H. Langel U. Wasterlain C.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10070-10077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAL (Sigma) was gently cross-linked with bovine serum albumin, a carrier protein, using glutaraldehyde. The coupled peptide and carrier were then used to coat 96-well plates (Corning). The conditioned medium from SCC culture plates and eight standard samples ranging from 0.05 to 500 ng/ml human GAL (Sigma) were combined with 1:50,000 rabbit anti-GAL polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and preincubated at 4 °C for 2 h prior to being added to the GAL coated 96-well plates. The specificity of the GAL antibody used for the ELISA was verified previously (26Mazarati A.M. Hohmann J.G. Bacon A. Liu H. Sankar R. Steiner R.A. Wynick D. Wasterlain C.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6276-6281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation, the plates were washed, secondary antibodies were added for 2 h, and color development was accomplished using o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) as a substrate. Finally, plates were read at 490 nm with a microplate reader. The principle of this assay was that GAL in the conditioned medium would competitively inhibit the binding of GAL antibody to the GAL substrate. Generation of N-terminal GALR1 Antibody—An N-terminal peptide from GALR1 was selected based on its location in the first extracellular domain and high antigenicity score. The peptide was synthesized in The University of Michigan Protein Core, and two rabbits were immunized four times. Sera were assessed for specific binding to the peptide using a non-competitive ELISA. Proliferation Assay—Rabbit anti-GAL polyclonal antibody or rabbit anti-GALR1 polyclonal antibody was used to investigate the role of GAL and GALR1, respectively, on cell proliferation. HOK16B, UM-SCC-22A, and UM-SCC-17B cells (1.5–3.0 × 104) were cultured overnight in a 24-well plate in KGM or DMEM. The following day, these cells were treated with medium containing anti-GAL or anti-GALR1 antibodies or vehicle control for 24 h. Each antibody dilution was normalized to 1:50 rabbit serum concentration. Each treatment was performed in triplicate. Cells in three wells were counted prior to the incubation. After 24 h, total cell number was determined by the trypan blue enumeration assay. Western Blot Analysis—The cell lines were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.2% Nonidet-P40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors on ice for 10 min, as described previously (21Mitra R.S. Zhang Z. Henson B.S. Kurnit D.M. Carey T.E. D'Silva N.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6243-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were scraped into Microfuge tubes and left for an additional 10 min with occasional vortexing, and particulate material was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein content was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-12% PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody concentrations were as follows: rabbit anti-GALR1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, generated against the N terminus of GALR1); rabbit anti-GALR2 polyclonal antibody (1:3000, Alpha Diagnostics); rabbit anti-GALR3 antibody (1:1000, Alpha Diagnostics); mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody (GAPDH, 1:5000, Chemicon International); anti-active MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA); and anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad). Affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) as a secondary antibody was used to detect primary antibodies. Visualization of the immunoreactive proteins was accomplished by the chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposure to film. MAPK activation was evaluated following incubation of immortalized keratinocytes (HOK16B cells) and UM-SCC-11A cells in serum-free medium with 1:50 concentration of GALR1 polyclonal antibody or with 1:50 normal rabbit serum. For MAPK inhibition experiments, cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 6 h prior to treatment with 10 nm U0126 for 24 h (Sigma). For experiments involving GAL stimulation, cells were stimulated with 150 nm GAL for 10 min following a 6-h preincubation in serum-free medium. Following standard Western blotting techniques as described above, the activation of the MAPK pathway was evaluated using anti-active MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:2000, Promega). Total RNA Isolation—RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the reverse transcription system kit (Promega). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—The cDNA was used as template in PCR reactions to amplify GAL, GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Specific 5′- and 3′-primers spanning the intron-exon boundaries in the region were GAL (5′-GCGCACAATCATTGAGTTTC-3′ and 3′-TGCATAAATTGGCCGAAGAT-5′), GALR1 (5′-AAGAAGGCCTACGTGGTGTG-3′ and 3′-TGGATGCTTCAGACTTCTTTGA-5′), GALR2 (5′-CCACCATCTACACCCTGGAC-3′ and 3′-ACTGGCGGTAGTAGCTCAGG-5′), GALR3 (5′-CATGTACGCCAGCAGCTTTA-3′ and 3′-ACGGTGCCGTAGTAGCTGAG-5′), and GAPDH (5′-GAGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTGCAG-3′ and 3′-CCATCCACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCA-5′). Human brain cDNA, used as a positive control, was a gift from Dr. A. Swaroop (University of Michigan). After 35 cycles of PCR amplification, products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Transfections—The pcDNA 3.1-GALR1 construct was obtained from The University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center. The pcDNA 3.1 empty vector was used as a control for transfection effects on endogenous gene expression. UM-SCC-11A or 293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and transfected with pcDNA 3.1-GALR1 or pcDNA 3.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated as indicated in figure legends and whole cell lysates were prepared. Statistical Analysis—All of the statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test, and experiments were done in triplicate. A p value of ≤0.05 was used as a measure of significance. Galanin Is Secreted by Human Oropharyngeal Keratinocytes—Although the growth effects of GAL have been studied in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (12Holmes F.E. Mahoney S. King V.R. Bacon A. Kerr N.C.

Endocrinol. 2003; 179: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the role of GAL and its receptors in epithelial cell proliferation has not been explored. Hence, in this study, initial experiments investigated the expression and secretion of GAL by normal and malignant oral epithelial cells. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, GAL mRNA was identified in immortalized oral keratinocytes (HOK16B) and oropharyngeal SCC cell lines including UM-SCC-17B, UM-SCC-11A, UM-SCC-22B, and UM-SCC-14A (Fig. 1A). As expected, the human brain, the positive control, showed a signal of similar molecular mass. The water control was appropriately negative. In order for GAL to stimulate the GALRs, it must be secreted. Secretion of the 3-kDa GAL neuropeptide from immortalized and malignant keratinocytes was investigated using a competitive ELISA (Fig. 1B). HOK16B and all of the SCC cell lines secreted GAL. Secretion was statistically greater in five SCC cell lines (17B and 14A (p = 0.05) and 11A, 14B, and 74A (p = 0.01)) when compared with the non-malignant HOK16B cells. In conditioned medium collected at 24 h, GAL secretion in UM-SCC-11A, UM-SCC-11B, UM-SCC-14A, UM-SCC-14B, UM-SCC-17B, UM-SCC-74A, and UM-SCC-81B consisted of a minimum of 175 ng/ml/million cells, whereas HOK16B, UM-SCC-22A, UM-SCC-22B, and OSCC3 secreted less than 50 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). Thus, GAL is transcribed in and secreted by non-malignant and malignant keratinocytes. Galanin Up-regulates Proliferation in Immortalized and Malignant Keratinocytes—Several studies have shown that GAL has an autocrine mitogenic effect on neuronal cells and modulates regeneration and survival in these cells (12Holmes F.E. Mahoney S. King V.R. Bacon A. Kerr N.C. Pachnis V. Curtis R. Priestley J.V. Wynick D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13O'Meara G. Coumis U. Ma S.Y. Kehr J. Mahoney S. Bacon A. Allen S.J. Holmes F. Kahl U. Wang F.H. Kearns I.R. Ove-Ogren S. Dawbarn D. Mufson E.J. Davies C. Dawson G. Wynick D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11569-11574Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Perumal P. Vrontakis M.E. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 179: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Hammond P.J. Smith D.M. Akinsanya K.O. Mufti W.A. Wynick D. Bloom S.R. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1996; 8: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that if GAL has an autocrine mitogenic effect in oral epithelial cells, an anti-GAL antibody should compete for secreted GAL, thereby inhibiting proliferation. To test this hypothesis, HOK16B and two cancer cell lines, UM-SCC-22A and UM-SCC-17B, were incubated with varying concentrations of anti-GAL antibody for 24 h. Cell proliferation was determined by the trypan blue enumeration assay. These cell lines were selected, because they represent low and intermediate levels of GAL secretion, i.e. <50 ng/ml and >175 ng/ml GAL, respectively (Fig. 1B). All three cell lines exhibited a reduction in cell number with anti-GAL antibody; however, compared with control-untreated cells, HOK16B proliferation at 24 h was not significantly inhibited at any of the antibody concentrations tested (Fig. 2). In contrast, both of the cancer cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation that was also significantly different from control at the highest antibody concentration (1:50,000). At this concentration, UM-SCC-22A exhibited a 38% inhibition (±3.9), whereas UM-SCC-17B, which secretes more GAL, exhibited a 63% (±3.0) inhibition. Thus, we conclude that GAL up-regulates proliferation in malignant keratinocytes. GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3 Are Expressed in Immortalized and Malignant Keratinocytes—Three galanin receptor isoforms, GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3, have been identified in neuronal cells. The pro-proliferative effects of GAL on human keratinocytes suggested that these cells express at least one of the three receptors. To verify this hypothesis, the expression of these three receptors in immortalized and malignant oral keratinocytes was investigated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblot analysis. GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3 mRNAs were identified in non-malignant (HOK16B) and malignant (UM-SCC-17B, -11A, -22B, and -14A) oral keratinocyte cell lines (Fig. 3A, top, middle, and bottom panels, respectively). Signals of corresponding molecular mass were detected in the human brain, which was used as a positive control. GAPDH served as an internal control. Protein expression was confirmed using isoform-specific galanin receptor antibodies (Fig. 3, B–D). GALR1-immunoreactive peptides were detected at a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa in all of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3B, top panels). However, when compared with the corresponding GAPDH signals that served as loading controls, it is apparent that HOK16B and UMSCC17B strongly express GALR1, whereas signals of lesser intensity were detected in the other SCC cell lines tested (Fig. 3B, top panels). GALR2-immunoreactive peptides were detected at a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, primarily in HOK16B, and to a lesser extent in UM-SCC-22B and UM-SCC-11A (Fig. 3C, top panels). GALR3 (∼55 kDa) was strongly expressed in UM-SCC-17B as well as UM-SCC-11A and UM-SCC-22B (Fig. 3D, top panels). Thus, GAL and all three of its receptors are variably expressed in non-malignant and malignant human oropharyngeal keratinocytes. An Antibody to the N Terminus of GALR1 Acts as a Competitive Inhibitor of Receptor Activation—The GALR1 gene has been mapped to the chromosome 18q23 region, which has been implicated in the progression of head and neck SCC. Thus, to investigate GALR1 function and signaling in immortalized and malignant oral keratinocytes, an antibody was generated to the N terminus, the ligand binding domain of GALR1, to serve as a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding. This strategy was adopted, because GALR1-specific agonists or inhibitors were unavailable. A peptide representing the ligand binding domain of the extracellular N-terminal region was synthesized and inoculated into rabbits to generate a GALR1-specific polyclonal antibody. Antibody specificity was verified by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with full-length GALR1 cDNA and HOK16B cells (Fig. 4). As expected, in 293T cells, the antibody detected a peptide in cells transfected with increasing concentrations of GALR1 cDNA, whereas no signal was detected in the vector control (pcDNA). This signal is specific for GALR1 and was not detected by antibodies to GALR2 or GALR3 (Fig. 4A). In HOK16B cells, the N-terminal antibody detected a single band at 70 kDa (Fig. 4B, left panel), which was not detected when the antibody was preincubated with increasing concentrations of the immunogenic peptide prior to Western blotting (Fig. 4B, middle and right panels). Antibodies to receptors may have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on receptor activation (28Goetzl E.J. Dembrow D. Van Brocklyn J.R. Graler M. Huang M.C. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 93: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the N-terminal GALR1 antibody inhibited receptor signaling, 293T cells were transfected with GALR1 and stimulated with GAL in the presence or absence of GALR1 antibody. Because stimulation of GALR1 facilitates MAPK activation (29Wang S. Hashemi T. Fried S. Clemmons A.L. Hawes B.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6711-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 30Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5758-5764PubMed Google Scholar, 31McDonald A.C. Schuijers J.A.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the GAL-induced MAPK effects in 293T cells were blocked by preincubation with the N-terminal GALR1 antibody (Fig. 4C). In 293T cells transfected with GALR1 as a model for GALR1 signaling, GAL stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 4C), whereas in empty vector (pcDNA) transfected cells, GAL did not induce ERK activation. Furthermore, MAPK activation was blocked when GALR1 cells were preincubated with the N-terminal GALR1 antibody prior to GAL treatment (Fig. 4C). Thus, the N-terminal GALR1 antibody specifically detects GALR1 and inhibits receptor activation. GALR1 Inhibits Proliferation in HOK16B and UMSCC11A— Oropharyngeal SCC cells secrete GAL, which binds to GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3, all of which are variously expressed in SCC cell lines (Fig. 3). To identify the GALR1-specific effects, the antibody generated to the N-terminal ligand binding domain of GALR1 (Fig. 4) was used as a competitive inhibitor to investigate the functional role of this receptor in human keratinocytes. Because GALR1 has a proliferative role in neuronal cells (12Holmes F.E. Mahoney S. King V.R. Bacon A. Kerr N.C. Pachnis V. Curtis R. Priestley J.V. Wynick D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 2003; 179: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), subsequent studies focused on a possible proliferative function for this receptor in SCC cells. The treatment of HOK16B with increasing concentrations of GALR1 rabbit polyclonal antiserum showed a dose-dependent increase of total cell number when compared with the preimmune rabbit serum control (Fig. 5A). This increase was significantly different from the control at a 1:50 antibody dilution. Because varying serum concentrations in the different treatment groups can contribute to pro-mitogenic effects, serum content in all of the treatment groups was normalized with preimmune serum. Preincubation of the antibody with the immunogenic peptide abrogated the increase in the cell number observed in cells treated with GALR1 antibody alone (Fig. 5B). In cells treated with non-immune rabbit serum and peptide, the GALR1"

Our data demonstrate that the abrogation of UPase activity led to greater than a 6-fold increase in uridine concentrations in plasma, a 5–6-fold increase in lung and gut, and a 2–3-fold increase in liver and kidney, as compared with wild type mice. Urine uridine levels increased 24-fold normal in UPase–/– mice. Uridine half-life and the plasma retention of pharmacological doses of uridine were significantly prolonged. Further, in these UPase–/– mice, abnormal uridine metabolism led to disorders of various nucleotide metabolisms. In the liver, gut, kidney, and lung of UPase–/– mice, total uridine ribonucleotide concentrations increased 2–3 times as compared with control mice. Cytidine ribonucleotides and adenosine and guanosine ribonucleotides also increased, although to a lesser extent, in these organs. Most significant deoxyribonucleotide changes were present in the gut and lung of UPase–/– mice. In these tissues, dTTP concentration increased more than 4-fold normal, and dCTP, dGTP, and dATP concentrations rose 1–2 times normal. In kidney, dTTP concentration increased 2-fold normal, and dCTP and dGTP concentrations rose less than 1-fold normal. In addition, the accumulated uridine in plasma and tissues efficiently reduced 5-fluorouracil host toxicity and altered the anesthetic effect of pentobarbital. These data indicate that UPase is a critical enzyme in the regulation of uridine homeostasis and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, and 5-fluorouracil activity.

In the presence of ribose-1-phosphate, UPase can also catalyze the reverse reaction, forming uridine from uracil, which in turn can be salvaged into uracil nucleotides by uridine kinase (1Cao D.

Except for erythrocytes and the liver and kidney, which maintain de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and supply other tissues with uridine for salvage, most normal tissues in adults rely on the salvage of uridine from plasma (5Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For instance, uridine incorporation has been shown to increase almost exponentially in human peripheral blood lymphocytes when stimulated by phytohemagglutinin as compared with their resting status (up to 30-fold in 24 h). However, de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis only increases 2–3-fold when stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (8Lucas Z.J. Science. 1967; 156: 1237-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In cultured L1210 cells, the plasma concentration of uridine is sufficient to meet their pyrimidine requirements. The work of Karle's laboratory (9Karle J.M. Anderson L.W. Cysyk R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 67-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has indicated that 3–5 μm uridine in the cell culture medium led to a 50% increase in the UTP pool of that culture, coupled with a 50% inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis from that cell culture. At 12 μm uridine, the UTP pool doubled, and more than 95% of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was inhibited, indicating the importance of plasma uridine in nucleic acid metabolism.Uridine also participates in the regulation of several physiological and pathological processes (10Connolly G.P.

Besides the direct salvage to pyrimidine nucleotides, the ribose moiety produced by the phosphorolysis of uridine can either enter the pentose cycle to meet cellular energy requirements or form phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, which is used in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides (11Wice B.M. Kennell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2578-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Pediatr. 1969; 75: 885-891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In addition, the levels of uridine in plasma and tissues are also critical for the success of anticancer therapies based on pyrimidine antimetabolites. Many preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that RNA, damaged by fluoropyrimidine incorporation, can be rescued by the administration of exogenous uridine or conservation of endogenous uridine by UPase inhibitors, such as benzylacyclouridine, thus leading to chemotherapeutic dose escalation and improvement of therapeutic index (15Darnowski J.W.

Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).With all of these clinical roles in mind, it is no surprise that under physiologic conditions, the uridine plasma concentration is strictly regulated at 3–5 μm among different species (2Gasser T. Moyer J.D. Handschumacher R.E. Science. 1981; 213: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Cao D. Pizzorno G. Drugs Today. 2004; 40: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms of this strict homeostasis of uridine and the biological consequences of its disruption remain to be elucidated. As an enzyme catalyzing uridine phosphorolysis, UPase may play an important part in the regulation of uridine homeostasis. In this study, we have generated a knock-out mouse model that lacks the UPase gene, quantified the subsequent changes in uridine metabolism, examined the effects of uridine homeostasis disruption on pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, and evaluated the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of UPase–/– Mice—Selected UPase+/– embryonic stem cells (Ref. 1Cao D. Russell R.L. Zhang D. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2313-2317PubMed Google Scholar) with normal karyotypes were introduced into C57BL/6J blastocysts that then completed their development in pseudopregnant C57BL/6J hosts. Chimeric offspring were used to generate the F1 UPase+/– mice. F2 UPase–/– and wild littermates obtained from inbreedings of the UPase+/– mice were used for the experiments. The geno-types of the mice were determined by Southern blot analysis, and the abrogation of the UPase gene products was confirmed by RT-PCR and uridine phosphorolytic activity assays. All experiments were conducted according to guidelines for the humane treatment of animals.Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from murine tails, digested with BamHI, separated in 0.8% agarose gel, and then transferred onto a nylon filter (Amersham Biosciences). A 600-bp PCR DNA fragment located immediately outside of the XhoI cloning site was random-labeled with [32P]dCTP and used to probe the DNA blots (1Cao D. Russell R.L. Zhang D. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2313-2317PubMed Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis of UPase mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues, and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized as described previously (19Cao D. Fan S.T. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11429-11435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed with forward primer (5′GCTCTTCCCGGATGAACACC-3′) in exon 5 (the targeted region) and the reverse primer (5′CGCCTGAAGTGCCAATGC-3′) in exon 6.Enzyme Activity Assays—UPase activity was measured by the conversion of [3H]uridine to [3H]uracil, and uridine kinase levels were determined by measuring the formation of [3H]UMP from [3H]uridine as described previously (1Cao D. Russell R.L. Zhang D. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2313-2317PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Uridine and Ribonucleotides—Amounts of uridine and ribonucleotides were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (16Pizzorno G. Wiegand R.A. Lentz S.K. Handschumacher R.E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1660-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, collected samples (plasma, urine, and tissues) were extracted with 2 volumes of 15% trichloroacetic acid at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min and neutralized with an equal volume of trioctylamine-Freon (45:55). Uridine was separated from aqueous phase using a C18 Microsorb column (250 × 4.6 mm, Varian) at 10 °C, with 50 mm potassium phosphate (KH2PO4, pH 3.0) as a mobile phase at 1.0 ml/min. Total ribonucleotide pools were determined by boiling the tissue extracts for 15 min and separating the samples on a Whatman Partisil-10-SAX anion exchange column using a 5 mm sodium phosphate mobile phase (pH 3.3) at 1.4 ml/min. Eluted uridine/nucleotides were monitored at 260 nm and quantitated by integration of the peak areas (16Pizzorno G. Wiegand R.A. Lentz S.K. Handschumacher R.E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1660-1665PubMed Google Scholar).DNA Polymerase Analysis of Deoxyribonucleotides—Deoxyribonucleotide pools were determined by a DNA polymerase assay (20Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Tissues were extracted with 0.4 n perchloric acid and neutralized by trioctylamine-Freon (55:45). DNA polymerase assays were conducted in a 20-μl mixture containing 1 unit of Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25 μm synthetic oligonucleotide template and primer, 2.5 μm [3H]dATP or [3H]dTTP (for dATP determination), and appropriate dNTP standards or tissue extracts. The reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 h, and then appropriate aliquots were spotted on filter disks (Whatman DE81). After the free isotopes were eluted with 5% Na2HPO4, the radioactivity of the reaction products left on the filters was determined by scintillation counting. Primer templates (Ref. 20Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar for the sequences) were prepared by annealing appropriate oligonucleotides, i.e. equimolar quantities of complementary strands were mixed together in a capped tube, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and then cooled down at room temperature.Uridine Disposition—To detect the metabolic kinetics of uridine in UPase–/– mice, 25 μCi of [3H]uridine was injected (intraperitoneally) into a mouse, and blood samples were collected at indicated time points by eye bleeding. Both [3H]uracil and [3H]uridine in plasma were determined by HPLC and scintillation counting. For pharmacokinetic analysis of pharmacological doses of uridine, 500 mg/kg of uridine was administered (intraperitoneally), and blood samples were collected by eye bleeding at indicated time points. After extraction with 15% trichloroacetic acid, uridine concentrations were determined as above.Pentobarbital Anesthesia—The anesthetic action of pentobarbital was assessed using the loss of righting reflex (LORR). Wild type and UPase–/– mice (2–3 months old) were injected (intraperitoneally) with 40 mg/kg of pentobarbital. After administration of the anesthetic, the duration of LORR in pentobarbital anesthesia was the time between the onset of and the emergence from LORR (21Geller E. Schiff B. Halpern P. Speiser Z. Cohen S. Neuropharmacology. 1989; 28: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).5-Fluorouracil Toxicity—Six wild type and UPase–/– mice (split equally for gender) were administered (intraperitoneally) weekly at doses of 5-FU ranging from 85 up to 250 mg/kg. Mouse weights were measured every other day as a proxy monitor for host toxicity. The doses leading to 15–20% weight loss were defined as the maximal tolerated dose. Observations ceased for each group after the first mouse died.RESULTSTargeted Disruption of the Murine UPase Locus—The mouse UPase gene was cloned, and the UPase locus-disrupted murine embryonic stem cells were generated as reported in our previous publications (1Cao D. Russell R.L. Zhang D. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2313-2317PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cao D. Nimmakayalu M.A. Wang F. Zhang D. Handschumacher R.E. Bray-Ward P. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4997-5001PubMed Google Scholar). UPase–/– mice were produced using the UPase+/– embryonic stem cell clones UPA503 and UPA532, both of which demonstrated normal karyotypes (data not shown). The genotypes of the mice were determined by Southern blot analysis. The wild type UPase allele shows up on Southern blot as an 18-kb band, whereas the mutant allele presents as a 4.0-kb band due to the introduction of a BamHI cut site. Therefore, UPase mutant heterozygous mice show both a 4.0-kb and an 18.0-kb band, whereas homozygous mice demonstrate a 4.0-kb band alone (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR and UPase activity assays both indicate that UPase gene products were completely abrogated in UPase–/– mice except for a residual uridine phosphorolytic activity present in liver tissues (Fig. 1, B and C). To understand the downstream effects of potential uridine accumulation secondary to UPase gene disruption, we also investigated uridine kinase activity. An increase in uridine kinase activity was detected in liver (77.8% increase, p < 0.05, Student's t test) and kidney (75.0% increase, p < 0.05, Student's t test) of UPase–/– mice, but no uridine kinase activity change was detected in the lung and gut (Fig. 1C).UPase–/– mice at the age of 3–5 months showed no changes in growth, development, sexual maturation, and fertility as compared with wild type littermates. The mutant UPase allele displayed a Mendelian distribution (1:2:1), indicating no lethal phenotype in UPase null mice. There were also no significant histological alterations present in the major organs surveyed, including brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, gut, and kidney (data not shown).Alterations of Uridine Metabolism in UPase–/– Mice—To understand the effects of UPase gene disruption on uridine metabolism, we have measured the concentrations of uridine in the plasma and some major organs of UPase–/– mice. As compared with wild type mice, the uridine concentration increased by more than 6-fold in the plasma of UPase–/– mice, and in tissues, the uridine concentration was elevated 5–6 times normal in lung and gut and 2–3 times normal in liver and kidney (Table I), indicating a critical role for UPase in the regulation of uridine concentrations in both plasma and tissues. In addition, a detection of urinary uridine concentration revealed a 24× normal elevation in UPase–/– mice, indicating the compensatory role of the kidney in uridine homeostatic regulation of UPase gene-deficient mice.Table IUridine concentrations in plasma, urine, and tissues of UPase –/– mice (μm)PlasmaUrineLiverGutLungKidneyUPase+/+4.1 ± 1.210.1 ± 4.8120.3 ± 20.568.9 ± 37.812.9 ± 3.5131.8 ± 37.8UPase-/-27.8 ± 3.8240.4 ± 42.3353.2 ± 39.1360.7 ± 44.771.7 ± 15.9339.9 ± 51.3 Open table in a new tab The metabolic kinetics of uridine in UPase–/– mice were also evaluated by tracing the fate of radiolabeled uridine. In wild type mice, tracer doses of [3H]uridine (25 μCi, intraperitoneally) were rapidly degraded with a t½ < 2 min. On the contrary, the [3H]uridine t½ in UPase–/– mice was ∼10–15 min, and [3H]uridine was still detectable 60 min after administration (Fig. 2A). Five minutes after administration, an obvious [3H]uracil peak was present in wild type mouse plasma but was notably absent in that of UPase–/– mice in which [3H]-uridine was still the major peak (Fig. 2B), indicating that [3H]-uridine was rapidly cleared via the phosphorolysis by UPase in wild type mice. Similarly, the disruption of UPase gene greatly increased the plasma retention of pharmacological doses of uridine. In UPase–/– mice, a pharmacological dose of 500 mg/kg of uridine (intraperitoneally) produced plasma uridine concentration above 1 mm for more than 1 h, whereas the plasma uridine declined in 1 h to ∼100 μm in wild type mice when administered with same doses of uridine (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Uridine metabolism in UPase–/– mice.

Therefore, we have examined the quantity of total ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides in the liver, gut, lung, and kidneys of UPase–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, total uridine ribonucleotide (UXP) concentrations increased 2–3 times normal in all organs surveyed. Cytidine, adenosine, and guanosine ribonucleotides (CXP, AXP, and GXP) also increased in these organs but generally to a lesser extent. Deoxyribonucleotides on the whole increased in these UPase–/– mouse tissues but with greater variations among different nucleotides and organs (Fig. 4A). As compared with wild type animals, dTTP concentrations in UPase–/– mice were elevated more than 4.0-fold in gut and lung and ∼2-fold in kidney; dCTP increased 1–2-fold in the gut, lung, and kidney of UPase–/– mice. Alterations in purine deoxyribonucleotides (dGTP and dATP) were also detected in gut, lung, and kidney, but they were generally elevated less than 1-fold. Interestingly, the increase of each deoxyribonucleotide in UPase–/– mouse livers was less than 50%, indicating that the liver, a major metabolic organ in vertebrate animals, has a strong self regulatory ability. Further, due to the unequal increases of each nucleotide pool in various tissues, the abnormalities of nucleotide metabolism were also characterized with the loss of the normal ratios among nucleotides (Figs. 3B and 4B).Fig. 3Ribonucleotide metabolism alterations in UPase–/– mice.

As shown in Fig. 5, 85 mg/kg of 5-FU represents the maximal tolerated dose in wild type mice, causing ∼15% weight loss within 4 weeks. Higher doses of 5-FU (100 mg/kg) resulted in animal deaths after the second dose (data not shown). In UPase–/– mice, however, 85 mg/kg of 5-FU caused no toxicity, and at 150 mg/kg, 5-FU-induced toxicity in UPase–/– mice was comparable with that observed at 85 mg/kg in wild type mice. A dose up to 200 mg/kg caused no animal deaths for 3 weeks.Fig. 55-Fluorouracil toxicity. 5-Fluorouracil was administered weekly (intraperitoneally), and mouse weights were tracked every other day to monitor for 5-fluorouracil toxicity.

There was no circadian cycle change observed in these mice; however, pentobarbital had a significantly reduced anesthetic effect on the UPase–/– mice. Although 40 mg/kg pentobarbital (intraperitoneally) induced a LORR of 1 h in wild type mice, the same dose of pentobarbital caused only 25 min of LORR in UPase–/– mice (Fig. 6). Also, the onset of LORR in UPase–/– mice was relatively longer (7 min versus 4 min) compared with wild type mice.Fig. 6Pentobarbital anesthetic effect. 40 mg/kg pentobarbital was administered (intraperitoneally), and LORR time was recorded for each mouse.

Our group and several other investigators have also established the ability of UPase to catalyze the conversion of thymidine into thymine, albeit with a lower efficiency (23el Kouni M.H. el Kouni M.M. Naguib F.N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3687-3693PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liu M. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5418-5424PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have generated UPase–/– mice, determined the role of UPase in the regulation of uridine homeostasis in vivo, and evaluated the effect of uridine homeostatic disruption on nucleotide metabolism, 5-FU, toxicity, and pentobarbital anesthesia. These UPase–/– mice had no apparent abnormalities in growth, development, sexual maturation, or reproductive ability. The mutant UPase allele displayed a typical Mendelian dissemination, indicating that UPase is not an essential gene for murine development or survival. However, lack of the UPase gene in mice indeed resulted in significant alterations in uridine and pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism.In UPase–/– mice, RT-PCR and UPase activity assays both confirmed a complete abrogation of UPase gene products in all tissues surveyed. The analysis of uridine phosphorolytic activity was important to exclude the possibility of residual activity from disrupted UPase gene products and to understand the presence of isoforms in UPase–/– mice. Indeed, Johansson (25Johansson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported the presence of an mRNA species (designated UPase-2) identical to the UPase gene in both humans and mice as we were conducting this study. In humans, UPase-2 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, whereas the mouse UPase-2 gene is mainly expressed in the liver. Consistent with this report, our results showed that a residual uridine phosphorolytic activity (1.3 nmoles/mg of protein/h) was present in the liver of UPase–/– mice, which is insensitive to benzylacyclouridine (data not shown). In addition, the accumulation o"
https://openalex.org/W2064641679,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that is positively regulated by two main events. The first is the binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM), which relieves intramolecular autoinhibition of the enzyme and leads to basal kinase activity. The second is activation by the upstream kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase. Phosphorylation of Ca2+/CaM-bound CaMKIV on its activation loop threonine (residue Thr200 in human CaMKIV) by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase leads to increased CaMKIV kinase activity. It has also been repeatedly noted that activation of CaMKIV is accompanied by the generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent or autonomous activity, although the significance of this event has been unclear. Here we demonstrate the importance of autonomous activity to CaMKIV biological function. We show that phosphorylation of CaMKIV on Thr200 leads to the generation of a fully Ca2+/CaM-independent enzyme. By analyzing the behavior of wild-type and mutant CaMKIV proteins in biochemical experiments and cellular transcriptional assays, we demonstrate that CaMKIV autonomous activity is necessary and sufficient for CaMKIV-mediated transcription. The ability of wild-type CaMKIV to drive cAMP response element-binding protein-mediated transcription is strictly dependent upon an initiating Ca2+ stimulus, which leads to kinase activation and development of autonomous activity in cells. Mutant CaMKIV proteins that are incapable of developing autonomous activity within a cellular context fail to drive transcription, whereas certain CaMKIV mutants that possess constitutive autonomous activity drive transcription in the absence of a Ca2+ stimulus and independent of Ca2+/CaM binding or Thr200 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2057496996,"β-Arrestins regulate the functioning of G protein-coupled receptors in a variety of cellular processes including receptor-mediated endocytosis and activation of signaling molecules such as ERK. A key event in these processes is the G protein-coupled receptor-mediated recruitment of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane. However, despite extensive knowledge in this field, it is still disputable whether activation of signaling pathways via β-arrestin recruitment entails paired activation of receptor dimers. To address this question, we investigated the ability of different muscarinic receptor dimers to recruit β-arrestin-1 using both co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy in COS-7 cells. Experimentally, we first made use of a mutated muscarinic M3 receptor, which is deleted in most of the third intracellular loop (M3-short). Although still capable of activating phospholipase C, this receptor loses almost completely the ability to recruit β-arrestin-1 following carbachol stimulation in COS-7 cells. Subsequently, M3-short was co-expressed with the M3 receptor. Under these conditions, the M3/M3-short heterodimer could not recruit β-arrestin-1 to the plasma membrane, even though the control M3/M3 homodimer could. We next tested the ability of chimeric adrenergic muscarinic α2/M3 and M3/α2 heterodimeric receptors to co-immunoprecipitate with β-arrestin-1 following stimulation with adrenergic and muscarinic agonists. β-Arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitation could be induced only when carbachol or clonidine were given together and not when the two agonists were supplied separately. Finally, we tested the reciprocal influence that each receptor may exert on the M2/M3 heterodimer to recruit β-arrestin-1. Remarkably, we observed that M2/M3 heterodimers recruit significantly greater amounts of β-arrestin-1 than their respective M3/M3 or M2/M2 homodimers. Altogether, these findings provide strong evidence in favor of the view that binding of β-arrestin-1 to muscarinic M3 receptors requires paired stimulation of two receptor components within the same receptor dimer. β-Arrestins regulate the functioning of G protein-coupled receptors in a variety of cellular processes including receptor-mediated endocytosis and activation of signaling molecules such as ERK.

Over the past several years, receptor dimerization has become an established concept in the field of G protein-coupled receptors (1Agnati L.F. Ferre S. Lluis C. Franco R. Fuxe K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 509-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 2Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism(s) by which receptors may undergo dimerization has yet to be elucidated in detail, it is becoming ever more clear that the phenomenon is playing a key role in receptor maturation, G protein coupling, and downstream signaling besides regulating such processes as internalization and desensitization. One of the most critical issues in receptor homodimerization and heterodimerization is whether signal transduction may require pair activation of receptor dimers. Many of the recent reports on G protein coupling consider separate stimulation of receptor dimers to be sufficient for activating G proteins in co-transfected cells (3Ginés S. Hillion J. Torvinen M.

Accordingly, heterodimerization would not necessarily interfere with G protein coupling and the receptor monomer should be sufficient by itself to activate G protein. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that heterodimerization between receptors that bind to distinct G proteins quite often leaves their coupling selectivity unaltered. For instance, β2 adrenergic receptors that couple with stimulatory G proteins or δ and κ opioid receptors that couple with inhibitory G proteins both form heteromeric complexes but their heterodimerization does not significantly alter ligand binding or their coupling properties (8Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar).However, this interpretation does not take into account the possibility that simultaneous activation of both receptors with selective agonists presupposes a different pharmacology from that foreseeable for two receptors activated separately (6Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In addition, the above conclusion is contradicted by a number of recent evidence. For instance, Baneres and Parello (9Baneres J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) have been able to demonstrate unambiguously with a combination of mass spectrometry and neutron scattering in solution that only one G protein trimer binds to a leukotriene B4 (LTB4) 1The abbreviations used are: LTB4, leukotriene B4; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; 3HA-M3, 3×HA N-terminal tagged M3 receptor; M3-short, mutant muscarinic M3 receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein. 1The abbreviations used are: LTB4, leukotriene B4; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; 3HA-M3, 3×HA N-terminal tagged M3 receptor; M3-short, mutant muscarinic M3 receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein. receptor BLT1 dimer (2xBLT1.LTB4), thus forming a stoichiometrically defined (2xBLT1.LTB4)Gαi2β1χ2 pentameric assembly. They suggested that receptor dimerization may be crucial for LTB4-induced signaling. Similar conclusions have been reached in a recent paper by Chinault et al. (10Chinault S.L. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that yeast α-factor receptor oligomerization is required for G protein activation. These two latter papers point to the receptor dimer as the minimal structural configuration necessary to sustain receptor functioning. In line with these findings, we have recently demonstrated that paired activation of two receptor monomers within muscarinic M3 dimers is required to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In fact, a mutant muscarinic M3 receptor (M3-short), which by itself cannot stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduces by a large extent the ability of M3 to activate ERK1/2 (11Novi F. Scarselli M. Corsini G.U. Maggio R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7476-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the most compelling evidence supporting the requirement for receptor dimerization in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was obtained with chimeric α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors (12Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that both adrenergic and muscarinic components of the α2/M3 and M3/α2 chimeric receptor heterodimers must be activated for ERK1/2 to be phosphorylated (11Novi F. Scarselli M. Corsini G.U. Maggio R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7476-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the same study, we provided additional evidence that activation of ERK1/2 by M3 receptors in COS-7 cells occurs independently of G protein activation. Because β-arrestins may activate mitogen-activated protein kinase by recruiting signaling molecules into a complex with agonist-occupied receptors (14Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we suggested that activation of ERK1/2 by M3 receptors may be due to the recruitment of β-arrestin to the site of the activated receptor.The combined evidence that M3 receptors might activate ERK1/2 via β-arrestin and that ERK1/2 activation is dependent upon receptor dimerization strongly suggests that the binding of M3 receptors to β-arrestin depends on both receptor components of the muscarinic M3 dimers. To test this hypothesis, we have extensively characterized the binding of β-arrestin-1 to a number of muscarinic M3 receptor dimers using co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy in COS-7. Our findings provide strong evidence that the binding of β-arrestin-1 to muscarinic M3 receptor dimers requires a paired activation of two receptor components within the same receptor dimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—N-[3H]Methylscopolamine (83 Ci/mmol) and [3H]adenine (32 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Tripitramine was kindly provided by Dr. Carlo Melchiorre (University of Bologna).Eukaryotic Expression Vectors—Construction of M3-short and chimeric adrenergic/muscarinic α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors has been described elsewhere (12Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31055-31060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, M3-short was obtained by deleting 196 amino acids from the third cytoplasmic (i3) loop of M3 (the remaining i3 loop was 43 amino acids long). Chimeric adrenergic/muscarinic α2/M3 and M3/α2 receptors were obtained by exchanging the last two transmembrane regions between the adrenergic α2C and the muscarinic M3 receptor. In both chimeras, the third cytoplasmic loop was from the M3 receptor. A schematic representation of the receptor mutants used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we used a triple HA N-terminal tagged human M3 receptor inserted in a pcDNA3 vector from Guthrie cDNA Resource Center and a c-Myc N-terminal tagged human M2 receptor kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Haga. The chimeric M3/α2 receptor was tagged at its N terminus with the HA antigen (HA-M3/α2). The C-terminal tagged FLAG-β-arrestin-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz.Cell Cultures and Transfection—COS-7 cells were incubated at +37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (containing 5% CO2) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 105/100-mm dish, and 24 h later, they were transiently transfected with the plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method. The total amount of DNA used for each transfection was brought to 4 μg by adding an appropriate amount of vector DNA.Membrane Preparation and Binding Assay—On day 1, COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid(s) of interest. Three days after transfection, confluent plates of cells were lysed by replacing the medium with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mm Na-HEPES, 2 mm EDTA). After 20 min, cells were scraped off the plate and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 20 min at +4 °C. The lysed cell pellet was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in ice-cold binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 155 mm NaCl, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Binding was carried out at +30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml, and atropine 1 μm was used to define nonspecific binding. The bound ligand was separated from the unbound ligand using glass-fiber filters (Whatmann, GF/B) with a Brandel cell harvester, and the filters were counted with a scintillation β-counter.Phosphatidylinositol Breakdown Assay—Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with myo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/ml) for 48 h. Immediately prior to the experiment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 min in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10 mm LiCl and 20 mm HEPES. The medium was then replaced by 0.25 ml of the same medium containing the experimental agents. After a 1-h incubation at +25 °C, the reaction was arrested by the addition of 0.75 ml of 7.5% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The trichloroacetic acid was extracted with water-saturated diethyl ether (3 × 4 ml), and the levels of inositol monophosphate were determined by anion exchange chromatography.Adenyl Cyclase Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmid(s) containing the receptor of interest plus the adenyl cyclase V. 24-h after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and recultured in 24-well plates, and after an additional 24 h, they were assayed for adenyl cyclase activity. The cells in the 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h with 0.25 ml/well fresh growth medium containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine, and this medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg bovine serum albumin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.5 mm) and RO-20-1724 (0.5 mm). Adenyl cyclase activity was stimulated by the addition of 1 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of carbachol. After 10 min of incubation at +30 °C, the medium was removed and the reaction was terminated by the addition of perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP followed by neutralization with KOH. The amount of [3H]cAMP formed was determined by a two-step column separation procedure.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, confluent cells were treated with the selected compound 3 days after transfection. Following incubation, the reaction was stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold sterile 0.9% NaCl. Cells were then scraped with 300 μl of buffer solution A (0.2% digitonin, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1.5 μm pepstatin, 4 μm leupeptin, 0.01 m aprotonin, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysed cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at +4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered for immunoprecipitation. The amount of proteins was assayed with the protein assay kit of Bio-Rad, and aliquots of 60 μg of proteins (if not otherwise specified) were used for immunoprecipitation.To eliminate proteins nonspecifically bound to magnetic beads, the cell extract was preexposed to 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolab) for 1 h at +4 °C. A magnetic field was applied to the side of the tube, and the supernatant was recovered and transferred to a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of a monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) or an anti-c-Myc antibody (Sigma) was added to the tube and the suspension was incubated at +4 °C for 1 h. At the end of this incubation period, 25 μl of protein G magnetic beads were added and incubated at +4 °C for an additional hour. A magnetic field was applied to pull beads to the side of the tube, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The magnetic beads were washed with 500 μl of buffer solution B (0.1% Niaproof, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) including the protease inhibitor mixture. Bead pellets were recovered by applying a magnetic field, and they were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and incubated at +70 °C for 5 min.A magnetic field was applied to the sample, and the supernatant was recovered and loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were run at 90 V for 2–3 h and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 100 V. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were determined by immunoblotting with specific antibodies such as polyclonal anti-β-arrestin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-i3-loop M3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody. Data from separate experiments were digitized on a flat bed scanner and analyzed with a Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems software.Immunocytochemistry—COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method on 100-mm plates, and the day after transfection, they were split and seeded on coverslips previously placed on 6-well plates at a confluence of 2 × 105 cells/well. Three days after transfection, they were treated with 100 mm carbachol and then processed for immunocytochemistry. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, and then incubated in 1% BSA for 1 h to reduce background staining. They were then exposed to a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at a working dilution of 1/100 followed by another incubation with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a working dilution of 1/100. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on slides using Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probe). The coverslips were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope using ×63×/1.25 oil Zeiss objective.RESULTSTo characterize the expression of endogenous β-arrestin-1 in COS-7 cells, protein extracts from mock-transfected COS-7 cells and from cells transfected with a C-terminal tagged FLAG-β-arrestin-1 were immunoblotted with an antibody directed against the C terminus of β-arrestin-1. In mock-transfected COS-7 cells, a band corresponding to the molecular mass of β-arrestin-1 (55 kDa) was detected on the blot (Fig. 2A). In COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-β-arrestin-1, the same antibody recognized a broad band corresponding to the FLAG-β-arrestin-1. In COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-β-arrestin-1, the anti-FLAG antibody recognized the same band as the anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody, whereas it did not detect any signal in mock-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Identification of endogenous β-arrestin-1 and the muscarinic M3 receptor by specific antibodies in COS-7 cells. In panel A, mock-transfected and FLAG-β-arrestin-1-transfected COS-7 cells were immunoblotted (IB) with an antibody directed against the C-terminal end of β-arrestin-1. In the first lane, the antibody recognized a band of ∼55 kDa corresponding to the endogenous β-arrestin-1. A much broader band corresponding to FLAG-β-arrestin-1 was detected by the same antibody in the second lane. B, to confirm that the bands correspond to β-arrestin-1, the same membrane was stripped and re-blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody (Flag-β-arr-1). In cells transfected with FLAG-β-arrestin-1, the anti-FLAG antibody recognized a band analogous to the one detected by the anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody. C, characterization of the antibody directed against the third loop of muscarinic M3 receptor. In COS-7 cells transfected with 3HA-M3, the antibody recognized two bands probably corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric form of the receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the nature of receptor-arrestin interaction, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in COS-7 cells co-expressing β-arrestin-1 and the 3×HA N-terminal tagged M3 receptor (3HA-M3). The 3HA-M3 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and the amount of β-arrestin-1 pulled down was normalized to the amount of the immunoprecipitated receptor. The same amount of immunoprecipitated 3HA-M3 (and in some experiments M3) obtained with an antibody directed against the third cytoplasmic loop could be reproducibly recovered in different experiments. In cells transfected with 3HA-M3 or M3 (results not shown), this antibody recognizes two bands that most likely correspond to the monomeric and dimeric forms of the muscarinic receptor (Fig. 2C).The amount of β-arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with the 3HA-M3 receptor in the absence of agonist (basal) was usually very low or undetectable. In contrast, stimulation of 3HA-M3 receptors with 100 μm carbachol induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the co-immunoprecipitated β-arrestin-1 complex, which then reached its maximum by ∼20 min (Fig. 3). A dose-response curve of carbachol-induced β-arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitation was obtained by incubating cells transfected with 3HA-M3 receptors for 10 min at the different concentrations of the agonist. The EC50 was between 10 and 100 μm, and no further increase in β-arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitation was observed up to 1 mm (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Time course of carbachol induced β-arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitation in cells transfected with 3HA-M3 and 3HA-M3 + M2. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of 3HA-M3 (upper blot) or with 1 μg of 3HA-M3 + 2 μg of M2 plasmid DNA (lower blot). Confluent monolayers of COS-7 cells were stimulated with carbachol (100 μm) for the time indicated, and incubation was terminated by adding ice-cold NaCl (0.9%). Cells were extracted in digitonin, and aliquots of 60-μg proteins were incubated with an anti-HA antibody and processed for immunoprecipitation (IP) with protein G magnetic beads (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Because deletion of the i3 loop is expected to impair carbachol-induced stimulation of β-arrestin-1 binding, we tested the ability of a mutated muscarinic receptor in which 196 amino acids of the i3 loop were deleted (M3-short) to co-immunoprecipitate with β-arrestin-1. For this purpose, we used the N-terminal tagged HA-M3-short. As predicted, stimulation of this receptor with 100 μm carbachol did not increase the amount of co-immunoprecipitated β-arrestin-1 compared with the basal value (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, the basal amount of β-arrestin-1 that co-immunoprecipitated with the HA-M3-short receptor was significantly higher than that co-immunoprecipitated with the wild type receptor. This suggests that, in addition to the i3 loop, other segments of the M3 receptor can also be involved in β-arrestin-1 binding.Fig. 5Inhibition of carbachol induced 3HA-M3 recruitment of β-arrestin-1 by the M3-short receptors. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 1-μg DNA of 3HA-M3 and 2 μg-DNA of the M3-short or M3 or pCD plasmid. An additional control was transfected with 2-μg DNA of the HA-M3-short receptor.

Scarselli M. Corsini G.U. Maggio R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7476-7486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We calculated that up to 76.6% M3 receptor expressed could be co-immunoprecipitated with M3-short in COS-7 cells co-transfected with 2 μgofM3-short and 1 μgofM3. In the same paper, we showed that M3-short impairs the ability of M3 to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the heterodimer. Here, we tested whether the M3-short could interfere with the ability of 3HA-M3 to co-immunoprecipitate with β-arrestin-1. As shown in Fig. 5, co-expression of M3-short almost entirely prevents carbachol-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of β-arrestin-1 with the M3 receptor. This result was not due to potential problems linked to co-transfection, because overexpression of wild type M3 did not impair the amount of β-arrestin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with the 3HA-M3 (Fig. 5).These findings strongly suggest that M3-short interferes with the ability of 3HA-M3 to recruit β-arrestin-1. To test this hypothesis, we verified whether β-arrestin-1 and 3HA-M3 could co-localize following muscarinic receptor activation in living cells. For this purpose, β-arrestin-1 C-terminal tagged with GFP (β-arrestin-1-GFP) and the 3HA-M3 receptor were co-expressed in COS-7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2068944057,"p73, a member of the p53 family, is expressed from two separate promoters, generating TA and ΔN variants. Each variant potentially encodes at least seven alternatively spliced isoforms (α–η). Interestingly, we and others have shown that the α isoform of p73 has a weaker transcriptional activity than the β isoform. Because the α isoform has an extended C terminus consisting of a sterile α motif (SAM) and an extreme C terminus, it appears that the C terminus is inhibitory. However, how the C terminus inhibits the transcriptional activity of p73 has not been determined. Here, we found that both the SAM and the extreme C terminus exert their inhibitory activity by preventing the accessibility of p300/CBP to the activation domain in p73. Specifically, we showed that the SAM and the extreme C terminus together or individually are capable of repressing the function of p73 activation domain, but neither interacts directly with the activation domain, or suppresses the DNA-binding activity, of the p73 protein. We also showed that the intact state of the SAM and the extreme C terminus is essential for their inhibitory functions such that a small deletion of either the SAM or the extreme C terminus abolishes its inhibitory activity. Furthermore, we showed that both inhibitory domains in the C terminus are capable of suppressing the function of a cis heterologous activation domain from p53 or Gal4. Finally, we showed that both inhibitory domains suppress the ability of p73 to interact with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP that are necessary for the initiation of transcription. p73, a member of the p53 family, is expressed from two separate promoters, generating TA and ΔN variants.

Like p53, p73 functions as a transcription factor and activates a number of putative p53 target genes, which mediate the function of p73 in inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation (1Kaghad M.

In addition, previous studies have shown that p73 also activates its unique downstream targets, suggesting that p73 may play a role distinct from that by p53 in response to cellular stimuli (16Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blint E. Phillips A.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Vousden K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, p73 mutation is extremely rare in human tumors (19Nimura Y. Mihara M. Ichimiya S. Sakiyama S. Seki N. Ohira M. Nomura N. Fujimori M. Adachi W. Amano J. He M. Ping Y.M. Nakagawara A. Int.

Majewski P. Haluska F.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 172-174PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to p53-deficient mice that show an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumors, p73-deficient mice exhibit severe neurological defects, including hydrocephalus, hippocampal dysgenesis, and abnormalities in the pheromone sensory pathway (11Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). p73 is activated in response to some of the cellular and genotoxic stresses that stimulate p53 (14Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M.

Although p53 is regulated primarily by post-translational modifications, p73 is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations (14Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y.

It has been shown that p73 is stabilized by DNA damage in a manner dependent on non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-abl (14Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y.

Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In addition, p73 is transcriptionally activated by DNA damage at least in part via p53, E2F, and p73 itself (25Chen X. Zheng Y. Zhu J. Jiang J. Wang J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T.

Activation of p73 is critical to E2F-induced p53-independent apoptosis (26Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14177-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been found to interact with p53 family members and regulate their transcriptional activities. Among these are ASPP1 and ASPP2 that bind to all three p53 family members and specifically affect their abilities to activate apoptotic genes, such as Bax, Puma, but not p21 or mdm2. Thus, ASPP1 and ASPP2 appear to regulate p53 family members in determining cell fate upon cellular stresses (29Samuels-Lev Y. O'Connor D.J. Bergamaschi D. Trigiante G. Hsieh J.K. Zhong S. Campargue I. Naumovski L. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 30Bergamaschi D. Samuels Y. Jin B. Duraisingham S. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Yes-associated protein, another p53 family interacting protein, binds to the PPXY motifs in p73 and p63 through its WW domain and increases the transcriptional activities of p73 and p63 (31Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Castagnoli L. Shaul Y. Sacchi A. Oren M. Sudol M. Cesareni G. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15164-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the activities of the p53 family proteins can be regulated by both common and unique factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that the extreme C terminus in p53 functions as a negative regulator. For example, the DNA-binding ability of p53 is increased when the C terminus is deleted, phosphorylated, acetylated, or bound with a specific antibody to this domain (32Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 33Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Both p73α and p63α have an extended C terminus compared with their shorter counterparts, such as p73β and p63β (35Chen X. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that p73β transactivates a variety of p53-responsive promoters to a greater extent than p73α does, suggesting that the C termini in p73α and p63α suppress their transcriptional activities in a manner similar to that in p53. But no homology has been found in the C terminus between p53 and p73 (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). In addition, p300/CBP is found to acetylate several lysine residues within the p53 C terminus, which enhances the DNA binding and thereby the transcriptional activity of p53 (33Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar, 34Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, no lysine residue has been found to be acetylated within the p73 C terminus. Furthermore, RACK1, a receptor for activated C kinase, and MM1, a c-Myc-binding protein, were found to interact with the C terminus in p73α and regulate p73α activity (39Ozaki T. Watanabe K. Nakagawa T. Miyazaki K. Takahashi M. Nakagawara A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3231-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Watanabe K. Ozaki T. Nakagawa T. Miyazaki K. Takahashi M. Hosoda M. Hayashi S. Todo S. Nakagawara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15113-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, the extreme C terminus in p63α is found to interact with the p63α activation domain and inhibits its activity (41Serber Z. Lai H.C. Yang A. Ou H.D. Sigal M.S. Kelly A.E. Darimont B.D. Duijf P.H. Van Bokhoven H. McKeon F. Dotsch V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8601-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Collectively, the evidence suggests that the C terminus in p73α may inhibit its transcriptional activity through a unique mechanism. In this study, we found that both the SAM and the extreme C terminus in p73α are inhibitory domains and their intact state is essential for their inhibitory functions. We demonstrated that both inhibitory domains are able to repress the function of p73 activation domain, and we provided evidence that this effect is not due to a direct interaction between the inhibitory domains and the p73 activation domain. We also showed that the C terminus does not suppress the DNA-binding ability of the p73 protein. Interestingly, both inhibitory domains are capable of repressing a cis heterologous activation domain from p53 or Gal4 transcription factor. Finally, we found that the C terminus suppresses the ability of p73 to interact with transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP. Plasmids—The tetracycline-regulated expression constructs, pUHD10–3-HA-p73α and pUHD10–3-HA-p73β, were described previously (42Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Various HA-p73α deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification using pUHD10–3-HA-p73α as a template. To generate HA-p73α(Δ555–636), a cDNA fragment encoding residues 248–554 in p73α was amplified by the 5′-end primer, p73α EcoRI-5 (5′-GAC GGA ATT CAC CAC CAT-3′), and the 3′-end primer, p73α-3 (5′-GGA TCC TCA GTG GAT CTC GGC CTC C-3′). The fragment was then used to replace the region encoding residues 257–645 in HA-p73α through an internal EcoRI site. To generate HA-p73α(Δ540–636), HA-p73α(Δ525–636), HA-p73α(Δ510–636), or HA-p73α(Δ495–636), a cDNA fragment encoding residues 248–539, 248–524, 248–509, or 258–494 in p73α was amplified by the 5′-end primer, p73α EcoRI-5, and a 3′-end primer that spans the region encoding the last six residues and a stop codon. These fragments were used to replace the region encoding residues 257–645 in HA-p73α, respectively. To generate HA-p73α(Δ500–555), a cDNA fragment encoding residues 248–499 in p73α was amplified and ligated with a cDNA fragment encoding residues 556–636 in p73α. To generate HA-p73α(Δ500–570) or HA-p73α(Δ500–590), the cDNA fragment encoding residues 248–499 in p73α was ligated with a cDNA fragment encoding residues 571–636 or 591–636 in p73α. These fragments with internal deletion were used to replace the region encoding residues 257–645 in HA-p73α. All these mutant p73 cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 or pUHD10-3 at the EcoRI site. To generate constructs that express various Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and p73α chimeric proteins, a cDNA fragment that encodes residues 1–120 in p73α and a cDNA fragment that encodes residues 346 to the C terminus in p73α, p73α(Δ555–636), p73α(Δ500–555), or p73α(Δ495–636), were amplified, ligated together at an internal KpnI site, and cloned into the mammalian two-hybrid vector, PM (Invitrogen), at BamH1 and XhoI sites. The cDNA fragment that encodes residues 1–120 in p73α was also cloned into PM. The resulting plasmid was designated as PM-p73α, PM-p73α(Δ555–636), PM-p73α(Δ500–555), PM-p73α(Δ495–636), or PM-p73α(AD). To generate a construct that expresses a chimeric protein containing the Gal4 activation domain and various domains in p73α, a cDNA fragment that encodes residue 117 to the C terminus in p73α, p73α(Δ555–636), p73α(Δ500–555), or p73α(Δ495–636), was amplified and cloned into the mammalian two-hybrid vector, pVP16 (Invitrogen), at BamH1 and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as pVP16-p73α, pVP16-p73α(Δ555–636), pVP16-p73α(Δ500–555), or pVP16-p73α(Δ495–636). To generate a construct that expresses a chimeric protein containing the p53 activation domain and various domains in p73α, a cDNA fragment encoding residues 1–98 in p53 was amplified and ligated with the cDNA fragment encoding residue 117 to the C terminus in p73α, p73α(Δ555–636), p73α(Δ500–555), or p73α(Δ495–636), at a KpnI site. The ligated cDNA fragments were cloned into pcDNA3, respectively, at BamH1 and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as p53-AD, p53-AD-p73α, p53-AD-p73α(Δ555–636), p53-AD-p73α(Δ500–555), or p53-AD-p73α(Δ495–636). All the deletion mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Lines—The culture, transfection, and generation of H1299 cell lines were performed as described previously (42Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Individual clones were screened for inducible expression of various p73α proteins by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected from plates in phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended with 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (42Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (c-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody and anti-actin polyclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. DNA Histogram Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per 90-mm-diameter plate in the presence or absence of tetracycline (2 μg/ml). At 72 h after plating, cells floating in the medium and cells on the plates were collected and fixed. DNA histogram analysis was performed as described previously (42Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells in the sub-G1, G0 and G1, S, and G2 to M phases was determined by using the CellQuest program. The percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase was used as an index for the degree of apoptosis. Luciferase Assay—To determine the transcriptional activity of p73α, p73β, or various p73α deletion mutants, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-HA-73α, pcDNA3-HA-p73β, or a pcDNA3 construct that expresses one of the p73α deletion mutants, was co-transfected into H1299 cells with 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter, pGL2-p21A, which is under the control of the p21 promoter with two p53-binding sites (43Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), or pGL2-GADD45, which is under the control of a p53-responsive element in intron 3 of GADD45 and a c-fos minimum promoter (43Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To determine the transcriptional activity of a chimeric protein containing Gal4-DBD and various regions in p73, 0.5 μg of PM, PM-p73α(AD), PM-p73α(Δ495–636), PM-p73α(Δ555–636), PM-p73α(Δ500–555), or PM-p73α was co-transfected into H1299 cells with 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter, pGL2–5Gal, which is under the control of a promoter containing five consecutive Gal4-responsive elements (Invitrogen). To determine the transcriptional activity of a chimeric protein containing the p53 activation domain and various regions in p73, 0.5 μg of p53-AD, p53-AD-p73α(Δ495–636), p53-AD-p73α(Δ555–636), p53-AD-p73α(Δ500–555), or p53-AD-p73α was co-transfected into H1299 cells with 0.25 μg of pGL2-p21A. To determine the transcriptional activity of a chimeric protein containing the Gal4 activation domain and various regions in p73, 0.5 μg of pVP16, pVP16-p73α(Δ495–636), pVP16-p73α(Δ555–636), pVP16-p73α(Δ500–555), or pVP16-p73α was co-transfected into H1299 cells with 0.25 μgof pGL2-p21A. As an internal control, 5 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector, pRL-CMV (Promega), was also co-transfected. The dual luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The increase (n-fold) in relative luciferase activity is the product of the luciferase activity induced by p73α, p73β, or various p73 C-terminal deletion mutants divided by that induced by pcDNA3 empty vector. Similarly, the increase (n-fold) in relative luciferase activity for various fusion proteins is the product of the luciferase activity induced by various Gal4-DBD, Gal4-AD, and p53-AD chimeric proteins divided by that induced by Gal4-DBD, Gal4-AD, and p53-AD, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assay was performed essentially as described previously (44Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 5 × 107 H1299 cells, which were un-induced (–p73) or induced (+p73) to express HA-p73α, HA-p73α(Δ555–636), HA-p73α(Δ500–555), or HA-p73β, were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Cell extracts were sonicated to generate 200- to 1000-bp DNA fragments. 1% of cell extracts from each of the samples was taken as input. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-myc monoclonal antibody. After reverse cross-linking and phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA fragments bound by p73 were purified over a Qiagen column. PCR was performed to visualize the enriched DNA fragments. Primers that were used to amplify each of the two p53-responsive elements within the p21 promoter were as previously described (44Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A region within the promoter of the GAPDH gene was amplified by the 5′-end primer (AAA AGC GGG GAG AAA GTA GG) and the 3′-end primer (AAG AAG ATG CGG CTG ACT GT) to serve as a control for nonspecific binding. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared from ∼2 × 108 H1299 cells that were induced to express HA-p73α, HA-p73α(Δ555–636), HA-p73α(Δ500–555), or HA-p73β for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (44Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol.

Rb has also been implicated in activation of transcription, in particular by nuclear receptors (NRs) and by differentiation-related transcription factors, but the relevance of this activity is unclear. We show that Rb and the related proteins p107 and p130 enhance the activity of NRs related to NGFI-B (Nur factors) through direct interactions with NGFI-B and SRC-2. Although recruitment of SRC/p160 coactivators to the NGFI-B AF1 domain is independent of Rb, its presence enhances SRC-dependent transcription. Rb potentiation of SRC coactivators is exerted on a subset (Nur factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), SF-1, and ER) but not all NRs. The levels of Rb-related proteins modulate hormone responsiveness of the NGFI-B-dependent pituitary proopiomelanocortin gene and HNF-4-dependent transcription during enterocyte differentiation. Increased Rb expression upon cell differentiation may promote differentiated functions, at least in part, by potentiation of NR activity.

Increased Rb expression upon cell differentiation may promote differentiated functions, at least in part, by potentiation of NR activity. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) encodes the Rb protein that is an important regulator of proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (1Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To exercise its numerous functions, Rb acts as a transcriptional regulator interacting with many transcription factors. For example, Rb interacts and represses transcription factors of the E2F family, whereas it enhances activity of transcription factors required for cell differentiation, such as MyoD, C/EBP, c-Jun, AP-2, and Cbfa1 (2Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Some functions of Rb are regulated by phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It is thought that dephosphorylated Rb inhibits E2F activity by binding E2F and recruiting histone deacetylases (2Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); this leads to repression of genes required for entry into S phase of the cell cycle. The phosphorylation of Rb at the end of the G1 phase by cyclin-dependent kinases causes disruption of Rb/E2F complexes and cell cycle progression. Rb phosphorylation is also regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p16, and its activity is modulated by p300 acetylation (3Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Demonacos C. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).

Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), in contrast to humans where RB1 inactivation is associated with retinoblastoma and not directly with pituitary tumorigenesis. Despite the absence of direct mutation in the RB1 gene in human pituitary tumors, loss of Rb expression was linked to pituitary corticotroph tumor progression when adenomas were compared with poorly differentiated carcinomas (4Hinton D.R. Hahn J.A. Weiss M.H. Couldwell W.T. Cancer Lett. 1998; 126: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Rb in pituitary POMC cells and, particularly, in their transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we determined whether Rb regulates transcription of the POMC gene itself. This led to identification of a subfamily of three orphan nuclear receptors (NRs) that are targeted by Rb. Indeed, this subfamily of orphan NRs includes the three Nur factors, NGFI-B (Nur77), Nur-related factor 1 (Nurr1), and neuron-derived orphan receptor 1 (NOR-1) (5Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R.

The Nur factors are immediate early response genes, and they are widely expressed. Nur77 and NOR-1 are implicated in the control of thymocyte apoptosis, whereas Nurr1 plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (reviewed in Ref. 7Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Nur factors contribute to basal POMC transcription as well as to activation of transcription in response to hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). The pituitary POMC promoter target of Nur factor action is the Nur response element (NurRE), a palindromic sequence bound by dimers formed between Nur family NRs (5Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 7Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The activity of Nur factor dimers is enhanced by coactivators of the steroid receptor coactivator SRC/p160 family, and this effect is mediated through the AF-1 domain of NGFI-B (8Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The SRC/p160 coactivator family consists of three proteins designated SRC-1/NCoA-1, SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1/NCoA-2, and SRC-3/p/CIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB-1/TRAM-1 (9McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). NRs contain two activation domains: one in the N terminus that is ligand-independent (AF-1), and the other in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain that is ligand-dependent (AF-2). AF-1 and AF-2 domains require coactivators such as SRCs to mediate their transcriptional effects. SRCs have histone acetyltransferase activity, and they also recruit CBP/p300 to enhance transcription. Rb has been reported to modulate the activity of some NRs, possibly through interaction with other proteins. Indeed Rb enhances the activity of GR through interaction with the Brm/BRG1 sub-units of the SWI/SNF complex (10Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the activity of the androgen receptor independently of BRG1 (11Lu J. Danielsen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31528-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rb also regulates negatively the activity of the thyroid hormone receptor by interacting with and inhibiting the coactivator Trip230 (12Chang K.H. Chen Y. Chen T.T. Chou W.H. Chen P.L. Ma Y.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Developmental Cell. 2002; 3: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Rb can also interact with the RIZ protein, which in turn interacts with the estrogen receptor (ER) in a ligand-dependent manner (14Abbondanza C. Medici N. Nigro V. Rossi V. Gallo L. Piluso G. Belsito A. Roscigno A. Bontempo P. Puca A.A. Molinari A.M. Moncharmont B. Puca G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3130-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data have suggested that Rb may be an important regulator of NR activity. In view of the particular, and apparently limiting, role of Rb in POMC-expressing lineages and of the present identification of Nur factors as Rb targets, we have investigated in detail the mechanism of Rb enhancement of NGFI-B activity and found that Rb acts as a potentiator of SRC/p160 coactivator function. This action is mediated by direct interactions between Rb, NGFI-B, and SRCs. The Rb/SRC synergism is not restricted to Nur factors, operates on other nuclear receptors, and may constitute a paradigm for the action of Rb on various transcription factors. Plasmid Constructs—POMC promoter constructs, NurRE, GRE, SF1-RE reporter plasmids as well as SF-1, NGFI-B and its mutants, SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, and CBP expression vectors were previously described (5Philips A.

Caco-2 cells were cultured as described (23Soutoglou E. Talianidis I. Science. 2002; 295: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For ER assays, cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, 9-cis-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, 17β-estradiol, and dexamethasone were added at 10-7 m for 16 h before harvesting. Luciferase activities were assayed 2 days after transfection. Transfection efficiencies were normalized using co-transfected CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (10 ng). Each transfection was repeated 3–10 times in duplicate, using different plasmid or siRNA preparations. siRNA and Transfection—siRNA against mouse Rb and p107 genes were designed to target the following sequences: Rb#1, CTTGACAAGAGAAATGATA; Rb#2, CCATGCTTAAATCAGAAGA; p107#1, CAAGCTAATAGTCACGTAT; and p107#2, CGAAATGACTATTATCGTT. The siRNA control targeted the GCAGCACGACTTCTTCAAG sequences in GFP mRNA or contained a random sequence. All duplexes were synthesized at Proligo (Paris, France) as 21-mers with dTdT 3′ overhang or were synthesized with the silencer siRNA construction kit as recommended by the supplier (Ambion). Each transfection was repeated at least three times in duplicate, using different siRNA preparations. AtT-20 cells were platted in 6-well plates and transfected with 400 pmol of siRNA GFP or with 100 pmol of each siRNA for Rb and p107, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-transfection experiments (see Fig. 8), luciferase and GFP plasmids were transfected together with the siRNA p107#1 or the random siRNA control using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, CRH was added at 10-7 m for 16 h. Cells were then harvested, sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using GFP luminescence and proteins and/or RNA were isolated. RNA Preparation—Total RNAs were extracted using the phenol/chloroform method. RNAs were treated 1 h with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), which was then heat-inactivated by a 10-min incubation at 70 °C. Reverse transcription was done with 2 μg of RNA, random hexanucleotides, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription (Invitrogen) during 1 h. An aliquot of this reaction mixture was used for quantitative real-time PCR. GST Pull-down Assays—All GST fusion proteins were produced, and 35S-labeled NGFI-B and SRC-2 mutants were synthesized in vitro as described (19Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were incubated with 1 μg of immobilized GST or GST-Rb constructs in 150 μl of TNEN50 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed at 4 °C twice in TNEN250 and twice in TNEN125. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that similar amounts of fusion proteins were recovered, and then autoradiographed. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays and Western Blots—C33A cells (10-cm plate) were transfected with 7 μg of each expression plasmid and harvested 48 h after. CRH (10-7 m) treatment of AtT-20 cells was for 2 h. Cells, harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C in TNEN250 with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, supernatants corresponding to 107 cells were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with αFLAG M2 (Sigma), αHA (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), αRb (3–245, BD Pharmingen), αp107 (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), αHNF-4 (H-171, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and isotype-matched non-immune IgG (Sigma) as control. Immunoprecipitates obtained after 1 h of incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) saturated with bovine serum albumin, were washed twice with TNEN250 and thrice with TNEN125. After SDS-PAGE, Western blots were revealed with antibodies against FLAG M2, HA, Rb, NGFI-B (554088, BD Pharmingen), and SRC-2 (MS-1140-P0, Neomarkers). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using antibodies against SRC-1 (sc-6098, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SRC-3 (sc-7216, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Gal4 (sc-577, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Fig. 6C, cells and nuclear extracts were prepared as described for ChIP below. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Quantitative PCR—AtT-20 cells treated or not for 2 h with 10-7 m CRH were prepared for ChIP as described (24Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Supernatants corresponding to 107 cells were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with 3 μg of monoclonal antibodies against NGFI-B, Rb, SRC-2, and FLAG M2 as negative control. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A/G-agarose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin and tRNA. Beads were washed as described by Upstate biotechnology. Quantitative PCR was performed on serial 4-fold dilutions of DNA extracted from immunoprecipitates. PCR products were separated on agarose gels and revealed by hybridization with appropriate DNA probes. Quantification of signals for different dilutions was performed with a PhosphorImager. For ChIP experiments in Caco-2 cells and mRNA quantitation, quantitative realtime PCR was used. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR (Stratagene MX-4000 or Applied Abiprism 7000) was used with the SYBR Green kit (Qiagen or Applied). The primers used were as follows: POMC promoter, 5′-TCCATTGCCCACCACAGAGCGC (-703) and 5′-GCCTAGTTCTGAGATCTTGCAG (-332); POMC Exon 3, 5′-ACCGGGTGGAGCACTTCCGCTG (+5375) and 5′-GGGGCAAGGAGGTTGAGAAATG (+5746); POMC 5′UTR-exon1, 5′-ACCCACCCAACCCTGCAAGTATAA and 5′-TGGCCTCTCTTAGTCACTGCTCTT; β-actin (exon3), 5′-TGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAGAA and 5′-TCCATGTCGTCCCAGTTGGTAA; β2-μGlobulin, TGCTATCCAGAAAACCCCTCA (+109) and 5′-GCGGGTGGAACTGTGTTACG (+209); Rb1 exon18-exon19, 5′-ATGGAATCCCTTGCATGGCT (+1612) and 5′-AGGACAAGCAGGTTCAAGGT (+1710); p107 exon21-exon22, 5′-AGCGCACTGCTGTACAAGTT (+3047) and 5′-TTTGGCAGGTGAGTCTGCAT (+3181); p130 exon8-exon9, 5′-ATGAGCGCGTATTCCTTGGT (+1104) and 5′-TGCTGCTGCAAGATGTCTCT (+1227); α1-AT promoter, 5′-CTGTACACTGCCCAGGCAAA (-174) and 5′-CAGTTATCGGAGGAGCAAACAGG (-87); α1-AT, 3′-untranslated region, 5′-GGATCAGCCTTACAACGTGTCTCT (+9917) and 5′-TTTCTCGTCGATGGTCAGCACA (+9989); α1-AT exon2, 5′-CACCAGTCCAACAGCACCAATATC (+5562) and 5′-CAGGATTTCATCGTGAGTGTCAGC (+5667); ARP-PO promoter, 5′-ACAGAGCGACACTCCGTCTCAAA (-307) and 5′-ACCTGGCGAGCTCAGCAAACTAAA (-213); ARP-PO, 5′-AACCCTGAAGTGCTTGACATGG (+160) and 5′-AACCAATCTGCAGACAGACACC (+232). All data were quantitated relative to β-actin mRNA levels. Rb Activates POMC Transcription through the NurRE—To determine whether the POMC gene is a target of Rb regulation, we investigated the ability of Rb to modulate POMC promoter activity using transient co-transfection in POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells. Strong activation of the POMC promoter was observed in the presence of Rb (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Using a panel of POMC promoter mutants, we found two different response elements that are targeted by Rb: one is the NurRE and the other is the Eboxneuro that is the target of NeuroD1-containing basic helix-loop-helix dimers (25Batsche E. Moschopoulos P. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (February 8 10.1074/jbc.M413427200)Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 2 and 4), mutagenesis of the NurRE abolished most of the Rb effect, whereas mutagenesis of another potential Nur factor target, the NBRE (5Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), did not affect Rb-dependent activity (lane 3). The importance of the NurRE for Rb activation was also shown using simple reporters that contain multimers of POMC regulatory elements. In this context, the NurRE confers Rb-dependent activity (Fig. 1B, compared lane 5 to lane 6). In both experiments, residual Rb-dependent activity (Fig. 1, A (lanes 2, and 4) and B (lane 6)) was ascribed to the Eboxneuro and to basic helix-loop-helix factors (25Batsche E. Moschopoulos P. Desroches J. Bilodeau S. Drouin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (February 8 10.1074/jbc.M413427200)Google Scholar). Prior work indicated that the NurRE and the cognate Nur factors contribute to basal activity as well as to POMC promoter responsiveness to the hypothalamic hormone CRH (5Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 7Maira M.H. Martens C. Philips A. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7549-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whereas the Eboxneuro contributes to basal activity (26Poulin G. Turgeon B. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6673-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of Rb and its related “pocket” proteins in vivo, we used a small interfering (si) RNA approach in AtT-20 cells. Because these cells express significant levels of Rb and p107, we used a mixture of four siRNAs complementary to these mRNAs (a pair for each). The siRNAs produced significant reductions of mRNAs for both Rb and p107, but not for β2-microglobulin (Fig. 1C). The decrease of Rb and p107 mRNAs resulted in reduced basal POMC expression and in complete abrogation of POMC gene activation by CRH (Fig. 1C). Rb-related proteins thus appear important for POMC expression. Rb Synergizes with NGFI-B and with SRC/p160 Coactivators—Because the NurRE is the target of orphan NRs of the Nur family, we tested the effect of Rb on NGFI-B activity. Using a NurRE reporter in AtT-20 cells, we show that Rb acts as a coactivator of NGFI-B-dependent activity in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). Because we have previously shown enhancement of NGFI-B activity by the SRC/p160 coactivators (8Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we tested a putative collaboration between Rb and these coactivators. As shown in Fig. 2B, Rb further enhanced NGFI-B- and coactivator-dependent transcription assessed using the NurRE reporter (top), whereas no effect was observed with a reporter devoid of NurRE (Min, bottom). The major effect of Rb was to enhance the activity stimulated by the SRC coactivators SRC-1, SRC-2, or SRC-3. Indeed, Rb increased the steepness of the NGFI-B dose-response curve beyond the effect of each SRC coactivator (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Rb acts synergistically with SRC coactivators to enhance NGFI-B activity. In these experiments, the levels of expression of Rb, NGFI-B, or SRC coactivators were not affected by co-expression of each other (Fig. 2, B (bottom) and D). Equivalent results were obtained in CV1 or L cells and in cells that are deficient in Rb protein and C33A and MDA-MB468 cells (data not shown). However, the SRC coactivator effect on NGFI-B-dependent activity appeared larger in Rb-positive cells (CV1 or L) compared with Rb-defective cells (C33A and MDA-MB468). Conversely, the effect of Rb on NGFI-B- and SRC-2-dependent (NGFI-B/SRC-2) transcription was greater in Rb-defective compared with Rb-positive cells (data not shown). Rb-related Proteins Potentiate NGFI-B/SRC Activity but Are Not Essential—Rb is the founding member of the “pocket protein” family that also includes p107 and p130 (1Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rb or related proteins are essential for SRC coactivator effects, we used primary fibroblasts (MEF) from triple knock-out (TKO) mice deficient in all pocket proteins (22Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). TKO MEFs and control (WT) MEFs had very similar transfection efficiency (not shown). NGFI-B stimulated NurRE-dependent transcription in both cells, and these activities were enhanced by SRC-2 (Fig. 2E). Thus, Rb-related proteins are dispensable for SRC enhancement of NGFI-B activity. However, WT MEFs exhibited higher activity and enhancement compared with TKO MEFs, consistent with the enhancement effect of Rb proteins (Fig. 2E). This was confirmed by increased NGFI-B- and SRC-2-dependent transcription after addition of Rb in TKO cells (Fig. 2F). All pocket proteins enhanced NGFI-B activity with or without SRC-2 in TKO and AtT-20 cells (Fig. 2G). These results show that pocket proteins are not essential for SRC coactivator function although they synergize with SRC coactivators. Nuclear Receptor Selectivity of Rb Potentiation—Although Rb synergy with SRCs was not recognized previously, its effect on some NRs, such as GR, androgen receptor, and PPARγ, was known. We therefore wanted to determine whether SRC coactivator activity is subject to Rb enhancement for all NRs. Using a representative panel of orphan- and ligand-dependent NRs together with reporters for their cognate DNA targets, we identified three subsets of NRs with respect to Rb action: one is subject to Rb enhancement of SRC-2 activity (Fig. 3, A–D), another is insensitive to Rb (Fig. 3, E–G), whereas the third is repressed by Rb (Fig. 3, H and I). In the first group, the two NGFI-B-related factors, Nurr1 and NOR-1, as well as the orphan NRs, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), and the ligand-dependent estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) were all enhanced by Rb. In contrast, the SRC-2-dependent activities of GR, RAR, and RXR were not sensitive to Rb, despite the positive effect of Rb on GR-dependent activity (10Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, the SRC-2-dependent activities of COUP-TFII and PPARγ (Fig. 3I and Ref. (13Fajas L. Landsberg R.L. Huss-Garcia Y. Sardet C. Lees J.A. Auwerx J. Developmental Cell. 2002; 3: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) were repressed in the presence of Rb. Similar results were obtained in TKO MEFs, C33A, CV1, or L cells. These results indicate that only a subset of NRs is sensitive to Rb potentiation of SRC activity. Rb and SCR2 Act through AF-1 Transactivation Domain of NGFI-B—We previously showed that SRC coactivators exert their effects through the AF-1 N-terminal domain of NGFI-B (8Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Martens C. Bilodeau S. Maira M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This AF-1 domain was shown to interact physically with SRC-2 (29Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The AF-1 is subdivided into two regions comprised between amino acids 20 and 36 and between amino acids 74 and 174 (8Maira M.H. Martens C. Batsche E. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 763-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When NGFI-B deletion mutants were assessed for their ability to support Rb enhancement (Fig. 4A), all Rb-dependent enhancement was lost upon deletion of N-terminal sequences between amino acids 17 and 37. Accordingly, deletion of the Q-rich domain (ΔQ) of SRC-2/TIF2, which is known to interact with the AF-1 domain (15Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), resulted in the loss of SRC-2-dependent activation both in presence and absence of Rb (Fig. 4B). In contrast, mutation of the LXXLL motifs (m123) in the NR interacting domain, which are required for AF-2-dependent activity, did not affect SRC-2 activation of NGFI-B activity, nor Rb enhancement (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the interaction between SRC-2 and the AF-1 domain is necessary for synergy between Rb and SRC-2. Multiple Rb domains are required for its po"

However, both patients and mice with a DBP deficiency still produce C24-bile acids, although C27-intermediates accumulate. An alternative pathway for bile acid biosynthesis involving the peroxisomal l-bifunctional protein (LBP) has been proposed. We investigated the role of LBP and DBP in bile acid synthesis by analyzing bile acids in bile, liver, and plasma from LBP, DBP, and LBP:DBP double knock-out mice. Bile acid biosynthesis, estimated by the ratio of C27/C24-bile acids, was more severely affected in double knock-out mice as compared with DBP–/– mice but was normal in LBP–/– mice. Unexpectedly, trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase was inactive in double knock-out mice due to a peroxisomal import defect, preventing us from drawing any firm conclusion about the potential role of LBP in an alternative bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, the immature C27-bile acids in DBP and double knock-out mice remained unconjugated in juvenile mice, whereas they occurred as taurine conjugates after weaning, probably contributing to the minimal weight gain of the mice during the lactation period. This correlated with a marked induction of bile acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase expression and enzyme activity between postnatal days 10 and 21, whereas the bile acyl-CoA synthetases increased gradually with age. The nuclear receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, farnesoid X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator receptor α did not appear to be involved in the up-regulation of the transferase.

Bile acids play an important role in the solubilization and digestion of dietary lipids and in the excretion of cholesterol. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver via a series of reactions involving many different enzymes located throughout the cell (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). The nonpolar steroid nucleus of cholesterol is converted into a considerably more polar steroid by enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. In the mitochondrion, a carboxyl group is formed on the aliphatic side chain of the sterol molecule, which is shortened by β-oxidation in the peroxisome (Fig. 1). As a consequence, bile acid synthesis is disturbed in peroxisome biogenesis disorders and also in peroxisomal DBP 1The abbreviations used are: DBP, d-bifunctional protein; ACOX1, straight-chain acyl-CoA oxidase; ACOX2, trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase; ACOX3, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase; AMACR, α-methylacyl-CoA racemase; BACS, bile acyl-CoA synthetase; BAAT, bile acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase; CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; DHCA, dihydroxycholestanoic acid; DKO, double knockout; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; HNF4α, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α; LBP, l-bifunctional protein; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator receptor α; THCA, trihydroxycholestanoic acid; THC:1-CoA, (24E)-trihydroxycholestenoyl-CoA; VLCS, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Pn, postnatal day n; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; THC, trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA. deficiency. DBP, alternatively called multifunctional protein 2, is involved in the second and third step of the β-oxidation of 2-methyl branched-chain fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives like the C27-bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid (DHCA and THCA) (2Wanders R.J.A. Barth P.G. Heymans H.S.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3219-3256Google Scholar). After cleavage of the side chain, the primary C24-bile acids cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are formed. In mice, CDCA is only a minor bile acid, since most of it is converted via hydroxylation into α/β/ω-muri-CA. After synthesis, bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine by the bile acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). In mice, almost exclusively taurine-conjugates are present, because murine BAAT does not use glycine as substrate (3Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E.H. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with a deficiency of DBP accumulate C27-bile acid intermediates, but there are still mature C24-bile acids present in their plasma and bile (4Clayton P.T. Lake B.D. Hjelm M. Stephenson J.B. Besley G.T. Wanders R.J. Schram A.W. Tager J.M. Schutgens R.B. Lawson A.M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1988; 11: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Une M. Konishi M. Suzuki Y. Akaboshi S. Yoshii M. Kuramoto T. Fujimura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that an alternative pathway for bile acid biosynthesis exists, which does not involve DBP. Indeed, there is an alternative microsomal pathway for cleavage of the side chain that does not involve any peroxisomal enzymes. This 25-hydroxylation pathway accounts for less than 5% of bile acid synthesis in several species studied (6Duane W.C. Bjorkhem I. Hamilton J.N. Mueller S.M. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Duane W.C. Pooler P.A. Hamilton J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Honda A. Salen G. Shefer S. Matsuzaki Y. Xu G. Batta A.K. Tint G.S. Tanaka N. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, another alternative pathway has been proposed involving the other peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, LBP (also called multifunctional protein 1), and α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) (Fig. 1) (9Cuebas D.A. Phillips C. Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Novikov D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During peroxisomal β-oxidation of THC-CoA, first (24E)-trihydroxycholestenoyl-CoA (THC:1-CoA) is formed by the branched-chain acyl-CoA oxidase in humans and by trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX2) in mice. THC:1-CoA is then converted to (24R,25R)-24OH-THC-CoA by the hydratase part of DBP, and subsequently this is converted into 24-keto-THC-CoA by the dehydrogenase part of DBP. Finally, this is thiolytically cleaved by sterol carrier protein X (10Wanders R.J. Vreken P. Ferdinandusse S. Jansen G.A. Waterham H.R. Van Roermund C.W. Van Grunsven E.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 250-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Alternatively, THC:1-CoA can be converted to (24S,25S)-24OH-THC-CoA by the hydratase part of LBP; however, this is not substrate for the dehydrogenase part of LBP or DBP. In vitro studies have shown that (24S,25S)-24OH-THC-CoA is a substrate for AMACR, which can convert this isomer to the (24S,25R)-isomer, which in its turn can be handled by the dehydrogenase part of LBP (9Cuebas D.A. Phillips C. Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Novikov D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Xu R. Cuebas D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If this route would be operational in vivo, it could account for some residual bile acid synthesis in DBP-deficient patients. In addition, the (24S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is formed in order to eliminate cholesterol from the brain and is excreted across the blood-brain barrier into the circulation, can be converted into bile acids, after ω-oxidation, via LBP (12Bjorkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E. Alvelius G. Ellegard L. Diczfalusy U. Sjovall J. Einarsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37004-37010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). (24S,25S)-24OH-THC-CoA is present in body fluids of patients with DBP deficiency, indicating that in these patients LBP indeed forms this hydroxy-intermediate (13Vreken P. van Rooij A. Denis S. van Grunsven E.G. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The question remains, however, whether the alternative pathway via LBP really contributes to bile acid synthesis when DBP functions normally or whether it can partly take over the role of DBP in bile acid synthesis in case of a deficiency of DBP. To answer this question, we performed bile acid analysis in LBP, DBP, and LBP:DBP double knock-out (DKO) mice. DBP–/– mice exhibit a severe postnatal growth retardation and a variable life span, with more than 50% of the mice dying before weaning, whereas the others survive into adulthood. In adult DBP–/– mice, C27-bile acid intermediates have been identified, as expected, but C24-bile acids are still present (14Baes M. Huyghe S. Carmeliet P. Declercq P.E. Collen D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16329-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the creation of the LBP–/– mouse has been published in 1996 and no gross phenotypic defects were described (15Qi C. Zhu Y. Pan J. Usuda N. Maeda N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Hashimoto T. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15775-15780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), no specific bile acid analysis in this mouse model has been reported. LBP:DBP DKO mice have a complete block at the level of the second step of peroxisomal β-oxidation. They exhibit severe growth retardation and postnatal mortality, with almost none surviving beyond weaning (16Jia Y. Qi C. Zhang Z. Hashimoto T. Rao M.S. Huyghe S. Suzuki Y. Van Veldhoven P.P. Baes M. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47232-47239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is unclear why the DKO mice are much more severely affected than the single DBP knock-out mice, because at this moment no specific function has been attributed to LBP. In order to compare bile acid composition, we collected liver, plasma, and bile of mice with the different genotypes between postnatal day 2 (P2) and adulthood. Because of the poor survival of the DKO mice, we could only analyze samples of these mice until P14–15. Since we noticed a major difference in the conjugation of bile acids in young animals compared with adult animals, a second goal was to investigate the ontogeny of hepatic bile acid conjugation. Animals—Wild type and single DBP knock-out (originally named multifunctional protein 2 knock-out) mice were obtained by inbreeding LBP:DBP+/+:+/– mice, whereas LBP knock-out and DKO mice were descendants of LBP:DBP–/–:+/– breeding pairs (14Baes M. Huyghe S. Carmeliet P. Declercq P.E. Collen D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16329-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Qi C.

Mice were bred in the animal housing facility of the University of Leuven under conventional conditions. They had unlimited access to standard rodent chow (Muracon-G; Carfil Quality-Pavan Services, Oud-Turn-hout, Belgium; for breeding pairs, this was enriched in a ratio of 1:1 with AM-II (Hope Farms, Arie Blok, Woerden, The Netherlands)) and water and were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of the University of Leuven. Wild type and peroxisome proliferator receptor α (PPARα)–/– mice on a Sv/129 genetic background, which were used for bile acyl-CoA synthetase and bile acyl-CoA:amino acid acyltransferase activity measurements, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Bile Acid Analysis—Bile acids were analyzed by HPLC-negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described (18Bootsma A.H. Overmars H. van Rooij A. van Lint A.E. Wanders R.J. van Gennip A.H. Vreken P. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with only minor modifications. The HPLC column used was a C8-column (Phenomenex Luna; 50 × 1 mm), and the bile acids were separated using a gradient from 60:40 (ammonium formiate, pH 8.1/MeOH (v/v)) to 90:10 (acetonitrile/H2O (v/v)) at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. Sample preparation for plasma was performed as described in Ref. 18Bootsma A.H. Overmars H. van Rooij A. van Lint A.E. Wanders R.J. van Gennip A.H. Vreken P. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. For bile acid analysis in bile, the bile was diluted 500 times in H2O. For analysis in liver, 15–25 mg of liver (wet weight) was homogenized in 150 μl of H2O. After sonication, 150 μl of MeOH was added plus 100 μl of internal standard ([2,2,4,4-2H]tauro-CA, [2,2,4,4-2H4]tauro-CDCA, [2,2,4,4-2H4]glyco-CA, [2,2,4,4-2H4]glyco-CDCA, [2,2,4,4-2H4]CA, and [2,2,4,4-2H4]CDCA). After another round of sonication, the sample was deproteinized by the addition of 750 μl of acetonitrile followed by subsequent centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored briefly, whereas the pellet was redissolved in 300 μl of MeOH/H2O (1:1), sonicated, and deproteinized as described above. The supernatants were pooled and evaporated under a stream of N2, and the residue was dissolved in 250 μl of MeOH/H2O (1:2). Five μl was injected into the HPLC tandem mass spectrometric system. Quantitation of the various conjugated bile acids was done using multiple reaction monitoring, whereas the various unconjugated bile acids were detected with selected ion monitoring. Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA Oxidase Measurements—Acyl-CoA oxidase activity measurements were performed essentially as described before (19Wanders R.J. Denis S.W. Dacremont G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). H2O2 production by the action of the acyl-CoA oxidases was measured in mouse liver homogenates prepared in PBS with 25 μm FAD by fluorometric quantitation of H2O2 using homovanillic acid and horseradish peroxidase. Measurements were carried out in the following incubation mixture: 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm homovanillic acid, 18 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 0.1 mm NaN3,5 μm FAD, and 5 μm bovine serum albumin. The reactions were started by the addition of 50 μm C16-CoA, 50 μm pristanoyl-CoA, or 80 μm THC-CoA. Fluorescence was followed at 30-s intervals for 10 min using a Cobas Bio centrifugal analyzer (excitation wavelength, 327 nm; emission filter, 410–490 nm) (Hoffman-La Roche). Bile Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity Measurements—Bile acid synthetase activity was measured with CA (sodium salt; Merck; stock 1 mm in H2O) and THCA (Ten Brink, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; stock 2 mm in 10 mg/ml β-cyclodextrin, 100 mm Tris, pH 8) as substrate. The incubations consisted of 100 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm CoA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm CA or THCA in a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were started by the addition of mouse liver homogenate (0.025 mg/ml) prepared in PBS and terminated after 30 min at 37 °C by adding 10 μl of 2 m HCl. Subsequently, the incubation mixtures were neutralized with 12 μl of MES/KOH (0.6 m/2 m) and deproteinized by adding 50 μl of acetonitrile. After centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatants were applied to a reverse-phase C18-column (Alltima, 250 × 4.6 mm; Alltech). Resolution of the different CoA esters was achieved by elution with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (25–37% (v/v)) in 16.9 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) under continuous monitoring of the absorbance at 254 nm. Bile Acyl-CoA:Amino Acid Acyltransferase Activity Measurements— Bile acyl-CoA:amino acid acyltransferase activity was measured with taurine and CA-CoA (chemically synthesized as described (20Rasmussen J.T. Borchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) as substrates. The incubations consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 20 mm taurine, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm CoA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm bovine serum albumin, and 200 μm CA-CoA in a final volume of 100 μl. The reactions were started by the addition of mouse liver homogenate (0.2 mg/ml) prepared in PBS and terminated after 30 min at 37 °C by the addition of 500 μl of acetonitrile. Fifty μlof [2,2,4,4-2H4]tauro-CA and [2,2,4,4-2H4]CA was added as an internal standard, and the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was evaporated under a stream of N2, and the residue was dissolved in 100 μl of MeOH/H2O (1:2). Five μl was injected into the HPLC tandem mass spectrometric system. Subcellular fractions were prepared from the liver of overnight fasted mice homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% ethanol (21van Veldhoven P.P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed for protein content, catalase (peroxisomal marker), lactate dehydrogenase (cytosolic marker) (21van Veldhoven P.P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and BAAT activity as described above. Northern Blotting—RNA was extracted from liver using the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described (22Huyghe S. Casteels M. Janssen A. Meulders L.

The blots were consecutively hybridized with radioactive probes and exposed. The probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR on mouse liver RNA using the following primers: mBAAT (5′-GCCAAGCTGACAGCTGTTC-3′ and 5′-AGGAGATGCCCAGCTCC-3′, based on BC012683), VLCS (5′-TGCCAGTGCTCTACACCG-3′ and 5′-TGCGAGGTCTATCGAGTTTC-3′, based on AF033031) (renamed to SLC27A2), mBACS (5′-GGGTATTTGGAAGAAACTAAC-3′ and 5′-GGACAACTTTGTGAAGCTG-3′, based on BC013272) (renamed to SLC27A5), mFXR (5′-ATGGTGATGCAGTTTCAGGGCTTAG-3′ and 5′-TCACTGCACATCCCAGATCTCACAG-3′, based on NM009108), and mβ-actin (5′-GCATTGTTACCAACTGGG-ACGACATGG-3′ and 5′-CTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′, based on NM007393). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed with antibodies against farnesoid X receptor (FXR), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4α), and calregulin. Mouse liver homogenate (50 μg in case of FXR and HNF4α, 25 μg for calregulin) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel essentially as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. After blocking of nonspecific binding sites with 50 g/liter Profitar and 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin in 1 g/liter Tween 20/PBS for 1 h, the blot was incubated for 2 h with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-FXR (diluted 1:200 in 3 g/liter bovine serum albumin; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-HNF4α (diluted 1:100; Perseus Proteomics Inc., Tokyo, Japan), or anti-calregulin (diluted 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-rabbit (FXR and calregulin) or goat anti-mouse (HNF4α) IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used for detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated using an unpaired Student's t test. The results were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. Bile Acid Analysis—Bile acids were analyzed in bile, liver, and plasma from LBP, DBP, and LBP:DBP DKO mice. Since almost no DKO mice survive beyond weaning, comparative analysis in mice from all the different genotypes could only be performed before postnatal day 21 (P21). Samples from the single knock-out mice were also analyzed at an adult age. In bile, liver, and plasma from wild type and LBP–/– mice (age <P21) the major bile acids were tauro-CA, tauro-muri-CA, and tauro-OH-CA. The mass spectra of bile from LBP–/– mice were similar to those from wild type mice (see Fig. 2), revealing only very limited amounts of bile acid biosynthesis intermediates. In contrast, C27-bile acid intermediates were the major bile acids in bile, liver, and plasma from both DBP–/– and DKO mice. DBP–/– mice accumulated mainly THCA with one double bond (THC:1), which has previously been identified by mass spectrometric analysis as the first intermediate of the peroxisomal β-oxidation process (14Baes M. Huyghe S. Carmeliet P. Declercq P.E. Collen D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16329-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). DKO mice, however, accumulated predominantly THCA itself or OH-THCA. The exact position of the hydroxyl group could not be identified, but the accumulating OH-THCA is most likely a mixture of THCA hydroxylated at several different positions, because multiple peaks were observed by HPLC for the molecule with m/z 465. In liver of both DBP–/– and DKO mice, the accumulation of C27-bile acid intermediates was accompanied by a severe deficiency of C24-bile acids (see Fig. 3). At P2–4 the liver of wild type animals contained 362 ± 88 nmol/g (wet weight) C24-bile acids, whereas the sum of all C24-bile acids in liver from DBP–/– mice was 34 ± 2 nmol/g, and in liver from the DKO mice 25 ± 10 nmol/g. This resulted in a C27/C24 ratio of 2.6 in DBP–/– mice and 5.1 in DKO mice versus a ratio of 0.01 in wild type mice. The total amount of bile acids (C24 + C27) was also reduced in DBP–/– and DKO mouse liver (in wild type animals 367 ± 87, in DBP–/– mice 121 ± 18, and in DKO mice 122 ± 30 nmol/g (w/w); see Fig. 3). At P10–11, the deficiency of C24-bile acids was even more pronounced in DKO mice (10 ± 3 nmol/g), resulting in a C27/C24 ratio of 13.3 in DKO mice versus 1.9 in DBP–/– mice. Surprisingly, at this age, livers from LBP–/– mice also contained reduced levels of C24-bile acids (243 ± 17 nmol/g versus 325 ± 80 nmol/g in wild type mice). In contrast to the DBP–/– and DKO mice, there was no gross accumulation of C27-bile acid intermediates in LBP–/– livers (6.2 ± 2.7 nmol/g in LBP–/– mice versus 3.2 ± 0.7 nmol/g in wild type mice, 84 ± 23 nmol/g in DBP–/– mice, and 130 ± 57 nmol/g in DKO mice). A comparative analysis of bile acid content was performed in liver from eight LBP:DBP–/–:+/+ and seven LBP:DBP–/–: +/– mice (P10–11) to study whether subtle changes between mice of these two genotypes could help clarify the role of LBP in bile acid biosynthesis. However, no differences in bile acid levels or patterns were found (see Table I). At P2–4 and in 6–10-week-old LBP–/– mice, the amount of C24-bile acids was completely normal. This was not the case in liver of DBP–/– mice, where C24-bile acids remained very low at all ages studied (P10–11, P21, 6–10 weeks).Table IBile acid levels in liver from LBP:DBP–/–:+/+ and LBP:DBP –/–:+/– mice (P10–11)Total C24-bile acidsTotal C27-bile acidsTotal bile acidsnmol/gLBP:DBP-/-:+/+ (n = 8)an = number.

Open table in a new tab Although the concentration of bile acids in plasma is low, the situation in the liver is relatively well reflected in plasma (Fig. 4). DBP–/– and DKO mice accumulate C27-bile acids, whereas they have a deficiency of C24-bile acids. This deficiency is most pronounced before weaning, but also at an adult age DBP–/– mice have statistically lower levels of C24-bile acids in their plasma. At P7–9, the sum of all C24-bile acids in plasma from DBP–/– mice is 3.5% from the C24-bile acids present in plasma from wild type animals. At P14–15, this is 7.7%; at P21 it is 27.6%; and at the age of 6–10 weeks it is 41.2%. This increasing percentage is not only due to a small increase in C24-bile acids of about 1.3-fold in DBP–/– mice but is mostly because of a strong decrease of bile acids in plasma from wild type animals (and also LBP–/– mice). Age-dependent changes in bile acid concentrations were even more pronounced in bile of DBP–/– mice (Fig. 5). C24-bile acids gradually increased with age, equaling levels in wild type mice at 5–6 months. At this age, bile from DBP–/– mice could only be distinguished from wild type and LBP–/– bile because of the presence of C27-bile acids. Together with a simultaneous age-dependent increase of C27-bile acids in bile of DBP–/– mice, this gave rise to elevated total bile acid levels in bile of 5–6-month-old DBP–/– mice. At all ages, the ratio of C27/C24-bile acids in bile of DBP–/– mice was much lower than in plasma and liver (at 6–10 weeks of age, the ratio was 1.2 in bile compared with 3.5 and 9.0 in liver and plasma, respectively).Fig. 5Bile acids measured in bile from wild type, LBP–/–, DBP–/–, and LBP:DBP–/–:–/– mice during development from the neonatal period until adulthood. Total C24-bile acids is the sum of t-(m)CA and (m)CA; total C27-bile acids is the sum of t-THCA, t-THC:1, OH-THCA, OH-THC:1, THCA, and THC:1; total bile acids is the sum of all C24- and C27-bile acids described above; the taurine/free C27 ratio is the ratio of the taurine-conjugated C27-bile acids over the free C27-bile acids described.

This age-dependent increase in conjugation of C27-bile acid intermediates was in sharp contrast to the situation with the C24-bile acids, which were already fully conjugated at P2–4 both in wild type and DBP–/– mice. Even in adult DBP–/– mice, about 23% of the C27-bile acids were unconjugated, whereas only 5% of the C24-bile acids were unconjugated in the same animals. Peroxisomal Acyl-CoA Oxidase Measurements—Because, in contrast to our expectation, DKO mice accumulated mainly THCA and hydroxylated THCA instead of THC:1, we measured peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase activities in liver from wild type, LBP–/–, DBP–/–, and DKO mice at P10–11 with THC-CoA, pristanoyl-CoA, and, for comparison, with C16-CoA (see Table II). The oxidation rate of pristanoyl-CoA and THC-CoA was markedly increased in DBP–/– as compared with wild type livers, which is in agreement with earlier results demonstrating increased protein levels for ACOX2 (14Baes M. Huyghe S. Carmeliet P. Declercq P.E. Collen D. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16329-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, in DKO mice, acyl-CoA oxidase activity measured with pristanoyl-CoA was strongly reduced and was even not detectable with THC-CoA as substrate. The residual conversion of pristanoyl-CoA could very well be due to the activity of ACOX3. The lack of THC-CoA oxidase activity explains the absence of THC:1 in liver, bile, and plasma from DKO mice.

https://openalex.org/W2135558166,"Amphiregulin (AR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) are growth factors known to promote non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival. We have previously published that 1) AR and IGF1, secreted by H358 NSCLC cells, cooperate to protect those cells and H322 NSCLC cells from serum-starved apoptosis; 2) H358 cells resist Bax-induced apoptosis through an inhibition of Bax conformational change. We show here that the antiapoptotic activity of the AR/IGF1 combination is specifically abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C and staurosporine, but not by the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors PD98059 and wortmannin, suggesting the involvement of a PKC-dependent and MAPK- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent survival pathway. The PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin restores apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. In addition, phosphorylation of PKCdelta and PKCzeta/lambda, but not of PKCalpha/beta(II), increases in serum-starved H358 cells and in H322 cells treated with an AR/IGF1 combination and is blocked by calphostin C. The combination of AR and IGF1 increases p90(rsk) and Bad phosphorylation as well as inhibiting the conformational change of Bax by a PKC-dependent mechanism. Finally, PKCdelta, PKCzeta, or p90(rsk) small interfering RNAs block the antiapoptotic activity of AR/IGF1 combination but have no effect on partial apoptosis inhibition observed with each factor used alone. Constitutively active PKC expression inhibits serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, whereas a catalytically inactive form of p90(rsk) restores it. Thus, AR and IGF1 cooperate to prevent apoptosis by activating a specific PKC-p90(rsk)-dependent pathway, which leads to Bad and Bax inactivation. This signaling pathway is different to that used by single factor."

This simplest UAUU motif was a small asymmetric internal loop.

Randomized RNA sequences readily fold into a variety of shapes with different functions. These functions include catalysis (ribozymes) and ligand binding (aptamers).

Among important functions is amino acid binding, which was arguably a crucial activity during the era when encoded polypeptide synthesis (translation) first appeared. Varied aliphatic, aromatic, polar, and basic amino acids are bound by RNA. For example, using in vitro selection or SELEX (6Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W.

In these binding sites, cognate codons and anticodons appear improbably concentrated; a probability of 5.4*10-11 on the assumption that affinity and coding sequences are unrelated (19Yarus M. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Yarus M. Knight R.D. Caporaso J.G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accordingly, amino acid binding sites and cognate amino acid triplets are not unrelated but instead strongly co-related. Therefore, we suppose that coding triplets were abstracted from larger ancestral RNAs that contained amino acid binding sites (21Yarus M. Knight R.D. Caporaso J.G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Aptamer selections can be constructed to favor the simplest molecular solutions that answer a particular selection regime. Such a “simplest” isoleucine-binding RNA has been selected (16Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using two different sets of primers. Here we report a novel isoleucine-binding RNA selected using different conditions. It is more complex than the simplest motif, 37.9 compared with 33.2 bits of information. Accordingly, it is our next simplest isoleucine binding structure. Notably, like the UAUU motif, which contains an isoleucine anticodon and codon, the new next simplest motif also has an isoleucine anticodon triplet among the functional nucleotides of the amino acid binding site. Information Content—Frequencies (Fi) of bases obtained from sequence alignment after doped selection of R431 have been used as estimated nucleotide probabilities (Pi). The final frequencies were normalized and adjusted to the skewed initial nucleotide probability at each position (0.7, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1). To normalize output frequencies each Fi after the selection was divided by the Fi before selection. Subsequently, for further calculations, each normalized Fi was divided by the sum of the normalized Fis. This method has been adopted from Carothers et al. (23Carothers J.M. Oestreich S.C. Davis J.H. Szostak J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The observed Shannon uncertainty, Hobs, was calculated for each nucleotide position of each motif using the equation: Hobs = -ΣPilog2Pi (i = A, G, C, or U). The calculated Hobs was subsequently subtracted from the maximum uncertainty possible Hmax (24Schneider T.D. Stormo G.D. Gold L. Ehrenfeucht A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). For random RNA Hmax is 2 bits/nucleotide position. Sampling error corrections were made for the information content calculations of both motifs. For the UAUU motif we used an approximate method to calculate the expectation of sampled uncertainty, AE(Hnb) = Hmax - (s - 1)/(2n * ln2), where s is number of symbols (4 for RNA), and n is number of analyzed sequences. For the newly selected motif we applied an exact method of calculation of the expectation of sampled uncertainty, Enb = ΣPnbHnb, where Pnb = n!/(na! ng! nc! nu!) * PanaPgngPcncPunu, and Hnb = -Σ (nb/n) log2 (nb/n), n is total number of bases in a given position in sequence alignment (n = number of A + number of G + number of C + number of U); analogously nb is number of given base, and na, ng, nc, nu, are the number of A, G, C, and U, respectively (24Schneider T.D. Stormo G.D. Gold L. Ehrenfeucht A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). For parts of stems that conserve only the ability to pair, shown in Fig. 6 as a black N, information content was computed as follows. There are 16 possible 2-nucleotide combinations at base-paired positions, maximum uncertainty is 4 bits/Watson-Crick base pair. For standard base pairings, uncertainty is 2 bits, so the information content is 2 bits (4 bits - 2 bits). We take G-U base pairs to also be acceptable, so 6 of 16 possibilities are “pairs.” The information content therefore is taken to be 1.5 bits per required base pair. For base pairs that showed preferences in nucleotide combination (colored pictograms in Fig. 6) information content was calculated based on observed frequencies among the 16 possibilities, as for dinucleotide probability.

The selection buffer contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. The elution buffer contained in addition 10 mm l-isoleucine. The column was washed after selection with 15 volumes of wash buffer, 1 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. For counter-selection, Sepharose blocked with acetyl groups instead of isoleucine was used. RNA was folded before applying to the column as follows: 65 °C for 3 min in water, adjusted to selection buffer, heating continued at 65 °C for next 45 s, and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Weakly bound RNA was eluted with 5.5–7-column volumes of column buffer. RNA retained on the column was eluted with 5 volumes of elution buffer (column buffer containing 10 mm l-isoleucine). 5 fractions (2.5-column volume) were collected and carried forward to amplification.

CMCT buffer was the same but contained borate (pH 8.0) instead of HEPES. Two concentration of isoleucine (2 or 10 mm) were used, with isoleucine-free buffer as a control. For an interference experiment RNA was modified with DMS or CMCT as described above. RNA after modification was purified on a P30 column (Bio-Rad). RNA was subsequently applied to isoleucine-EAH-Sepharose column. 1.5 or 2.5 volumes were collected from the void or elution peak, respectively; the same buffers as described for isoleucine selection were used. The primer extension method was used to identify modifications. Boundary Experiment—5′-End labeled ([γ32-P]ATP) R431 was partially hydrolyzed using 50 mm NaOH for 30 s, at 85 °C (28Ciesiolka J.

RNA was precipitated with EtOH, dissolved in water, folded as described under “Materials and Methods” for isoleucine selection, and applied to isoleucine-EAH-Sepharose column. Flow-through and eluted fractions were collected and analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. An RNA with 28 adjacent, initially randomized positions was subjected to isoleucine affinity selection using the previous affinity chromatography protocol (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Step by step description of this selection for isoleucine binding aptamers is available (25de Zwart I. Lozupone C. Knight R. Birmingham A. Illangasekare M. Jadhav V. Legiewicz M. Majerfeld I. Widman J. Yarus M. Hartmann R. Bindereif K. Schon A.A. Westhof E. Handbook of RNA Biochemistry. 2. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim2005: 783-806Google Scholar). An initial RNA pool containing 1012 unique sequences present in ∼2400 copies each, on average, was applied to a carboxyl-linked isoleucine-EAH-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 5.5–7-column volumes of buffer. Bound RNA was eluted with 2.5 volumes of the same buffer with 10 mm l-isoleucine. RNA was reverse-transcribed, amplified by PCR, and T7-transcribed to obtain next generation of RNA. Negative selection was included after the first cycle by taking the first 60% emerging from an acetylated control column for use in the subsequent affinity selection. After the fifth cycle an initial elution peak appeared (11.8% of applied RNA), and elution increased gradually to the seventh cycle (18.5% of applied RNA). The isoleucine-eluted population after seven cycles was cloned, sequenced, and aligned with ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). A total of 69 sequences was compared. A new isoleucine motif dominated the selected sequences. The frequency of this aptamer was 50.8% of the sequenced pool. Positional variation suggests at least 10 different parental sequences containing the motif were present in the initial pool (Fig. 1A). The percentage composition for each nucleotide position within the new motif is summarized in Fig. 1B. Binding and elution profiles for five RNAs are shown in Fig. 1C. For the most frequently appearing sequence (R431) KD is 0.9 mm. This is ∼2-fold lower than the UAUU motif selected previously (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast with every other selection for isoleucine binding RNA (16Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), there was only one sequence (1.4%) that fitted the UAUU motif: UACG(N8)CUAUUGGG (conserved nucleotide positions are italic, boldfaced, and underlined). This sequence, however, does not significantly bind the affinity column. Mfold (30Walter A.E. Turner D.H. Kim J. Lyttle M.H. Muller P. Mathews D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9218-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) predicts that this sequence does not stably fold the asymmetrical loop of the UAUU motif (not shown). It may therefore be present in active form only a small fraction of the time. We also recovered nonspecific column binding sequences isolated previously. These shared the sequence GUACGCCU (VG2 of Lozupone et al. (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which was recovered 7 times (not shown). New Isoleucine Motif—To define the minimal active length of the newly selected RNA we carried out a boundary experiment, randomly truncating 5′-labeled RNA with sodium hydroxide (Fig. 2). This procedure delimited a minimal functional RNA ending at nucleotide 61. Based on the observation that the truncated molecule does not require the last 7 nucleotides from the 3′-end, it appears that the corresponding part of the initial stem is dispensable; it can be shortened to 9 base pairs with a one-nucleotide bulge (compare Fig. 3C with 5). Accordingly, a predicted smaller active structure was 39 nucleotides (G23–C61; the 3′-boundary is marked on the thermodynamically favored structure in Fig. 5). This surmise was confirmed by construction of a functional site spanning the terminal loop, 41-R431, with a stem lengthened by one base pair from the assumed minimal structure. The original pair C22-G62 was converted to G-C (Fig. 3C) to aid T7 RNA polymerase transcription.Fig. 3Comparison of short isoleucine aptamers, 36-UAUU and 41-R431. A, profiles of binding and elution from isoleucine-EAH-Sepharose column. B and C, thermodynamically most probable secondary structures calculated by mfold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Shortening R431 left a functional aptamer. We compared column affinity for minimal structures having both motifs. Profiles of binding of 41-R431 and a shortened version of the UAUU motif (36-UAUU) are similar (Fig. 3A). Secondary structures of both RNAs calculated by mfold (30Walter A.E. Turner D.H. Kim J. Lyttle M.H. Muller P. Mathews D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9218-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) are compared in Fig. 3, B and C. The binding site was more closely defined by chemical evidence. A modification-interference assay with CMCT (U and G) or DMS (A and C) indicates that the tract 34GGUAUUG40 and positions A42, A43 and 45GA46 are crucial for binding (Fig. 4B). These positions are also marked on the structure shown in Fig. 5. In addition, protection/enhancement of the accessibility of site nucleotides to DMS and CMCT in the presence of isoleucine ligand was surveyed. CMCT chemical probing shows enhancements at positions U36, U39, G45, G47, and U48 in the presence of 10 mm l-isoleucine (data not shown). Positions showing enhancements are also likely to be close to the site of contact with isoleucine ligand, and are marked in Fig. 5. For the case of DMS probing no significant differences in reactivity were detected at 0, 2, and 10 mm isoleucine. Viewed on the hairpin structure in Fig. 5, the chemically implicated nucleotides are all conserved members of the hairpin loop. Doped reselection of R431, which has the most frequently recovered sequence, was undertaken to confirm these essential positions. 39 nucleotides spanning the loop were mutagenized (positions G23–C61 in Fig. 5). Starting from 1015 molecules of single-stranded DNA 3 cycles of selection were applied. The initial amount of DNA should have been enough to cover all possible sequences that are ≤8 mutational changes different from the original one. For comparison, the total number of sequences that are ≤12 mutational changes different from the original one is 2.4*1015 (31Knight R.D. Yarus M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e30Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After the third cycle, isoleucine elution reached 41% of RNA; this pool was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of 61 sequences showed that A50, A51, and A52 are essential elements, because they are perfectly conserved. These three adenosines were supplied as a part of primer complement sequences in the initial selection (Fig. 5, lowercase letters). The rest of the conserved nucleotide positions were as in the initial selection (compare Fig. 1B with 6A). In summary, 15 of 20 positions in the terminal loop are invariant; the consensus sequence of the loop is 33CGGUAAUGNRAUGANUHAAA52 (R = G or A; H = A, C, or U). From these data, we calculated information for each mutagenized nucleotide position (24Schneider T.D. Stormo G.D. Gold L. Ehrenfeucht A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) as Information Content = Hmax - Hobs (in bits/nucleotide position), where Hmax is the maximum Shannon uncertainty possible (2 bits for RNA), and Hobs is the observed Shannon uncertainty calculated based on nucleotide frequencies in the alignment of sequences of binding aptamers. Maps of the information content for the newly selected hairpin (Fig. 6A) and the UAUU internal loop motif (Fig. 6B) are shown. The secondary structure used for the new motif was the most probable structure calculated by BayesFold (32Knight R.D. Birmingham A. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) based on the alignment of 54 sequences of equal length obtained from doped selection. The calculation of information content was done based on 61 sequences with initial nucleotide probabilities of 0.7, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1. The differences in the height of characters within a given nucleotide position were computed by the web script RNA Structure Logo (33Gorodkin J. Heyer L.J. Brunak S. Stormo G.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 583-586PubMed Google Scholar) to reflect the calculated information content. There is evidently high information content in the loop and the first base pair of the stem, where a C-G pair is preferred over other pairs (including G-C). According to our calculations, the rest of the stem is probably required only for loop stabilization. Finally, the loop has five informational regions 33CGGUAAUG40, 42RA43, 45GA46, 48U, and 50AAA52 (possibly “site nucleotides”; Fig. 6A), which are separated by single much less informatively significant positions (possibly “joints”). The map secondary structure of the UAUU motif was also computed from reselection data (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The information content for the UAUU motif was based on 72 sequences with initial nucleotide probabilities of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.25 (Fig. 6B). The approximate information content for the newly selected binding site including necessary stems is 37.9 bits versus 33.2 bits for the original UAUU internal loop motif. As does the UAUU motif, the hairpin requires low levels (0.1–0.4 mm) of zinc ions for amino acid affinity (not shown). Finally, with regard to specificity; the hairpin motif does not distinguish isoleucine and leucine (Fig. 7). Even for glycine, some elution is seen, although most of the RNA sticks to the column until the high salt wash (Fig. 7). Leucine and glycine affinity suggest that the site is not highly focused on the details of the isoleucine side chain; certainly it is less side chain-specific than the original UAUU motif (16Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have selected a new aptamer, a hairpin with a 20-nucleotide loop (Figs. 5 and 6A) within which are all the essential nucleotides for an isoleucine binding site. Thus the new motif likely poises loop nucleotides to create a site for the ligand. This site binds l-isoleucine, although with affinity for similar amino acids (Fig. 7). However, considering that this is the second smallest isoleucine site we have selected, we note that the site embraces a conserved isoleucine anticodon sequence, AAU. Therefore, this is another example of a simple RNA aptamer, which contains coding triplets for a bound amino acid, consistent with the escaped triplet theory of the origin of the genetic code (21Yarus M. Knight R.D. Caporaso J.G. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The force of this observation is less than usual, however. We have usually required side chain-specific affinity for cognate amino acids, reasoning that specificity would be essential to a site used for coding; e.g. see Illangasekare and Yarus (18Illangasekare M. Yarus M. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 298-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Side chain specificity usually appears as an unselected by-product of selection on particular amino acid, but this new hairpin is not as selective for isoleucine (Fig. 7), as was the UAUU motif (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the new motif might be offered as experimental support for ambiguous primordial coding among chemically similar amino acids (Fig. 7). This is a possibility often advanced on purely theoretical grounds but also is implicit in a stereochemical origin for the code like the escaped triplet rationale. The newly selected aptamer does not take functional advantage of its somewhat larger size; its KD for isoleucine is only ∼2-fold lower with 4.7 bits more information, a lesser dependence on size than suggested previously (23Carothers J.M. Oestreich S.C. Davis J.H. Szostak J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, individual aptamer structures may be quite idiosyncratic, with the information/function relation visible only in the mean of many examples. The relaxed side chain specificity of the hairpin (Fig. 7) does suggest that a single index like KD may be too narrow a criterion for comparison with molecular information content. Finally, we consider why the simplest motif was not the most frequent outcome. Smaller RNA motifs are expected to initially be most frequent, because abundance in an unfractionated randomized pool is expected to increase exponentially as the number of required nucleotides decreases. On the other hand more active or more easily amplified RNA structures can sometimes be selected instead of simpler ones (25de Zwart I. Lozupone C. Knight R. Birmingham A. Illangasekare M. Jadhav V. Legiewicz M. Majerfeld I. Widman J. Yarus M. Hartmann R. Bindereif K. Schon A.A. Westhof E. Handbook of RNA Biochemistry. 2. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim2005: 783-806Google Scholar) in prolonged selections. For example, it has been suggested (for GTP binding) that 10-fold tighter binding can result from ∼10 more bits of information (for example, in five completely specified nucleotides), equivalent to ∼1000-fold decrease in abundance (23Carothers J.M. Oestreich S.C. Davis J.H. Szostak J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, this line of reasoning is very un-promising in our case. Firstly, the selection stringency was not set higher than previously (16Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Selection succeeded at the fifth cycle, and was halted after the seventh cycle, so simple motifs should survive. Previous selections dominated by the UAUU motif were stopped at the sixth or eighth cycles for a 26 or 22 nucleotide random region, respectively (22Lozupone C. Changayil S. Majerfeld I. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Even more convincing, similar previous selections failed to detect the hairpin, which has only about a 2-fold KD advantage. Thus, we must look for other explanations. Here we have calculated information content to characterize size. In these terms, why is a more complex structure containing ∼37.9 bits of information (the new hairpin) 35-fold more prevalent than the previously defined simplest 33.2-bit structure (the UAUU internal loop)? The hairpin should be 26-fold (237.9 divided by 233.2) less frequent on the basis of complexity, about a 910-fold (= 35 × 26) disparity from our actual result. In rationalizing this selection outcome, we suggest two important influences: the accidental inclusion of an AAA sequence in the 3′-primer site, later proven to be essential for hairpin activity (Fig. 6A), and use of a short 28-nucleotide random tract. The presence of the first condition can be considered as a supply of six bits of information, equivalent to a ∼64-fold increase in abundance favoring the newly selected hairpin. With six bits of information subtracted, only 31.9 additional bits are required for the newly selected motif. This inverts the abundances, making the hairpin loop ∼2.5-fold (233.2 divided by 231.9) more frequent than the UAUU motif. The second condition will limit or eliminate the advantage of modularity for the UAUU motif, removing a potential statistical advantage of the smaller motif; the UAUU motif has two modules (34Yarus M. Knight R.D. de Pouplana L. The Genetic Code and Origin of Life. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 75-91Google Scholar, 35Knight R.D. Yarus M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the hairpin one. Consequently the UAUU motif will not benefit from its usual statistical advantage; in a larger randomized region the UAUU motif might be the only observed outcome. Finally, there is a subtle condition whose significance is difficult to judge. Here we used new primer sites. These sequences are not complementary to each other, so they do not supply an initial formed stem that can be captured in selected structures. Because the UAUU motif can benefit in two ways from the initiation of helices, it might be disproportionately penalized when no helix is supplied. Thus, several experimental features (possibly combined with unseen stochastic factors) produced a new outcome. In summary; although primer design is a little explored aspect of selection planning, it clearly can be decisive and deserves attention.

https://openalex.org/W2067108180,"Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a novel immunosuppressant isolated from Streptomyces sp. that binds strongly to the human immunophilin cyclophilin A (CypA). SFA exerts its immunosuppressive activity through a mode of action different from that of all other known immunophilin-binding substances, namely cyclosporine A (CsA), FK506, and rapamycin. We have determined the crystal structure of human CypA in complex with SFA at 1.6 Å resolution. The high resolution of the structure revealed the absolute configuration at all 17 chiral centers of SFA as well as the details of the CypA/SFA interactions. In particular, it was shown that the 22-membered macrocycle of SFA is deeply embedded in the same binding site as CsA and forms six direct hydrogen bonds with CypA. The effector domain of SFA, on the other hand, has a chemical and three-dimensional structure very different from CsA, already strongly suggesting different immunosuppressive mechanisms. Furthermore, two CypA·SFA complexes form a dimer in the crystal as well as in solution as shown by light scattering and size exclusion chromatography experiments. This observation raises the possibility that the dimer of CypA·SFA complexes is the molecular species mediating the immunosuppressive effect.

More than 2 decades ago, the discovery of cyclosporine A (CsA) 1The abbreviations used are: CsA, cyclosporine A; CypA, cyclophilin A; SFA, sanglifehrin A; r.m.s, root mean square; Pip, piperazic acid; vdW, van der Waals; Bmt, (4R)-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]-4-methyl-l-threonine; Abu, (l)-α-aminobutyric acid. 1The abbreviations used are: CsA, cyclosporine A; CypA, cyclophilin A; SFA, sanglifehrin A; r.m.s, root mean square; Pip, piperazic acid; vdW, van der Waals; Bmt, (4R)-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]-4-methyl-l-threonine; Abu, (l)-α-aminobutyric acid. allowed spectacular progress in the field of organ transplantation (1Kallen J. Mikol V. Quesniaux V.F.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Schneider-Scherzer E. Schoergendorfer K. Weber K. Fliri H.G. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Biotechnology. 7. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1997: 536-591Google Scholar). Since then the search for novel immunosuppressants that interfere with T cell activation/proliferation has resulted in the isolation of several new molecules from natural sources (2Anderson P.S. Kenyon G.L. Marshall G.R. Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design. ESCOM Science Publishers, Leiden, The Netherlands1994: 3-248Google Scholar). The most prominent examples are FK506 and rapamycin. Besides their important therapeutic use, these drugs have also proven to be powerful tools for dissecting signal transduction pathways at the molecular level (3Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the biological activity of CsA, FK506, and rapamycin is mediated by intracellular binding proteins called immunophilins. CsA binds to cyclophilins (e.g. cyclophilin A (CypA)), whereas FK506 and rapamycin bind to FK506-binding proteins (e.g. FK506-binding protein-12). Immunophilin binding is required but not sufficient for the immunosuppressive activity of these drugs. Each complex interacts with a third partner, the effector protein, to achieve the full biological response. Thus, the CypA·CsA and FK506-binding protein-12-FK506 complexes inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby blocking the production of cytokines, including interleukin-2 (4Liu J. Farmer Jr, J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). The FK506-binding protein-12-rapamycin complex inhibits the kinase FK506-binding protein-12/rapamycin-associated protein kinase (also known as RAFT or mTOR (5Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B.

We have screened microbial broth extracts to identify CypA ligands with an immunosuppressive mechanism different from CsA (i.e. searching for the “rapamycin counterpart,” which binds to CypA). This search resulted in the isolation from Streptomyces sp. A92–308110 of a new class of compounds named sanglifehrins (7Sanglier J-J. Quesniaux V. Fehr T. Hofmann H. Mahnke M. Memmert K. Schuler W.

Antibiot. 1999; 52: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among the 20 different sanglifehrins isolated so far, sanglifehrin A (SFA) is the most abundant component (Fig. 1A). The affinity of SFA for CypA in a cell-free assay is remarkably high (IC50 = 6.9 nm) (i.e. approximately 60-fold higher than that of CsA) (IC50 = 420 nm) (9Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F.J. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J-J. Fehr T. J. Immunology. 2001; 166: 7165-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SFA displays potent immunosuppressive activity in the murine mixed lymphocyte reaction (IC50 = 170 nm), an in vitro immune response assay (9Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F.J. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J-J. Fehr T. J. Immunology. 2001; 166: 7165-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The details of the mechanism by which SFA exerts its immunosuppressive activity at the molecular level are still under intense investigation. The first results describing the effects of SFA on T cells (10Zhang L-H. Liu J.O. J. Immunology. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Zhang L-H. Youn H.-D. Liu J.O. J.

Immunology. 2004; 172: 6482-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were published in the last few years. These data clearly indicate that SFA acts via a mode of action that is different from that of all other known immunophilin-binding compounds, namely CsA, FK506, and rapamycin. In addition to its interesting biological profile, SFA has a unique chemical structure. The compound consists of a 22-membered macrocycle, bearing in position 23 a nine-carbon tether terminated by a highly substituted spirobicyclic moiety. The macrolide contains an E,E-diene, a short polypropionate fragment, and a tripeptide unit composed of valine and two unusual amino acids, piperazic acid and meta-tyrosine. It is the β-nitrogen of piperazic acid that is involved in the amide bond formation, which stands in contrast to all other piperazic acid containing natural products isolated so far. The unique chemical structure of sanglifehrin combined with its immunosuppressive activity generated broad interest. Chemical efforts resulted in the synthesis of several fragments and finally culminated with the total syntheses by Nicolaou et al. (15Nicolaou K.C. Murphy F. Barluenga S. Ohshima T. Wei H. Xu J.

Soc. 2002; 124: 4257-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, degradation and synthetic work on the SFA macrocycle, together with x-ray analysis of the 22-membered macrocycle alone bound to CypA, has been published recently (17Sedrani R. Kallen J. Cabrejas L.M. Papageorgiou C.D. Senia F. Rohrbach S. Wagner D. Thai B. Erne A.M. France J. Berer L. Rihs G. Zenke G. Wagner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 3849-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of the complex between human CypA and SFA. The high resolution of the x-ray data allowed the determination of the absolute configuration of all chiral centers of SFA and revealed the details of the CypA/SFA interactions. Furthermore, the structure of the CypA·SFA complex was compared with the structure of the CypA·CsA complex, since both immunosuppressants bind to the active site of CypA. Also, the finding that the CypA·SFA complex is present as a dimer in the crystal as well as in solution raises the possibility that the immunosuppressive effect of SFA might be mediated through a dimer of CypA·SFA complexes. Protein Preparation, Crystallization, and Data Collection—Human CypA was purified to homogeneity and SFA was obtained as described (7Sanglier J-J. Quesniaux V. Fehr T. Hofmann H. Mahnke M. Memmert K. Schuler W. Zenke G. Gschwind L. Maurer C. Schilling W. J. Antibiot. 1999; 52: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The complex CypA·SFA was prepared by adding the ligand (100 mm solution in ethanol) in a 3-fold molar excess to the protein solution (12 mg/ml cyclophilin A, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0). Cocrystallization was performed using a standard vapor diffusion hanging drop set-up, with VDX crystallization plates and siliconized microscope coverslips from Hampton Research. Crystallization droplets were made by mixing on the coverslips 1.0 μl of the protein solution with 1.0 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 700 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Commercially available screening kits from Hampton Research were used to find preliminary crystallization conditions. In the refined conditions, crystals grow within 3 weeks at 20 °C to a size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm3 with a reservoir of 80 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. A crystal was mounted in a glass capillary for data collection at 20 °C. X-ray diffraction data (347 frames of 1° rotation) were collected with a mar345 detector at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, using a wavelength of,λ = 0.873 Å. Intensity data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors with the CCP4 suite (19Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The molecular replacement solution was found with X-PLOR, version 3.1 (20Bruenger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar), using the protein coordinates of CypA (21Kallen J. Spitzfaden C. Zurini M. Wider G. Widmer H. Wuethrich K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nature. 1991; 353: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and diffraction data from 8 to 3 Å. For the subsequent refinement steps, all data from 15 to 1.6 Å were used. The two complexes were refined without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Alternate cycles of model building with the graphics program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refinement yielded a model with 256 added water molecules, but no ligands yet, with an R-factor of 23.2%. The resulting 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps were of excellent quality for the missing ligands and allowed the clear determination of the absolute configurations at all 17 chiral centers of SFA. Further refinement with REFMAC version 5.0 (23Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar), water insertion with ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar), and rebuilding steps yielded the final model, consisting of two complexes CypA·SFA (including residues 2–165 of CypA) and a total of 361 water molecules, which has an R-factor of 16.3% and Rfree of 18.5% (no σ cut-off, 15 to 1.60 Å, working set of 39,452 unique reflections, test set of 2096 reflections). The quality of the model was assessed with PROCHECK version 3.3 (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and REFMAC. 86.5% of the amino acids are in the most favored region, and 13.5% are in the additionally allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (no amino acids are in disallowed regions). The overall G-factor is 0.16, with r.m.s. bond lengths of 0.007 Å and r.m.s. bond angles of 1.18°. Buried solvent-accessible areas were calculated with the program AREAIMOL as implemented in the CCP4 suite (19Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Dynamic Light Scattering and Size Exclusion Chromatography— Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed with a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument in conjunction with the software package “Dynamics (version 3.30),” both from Protein Solutions Ltd. The complexes were prepared as 1:1 mixtures of CypA and ligand (both at 56 μm), in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and measurements were performed at 20 °C. Size exclusion chromatography to detect monomer/dimer formation was done by injecting samples of 40-μl total volume containing 29 μm CypA and 126 μm ligand (or no ligand, as a reference) at pH 7.0 in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The 5 × 100-mm column was packed with BioGel P30 (45–90 μm) from Bio-Rad, and the flow rate was 0.06 ml/min. The collected fractions with CypA (detected at 210, 254, and 280 nm) were then subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis for verification of complex formation and molecular weight of ligand. The SFA-binding Site—We have determined the three-dimensional structure of CypA bound to SFA by x-ray crystallography. The 1.6 Å resolution data were phased by molecular replacement using CypA (21Kallen J. Spitzfaden C. Zurini M. Wider G. Widmer H. Wuethrich K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nature. 1991; 353: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) as a search model, yielding a dimer of CypA·SFA complexes as solution. The atomic structure includes residues 2–165 of two CypA molecules, two SFA ligands and a total of 361 water molecules. The results of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table I. The high resolution of the x-ray data allowed the determination of the absolute configuration of all 17 asymmetric centers of the macrocyclic and spirobicyclic fragments of SFA (Fig. 1, A and B).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsParametersValuesData collectionSpace groupP212121a (Å)62.6b (Å)65.4c (Å)76.6Resolution range (Å)aNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.15.0 to 1.60 (1.66 to 1.60)ReflectionsMeasured (n)179,130Unique (n)41,593RsymaNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.0.075 (0.456)Completeness (%)aNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.99.2 (100.0)<I/σ (I)>aNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.16.4 (1.9)RefinementResolution range (Å)aNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.15.0 to 1.60 (1.64 to 1.60)Reflections usedI > 0σ39,452ln Rfree2096R-factoraNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.0.163 (0.227)RfreeaNumbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.0.185 (0.238)No. of molecules in asymmetric unitProtein/ligand2Water361r.m.s. deviation between NCSbNoncrystallographic symmetry.-related protein molecules (Å)0.255Average B factor for nonhydrogen atoms (Å2); number of atomsProtein (chains A/B)16.4/14.4; 1258/1258Ligand (chains L/M)11.1/11.2; 78/78Water molecules (chains V/W)38.7/34.6; 187/174r.m.s. deviation bond lengths (Å)0.007r.m.s. deviation bond angles (degrees)1.183a Numbers in parentheses are calculated using data from the highest resolution bin.b Noncrystallographic symmetry. Open table in a new tab CypA is an enzyme that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds (1Kallen J. Mikol V. Quesniaux V.F.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Schneider-Scherzer E. Schoergendorfer K. Weber K. Fliri H.G. Rehm H.-J. Reed G. Biotechnology. 7. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1997: 536-591Google Scholar). Like CsA, SFA binds to the active site of CypA (Fig. 2). In particular, the piperazic acid (Pip) moiety of SFA occupies the same hydrophobic pocket of CypA that is used by the proline ring of the model substrate Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala (26Kallen J. Walkinshaw M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), by the proline ring of dipeptides (27Zhao Y. Ke H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7362-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and by the side chain of Me-Val11 for CsA (1Kallen J. Mikol V. Quesniaux V.F.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Schneider-Scherzer E.

Biol. 1993; 234: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). This hydrophobic pocket is formed by the amino acids Phe60, Met61, Phe113, and Leu122 of CypA. The tripeptide moiety Pip-meta-Tyr-Val of SFA forms six direct hydrogen bond interactions (cut-off 3.2 Å) with four amino acids of the protein (Fig. 3A). Three of these amino acids (Arg55, Gln63, and His126) make intermolecular hydrogen bonds through their side chains, whereas one amino acid (Asn102) forms an antiparallel β-sheet interaction with the ligand through its main chain. In detail, these hydrogen bonds are located between NE2-His126 and the meta-tyrosine hydroxy group (2.71 Å/2.73 Å), between the main-chain nitrogen of Asn102 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of meta-tyrosine (2.99 Å/2.96 Å), between the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn102 and the main-chain nitrogen of meta-tyrosine (2.80 Å/2.85 Å), between NE2-Gln63 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of valine (3.03 Å/3.03 Å), between OE1-Gln63 and the α-nitrogen of the piperazic acid (3.06 Å/3.10 Å), and between NH2-Arg55 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of valine (3.21 Å/3.19 Å). In the latter list, distances are given between heteroatoms in the two independently refined complexes of the asymmetric unit (the averaged values are displayed in Fig. 3A). In addition, SFA makes two water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the protein, namely between the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of valine and NH1-Arg55, NE2-His54, and CO-Gly72 and between the C31 hydroxyl and N-Trp121. The latter interaction and/or the side-chain reorientation of Trp121 enforced by the binding of SFA (see below) could account for the change in Trp121 fluorescence described previously (29Pemberton T.J. Kay J.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The 3-oxo-butyl side chain attached at C14 extends on the surface of the complex and does not form important interactions with the protein. The C15 hydroxy group points toward a pocket in the cyclophilin structure occupied by water molecules, whereas the methyl group at C16 is directed toward the interior surface of the macrolide, and the C17 hydroxy group is exposed to the solvent. The E,E-diene region C18–C22 of the macrocycle is not involved in direct contacts with the protein but forms vdW contacts with the meta-tyrosine of SFA in the dyad-related monomer. The linker region C24-C32 between the macrocycle and the spirobicyclic moiety makes vdW contacts with side-chain atoms from amino acids Ile57, Phe60, Thr119, and Trp121. The presence of the linker region of SFA imposes a side-chain reorientation on Trp121, compared with unliganded CypA (30Ke H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, within the spirobicycle, only the methyl group C45 makes vdW contacts with side-chain atoms from Ile57 and Phe60. Upon complex formation of the monomer, a total of 1232/1225 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface from CypA and SFA is buried (547/547 Å2 from the protein molecules and 685/678 Å2 from the SFA ligands). In the latter list, values are given for the two independently refined complexes of the asymmetric unit.Fig. 3Comparison of the CypA·SFA and CypA·CsA complexes. A, detailed view of the interactions between the macrocycle of SFA (ball-and-stick model, cyan) and CypA (stick model, yellow). There are six direct intermolecular hydrogen bonds (cut-off 3.2 Å) formed by the tripeptide moiety Pip-meta-Tyr-Val of SFA. The distances indicated are averaged over the two independently refined complexes of the dimer. B, detailed view of the interactions between CsA (ball-and-stick model, magenta) and CypA (stick model, white). The projected view is identical to the one in A. There are five direct intermolecular hydrogen bonds (cut-off 3.2 Å) made by CsA (the hydrogen bond between CO-MeLeu10 and NE1-Trp121 is only indicated in the scheme at the right). The main side-chain differences between the complexes CypA·SFA and CypA·CsA occur for Trp121 (not shown) and Arg55.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following amino acids have a nonhydrogen atom closer than 4 Å to the ligand SFA in both independently refined monomers: Arg55, Ile57, Gly59, Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Gly72, Thr73, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Gln111, Phe113, Thr119, and His126. The average B-factor for the ligand (11.1 Å2) is lower than the average B-factor for the protein (15.4 Å2), consistent with the fact that excellent electron density for all nonhydrogen atoms of SFA is visible. The most flexible regions of SFA, with B-factors > 15 Å2, are the 3-oxo-butyl side chain and the ethyl group attached to the spirobicycle at C40. Overall, the x-ray crystal structure of SFA bound to CypA confirms that the affinity of the ligand for CypA is primarily mediated by the 22-membered macrocycle, whereas the spirobicyclic unit remains essential for the immunosuppressive activity. Comparison of the CypA·SFA and CypA·CsA Complexes: A Case of Induced Fit and Binding with Opposite Peptide Backbone Directions—A least squares superposition of CypA·SFA and CypA·CsA shows that the protein backbones are similar in both complexes. The r.m.s. deviation of Cα positions for CypA in complex with SFA (monomer A in the present structure) and CsA (accession code 1CWA), using residues 2–165, is 0.30 Å. The largest difference in the position of backbone atoms occurs for the 68–73 loop, with maximal deviations of 1.7 and 1.4 Å for the Cαs of Asn71 and Gly72, respectively. In addition, there are two important side-chain differences in the ligand binding pockets that occur for Arg55 (Fig. 3, A and B) and Trp121. These latter differences are essential for binding the two respective ligands. The side chain of Arg55, mediating a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of valine (SFA), rotates into a new position in the CypA·CsA complex in order to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of MeLeu12 (CsA) and to avoid a steric clash with Val5 (CsA). In return, the latter position of Arg55 from the Cyp·CsA complex would lead to a steric clash with the ester and diene groups of SFA. The side chain of Trp121 rotates into a new position in the CypA·CsA complex in order to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of MeLeu9 (CsA). In return, the latter position of Trp121 from the CypA·CsA complex would lead to a steric clash with the linker that extends between the macrocycle and spirobicycle of SFA. These two fundamental side-chain adaptations can be regarded as examples of induced fit in order to bind two chemically very different ligands. Interestingly, the parts of the backbone moieties of the tripeptides Pip-meta-Tyr-Val (SFA) and MeVal11-MeBmt1-Abu2 (CsA) that undergo key interactions with CypA superimpose closely in space, although the peptide directionalities are opposite (Fig. 4). In particular, the carbonyl groups of valine (SFA) and MeBmt1 (CsA), both mediating the hydrogen bond with NE2-Gln63, superimpose. The situation is very similar for the carbonyl groups of meta-Tyr (SFA) and MeVal11 (CsA), both mediating the hydrogen bond (weaker in the case of CsA) with the backbone nitrogen N-Asn102. Also, the backbone nitrogens of meta-Tyr (SFA) and Abu2 (CsA) are positioned in such a way that they both can mediate a hydrogen bond with CO-Asn102. Whereas both immunosuppressants SFA and CsA, despite their completely different chemical structures, fit nicely into the active site of CypA, their effector domains are clearly very different, already strongly suggesting that the respective immunosuppressive mechanisms are different. Indeed, a superposition with the ternary complex CypA·CsA·calcineurin (31Huai Q. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Zhao Y. Mondragon A. Liu J.O. Ke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12037-12042Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 32Jin L. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13522-13526Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) shows that CypA·SFA cannot interact with calcineurin. Structure of the Local Dimer of CypA·SFA Complexes: The Dimer Hypothesis—The two CypA·SFA complexes are related by an approximate local dyad axis (rotation angle = 176°, calculated from the least squares superposition of protomers A and B using residues 2–165), which is located between the two SFA ligands and oriented almost parallel to the longest dimension of SFA (Fig. 5, A and B). The slight disturbance of the C2 symmetry can be explained by crystal packing (see below). With the exception of the spirobicyclic and α-ketobutyrate moieties (which extend toward the outside of the dimeric complex), all of the remaining parts of the SFA ligands are deeply buried in the dimer. Upon dimer formation, a total of 1504 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface from the two monomers is buried (721 Å2 from the protein molecules and 783 Å2 from the SFA ligands). Interestingly, these values are even larger than the ones for monomer complex formation itself (see above). The two SFA ligands make extensive vdW contacts with each other along the local dyad. In particular, the meta-tyrosine side chain is in close proximity to the E,E-diene fragment of the neighboring SFA molecule, and the C26–C28 fragments form vdW contacts with each other. In addition, a number of water-mediated hydrogen bonds are formed between the two SFA ligands (e.g. between the C41 carbonyl oxygen and the C31 hydroxy group), between a SFA ligand and the neighboring protein molecule of the dimer (e.g. between the C17 hydroxy group and the Asn102 side chain), and between the two protein molecules. Finally, a direct hydrogen bond links NE1-TrpA121 and CO-ArgB148 (distance 3.1 Å). The two CypA·SFA complexes in the asymmetric unit were refined without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. They show an r.m.s deviation of 0.26 Å for the Cα positions of residues 2–165 after least squares superposition. The main side-chain differences in proximity of the SFA binding site occur for Trp121, Lys125, and Arg148. These differences can be explained by differences in crystal contacts: for protomer A, ArgA148 is involved in a salt bridge with GluB′134 of a neighboring protomer B′ in the lattice and thus adopts a different side-chain conformation than ArgB148. As a consequence, TrpB121, which stacks on ArgA148, adopts a different side-chain conformation than TrpA121. Finally, LysA125, which stacks on TrpA121, adopts a different side-chain conformation than LysB125. Since the side-chain conformations of TrpA121 and LysA125 are not influenced by crystal packing, they probably represent the state for the dimer in solution. The fact that the crystallographically observed CypA·SFA dimer is stabilized by numerous interactions raised the possibility that this dimer also exists in solution. Toward this end, monomer/dimer formation was followed by size exclusion chromatography as well as dynamic light scattering. Using the latter method, CypA alone has an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa, the actual mass being 18 kDa. In contrast, the apparent molecular mass of the CypA·SFA complex was 31 kDa, clearly confirming the existence of a dimer in solution. In a further experiment, a SFA derivative was tested that retains a high affinity for CypA but for which dimer formation is predicted to be impaired. The apparent molecular mass of (26S,27S)-dihydroxysanglifehrin A (33Metternich R. Denni D. Thai B. Sedrani R. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 9632-9639Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in complex with CypA is 17 kDa, confirming the prediction, based on the crystal structure, that the two additional hydroxy groups would lead to steric clashes with themselves and thus block dimerization (in the intact dimer, the atoms C26 and C27 are at distances of 3.8 and 4.0 Å with their corresponding partners) (Fig. 5B). Also, size exclusion chromatography (followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy for verification of complex formation and molecular mass of ligand) showed that CypA complexed with the latter derivative displayed a retention time (6.5–7 min), which is very similar to unliganded CypA and CypA·CsA and thus corresponds to a monomer. CypA bound to the 22-membered SFA macrocycle (17Sedrani R. Kallen J. Cabrejas L.M. Papageorgiou C.D. Senia F. Rohrbach S. Wagner D. Thai B. Erne A.M. France J. Berer L. Rihs G. Zenke G. Wagner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 3849-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) alone showed the same result, again indicating a monomer. The complex CypA·SFA, on the other hand, had a clearly shorter retention time of 5 min, which indicates probable dimer formation. The spirobicycle linker, which is missing in the case of the 22-membered SFA macrocycle alone, mediates important vdW contacts within the dimer and also induces a side-chain conformation of Trp121 (Fig. 2), which enables interactions with the other monomer. The latter influence on Trp121 could be denoted as the “Trp switch,” which yields the intersubunit hydrogen bond between NE1-TrpA121 and O-ArgB148. Importantly, both derivatives of SFA (dihydroxy-SFA and the macrocycle) lack immunosuppressive activity in the murine mixed lymphocyte reaction, although their affinity for CypA is unaffected (Table II). 42-N-methyl-SFA, on the other hand, is an example of a derivative retaining immunosuppressive activity (Table II) and still forming a dimer in solution. The apparent molecular mass of the CypA·42-N-methyl SFA complex using the dynamic light scattering method was 26 kDa. Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of SFA derivatives to form a dimer similar to the one observed by crystallography might be related to their immunosuppressive activity as measured in the murine mixed lymphocyte reaction assay.Table IICyclophilin binding and immunosuppressive activity of SFA and derivativesCompoundCypA bindingaCypA binding and the MLR were performed as described previously (7).

Open table in a new tab The present report describes the x-ray structure of the novel immunosuppressive natural product SFA bound to human CypA at 1.6 Å. The x-ray structure not only allowed the determination of the absolute configuration at all chiral centers of SFA but also revealed the details of the binding mode of SFA to CypA. In particular, it showed that the macrocycle of SFA forms six direct hydrogen bonds with CypA. The x-ray structure also revealed that the chemical structure of SFA is nicely suited to enable strong interactions with the active site of CypA (or possibly of CypA homologs possessing similar binding sites). The hydrogen bond to NE2-His126, for example, can only be formed because the hydroxyl group on the tyrosine side chain is not in the usual para-position but rather in the meta-position of the aromatic ring. The removal of this hydroxyl group leads to a significant reduction in the affinity for CypA as measured in a cell-free assay, as well as to substantial loss of the immunosuppressive activity (34Baenteli R. Wagner J. Zenke G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hydrogen bond with the side-chain atom OE1-Gln63 is only possible because the β-nitrogen of the piperazic acid, instead of the usual α-nitrogen, is involved in the amide bond formation. This feature is unique among all piperazic acid-containing natural products. The observation that two CypA·SFA complexes form an intimate dimer in the crystal and in solution has led to the hypothesis that this dimer formation is related to the immunosuppressive effect. Again, many aspects of the chemical structure of SFA are nicely tailored toward promoting dimer formation. For instance, the meta-tyrosine ring forms vdW interactions with the E,E-diene of the other monomer, and the linker to the spirobicycle induces an important modification of the side chain conformation of Trp121. The dimer hypothesis states that SFA derivatives that induce a dimeric structure similar to the CypA·SFA complex should retain immunosuppressive activity, whereas SFA derivatives that block dimer formation (or form a different dimer) are not immunosuppressive. In summary, this x-ray structure assists in clarifying the mechanism of action of SFA and may help to identify the effector protein mediating the biological effects of SFA. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2069129217,"Some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes secrete a virulence factor called the streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) function. SIC is a polyfunctional protein that interacts with a number of host proteins and peptides, especially with those that are involved in host defense systems. In addition to inhibiting the complement-mediated lysis of cells, SIC inhibits lysozyme, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, and β-defensins. SIC also binds to proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and thereby may cause cytoskeletal derangement. The SIC molecule has three distinct structural domains constituting the N-proximal short repeat region (SRR), the central long repeat region (LRR), and the C-proximal proline-rich region (PRR). To map various functions to the structural domains, we have analyzed recombinant subclones expressing various parts of SIC and elastase-generated discrete fragments of SIC for binding to various ligands and for determining their biological properties. The results demonstrate the following. (a) SRR alone was sufficient to confer inhibition of complement function. (b) Anti-defensin and anti-lysozyme activities were mapped to the SRR plus LRR. (c) The LRR plus PRR harbored ezrin binding activity. Some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes secrete a virulence factor called the streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) function.

In addition to inhibiting the complement-mediated lysis of cells, SIC inhibits lysozyme, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, and β-defensins. SIC also binds to proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and thereby may cause cytoskeletal derangement. The SIC molecule has three distinct structural domains constituting the N-proximal short repeat region (SRR), the central long repeat region (LRR), and the C-proximal proline-rich region (PRR). To map various functions to the structural domains, we have analyzed recombinant subclones expressing various parts of SIC and elastase-generated discrete fragments of SIC for binding to various ligands and for determining their biological properties. The results demonstrate the following. (a) SRR alone was sufficient to confer inhibition of complement function. (b) Anti-defensin and anti-lysozyme activities were mapped to the SRR plus LRR. (c) The LRR plus PRR harbored ezrin binding activity. Some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes secrete a major protein, called “streptococcal inhibitor of complement” (SIC), 1The abbreviations used are: SIC, streptococcal inhibitor of complement; DRS, distantly related SIC; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; hBD-3, human β-defensin 3; LRR, long repeat region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PRR, proline-rich region; SRR, short repeat region. 1The abbreviations used are: SIC, streptococcal inhibitor of complement; DRS, distantly related SIC; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; hBD-3, human β-defensin 3; LRR, long repeat region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PRR, proline-rich region; SRR, short repeat region. which was originally identified as an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (1Akesson P. Sjoholm A.G. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAC function is achieved by preventing the insertion of C567 into the cell membrane (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The distribution of the gene for SIC is highly restricted among S. pyogenes serotypes, based on a classification of a major surface antigen called the M protein. Only M1 and M57 strains have been shown to contain the sic gene (1Akesson P. Sjoholm A.G. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Hartas J. Sriprakash K.S. Microb.

Kobayashi K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 3835-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported occurrences of the gene in several other M types.SIC, although originally characterized as an inhibitor of complement function, has subsequently been shown to have other activities. It inhibits the antimicrobial activity of lysozyme, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), α- and β-defensins, and LL-37, which are all components of the innate immune system (5Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J.

Additionally SIC has been shown to bind ezrin and, thereby, may modulate functions of cytoskeleton proteins (8Hoe N.P. Ireland R.M. DeLeo F.R. Gowen B.B. Dorward D.W. Voyich J.M. Liu M. Burns Jr., E.H. Culnan D.M. Bretscher A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7646-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as it has been shown to inhibit streptococcal attachment to host cells in vitro. SIC also binds to various blood glycoproteins such as clusterin (1Akesson P. Sjoholm A.G. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The presence of the sic gene in all S. pyogenes M1 isolates (generally considered as highly virulent), the high diversity of the sic gene (9Hoe N.P. Vuopio-Varkila J. Vaara M. Grigsby D.

Med. 1999; 5: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggest an important role for SIC in S. pyogenes virulence. SIC is highly immunogenic in humans, and the immune response occurs during natural infection (11Hoe N.P. Kordari P. Cole R. Liu M. Palzkill T. Huang W. McLellan D. Adams G.J. Hu M. Vuopio-Varkila J.

Microbiol. 2002; 51: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is thought that the high variability of SIC may be a response to the need for the molecule to mutate and escape immune pressure. Interestingly, these mutations occur throughout the length of the molecule; that is, they are not confined to any one domain, suggesting that mutations in the sic gene are not directed to overcome immune responses to any specific functional domain. The multitude of interactions between SIC and host proteins and the effects of SIC on a diverse range of host defense systems have hindered the definition of its principal role in virulence. One study in mice (13Lukomski S. Hoe N.P. Abdi I. Rurangirwa J. Kordari P. Liu M. Dou S.J. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that the knock-out of the sic gene from an M1 strain resulted in more rapid clearance of the pathogen after intranasal inoculation than with the wild type parent strain, which suggests that a SIC-positive strain is likely to be more persistent.The sequence of SIC revealed three distinct regions (1Akesson P.

The role of these regions in the diverse biochemical/biological functions outlined above is unknown, although some preliminary binding data using proteolytic fragments of the SIC protein show that only a fragment comprising most of the SRR plus part of the LRR binds to the β-defensins and SLPI (7Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41 (abstr.): 265Google Scholar, 15Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2004; 111: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In this communication we report on the construction of subclones that express these distinct regions of SIC and on the testing of their properties. Our results clearly define binding sites within this poly-functional protein. Implications of these properties in relation to pathogenesis are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, DNA, Peptides, and Antibodies—S. pyogenes 2031, an M1 serotype, was used to obtain clones of the sic gene and portions corresponding to one or more of structural domains of the protein. Streptococcus was grown in Todd Hewitt broth (Oxoid) supplemented with neopeptone. DNA manipulations and sequencing were as described previously (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Frick I.M. Akesson P. Rasmussen M. Schmidtchen A. Bjorck L. J. Biol.

S. pyogenes M1 (National Collection of Type Cultures number 8198; American Type Culture Collection number 12344) was obtained from the National Collection of Type Cultures, Central Public Health Laboratory, London. This strain was grown in Todd Hewitt broth and 0.2% yeast extract (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hants, UK) and maintained in the short term on selective Columbia agar plates with 5% horse blood (containing 5 μg/ml oxolinic acid and 10 μg/ml colistin sulfate; Sigma-Aldrich). The sequence of the sic gene in this strain is identical to that originally published from strain AP1 (GenBank™ accession number X92968) (1Akesson P. Sjoholm A.G. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).A peptide corresponding to the last 35 amino acids of ezrin was synthesized (Mimotopes). This portion of the molecule has been shown to bind to SIC (8Hoe N.P. Ireland R.M. DeLeo F.R. Gowen B.B. Dorward D.W. Voyich J.M. Liu M. Burns Jr., E.H. Culnan D.M. Bretscher A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7646-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant human β-defensin 3 (hBD-3) was obtained from PeproTech EC Ltd., London, UK.Antibodies to SIC were raised in rabbits by immunizing with recombinant M1 SIC from strain 2031 (IMVS, Gilles Plains, Australia) or with M1 SIC (National Collection of Type Cultures number 8198) purified from bacterial culture supernatants as described (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Anti-ezrin antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and was raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 511–586.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant SIC and SIC Subclones—The sic gene from 2031 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers shown in Fig. 1. The relative positions of these primers are also indicated. The polymerase chain reaction conditions, the cloning into the pBAD Thio vector, and the purification of the thioredoxin fusion proteins containing a C-terminal His6 tag were described previously (14Binks M. McMillan D. Sriprakash K.S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6701-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Control clones expressing only His-tagged thioredoxin were also obtained. DNA sequences for all subclones confirmed their identity. The majority of the fusion proteins are intact as seen on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 2). The anti-recombinant SIC antibody did not react with thioredoxin.Fig. 2Expression of M1 SIC subclones as thioredoxin fusion proteins in E. coli. Top, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4908-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subfragments of SIC, obtained by digestion with elastase, were purified as described by Fernie-King et al. (15Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2004; 111: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These fragments were as follows: fragment A, amino acids 1–33 (part of the short repeat region); fragment B, amino acids 34–126 (the remainder of the short repeat region plus long repeats 1 and 2); and fragment C, amino acids 127–273 (long repeat 3 plus the proline-rich region). All residue numbers are from the start of the mature protein (Fig. 1).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the Binding of SIC to the Complement Proteins C6 and C7—Assays for binding of SIC or its fragments to the complement proteins C6 and C7 were performed as described previously by indirect ELISA (16Binks M. Sriprakash K.S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3981-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates (TITERTEK) were coated with 100 μl of 20 μg/ml recombinant SIC proteins in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, purified C6 or C7 (1 μg/ml final; Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. The wells were then washed three times with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Binding was detected with primary goat anti-C6 or anti-C7 immunoglobin (1:1000; ICN Biomedical) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary (1:1000; Sigma) Ig. The reaction was developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), and the absorbance read at 450 nm in a Bio-Rad benchmark microplate reader.ELISA for the Binding of SIC to Ezrin—Assays for SIC-ezrin binding were performed by indirect ELISA as described for complement binding assays. In this case the microtiter wells were coated with 5 μg of SIC or subclones per well and then reacted with 1 μg/well ezrin peptide. Binding was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-ezrin Ig and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig.ELISA for the Binding of SIC to hBD-3—ELISA for the binding of SIC and its proteolytic or recombinant subfragments to triplicate wells coated with hBD-3 was performed essentially as described previously (15Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2004; 111: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that all ligands were added at 5 μg/ml. Bound proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-SIC Ig fraction (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Sigma Aldrich) diluted 1:1200 in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 with 0.1% gelatin. Control wells with either no ligand, no first antibody, or a second antibody only were set up together with matching sets of wells to which coating buffer only had been added as background controls. Incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C, and all washes were in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. The Sigma Fast pNPP substrate/buffer system was used as the final reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was read at 405 nm (reference wavelength 490 nm) in a Bio-Rad 3550 microplate reader.Complement-mediated Hemolysis Assay—The detail of this assay was described previously (14Binks M. McMillan D. Sriprakash K.S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6701-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sheep erythrocytes were activated with hemolysin (1:500 dilution; Virion) in gelatin veronal buffer plus MgCl2 and CaCl2 (GVB++) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 30 min at 4 °C. Human serum, used in this study as the complement source, was titrated to usually 1:100–1:150 dilution in GVB++ to give ∼30–50% lysis. For the SIC activity assay, the serum was pre-incubated with SIC or SIC fragments (4 μg), thioredoxin (control protein, 1.5 μg), or PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Osmolysis of erythrocytes with water was taken as 100% value. After removing the intact erythrocytes by centrifugation at 1700 × g, hemolysis was measured by reading the absorbance at 415 nm in a Bio-Rad benchmark microplate reader.Complement “Reactive Lysis” Assays—Reactive lysis (17Lachmann P.J. Thompson R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is a technique for studying the terminal pathway of complement on its own. Lysis is initiated by C5b6, a complex generated in acute phase sera (which have an excess of C5 and C6 over C7), by activation of the alternative pathway with yeast cell walls. A euglobulin fraction of such activated sera is used as a source of C56. When the C56 encounters C7 it forms the C567 complex, which briefly has the capacity to bind to lipid membranes. Lysis is then brought about by C8 and C9. In a reactive lysis assay, opposing wells are cut into agarose plates and filled with C56 euglobulin, which is functionally free of C7 (prepared from acute phase serum as described in Ref. 17Lachmann P.J. Thompson R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and normal human serum (as a source of C7, C8, and C9), and allowed to diffuse. Where the diffusing reagents meet, lines of lysis form. Agarose plates (1% agarose in complement fixation diluent) containing 0.75% washed guinea pig red cells (TCS Biosciences Ltd., Botolph Claydon, UK) were poured on 3 × 1-inch microscope slides (2.5 ml per plate). A pattern of 3-mm wells was cut, and 10 μl of the various reagents were added as indicated in Scheme 1.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Up to five 10-μl aliquots of M1 SIC and proteolytic or recombinant subfragments of SIC (as potential inhibitors of lysis) were added to the wells and allowed to diffuse into the agarose (to achieve an equal amount of protein, ∼2 nmol). 10 μl of normal human serum, C56 euglobulin, or PBS (as a negative control) were then added to the other wells. Plates were incubated overnight at room temperature in a moist box and then photographed.Titration of the Effect of SIC Subfragments on the Killing of M1 S. pyogenes by hBD-3—Briefly, overnight cultures of M1 group A streptococcus were grown at 37 °C in Todd Hewitt broth with 0.2% yeast extract and used to inoculate fresh broth at 1:100. Bacteria were grown to mid log-phase, spun down, and washed twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm glucose (Tris-glucose) and resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 105/ml in Tris-glucose and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Doubling dilutions of SIC, recombinant SIC fragments, or recombinant thioredoxin control protein from 3.4 μm were combined with 3.4 μm hBD-3 (all in Tris-glucose) in a total volume of 20 μl (in duplicate) for 3 h at 37 °C. 20 μl of prepared bacteria were added and incubated for a further 1.75 h at 37 °C. Thus, final overall concentrations were SIC from 0.85 μm, 0.85 μm hBD-3, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, each with bacteria at 105/ml. The reaction mixtures were then diluted one-fifth with Tris-glucose and 100 μl spread on duplicate selective horse blood agar plates, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Controls were bacteria in Tris-glucose, matching dilutions of SIC, SIC fragments, or control protein, or hBD-3 alone.The Effect SIC Subfragments on the Catalytic Activity of Lysozyme— Sequential dilutions of three parts SIC or proteolytic subfragments A and C from 35 μm or subfragment B from 70 μm, plus one part diluent, were combined with 17.5 μm hen egg lysozyme in 20-μl volumes in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, in duplicate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Similar sequential dilutions of hen egg lysozyme alone from 35 μm were also made up and incubated as described above to provide a standard curve. 5 μl of each set of reaction mixtures together with a set of standard curve dilutions were added to 3-mm wells of duplicate agarose lysoplates containing Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.5 mg/ml. The plates were incubated at room temperature for ∼4 h, and the diameters of the zones of bacterial cell wall clearance were measured using a magnifying graticule with divisions of 0.1 mm.RESULTSProduction of SIC Subclones—Earlier studies have clearly defined three major structural domains within the SIC molecule, namely a short repeat region, a long repeat region, and a proline-rich region. As pointed out in the introduction, SIC is a multifunctional protein. To assign these functions to one or more of the structural domains we constructed various truncated recombinants containing the SRR (clone S1), the LRR (clone S2), the PRR (clone S3), the SRR plus LRR (clone S4), and the LRR plus PRR (clone 5). As evident in Fig. 2, top, the majority of the recombinant fusion proteins for the above clones and full-length mature protein were intact. Antibodies against full-length SIC, raised in rabbits, reacted specifically with all the subclones but not with the thioredoxin fusion partner (Fig. 2, bottom).Interference with the Complement-mediated Cell Lysis Is Largely Restricted to the N-terminal Third of the SIC Molecule— Sensitized sheep erythrocytes were incubated with human sera as a complement source diluted sufficiently to result in ∼50% lysis of erythrocytes. Pre-incubation of the sera with SIC or the SRR (clone S1) inhibited complement-mediated lysis of erythrocytes to a similar extent (45 and 57%, respectively; Fig. 3). The LRR alone did not show significant inhibition. However, whereas the PRR alone exhibited a low to moderate level of inhibition, LRR plus PRR did not inhibit complement function.Fig. 3Inhibition of complement function is largely attributed to the SRR of the SIC protein. In complement hemolysis assay, human serum was incubated with SIC, truncated recombinant proteins, thioredoxin (Thio), or PBS as indicated. Complement-mediated hemolysis of sensitized sheep red blood cells was measured (OD at 415) by the release of hemoglobin into cell supernatant. Panel A shows hemolysis, and panel B shows the percentage of inhibition calculated from panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In reactive lysis assays, which more precisely reflect the established mode of action of SIC against complement (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), almost total inhibition of lysis was observed with the SRR (clone S1) and the SRR plus LRR (clone S4), with a slight degree of inhibition by the PRR (clone S3). Fig. 4 illustrates the inhibition of reactive lysis by native M1 SIC and subclone S1 and the total lack of inhibition by clone S2. Interestingly, none of the proteolytic fragments of SIC, either singly or in combination, showed any inhibitory activity at all. The results are summarized in Table I.Fig. 4The SRR of SIC inhibits complement-reactive lysis. Plates shown from top to bottom had M1 SIC, clone S1 (SRR), and clone S2 (LRR), respectively. In all of the plates the top left and bottom right wells contain SIC or subfragment, the top right and bottom left wells contain PBS, the center row left and right wells contain normal human serum, and the center well contains C56 euglobulin. In the top two plates the truncation of the line of lysis can be seen, demonstrating the inhibition of reactive lysis, whereas in the bottom plate there is no inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of reactive lysis assaySIC or fragmentDegree of inhibitiona0, (+), and +++ represent no, low, and high activity, respectively.Recombinant SIC+++S1: SRR+++S2: LRR0S3: PRR(+)S4: SRR + LRR+++S5: LRR + PRR0Thioredoxin control(+)Native M1 SIC+++Fragment A0Fragment B0Fragment C0Fragments A+B0Fragments B+C0Fragments A+C0Fragments A+B+C0a 0, (+), and +++ represent no, low, and high activity, respectively. Open table in a new tab In our previous studies we showed by ELISA that SIC binds to the complement proteins C6 and C7 and to C567 complexes (2Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Binks M. McMillan D. Sriprakash K.S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6701-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that binding of these complement proteins to SIC is mediated by the SRR subclone S1 (Fig. 5, A and B). The subclone S2 containing the LRR did not bind at all. However, the PRR-containing subclones (S3 and S5) had low binding to C6 and C7. These results are consistent with our recent studies that show distantly related SIC (DRS) proteins, which have significant similarity with SIC only in the PRR, are also able to bind C6 and C7, albeit at a lower level (15Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2004; 111: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results of the functional assays, together with the binding studies described above, clearly show that interference with complement function is largely restricted to the N-terminal third of the SIC molecule.Fig. 5Mapping of the C6 and C7 complement protein-binding site. In panels A and B microtiter wells were coated with SIC, truncated SIC polypeptides, or thioredoxin (Thio) as indicated. The proteins were subsequently incubated with C6 (A) or C7(B), and binding was detected using C6- and C7-specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The SRR Plus LRR Inhibits the Antimicrobial Activity of hBD-3 against M1 Group A Streptococci and Binds to hBD-3 by ELISA—Harder et al. (18Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar) showed that skin and tonsils are major tissues for production of hBD-3 and that oral epithelial cells and keratinocytes express this defensin. These tissues are primary sites of infection by S. pyogenes. Hence, studying the interaction between SIC and hBD-3 is relevant for streptococcal infection. Experiments were performed with the recombinant SIC fusion proteins to elucidate which region of SIC is responsible for inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of hBD-3. Equimolar and 1:2 molar ratios (clone/hBD-3) of clone S4 (the SRR plus the LRR) resulted in 100% inhibition of hBD-3, and ∼80% inhibition was achieved at a 1:4 molar ratio. These values are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that the whole SIC molecule inhibited hBD-3 at a 1:2 molar ratio in Tris buffer (15Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2004; 111: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, equimolar concentrations of clone S3 (the C-terminal PRR) resulted in up to 50% inhibition. Clone S5 (LRR plus PRR) inhibited no better than the PRR alone. No inhibition of hBD-3 activity was exhibited by clone S1 (SRR), clone S2 (LRR), or the thioredoxin fusion partner alone (Fig. 6A). The ELISA also showed that binding to hBD-3 was confined to the whole molecule, clone S4 (SRR plus the LRR), and proteolytic fragment B, which is broadly similar to clone S4 but is truncated from both ends (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W1991238165,"Increasing evidence suggests that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) affects the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid β (Aβ) protein production as well as mediates the clearance of Aβ from the brain. Recent studies indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of LRP is critical for this modulation of APP processing requiring perhaps a complex between APP, the adaptor protein FE65, and LRP. In this study, we expressed a small LRP domain consisting of the C-terminal 97 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, or LRP-soluble tail (LRP-ST), in CHO cells to test the hypothesis that the APP·LRP complex can be disrupted. We anticipated that LRP-ST would inhibit the normal interaction between LRP and APP and therefore perturb APP processing to resemble a LRP-deficient state. Surprisingly, CHO cells expressing LRP-ST demonstrated an increase in both sAPP secretion and Aβ production compared with control CHO cells in a manner reminiscent of the cellular effects of the APP “Swedish mutation.” The increase in sAPP secretion consisted mainly of sAPPβ, consistent with the increase in Aβ release. Further, this effect is LRP-independent, as the same alterations remained when LRP-ST was expressed in LRP-deficient cells but not when the construct was membrane-anchored. Finally, deletion experiments suggested that the last 50 amino acid residues of LRP-ST contain the important domain for altering APP processing and Aβ production. These observations indicate that there are cellular pathways that may suppress Aβ generation but that can be altered to facilitate Aβ production.

LRP is synthesized as a 600-kDa precursor protein that is subsequently cleaved in the trans-Golgi compartment by furin to generate a large 515-kDa α-chain and a smaller 85-kDa membrane-associated β-chain that remain non-covalently linked (3Herz J.

The cytoplasmic tail contains two NPXY endocytosis motifs and binds a number of cytoplasmic adaptor and scaffold proteins, such as FE65, Mint2, Disabled-1 (Dab1), Shc, and JIP-1 and -2, probably through the second NPXY motif (5Barnes H.

In addition, LRP itself undergoes a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase intramembrane proteolysis, releasing a potentially transcriptionally active fragment in a manner similar to APP and Notch (8Kinoshita A.

LRP and three of its key ligands, apoE, α2-macroglobulin, and APP, are genetically associated with Alzheimer disease and are found in senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer disease patients (10Blacker D.

LRP also mediates the binding and clearance of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) complexes bound to apoE or α2-macroglobulin in cultured cells and in the brain (14Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H. Katzman R. Koo E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Narita M. Holtzman D.M.

Kumar S.R. Calero M. Bading J. Frangione B. Holtzman D.M. Miller C.A. Strickland D.K. Ghiso J. Zlokovic B.V. J. Clin.

These findings therefore support a model in which LRP plays an important role in Aβ uptake and removal. In a dual but opposing effect, it has been proposed that LRP can also promote Aβ production by altering the trafficking and processing of APP, possibly by APP/LRP interactions via the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain as well as through cytoplasmic adaptor proteins (7Trommsdorff R.

Brain Res. 2001; 87: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Absence of LRP or treatment of receptor-associated protein, an antagonist of all known LRP ligands, substantially reduced Aβ release, a phenotype that was reversed when full-length or truncated LRP was transfected in LRP-deficient cells (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I. Tanzi R.E. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7410-7415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The domain in LRP that is responsible for regulating APP processing and Aβ production was mapped to the cytosolic tail; specifically, a seven-amino acid motif that included the distal NPVY site (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the cytoplasmic domain of LRP plays a major role in APP processing. We hypothesized that formation of a LRP·APP complex is important for normal APP processing and have shown that indeed, APP and LRP appear to be functionally linked by the adaptor protein FE65 (24Pietrzik C.U. Yoon I.S. Jaeger S. Busse T. Weggen S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4259-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the idea that blocking the interaction between LRP and APP could reduce Aβ production in a manner similar to that observed in LRP-deficient cells. We hypothesized that expression of a LRP construct, consisting of only the last 97 amino acid residues of the cytosolic tail of LRP, will block LRP/APP interaction and, in so doing, alter APP processing and Aβ generation. Surprisingly, expression of the soluble LRP cytosolic fragment did not impair Aβ production as expected. Instead this fragment altered APP processing by positively regulating the β-secretase pathway of APP cleavage. cDNA Constructs—The mutant LRP constructs used in this study are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The Myc-tagged last 97 amino acids of the cytoplasmic region of the LRP β-subunit (Myc-LRP-ST) and various LRP derivates were generated by PCR. The fatty acylation (i.e. myristoylation and palmitoylation) signal sequence of Fyn tyrosine kinase (GCVQCKCKDKEATKLTEER) was fused to the N-terminal end of LRP-ST (FA-LRP-ST) (25McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were subcloned into pLHCX vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for retrovirus production. Plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (pMST), the Gal4 DNA-binding domain engineered into the cytoplasmic tail of APP695 (pMST-APP), the APP-Gal4 fusion protein with a deletion in the NPTY motif of the APP cytoplasmic tail (pMST-APPΔ), and a Gal4 reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase (pG5E1B-luc) have been described (26Cao X.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. T. Sudhof). The pLHCX-FE65 construct was engineered from pCMV-FE65 vector (a generous gift from Dr. T. Sudhof). Plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was from Promega. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Lines—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the LRP-deficient CHO cell line (13-5-1) stably expressing wild type APP751 (APP-WT) have been described previously (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To generate stable cell lines expressing various LRP constructs, VSV-G (glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus) pseudo-typed retroviruses were packaged and used to infect CHO cells (27Emi N. Friedmann T. Yee J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After infection, the cells were selected using hygromycin (250 μg/ml), and antibiotic-resistant cells were expanded without further clonal selection. Antibodies—The polyclonal antibody 1704 recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of human LRP (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody CT15, which reacts with the C-terminal 15 amino acid residues of APP, and the monoclonal antibodies 1G7/5A3 and 26D6, which recognize the ectodomain of APP, have been described previously (28Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 9E10 against the Myc epitope sequence and Ab-1 against the β-tubulin were obtained from Calbiochem. Western Blot Analyses—Cell lysates solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 or conditioned media were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 4–12% NuPAGE® Novex BisTris gels (Invitrogen) or 8% Tris-glycine gels to detect low molecular APP C-terminal fragments and Aβ or sAPP, respectively. In all cases, gel loading was normalized to total protein content in the cell extract or the corresponding cell extracts when medium samples were used. Western blotting was carried out with the indicated antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Quantitation of the chemiluminescence signal was done using a charge-coupled device imaging system (GeneGnome, Syngene, Frederick, MD). All experiments were performed at least three times, and each experiment was done in duplicate or in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences were analyzed by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc comparisons of group means using the Tukey test. Statistical differences with two-tailed probability values of p < 0.05 were taken as significant. Extraction of Membrane Fraction—Cells in a 10-cm dish were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The scraped cells were collected by low speed centrifugation (500 × g for 1 min). Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and homogenized by passing five times through a 25-gauge needle and five times through a 27-gauge needle. To prepare a post-nuclear supernatant, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was isolated from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was saved for further analysis at –80 °C. The pellet (membrane fraction) was resuspended in 100 μlof radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and cleared by a spin at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Metabolic Labeling—Confluent cells were incubated in 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min or 3 h to determine the turnover of full-length APP or APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs), respectively. Following metabolic labeling, the cells were either lysed immediately (time 0) or chased for 1, 2, or 4 h. The full-length APP and APP CTFs were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody CT15. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (8% Tris-glycine gels for full-length APP and 4–12% NuPAGE® Novex BisTris gels for APP-CTF) and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for quantitation. Internalization Assay—To measure internalization of cell-surface APP, iodinated 1G7 antibody was added to confluent cultures of APP-WT CHO and MycST cells at 37 °C for 30 min exactly as described previously (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In brief, after incubation, the cells were rapidly chilled on ice, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold binding medium. The chilled cells were washed extensively, and the remaining surface antibody was detached by two acid washes. The cells were then lysed and collected for analysis. Acid-labile and acid-resistant radioactivity represents the surface and internalized pools of APP, respectively. Specific binding was determined after subtraction of the radioactivity counts obtained from parallel cultures of untransfected CHO cells. The ratio of acid-resistant to acid-labile counts therefore provided a measure of the internalized versus cell-surface pools of APP. Data are from three separate experiments, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Subconfluent CHO cells were transiently transfected with the following combinations of plasmids (0.25 μg of each): 1) pMST + pG5EIB-luc + pLHCX; 2) pMST-APP + pG5EIB-luc + pLHCX; 3) pMST-APP + pG5EIB-luc + pLHCX-FE65 + pLHCX; 4) pMST-APPΔ+ pG5EIB-luc + pLHCX-FE65 + pLHCX; and 5) pMST-APP + pG5EIB-luc + pLHCX-FE65 + pLHCX-MycST. 20 ng of pRL-TK was added to each plasmid mix to control for transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using the 1× lysis buffer from the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified using a dual injector luminometer (EC & G Berthold). The firefly luciferase values were normalized against the Renilla luciferase value after background values from the wells with no cell lysates were subtracted. The values were expressed as fold induction over Gal4 (i.e. value from plasmid combination 1). Effect of LRP-soluble Tail (LRP-ST) Expression on APP Processing—To examine the effects of LRP-ST expression on APP processing, Myc-tagged LRP-ST (Myc-LRP-ST) was stably expressed in APP-WT CHO cells (herein referred to as MycST cells). Expression of Myc-LRP-ST was examined by immunoblotting with a LRP C-terminal antibody. When whole cell lysates were separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions, full-length LRP (∼600 kDa) and LRP β-chain (∼85 kDa) were detected in membrane fractions from both parental control and Myc-LRP-ST-transfected cells (Fig. 2A, upper panel). As anticipated, the Myc-LRP-ST lacking the transmembrane domain was detected in the cytosolic fraction of MycST cells only. The recently described ∼25-kDa C-terminal fragment of LRP representing the substrate for γ-secretase intramembrane proteolysis (9May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was also detected in membrane fractions of both cell lines (Fig. 2A, lower panel, asterisk). Expression of the Myc-LRP-ST fragment was also detected by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognized the Myc epitope tag (Fig. 2B). Expression of Myc-LRP-ST did not alter the expression of APP (Fig. 3, top panel). However, there was a significant ∼2-fold increase in the level of APP CTF in MycST cells as compared with control APP-WT CHO cells (Fig. 3, middle panel). Previously, we reported that in LRP-deficient cells, the levels of APP CTFs were substantially reduced (20Pietrzik C.U. Busse T. Merriam D.E. Weggen S. Koo E.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Increased level of C-terminal fragment (CTF) of APP in MycST cells. Expression of the full-length APP level in a duplicate sample of cell extracts is unchanged following stable expression of Myc-LRP-ST (top panel). However, there is an ∼2-fold increase in APP CTF levels in MycST cells as compared with APP-WT CHO cells (middle panel). β-tubulin levels were determined with a monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) in the same cell lysate to ensure equal loading (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next assayed for sAPP secretion, because CTF generation and sAPP secretion are frequently correlated with each other. As predicted, there was an ∼2-fold increase in total sAPP secretion in conditioned medium from MycST cells as compared with controls (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the α-or β-secretase-derived sAPP was preferentially affected by LRP-ST, the same conditioned medium was subjected to additional immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody 26D6, which reacts with the first 12 residues of the Aβ sequence contained in sAPPα but not in sAPPβ (14Kang D.E. Pietrzik C.U. Baum L. Chevallier N. Merriam D.E. Kounnas M.Z. Wagner S.L. Troncoso J.C. Kawas C.H. Katzman R. Koo E.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 28Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there was only a small non-significant (∼15%) increase in sAPPα in MycST cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the observed ∼2-fold increase in total sAPP secretion mainly resulted from sAPPβ. Consistent with this interpretation, β-secretase-derived APP CTFβ was also increased by >50% in Myc-LRP-ST-expressing cells (Fig. 4C) concomitant with an ∼2-fold increase in Aβ secretion (Fig. 4D). The increase in Aβ level was not because of the Myc tag attached to LRP-ST, because the expression of LRP-ST alone showed similar results (Fig. 4E). These results taken together indicate that LRP-ST expression in CHO cells augments APP processing through a β-secretase-mediated pathway. Reduction in Cell-surface APP by LRP-ST—To test whether the increased sAPP, CTFs, and Aβ levels in MycST cells were because of the increased stability of APP, we next examined the turnover of full-length APP by pulse-chase analysis in APP-WT CHO and MycST cells. However, there was no change in the turnover rate of APP in MycST cells as compared with controls (t1/2, ∼60 min) (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, the increase in CTF levels in MycST cells might also be due to its enhanced stability. As with full-length APP, there was no significant difference in the half-life of APP CTFs (∼2 h) in MycST cells as compared with controls (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the increased APP CTF level in MycST cells is secondary to enhanced production. In CHO cells, a major pathway for the generation and secretion of Aβ appears to be derived from endocytic processing of APP from the cell surface (30Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9100-9107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next measured the internalization of APP using an iodinated APP antibody (1G7). The internalization of APP was expressed as a ratio between the 125I-1G7 antibody bound to intracellular and cell-surface APP. Although APP internalization was essentially unchanged (7% reduction, Fig. 5D), a 30% reduction in steady-state levels of cell-surface APP was observed in MycST cells as compared with control APP-WT CHO cells (Fig. 5E). These results suggested that LRP-ST altered the processing of APP in compartments prior to trafficking to the cell surface. Such a phenotype resembles that of the APP “Swedish mutation” where decreased cell-surface APP and increased β-secretase cleavage products were documented (31Perez R.G. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9100-9107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, we failed to document any increase in either the protein or in the mRNA level of β-secretase (data not shown). The alterations in the level of cell-surface APP level as well as the changes in APP/Aβ processing in MycST cells indicated that there may be perturbed trafficking of APP to different subcellular organelles. Therefore, we examined the subcellular localization of APP by immunolocalization and sucrose density gradient fractionation after sodium carbonate extraction or Triton X-100 solubilization. However, we could not detect any significant changes in APP subcellular localization in MycST cells with either of these two approaches (data not shown). Effect of MycST Deletion Mutants on APP Processing—A recent study using the yeast two-hybrid assay reported that the cytoplasmic tail of LRP could interact with several functionally distinct proteins, such as JIP1 and -2, PSD-95, and Mint2 (6Gotthardt M.

In addition, it has been shown that the NPXY domains of both LRP and APP cytoplasmic tails bind to adaptor proteins FE65, mDab, and Shc (5Barnes H. Ackermann E.J. van der Geer P.

Thus, we first expressed Myc-LRP-ST constructs lacking the first (Myc-LRP-ST ΔNPTY) or second (Myc-LRP-ST ΔNPVY) NPXY motifs in parental APP-WT CHO cells. Surprisingly, expression of both Myc-LRP-ST deletion constructs still increased the levels of Aβ as compared with control APP-WT CHO cells (Fig. 6A), indicating that neither NPXY core motif alone in LRP-ST is functional with respect to the increase in Aβ production. Based on these results, we therefore hypothesized that regions flanking either one or both NPXY motifs must account for the increased Aβ secretion by LRP-ST. To test this possibility, additional mutant LRP-ST constructs were engineered. Although expression of the last 50 amino acid residues of LRP-ST (LRP-ST48–97) still increased Aβ secretion, expression of the first 47 amino acid residues of LRP-ST (LRP-ST1–47) had no effect on Aβ secretion in APP-WT CHO cells (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that amino acid residues in between positions 48 and 97 but not the core NPXY motif of LRP-ST (residues 57NFTNPVYATL66) are cr"

Crystallographic studies have revealed that fusion-active gp41 is a “trimer-of-hairpins” in which three central N-terminal helices form a trimeric coiled coil surrounded by three antiparallel C-terminal helices. This structure is stabilized primarily by hydrophobic, interhelical interactions, and several critical contacts are made between residues that form a deep cavity in the N-terminal trimer and the C-helix residues that pack into this cavity. In addition, the trimer-of-hairpins structure has an extensive network of hydrogen bonds within a conserved glutamine-rich layer of poorly understood function. Formation of the trimer-of-hairpins structure is thought to directly force the viral and target membranes together, resulting in membrane fusion and viral entry. We test this hypothesis by constructing four series of gp41 mutants with disrupted interactions between the N- and C-helices. Notably, in the three series containing mutations within the cavity, gp41 activity correlates well with the stability of the N-C interhelical interaction. In contrast, a fourth series of mutants involving the glutamine layer residue Gln-653 show fusion defects even though the stability of the hairpin is close to wild-type. These results provide evidence that gp41 hairpin stability is critical for mediating fusion and suggest a novel role for the glutamine layer in gp41 function.

Remarkably, the putative fusion-active structures of these proteins from retroviruses (e.g. HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, and Moloney murine leukemia virus), orthomyxoviruses (influenza), paramyxoviruses (simian virus type 5 and human respiratory syncytial virus), filoviruses (Ebola), and coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) (1Eckert D.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 49414-49419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) all reveal the same six-helix bundle conformation. This six-helix structure can also be described as a trimer-of-hairpins in which each hairpin consists of an N-terminal helix (N-helix) packed against an antiparallel C-terminal helix (C-helix). Three central N-helices form a coiled coil surface with three prominent hydrophobic grooves that each allow C-helix binding (3Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 4Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct.

Thus, the trimer-of-hairpins structure is largely stabilized by hydrophobic packing between the three internal N-helices and between the N- and C-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). This fusion-active configuration juxtaposes the amino terminus of gp41, which contains a fusion peptide inserted into the target cell membrane, with the carboxyl terminus, which contains the transmembrane anchor in the viral membrane. The current model for membrane fusion proposes that formation of the hairpin structure provides the energy necessary for viral and cellular membrane apposition, leading to membrane fusion (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 3Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). There are two prominent features of the trimer-of-hairpins structure in HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus gp41. First, three symmetric hydrophobic cavities on the surface of the N-helix coiled coil each forms a docking site for three residues from a C-helix. Notably, small peptides or synthetic molecules targeted to these cavities prevent trimer-of-hairpins formation and inhibit fusion (7Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S.

Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); the efficacy of these molecules underscores the critical role of interhelical interactions within the cavity in gp41 function. Second, a planar cluster of conserved glutamine and asparagine residues, from both the N- and C-helices, form a hydrogen-bonded layer within the six-helix bundle (5Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Though a novel structural feature, the function of this “glutamine layer” remains unclear (6Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 9Malashkevich V.N. Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); indeed, none of the reported mutations in this region reduce gp41 activity. In fact, such substitutions can increase gp41 core stability (10Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Radigen L. Jiang S. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Wang S.

Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutational and biophysical analyses of gp41 support the hypothesis that hairpin formation provides the driving force for membrane fusion. For example, the N-helix residues Leu-565, Leu-568, and Val-570, located on the cavity surface, form hydrophobic contacts with C-helices as determined by x-ray crystallography. Alanine mutations at these positions decrease six-helix bundle stability and reduce envelope-mediated fusion (12Lu M. Stoller M.O. Wang S. Liu J. Fagan M.B. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11146-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J.

Virology. 2004; 329: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These mutations are notable, because they likely represent a specific defect in the fusion pathway, unlike some N- and C-helix mutants that fail to correctly process the gp160 precursor into gp120 (the receptor binding subunit) and gp41 (11Wang S. York J. Shu W. Stoller M.O. Nunberg J.H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7283-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Lu M. Stoller M.O. Wang S. Liu J. Fagan M.B. Nunberg J.H. J.

Although these studies support a role for hairpin formation in membrane fusion, a systematic analysis of the correlation between hairpin stability and gp41 activity would provide a more rigorous test of the model. In this study we seek to identify the energetic contribution of the N-C helical interaction to the fusion reaction. We made a series of substitutions at each of four positions in the N-C helical interface. We report that for mutations within the N-helix cavity, the fusion activity of gp41 depends on the stability of the N-C interface. In contrast, for the series of substitutions in the glutamine layer, we find that gp41 activity is abolished even in the presence of stable N-C interactions, thereby providing evidence for an important role for the glutamine layer in gp41-mediated fusion. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Env mutations were made using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of pBS-SKII containing HXB2 gp160 (pBS-SKII-gp160) and verified by DNA sequencing. For expression in 293T cells, all mutations were subcloned into pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen). For generation of stable cell lines, the mutations were subcloned into the pB-IRES-CD2 retroviral vector (gift from Jonathan Bogan, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge MA). For expression of recombinant proteins, mutations were cloned into the pAED4 vector (4Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Mutant N34 and wild-type C28 fragments were PCR-amplified from pBS-SKII-gp160 using the primers 5′-GCAATTCCATATGTCTGGTATAGTGCAGCAG-3′ (N34 forward) and 5′-ACCGCGACCACCGCTTCTTGCTTGGAGCTGCTTG-3′ (L6N34 reverse) for the N34 fragment and 5′-GGTGGTCGCGGTGGTTGGATGGAGTGGGACAGAG-3′ (L6C28 forward) and 5′-GGAATTCCTAGTGATGATGATGATGATGCTTTTCTTGCTGGTTTTGC-3′ (C28-HIS reverse) for the C28 fragment. These primers introduce a six-residue linker (Ser-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Gly) between N34 and C28 and a hexahistidine tag (HIS) 3′ of C28. For mutant C28 fragments, C28-HIS reverse primers encoding the mutations were used. The N and C fragments were joined by overlap PCR with primers N34 forward and C28-HIS reverse and subcloned into pAED4. Protein Expression and Purification—Bacterial cultures expressing N34(L6)C28-HIS variants were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3-4 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 15% glycerol, and 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 μm MgCl2, 1 μm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml DNase I, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged (27,000 × g for 30 min) to separate the soluble and inclusion body fractions. The pellet was washed again in lysis buffer, and supernatants from both washes were pooled. With the exception of the glycine mutants, all peptides were present in the soluble fraction and affinity-purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen, Inc.). For the glycine mutants, inclusion body pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 6 m guanidine-HCl before purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. Peptide-containing fractions were dialyzed into 5% acetic acid, purified to >95% purity over a preparative C5 column by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and lyophilized. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Lyophilized peptide was dissolved in water, and concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine-HCl (17Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Peptides were then diluted to 10 μm in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm sodium chloride (pH 7)). CD spectra were obtained on an AVIV 62DS CD spectrometer. To determine helical content, a value of -33,000 degree cm2 dmol-1 was used for theoretical 100% helicity (12Lu M. Stoller M.O. Wang S. Liu J. Fagan M.B. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11146-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation scans were performed on 10 μm peptide samples in PBS. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) was calculated as the maximum value of the first derivative of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) with respect to temperature. Consistent with previous reports for N34(L6)C28 (10Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Radigen L. Jiang S. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Wang S. York J. Shu W. Stoller M.O. Nunberg J.H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7283-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), thermal denaturation of these recombinant peptides was cooperative but not reversible. Sedimentation Equilibrium—All measurements were recorded on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with a Ti-60a rotor. Wild-type N34(L6)C28-HIS was dialyzed overnight in PBS or sodium acetate buffer (50 mm sodium acetate and 150 mm NaCl (pH 5.5)), and diluted to 5, 10, and 30 μm. Samples dialyzed in PBS formed some precipitate, whereas samples in sodium acetate remained fully soluble. Data were collected at 20 °C with rotor speeds of 20, 30, and 42 krpm and wavelengths of 229 and 280 nm. Data sets were fitted simultaneously with WinNonlin (version 1.06) (18Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). No systematic residuals were observed, and both samples fit well to a single species model. Because wild-type N34(L6)C28-HIS formed stable trimers in both buffers and remained fully soluble after overnight dialysis at low pH, mutant peptides were analyzed in the sodium acetate buffer. All N34(L6)C28-HIS variants except L565G fit best to a single species model, showed no systematic residuals, and had molecular weights within 10% of those calculated for an ideal trimer. The L565G peptide was predominantly trimeric in solution, but the data fit slightly better as a monomer-trimer equilibrium containing 80% trimers. Envelope Glycoprotein Expression and Western Blot Analysis—Mutant envelope glycoproteins were expressed in 293T cells by transient transfection for expression analysis and cell-cell fusion assays. 293T cells were plated in gelatin-coated 12-well plates. At ∼30-50% confluency, cells were transfected with 800 ng of pcDNA-gp160 expressing mutant gp160 and 400 ng of pnGFP (a plasmid expressing nuclear green fluorescent protein) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was assessed by green fluorescent protein fluorescence and was similar for all mutants (∼30-50%). Envelope expression was measured by Western blot analysis. gp41 and gp160 from cell lysates were analyzed with an anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody, Chessie 8 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Shed gp120 was immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatant using an anti-gp120 polyclonal antibody (gift of Peter Kim, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point PA), and protein-A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). To determine cell surface expression levels of Env, transfected cells were washed with cold PBS (pH 8.0) and biotinylated using 5 mm sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS containing 100 mm glycine to remove excess biotin, cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). Biotinylated surface proteins were precipitated using immobilized NeutrAvidin (Pierce) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Stable cell lines expressing the alanine mutants were made using retroviral transduction of NIH3T3 cells. To generate retrovirus, 293T cells were plated on gelatin-coated 60-mm plates and transfected with pBI-CD2-gp160 encoding mutant gp160 and a Moloney murine leukemia virus packaging vector, pCLeco (gift from C. Lois, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). A 1:2 dilution of viral supernatant was used to infect NIH3T3 cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. After several passages, the infected NIH3T3 cell lines were used for dye transfer assays. Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—Forty-eight hours after transient transfection, 293T cell monolayers were resuspended and counted. A mixture of 4 × 104 envelope-expressing 293T cells and 4 × 104 target cells, 3T3-T4-CXCR4 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), was plated in duplicate into gelatin-coated, eight-well slides and incubated for 21 h at 37 °C. After fixation and hematoxylin staining, the number of syncytia per well was counted under phase microscopy. Cells containing three or more nuclei were scored as syncytia. Dye Transfer Fusion Assay—3T3 cells stably expressing gp41 mutations were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish. Eight hours later, cell monolayers were incubated with 420 nm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C and gently washed twice with PBS before the addition of labeled target cells. Target cells, 3T3-T4-CXCR4, were labeled with the lipid dye octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) (Molecular Probes). 2 × 106 target cells were washed in PBS, incubated in PBS containing 2 μm R18 for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, and washed twice in PBS before resuspension in growth media. Approximately 4 × 105 target cells were added to envelope-expressing monolayers, and dishes were immediately incubated at 37 °C. Cells were examined for dye transfer every 20-30 min by counting the number of co-labeled cells in five separate fields at 200× magnification. Design of Four Allelic Series—Residues Leu-565, Leu-568, and Val-570 are located on the surface of the N-terminal coiled coil within a large cavity and interact with the internal face of the C-helix (Fig. 1, A and B). In previous studies, mutation of these residues to alanine reduced fusion but did not affect gp160 processing or gp120-gp41 association (12Lu M. Stoller M.O. Wang S. Liu J. Fagan M.B. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11146-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific defect in the fusion pathway. To obtain a range of gp41 core stabilities, each position was mutated to glycine, alanine, and phenylalanine. We chose glycine for its helix-destabilizing properties (19Fersht A. Julet M. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999: 508-539Google Scholar), alanine for its reduced hydrophobic bulk, and phenylalanine for its increased bulk over the native leucine or valine residue. The polar contacts within the glutamine layer were disrupted by mutagenesis of Gln-653 (Fig. 1C). This residue is buried in the interhelical interface and forms hydrogen bonds with neighboring helices in the core crystal structure (6Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 20Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Hyde C.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is highly conserved; only two of 630 viruses in the Los Alamos HIV sequence data base show mutations at this position (www.hiv.lanl.gov). The Q653A and Q653L substitutions were designed to abolish polar contacts with neighboring glutamine residues, whereas the Q653E substitution retains bulk and polarity. Biophysical Analysis of Recombinant gp41 Core Structures—We used a recombinant peptide model to measure the biophysical properties of mutant gp41 cores. This gp41 core peptide, termed N34(L6)C28-HIS, contains N- and C-terminal helices that are joined by a six residue linker (Fig. 1A). It is similar to the previously described N34(L6)C28 peptide (21Lu M. Ji H. Shen S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4433-4438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but contains a C-terminal HIS tag to facilitate purification. Circular dichroism indicates that the molecule is >90% helical and thermostable, with a Tm of 74 °C. In addition, it forms a discretely trimeric species as determined by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 2 and Table I). When compared with published data for N34(L6)C28, N34(L6)C28-HIS has a 4 °C higher melting temperature. We speculate that addition of the C-terminal tag promotes stability by attenuating the helix dipole moment or by reducing fraying of the helical ends (19Fersht A. Julet M.

In each position, all mutants are less stable than wild-type, with the relative order Gly < Ala < Phe < wild-type. At position 568 the phenylalanine mutant (Tm of 61 °C) is only slightly more stable than the alanine mutant (Tm of 60 °C). The low stability of the L568F variant may be caused by local distortion to accommodate the large aromatic ring. All mutants are highly helical, and, with the exception of L565G (see “Materials and Methods”), the least thermostable variant in this study, all form clean trimers as evidenced by sedimentation equilibrium analysis (Table I). Interestingly, mutations at Gln-653 do not appreciably destabilize the six-helix bundle structure. The Q653A, Q653L, and Q653E mutants have Tm values close to that of wild-type and form stable trimers (Table I). Thus, in contrast to the effects observed with the cavity mutations, altering the native interhelical interaction within the glutamine layer does not substantially affect gp41 core stability. Expression and Processing of gp41 Variants—We examined the expression and processing of envelope mutants after transient transfection of mutant constructs into 293T cells. Transfection efficiency, assessed by co-transfection of a green fluorescent protein expression vector, was similar for all Env proteins. 2T. R. Suntoke and D. Chan, unpublished data. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates with an anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody reveals that all gp41 mutants, except L565A, are expressed and processed at levels similar to that of wild-type (Fig. 3, A and B). These results are quantitated by gel densitometry in Table II and are consistently similar to wild-type levels (80-120%). L565A gp41 is expressed at 60% of wild-type. The levels of cell surface Env were quantitated by surface biotinylation and precipitation using avidin-conjugated beads. Expression levels of mutant gp160 and gp41 on the cell surface were similar to that of wild-type (data not shown), and the ratio of surface gp41 to gp160 confirmed that proteolytic processing of the Env precursor was normal for all mutants (Table II).Table IISummary of Env expression, processing, and fusionEnvgp160 expressionaRelative Env expression was quantitated by densitometry.

Some mutations in gp41 affect its association with gp120, leading to the increased release of gp120 into the culture supernatant. Immunoprecipitation of gp120 from the culture medium followed by Western blot analysis shows that steady-state levels of shed gp120 are similar for wild-type and all mutants (Fig. 3 and Table II). These results further indicate that mutations at positions 565, 568, 570, and 653 in gp41 do not affect the native conformation of the envelope glycoprotein. Fusogenic Potential of Mutant Envelope Glycoproteins—The gp41 mutants were tested for membrane fusion activity with syncytia assays. For the N-helix mutants, there is good correlation between thermostability of the gp41 core and fusion activity (Table II). The glycine mutants, which are the least stable, have barely detectable levels of fusion. As the stabilities of the mutants increase, there is a simultaneous increase in fusion activity. This trend becomes clear when the fusion activity of the mutants is plotted as a function of gp41 stability (Fig. 4). This plot also reveals that the V570A mutant has unusually low fusion activity. V570A has intermediate stability (Tm of 62 °C) that is comparable with that of L565F, L568A, and L568F; however, unlike these three mutants, it is severely deficient in cell fusion activity. The reason for this anomaly remains to be determined. Our results agree with and extend previously published data for alanine mutants at positions 565, 568, and 570 (12Lu M. Stoller M.O. Wang S. Liu J. Fagan M.B. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11146-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Ji H. Shu W. Burling F.T. Jiang S. Lu M. J.

Virology. 2004; 329: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which suggest a similar correlation between fusion and core stability. The Gln-653 mutants provide a striking exception to this correlation. Despite its highly stable core structure, the Q653E substitution caused a 32% decrease in gp41 fusion activity compared with wild-type. A more severe mutation, Q653L, which abolishes polarity, further decreased gp41 function (55% of wild-type), whereas removal of both polarity and bulk with the Q653A mutation almost completely abrogated fusion. These results provide the first evidence that disruption of polar contacts within the gp41 glutamine layer decreases envelope-mediated fusion. The low fusogenicity of these 653 mutants, despite their extremely thermostable core structures, implicates the glutamine layer in a novel role in gp41 function. Fusion Kinetics of Alanine Mutants—In gp41-mediated fusion there is a significant lag time after mixing cells before the first fusion events are observed (23Gallo S.A. Finnegan C.M. Viard M. Raviv Y. Dimitrov A. Rawat S.S. Puri A. Durell S. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This delay is thought to reflect the slow conformational changes that occur in the envelope protein during the fusion process. Our N-helix mutants likely show fusion defects because weakened N-C helical interactions reduce the efficiency of membrane apposition. Alternatively, it is possible that attenuated N-C helical interactions also cause a delay in membrane apposition, resulting in a kinetic defect. In this scenario, Env molecules would display kinetics of fusion slower than that of wild-type, leading to a delay in the onset of initial fusion events. To test this possibility, the L565A, L568A, and V570A mutants were analyzed further. The alanine mutants were chosen because they display low but detectable levels of fusion. The kinetics of fusion at early time points was analyzed using 3T3 cell lines stably expressing L565A, L568A, and V570A mutant envelope glycoproteins. The alanine mutants displayed levels of expression and processing similar to wild-type and fusion phenotypes analogous to those seen with transient transfections (4% for L565A, 17% for L568A, and 2% for V570A).2 Dye labeling of envelope-expressing cells with a cytosolic marker, calcein-AM, and target cells with a lipid marker, R18, allowed initial fusion events to be detected as dual-labeled cells. For each cell line, fusion was monitored approximately every 25 min. Fig. 5 shows the fusion progression of the alanine mutants at early time points after the co-incubation of effector and target cells. A small number of dye transfer events was initially detected for wild-type gp41 between 15 and 30 min post-mixing, followed by a dramatic increase starting at 80 min. These results correspond well with reported fusion kinetics experiments in which initial fusion events are detected after time lag, followed by rapid acceleration (Ref. 23Gallo S.A. Finnegan C.M. Viard M. Raviv Y. Dimitrov A. Rawat S.S. Puri A. Durell S. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and references therein). With the alanine mutants it is difficult to reliably measure the onset of initial fusion events due to the low efficiency of fusion. Nevertheless, the acceleration phase for all the alanine mutants occurs between 80 and 100 min, indicating that the early kinetics for wild-type and mutant cell lines are similar. Structural studies of the HIV-1 envelope protein suggest an elegant mechanism through which gp41 mediates apposition of viral and target cell membranes: the interaction of N- and C-helices to form the six-helix bundle forces the target cell membrane (containing the inserted fusion peptide) close to the viral membrane (containing the gp41 transmembrane segment). If this model is correct, the efficiency of gp41-mediated membrane fusion should depend on the strength of the N-C interhelical interaction. Indeed, with three sets of N-helix mutants we observe a strong correlation between trimer-of-hairpins stability and membrane fusion (Fig. 4). Fusion activities decrease rapidly with decreased stability, and all mutants with a Tm of 57 °C or lower lack significant activity, suggesting that there may be a threshold stability necessary to mediate membrane apposition. To further test this model, it will be important to develop experimental systems to directly measure the free energy change during the transition of gp41 from its native conformation to its fusogenic conformation. Our fourth mutant series at C-helix position 653 shows markedly different results and suggests a significant role of the glutamine layer in gp41 function. Substitutions at position 653 do not significantly destabilize the hairpin but nevertheless reduce gp41-mediated membrane fusion (Tables I and II). Although the unusual structural features of the glutamine layer were noted in earlier structural studies (5Tan K. Liu J. Wang J. Shen S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), this is the first evidence of a functional role for this domain in membrane fusion. The basis for the glutamine layer requirement remains to be elucidated. Previous mutations in this region have not supported an essential role for this region in membrane fusion (10Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Radigen L. Jiang S. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Wang S. York J. Shu W. Stoller M.O. Nunberg J.H. Lu M.

Interestingly, in the N-helix, residues contributing to the glutamine layer are part of a small region implicated in resistance to the potent viral entry inhibitor enfuvirtide (reviewed in Ref. 24Greenberg M. Cammack N. Salgo M. Smiley L. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; 14: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (25Greenberg M.L. Cammack N. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2004; 54: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Viruses containing such mutations have reduced replicative fitness in vitro and revert back to wild-type in the absence of inhibitor (25Greenberg M.L. Cammack N. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2004; 54: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Lu J. Sista P. Giguel F. Greenberg M. Kuritzkes D.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4628-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, SNARE helical bundles involved in intracellular vesicle fusion appear to have a similar ionic layer, which may be important for efficient recycling of SNARE complexes (27Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Numerous studies using designed coiled coils suggest that buried polar residues can play important roles in interhelical interactions. For instance, a buried glutamine can decrease the strength of interaction between helices (28Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, a buried polar residue at the interface of a short dimeric coiled coil can influence the orientation of the dimer, facilitating reversibility of assembly (29Knappenberger J.A. Smith J.E. Thorpe S.H. Zitzewitz J.A. Matthews C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); this destabilization could permit the exchange of binding partners and may be biologically relevant. Although our Gln-653 mutations do not significantly change the stability or the oligomeric state of the gp41 core, it remains to be determined whether they have more subtle effects on gp41 protein structure.

These metalloproteases are type II integral membrane glycoproteins sharing a high degree of sequence homology, particularly within their large COOH-terminal domain, which contains their active site along with the consensus zinc-binding motif HEXXH. The recent disclosure of the tri-dimensional structure of NEP as revealed by x-ray crystallography (16Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Hennig M. Winkler F.K. Dale G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) has enabled modeling studies of other members of the family that suggest that their overall three-dimensional structures are also highly conserved inside as well as outside the active site (16Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Hennig M. Winkler F.K. Dale G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Voisin S. Rognan D. Gros C. Ouimet T. J. Biol.

Blood. 2003; 102: 3028-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of these metalloproteases is maintained by at least 10 conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges. Although the NEP structure has been shown to be held by six such bridges, it seems that five may be sufficient to confer a NEP-like structure and enzymatic profile because five may at best exist in NEP2, the closest NEP homologue (17Voisin S. Rognan D. Gros C. Ouimet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46172-46181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Ouimet T. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Whereas the cysteine residues of NEP are all involved in intramolecular disulfide bridges (21Oefner P.J. J. Chromatogr. B. 2002; 782: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), other members of the family have been shown to form intermolecular complexes through unpaired cysteine residues. For example, ECE-1 forms a homodimer through its non-conserved Cys412 residue (22Shimada K. Takahashi M. Turner A.J. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with subtle changes to the kinetic properties of the dimerized protease compared with the monomer (23Savage P. De Lombaert S. Shimada K. Tanzawa K. Jeng A.Y. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: S16-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Finally, Kell can form a heterodimer by linking Kx to its Cys72 residue (24Russo D. Redman C. Lee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13950-13956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the function of Kx remains unknown, the formation of the Kell-Kx complex seems to occur in the ER in COS cells (25Russo D. Lee S. Redman C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the lack of Kx, which leads to the McLeod phenotype, is also associated with decreased Kell antigenic reactivity on red blood cells (26Daniels G.L. Weinauer F. Stone C. Ho M. Green C.A. Jahn-Jochem H. Offner R. Monaco A.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other conserved features include post-translational modifications and, in particular, glycosylation, which has been shown to be relevant to the trafficking and enzymatic activity of these proteases (27Lafrance M.H. Vezina C. Wang Q. Boileau G. Crine P. Lemay G. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The predicted sequence of the Kell protein possesses five potential N-glycosylation sites. Among the identified point mutations of the Kell system so far, one may affect such a process, that of Kell K1, which is defined by a C to T base substitution in exon 6 leading to the replacement of a threonine by a methionine residue (T193M) within a putative N-glycosylation consensus sequence Asn-X-Thr/Ser. This mutation could alter the polysaccharide content of Kell and lead to a change in protein conformation and/or trafficking into the cellular machinery (29Lee S. Wu X. Reid M. Zelinski T. Redman C. Blood. 1995; 85: 912-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could in turn affect its function. NEP and NEP2 are rather promiscuous enzymes in vitro efficiently cleaving many small messenger peptides into inactive fragments (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although it has also been shown to cleave other messenger peptides in vitro (30Johnson G.D. Stevenson T. Ahn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4053-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), ECE-1 seems more specific insofar as it remains the only enzyme involved in the maturation of endothelin-1 by cleaving the inactive Big-endothelin-1 (Big-ET) intermediate at its Trp21-Val22 bond. Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictor peptides produced from three distinct genes, which code for distinct precursors and intermediates termed Big-ET-1, Big-ET-2, and Big-ET-3, the most abundant of which seems to be Big-ET-1 (31Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. Miyauchi T. Goto K. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar), the preferred substrate of ECE-1 (7Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In vivo, the use of specific inhibitors of neprilysin, e.g. thiorphan, has suggested NEP to be involved in the inactivation of enkephalins (32Malfroy B. Swerts J.P. Guyon A. Roques B.P. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1978; 276: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), tachykinins (33Matsas R. Fulcher I.S. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3111-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and atrial natriuretic peptide (34Gros C. Souque A. Schwartz J.C. Duchier J. Cournot A. Baumer P. Lecomte J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7580-7584Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As the enzymatic specificity and pharmacological profile of novel enzymes of the family are being characterized, however, the true physiological functions of each individual enzyme and of NEP, in particular, can be put into question (20Ouimet T. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Facchinetti P. Rose C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Neuroscience. 2003; 118: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, as members of a given family of proteins may have overlapping functions, it now becomes essential to study and characterize the orphan enzymes of this family. Whereas Kell as a blood group is well characterized in terms of antigenicity, its physiological function remains unclear. Even though Kell is mainly expressed in erythroid tissues like red blood cells, bone marrow, and fetal liver, Northern blot analysis has recently shown that Kell is also present in non-erythroid cells, primarily in testis and heart (36Russo D. Wu X. Redman C.M. Lee S. Blood. 2000; 96: 340-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dot blots further suggest its possible expression in brain (36Russo D. Wu X. Redman C.M. Lee S. Blood. 2000; 96: 340-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Camara-Clayette V. Rahuel C. Lopez C. Hattab C. Verkarre V. Bertrand O. Cartron J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recombinant soluble form of Kell (sKell) without its intracellular and membrane-spanning domains was expressed using insect cells and shown to possess an endothelin-converting enzyme activity, cleaving all three intermediates with a preference toward Big-ET-3, which was cleaved at its Trp21-Ile22 bond to produce mature ET-3 (38Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further characterize the enzymatic activity and specificity of the Kell protein and particularly its physiological forms in physiologically relevant systems, two antithetical and common antigenic forms of the blood group, K1 and K2, were expressed in either K562 cells, an erythroleukemia cell line, or in the endothelial HEK293 cells. The study of their subcellular distributions therein shows them to be identical despite their confirmed difference in glycosylation. However, whereas both K1 and K2 were expressed at the cell surface in both cell lines, only the Kell K2 protein possesses a metalloprotease activity that is characterized in detail using a model substrate as well as various bioactive messenger peptides. These results show the Kell protein bearing the K2 antigen to be a metalloprotease-inhibited by metal chelators and by the generic M13 family inhibitor phosphoramidon. The Kell K2 protein bound transition-state inhibitors known to be NEP-specific, such as thiorphan (39Patey G. De La Baume S. Schwartz J.C. Gros C. Roques B. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Soroca-Lucas E. Science. 1981; 212: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Roques B.P. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Soroca E. Lecomte J.M. Malfroy B. Llorens C. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1980; 288: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), with very high affinity. Finally, the previously suggested Big-ET-3 maturing activity of Kell (38Lee S. Lin M. Mele A. Cao Y. Farmar J. Russo D. Redman C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is confirmed for the Kell K2 antigen and novel physiological substrates identified. Materials—Synthetic fluorogenic and bioactive peptides were purchased from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Phosphoramidon, brefeldin A, monensin, and saponin were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentier Fallavier, France), whereas thiorphan, captopril, omapatrilat, and compound I were generous gifts from Bioprojet (Paris, France). All of the products used for cellular culture were from Invitrogen (Cergy Pontoise, France) unless otherwise stated. Kell K1 and Kell K2 Constructs—Starting material for PCR amplification of the Kell coding sequence was a human bone marrow cDNA library (Clontech Palo Alto, CA). Forward and reverse primers used for amplification were 5′-TGGGGGATCCGCCACCATGGAAGGTGGGGACCAAAGG-3′ and 5′-ACCCTCTAGAGTGGCATCTTTGGTAACCAAG-3′ respectively (the cloning sites are underlined and italicized). The purified PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and overhangs were filled with T4 DNA polymerase for blunt EcoRV cloning in pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). All of the enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Sequence verification demonstrated that the amplified Kell sequence corresponded to the common K2 antigen. To obtain the K1 sequence, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit and an adequate pair of primers (the sequence of the sense primer was 5′-CTTTAACCGA(C/T)GCTGAGACTTCTG-3′, the mismatch is indicated with underlined italics). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium, and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, both supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The pcDNA3.1 vector (control) and Kell K1 and Kell K2 constructs were transfected in HEK293 cells using Superfect (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) as previously described (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas K562 cells were transfected by electroporation. K562 and HEK293 clones expressing Kell K1, Kell K2, or the empty vector were selected after 2 weeks in culture medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml Geneticin and maintained in culture medium containing 200 μg/ml antibiotic. Routinely, HEK293 cells were scraped 4–5 days after seeding and harvested in ice-cold HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 7), whereas K562 cells were collected by centrifugation. After cell disruption with a Polytron (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland), membranes were obtained by centrifugation (twice at 50,000 × g for 40 min each), resuspended in HEPES buffer (50 mm, pH 7, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100) at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl, and solubilized in HEPES buffer containing 2% Brij-58: 1% Triton X-100 for 16 h at 4 °C, a combination of detergents that has previously been shown not to affect the enzymatic activity of metalloproteases of the M13 family (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The non-soluble fraction was subsequently removed by centrifugation. Endoglycosidase Digestions—HEK293 or K562 membranes (10 μg) expressing either Kell K1 or Kell K2 antigens were heat-denatured in SDS and incubated with either recombinant N-glycosidase F (NglyF, 2 units) or endoglycosidase H (EndoH, 2.5 milliunits) for 16 h at 37 °C according to the supplier's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France). Controls were incubated without enzyme, and samples were then processed for immunoblotting. Red blood cells (RBCs) with known phenotypes were obtained from the Centre National de Reference pour Les Groupes Sanguins (Paris, France). They were washed in digestion buffer (112.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm PO4, 50 mm EDTA, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm 2-aminoethyl-benzosulfonylfluorohydrochloride, 2 mm Pefabloc, pH 7.5), diluted 10 times in the same buffer, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 10 units of N-glycosidase F in a final volume of 230 μl. Total digestion of the samples was verified by running an aliquot on a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting, whereas the remaining cells were sorted using various antigen-specific antibodies (see below). Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded on 14-mm collagen-coated coverslips and fixed after 24 h with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, and nonspecific binding was saturated with preincubation buffer (10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 0.2% BSA, 0.05% saponin in PBS). The Kell-specific monoclonal antibody 5A11 directed toward the common, intracellular, amino-terminal region of the protein (41Jaber A. Loirat M.J. Willem C. Bloy C. Cartron J.P. Blanchard D. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was diluted (1/1000) in preincubation buffer and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody (goat antibody directed against rabbit IgG coupled to CY3; 1/250; Interchim). Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol and observed with a Leica confocal microscope. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—HEK cells (5 × 105) were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS/BSA (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (w/v)). 100 μl of antibodies in PBS/BSA were added at saturating concentrations to the cell suspension, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at 25 °C. After washing in PBS/BSA, the cells were incubated with 100 μl of fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG (Beckman Coulter, Villepinte, France) for 45 min at 25 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were suspended in 500 μl of PBS/BSA containing 0.2 mg/ml propidium iodide. Analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the CellQuest software. Propidium iodide-positive dead cells were excluded from analysis. HEK cells expressing the Kell K2 antigen were sorted with the mouse monoclonal F7 clone (obtained from Dr. P. Rubinstein, the New York Blood Center), whereas K1 antigen-expressing HEK cells were identified according to their reactivity toward the human T27S antibody (42Goossens D. Champonier F. Rouger P. Salmon C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 101: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Washed and treated red blood cells were diluted in 1 ml of PBS/BSA. 100 μl of saturating concentrations of antibodies were mixed with 50 μl of the cell suspension and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. After another washing step, the cells were incubated with 100 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse or anti-human IgG (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min at 25 °C. After washing with PBS, red blood cells were suspended in 500 μl of PBS/BSA and analyzed as above in the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. These experiments were performed using F7 and monoclonal MIMA 15 (New York Blood Center) (43Tearina Chu T.H. Halverson G.R. Yazdanbakhsh K. Oyen R. Reid M.E. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) antibodies for Kell K2 as well as human CARS (Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine), monoclonal MIMA 23 (New York Blood Center), and T27S (42Goossens D. Champonier F. Rouger P. Salmon C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 101: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) antibodies for K1. Mean fluorescence intensity was used as a reliable index of cell reactivity toward monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Cell Treatments—HEK293 cell lines expressing either Kell K1 or Kell K2 antigens were brought to 80–90% confluency in 150-mm plates. Treatments proceeded for 16 h in fresh culture medium supplemented with either 5 μg/ml transport blocker brefeldin A or 5 μm monensin, an inhibitor of vesicular transport. Vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus was also blocked by incubating the cell lines for 8 h at 15 and 20 °C, respectively. Cells were harvested and disrupted immediately following either treatment, and membrane fractions were produced and solubilized as described above. Immunoblotting—Samples were diluted in buffer (4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer, 10× NuPAGE sample-reducing agent), subjected to SDS/PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). After 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% BSA, blots were incubated with the Kell-specific monoclonal 5A11 antibody (1/5000) for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoblots were revealed after a 1-h incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (1/3000; Bio-Rad) using SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Perbio Science France). Partial Purification of Kell K1 and Kell K2 Proteins—Solubilized HEK293 membranes expressing either vector alone or Kell K1 or K2 antigen were loaded onto 2.5 ml of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100. After a 15-ml wash with the equilibration buffer without detergent, columns were eluted with 5 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 m N-acetylglucosamine and 0.05% Triton X-100. For mass spectrometry studies, these preparations were subjected to two additional purification steps. Eluates from the lectin columns were diluted 2-fold with 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 m (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a fast flow phenyl-Sepharose (phenyl-Seph.) HiTrap column (1 ml/min, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 m (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. After washing with 15 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was subjected to a graded step elution protocol using 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 m (NH4)2SO4 supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. Fractions were immunoblotted with the Kell-specific antibody, and reactive fractions were pooled and concentrated on a Centricon YM 100 device (Millipore, Brumath, France), whereas the (NH4)2SO4 buffer was replaced by 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were quantified with BSA standards using the DC protein assay reagent package (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Activity Assays and Inhibitory Potencies—Enzymatic activities were assayed essentially as described by Rose et al. (28Rose C. Voisin S. Gros C. Schwartz J.C. Ouimet T. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A series of synthetic fluorogenic peptides (20 μm) were tested using 10 μg of total protein from the Kell K1 and Kell K2 lectin purification step (concanavalin A) and diluted in the reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100). For Km determinations, the incubation mixtures were comprised of 10 μg of total protein from the lectin fraction of either Kell K1 or K2 HEK293 cell membranes and from 1 to 128 μm Glut-FAAF-AMC or Suc-AAF-AMC diluted in 100 μl of reaction buffer. Incubations proceeded for 60 min at 37 °C followed by a 60-min incubation at 56 °C with an excess of aminopeptidase M to release the fluorescent AMC moiety. Inhibitory potencies were determined as follows. 20 μm Glut-FAAF-AMC an"
https://openalex.org/W1976823132,"Previous work demonstrated both acid and neutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase activities in rat liver homogenates. Here we present the purification, identification, and characterization of an acid retinyl ester hydrolase activity from solubilized rat liver microsomes. Purification to homogeneity was achieved by sequential chromatography using SP-Sepharose cation exchange, phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction, concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity and Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography. The isolated protein had a monomer molecular mass of ∼62 kDa, as measured by mass spectrometry. Gel filtration chromatography of the purified protein revealed a native molecular mass of ∼176 kDa, indicating that the protein exists as a homotrimeric complex in solution. The purified protein was identified as carboxylesterase ES-10 (EC 3.1.1.1) by N-terminal Edman sequencing and extensive LC-MS/MS sequence analysis and cross-reaction with an anti-ES-10 antibody. Glycosylation analysis revealed that only one of two potential N-linked glycosylation sites is occupied by a high mannose-type carbohydrate structure. Using retinyl palmitate in a micellar assay system the enzyme was active over a broad pH range and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 86 μm. Substrate specificity studies showed that ES-10 is also able to catalyze hydrolysis of triolein. Cholesteryl oleate was not a substrate for ES-10 under these assay conditions. Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that ES-10 is highly expressed in liver and lung. Lower levels of ES-10 mRNA were also found in kidney, testis, and heart. A comparison of mRNA expression levels in liver demonstrated that ES-10, ES-4, and ES-3 were expressed at significantly higher levels than ES-2, an enzyme previously thought to play a major role in retinyl ester metabolism in liver. Taken together these data indicate that carboxylesterase ES-10 plays a major role in the hydrolysis of newly-endocytosed, chylomicron retinyl esters in both neutral and acidic membrane compartments of liver cells.

Higher eukaryotic organisms require dietary vitamin A (retinol), which gives rise to a variety of active metabolites. Retinoids are needed for important physiological processes such as vision, reproduction, growth, development, and immune function. Vitamin A must be obtained from the diet either as preformed vitamin A in foods of animal origin or as provitamin A carotenoids in fruits and vegetables. Preformed vitamin A is found in the diet mainly in the form of long-chain fatty acid esters (retinyl esters), with minor amounts found in the form of retinol and retinoic acid (1Silveira R.E. Moreno F.S. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 446-456Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Following ingestion, dietary retinyl esters are hydrolyzed to retinol in the lumen of the small intestine. This activity was previously thought to be catalyzed by pancreatic carboxylester lipase (2Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-256Google Scholar); however, experiments with a carboxylester lipase knock-out mouse model indicated that the luminal hydrolysis of retinyl esters is catalyzed by pancreatic triglyceride lipase (3van Bennekum A.M. Fisher E.A. Blaner W.S. Harrison E.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4900-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rigtrup et al. (4Rigtrup K.M. Ong D.E.

Nutr. 1994; 60: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) also identified an enzyme with alkaline retinyl ester hydrolase activity in intestinal brush border membranes, which is thought to be phospholipase B. Liberated retinol is subsequently absorbed by enterocytes, reesterified with long-chain fatty acids primarily by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, incorporated into chylomicrons, and secreted into the lymphatic system.After transport to and uptake by the liver, retinyl esters are hydrolyzed to retinol by neutral and acid retinyl ester hydrolases (REH). 1The abbreviations used are: REH, retinyl ester hydrolase; AREH, acid retinyl ester hydrolase; AS, ammonium sulfate; Con A, concanavalin A; DSA, Datura stramonium agglutinin; Endo H, β-endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; MAA, Maackia amurensis agglutinin; MALDI-ToF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MG, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside; MS, mass spectrometry; NaAc, sodium acetate; OG, octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; PNA, peanut agglutinin; PNGase F, peptide N-glycanase F; SELDI-TOF, surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight; SNA, Sambucus nigra agglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-glycine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; RBP, retinol-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: REH, retinyl ester hydrolase; AREH, acid retinyl ester hydrolase; AS, ammonium sulfate; Con A, concanavalin A; DSA, Datura stramonium agglutinin; Endo H, β-endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; MAA, Maackia amurensis agglutinin; MALDI-ToF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; MG, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside; MS, mass spectrometry; NaAc, sodium acetate; OG, octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; PNA, peanut agglutinin; PNGase F, peptide N-glycanase F; SELDI-TOF, surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight; SNA, Sambucus nigra agglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-glycine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; RBP, retinol-binding protein. Retinol is then transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it binds to retinol-binding protein (RBP) before secretion into the circulation as a retinol-RBP complex. Excess retinol is transported by a yet unknown mechanism to hepatic stellate cells for storage as retinyl ester. Mobilization of these reserves during times of inadequate dietary intake again requires hydrolysis by neutral and/or acidic REHs (1Silveira R.E. Moreno F.S. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 446-456Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The enzymatic hydrolysis of retinyl esters in liver plays an important role in maintaining constant plasma retinol levels and is a key step in the formation and utilization of hepatic vitamin A reserves. Several enzymes, such as pancreatic carboxylester lipase, pancreatic triglyceride lipase, and members of the nonspecific carboxylesterase gene family have been identified in the past that can hydrolyze retinyl esters in vitro (6Harrison E.H. Annu Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Research has also focused on the enzyme(s) that catalyze this important reaction in liver cells.

Hagen et al. (15Hagen E. Myhre A.M. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Norum K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated in a cell culture model that most of the chylomicron remnant-derived retinyl ester is hydrolyzed in increasingly acidic endosomal compartments and that lysosomes do not contribute significantly to retinyl ester hydrolysis. Similar conclusions were drawn from experiments in intact rats by Harrison et al. (16Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even less is known about retinyl ester hydrolysis in hepatic stellate cells. Azais-Braesco and co-workers (17Mercier M. Forget A. Grolier P. Azais-Braesco V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) isolated retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets from liver stellate cells and showed that an unidentified acid REH activity could use these lipid droplets as substrate for retinyl ester hydrolysis (18Azais-Braesco V.

The aim of the present investigation was to purify and characterize the bile salt-independent, acid REH from rat liver microsomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Frozen livers (average wet weight, ∼14 g) from male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals; retinyl-[1-14C]palmitate (2.22 GBq/mmol), cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (2.22 GBq/mmol), and [9,10-3H]triolein (0.74 TBq/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; Triton X-100, Triton X-100RS, and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) were from Sigma; Scintiverse-BD liquid scintillation liquid was from Fisher Scientific; SP-Sepharose FF, phenyl-Sepharose HP, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and Superose 12 were from Amersham Biosciences; Precision Protein Standards and Biosafe Coomassie Blue G-250 were from Bio-Rad; Peptide: N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H were from New England BioLabs; bicinchoninic acid and bovine serum albumin standards were from Pierce, Biomax 30 filters were from Millipore, H4 protein chips were from Ciphergen; and tissue-specific rat total RNA was from Ambion. All other reagents were of the highest purity available.Isolation of Hepatic Microsomes—Rat liver microsomes were prepared as previously described by Gad and Harrison (10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen rat livers were thawed and washed twice with an ice-cold sucrose/Tris buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2). Individual livers were minced with a scalpel and processed through a tissue press. The minced liver tissue was resuspended in sucrose/Tris buffer and homogenized with three strokes of a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in sucrose/Tris buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged again as described above. The combined supernatants were centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 × g. The pelleted microsomes were resuspended with a Dounce homogenizer in sucrose buffer (250 mm) at a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at -80 °C.Enzyme and Protein Assays—REH activity was measured with minor modifications by a radiometric method described previously by Harrison and Gad (7Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, 10 μl of sodium acetate buffer (250 mm, pH 5.0) and 15 μl of enzyme source (freshly thawed subcellular or eluted fractions) were added together on ice. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of retinyl palmitate (500 pmol, with tracer radiolabeled retinyl-[1-14C]palmitate (∼12.5 nCi)) in 25 μl of water containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). Assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 812.5 μl of methanol/chloroform/heptane (1.41:1.25:1.0, v/v/v) and 262.5 μl of potassium carbonate/borate buffer (100 mm, pH 10). An aliquot of the upper aqueous phase was mixed with scintillation solvent and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of hydrolyzed retinyl palmitate was calculated from the specific radioactivity of the substrate and the partition coefficient of palmitic acid. The same enzymatic test was applied to assay cholesteryl esterase and triolein lipase activities by substituting labeled cholesteryl oleate and labeled triolein, respectively, for retinyl palmitate as substrate. These assays were carried out with 1.5 μg of purified ES-10 (Superose 12 pool). Several different proteins are known to bind retinol. To test whether these proteins can stimulate retinyl ester hydrolase activity in our in vitro assay system, bovine serum albumin and β-lactoglobulin were added to the test mixture at the following concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/ml. Serum retinol-binding protein and recombinant apocellular retinol-binding protein 1 were added to the test mixture at the following concentrations: 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml. Enzyme activity measurement were carried out with 1.5 μg of purified ES-10 (Superose 12 pool) at acidic and neutral pH. Protein concentrations were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard. All enzyme activity assays were performed three times in triplicates using ES-10 purified according to the previously described protocol. Enzyme kinetics was analyzed with the Origin 5.0 Professional software package.Solubilization of Acid REH Activity from Hepatic Microsomal Membranes—Freshly thawed microsomes were diluted with 250 mm sucrose to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged for 60 min at 4 °C at 105,000 × g using a Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was collected and used as starting material for the purification of acid REH.Purification of REH by Sequential Chromatography—Detergent-solubilized microsomes were adjusted with NaAc to pH 5.0 and a final concentration of 25 mm NaAc. The solution was clarified by centrifugation for 60 min at 105,000 × g and used as starting material for cation exchange chromatography. The clarified supernatant was directly applied to a SP-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with a NaAc buffer (25 mm NaAc, pH 5.0, 0.1% Triton X-100RS). After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in sodium acetate buffer. Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized with a Tris/HCl buffer to pH 7.2 and brought to a final concentration of 50 mm Tris/HCl. The fractions with the highest specific activities were pooled, adjusted to 0.5 m ammonium sulfate (AS) and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column, equilibrated with an AS/Tris buffer (0.5 m AS, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2). After extensive washing with the same buffer, bound protein was eluted with a N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG)/Tris buffer (25 mm OG, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2). Fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled, adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl, and applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column equilibrated with Con A buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm OG, 1 mm Mn/CaCl2). After extensive washing, specifically bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 m methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in Con A buffer. Fractions with the highest specific activity were pooled, concentrated with a Biomax 30 centrifugal filter, and loaded onto a Superose 12 high resolution column equilibrated with a Tris/NaCl gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm OG). Fractions with the highest specific activity were concentrated and stored in frozen aliquots at -80 °C.SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and N-terminal Sequence Analysis— SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out with the Tris/Tricine buffer system according to Schagger and Von Jagow (19Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels (10 × 7 cm) and visualized by colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 or silver staining according to standard protocols (20Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar, 21Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Towbin transfer buffer system (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol). Transferred proteins were stained with Amido Black for 1 min, destained with diluted acetic acid for 5 min, and washed extensively with MilliQ water. N-terminal Edman sequence analysis was carried out by the Protein Microchemistry/Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA) on an Applied Biosystems Model 494 Precise Protein Sequencer. Additional sequence information was obtained by in-gel tryptic digestion of purified REH and LC-MS/MS analysis at the Protein Microchemistry/Mass Spectrometry Facility on a Finnigan LCQ Classic Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer with Nanocapillary HPLC.On-chip Glycosylation Analysis by SELDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry— Purified REH was adjusted to 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and spotted onto the surface of an H4 protein chip pretreated with 100% acetonitrile. The sample was air-dried, and spotting was repeated two more times. After a brief wash with MilliQ water, the protein chip was placed in an 8-well bioprocessor. The samples were incubated either without or with 1 unit of PNGase F (in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) or 1 unit of Endo H (in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5) in a final volume of 50 μl. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the protein chip was briefly washed with MilliQ water and air-dried. 1 μl of a saturated solution of sinapinnic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in MilliQ water was deposited on the individual spots of the protein chips. Glycosylated and deglycosylated REH was analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry.cDNA Synthesis and Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—cDNA was synthesized in a total volume of 20 μl, from 5 μg of rat total RNA (Ambion) in the presence of random primers and ImProm-II™ reverse transcriptase (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. mRNA expression was determined by real time RT-PCR on an ABI PRISM™ 7700 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Probes and Primers (Table I) were designed with the Primer Express 1.5 software program (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Keystone DNA BIOSOURCE International (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). PCR amplification was performed in capped 96-well optical plates. PCR reactions were carried out with the cDNA equivalent of 100 ng of RNA/well in a total volume of 50 μl using the Stratagene Brilliant kit (La Jolla, CA). After an initial step of 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, 40 thermal cycles were carried out for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed by the Comparative Threshold Cycle (CT) method (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, User Bulletin 2) using the rat ribosomal protein L32 as standard for comparisons.Table IRat probe and primer sequences used for real time RT-PCRTarget DNA (GenBank™)Probes (conc.)aOptimized probe and primer concentrations are indicated in parenthesesForward primer (conc.)aOptimized probe and primer concentrations are indicated in parenthesesReverse primer (conc.)aOptimized probe and primer concentrations are indicated in parentheses5′-FAM-3′-BHQ5′-3′5′-3′L32 (NM_013226)CAGCACAGCTGGCCATCAGAGTCACCCGAAAAGCCATCGTAGAAAGACCTGGCGTTGGGATTGG(200 nm)(300 nm)(900 nm)ES-10 (NM_133295)TGGGCTATCCACTCTCCGAAGGCAAGCAAGAGTTTGGCTGGATCATAGAGGGATTTGGCTGTTTTCTG(200 nm)(300 nm)(900 nm)ES-4 (X81825)CTGGATGTGAAACCACCACATCTGCCCAGCCGCTAAGCAAATTGCTACGAGGCAGTGAACAATGA(200 nm)(300 nm)(900 nm)ES-3 (NM_031565)ATCCCAATGGACAGGGCCTGCCCTGGGCAAACTTTGCTAGGAATTTGGTCATACTCTGGCCAATG(200 nm)(900 nm)(900 nm)ES-2 (NM_133586)CACGGAAACAACCACATAGCTGGCTGGCCCGACGAACTGAGAACTGGAATAAGCAGGAGCCCAAAGAG(200 nm)(900 nm)(900 nm)a Optimized probe and primer concentrations are indicated in parentheses Open table in a new tab RESULTSPurification of Acid Retinyl Ester Hydrolase—Gad and Harrison (10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported previously that rat liver microsomes contain both bile salt-independent, neutral and bile salt-independent, acid REH activities. Rat liver microsomes were therefore used as enzyme source for developing an AREH purification protocol. Initially, a number of different non-ionic detergents were screened for their ability to effectively solubilize AREH activity from microsomal membranes. Triton X-100, Nonidet P40, Tween 20, OG, and OTG were found to be equally effective solubilizers of AREH activity when used above their respective critical micellar concentrations (data not shown). AREH activity was subsequently purified from Triton X-100-solubilized microsomal membranes by sequential chromatography using cation ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction and lectin affinity chromatography. Trial experiments showed that binding of AREH activity to concanavalin A-Sepharose was inhibited by the presence of Triton X-100 in the binding buffer; however, increased affinity of AREH activity to Con A-Sepharose was observed when Triton X-100 was replaced by OG in the binding buffer. As a consequence, a detergent exchange was incorporated into the elution protocol of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step. Purification to near homogeneity was achieved by a final gel filtration step with a calibrated Superose 12 HR10/30 column, which not only removed remaining impurities but also provided additional insight into the degree of complexation of AREH activity in solution. Analytical gel filtration estimated the native molecular mass of AREH to be ∼176 kDa (Fig. 1). The presence of octyl glucoside in the gel filtration buffer was necessary to prevent a significant loss of total retinyl ester hydrolase activity during this purification step. The purification of AREH activity was monitored by the increase in specific activity (Table II) and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that the enrichment of AREH activity resulted in the purification of a protein with a monomer molecular mass of ∼60 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Taken together with the analytical gel filtration results, these data indicate that AREH activity exists as a homotrimeric complex in solution. Densitometric analysis of the gel filtration eluate revealed that the AREH-containing sample was ∼95% pure (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). Table II summarizes the purification of AREH activity using 5 rat livers as starting material. To date, 4 preparations of the enzyme have been carried out according to the described protocol with similar results in specific activity, yield and enrichment to those shown in Table II. Table II demonstrates that Triton X-100 not only releases AREH from microsomal membranes but that it also stimulates total AREH activity ∼3-fold. Enrichment and yield of AREH activity were therefore calculated in respect to the solubilized supernatant of the microsomal membrane preparation to take this stimulatory effect into account. In contrast, AREH activity became increasingly unstable once it was solubilized from microsomal membranes, which resulted in a loss of over 90% of total AREH activity during the subsequent four chromatographic purification steps (Table II). Because the sensitivity of AREH to serine and cysteine protease inhibitors was not known, these inhibitors were not included in the solubilization buffer. Furthermore, some proteasomes are associated with microsomal membranes (22Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Thomson S. Hendil K.B. Butcher G.W. Fuertes G. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and might therefore be responsible for the loss of enzymatic activity observed after the solubilization and subsequent purification steps.Table IIPurification of a bile salt-independent AREH from solubilized rat liver microsomesFractionVolumeProtein. conc.Total proteinTotal activitySpecific activityEnrichmentYieldmlmg/mlmgnmol/hnmol/mg·hfold%Microsomes5012.86407041.1Solubilized microsomal supernatant3200.51602080131100SP-Sepharose pool500.63089729.92.343Phenyl-Sepharose pool200.3624741.33.211.8Con A-Sepharose pool180.183.220363.54.99.7Superose 12 gel filtration80.322.5617267.45.28.3 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of AREH during protein purification.

The resulting peptide mass fingerprint was then compared with the peptide mass fingerprints of all known rat proteins in the non-redundant NCBI data base with the Mascot protein search software. The initial search successfully matched the tryptic peptide map to several different proteins of the highly homologous carboxylesterase family but failed to unambiguously identify a single protein. As a consequence, the in-gel tryptic digest of the purified protein was subjected to LC-MS/MS sequence analysis, which identified the purified AREH activity as rat liver carboxylesterase ES-10. The N terminus of mature ES-10 was identified by automated Edman degradation of the intact protein and was found to have the sequence: YPSSPPVVNTVKGKV (Table III). A polyclonal antibody raised against the 13 C-terminal amino acids of ES-10 also reacted with the purified protein, further confirming the identification of AREH as ES-10 (data not shown).Table IIIEnzymatic properties of carboxylesterase ES-10 as a bile salt-independent REHMolecular mass (kDa)aDetermined by MALDI-ToF MSGlycosylated ES-1062Deglycosylated ES-10"

The mutation of Ala54 to leucine destabilizes the T-state of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The mutant enzyme retains wild-type levels of activity, but the concentration of AMP that causes 50% inhibition increases 50-fold. In the absence of AMP, the Leu54 enzyme adopts an R-state conformation nearly identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzyme, however, grows in two crystal forms in the presence of saturating AMP. In one form, the AMP-bound tetramer is in a T-like conformation, whereas in the other form, the AMP-bound tetramer is in a R-like conformation. The latter reveals conformational changes in two helices due to the binding of AMP. Helix H1 moves toward the center of the tetramer and displaces Ile10 from a hydrophobic pocket. The displacement of Ile10 exposes a hydrophobic surface critical to interactions that stabilize the T-state. Helix H2 moves away from the center of the tetramer, breaking hydrogen bonds with a buried loop (residues 187–195) in an adjacent subunit. The same hydrogen bonds reform but only after the quaternary transition to the T-state. Proposed here is a model that accounts for the quaternary transition and cooperativity in the inhibition of catalysis by AMP.

AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F26P2) binding to allosteric and active sites, respectively, inhibit FBPase while simultaneously activating its counterpart in glycolysis, fructose-6-phosphate 1-kinase (3Van Schaftingen E.

Biosynthesis and degradation of F26P2 are subject to hormonal control principally by glucagon and insulin (4Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Claus T.H. Ann. Rev.

F26P2 enhances the binding of AMP to FBPase by up to an order of magnitude (6Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi R.M. McGrane M.M. Pilkis J. Claus T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, although intracellular concentrations of AMP remain relatively constant, AMP should become a more potent inhibitor of FBPase as concentrations of F26P2 increase. AMP binds 28 Å away from the nearest active site and perhaps not surprisingly inhibits catalysis noncompetitively with respect to F16P2. Yet, AMP is a competitive inhibitor of catalysis with respect to essential divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+), all of which are in proximity to (and probably coordinate with) the 1-phosphoryl group of F16P2 (7Liu F.

Substrates or products in combination with metal cations stabilize the R-state conformation. A proposed mechanism for allosteric regulation of catalysis involves three conformational states of loop 52–72 called engaged, disengaged, and disordered (14Nelson S.W. Kurbanov F. Honzatko R.B.

Fluorescence from a tryptophan reporter group at position 57 is consistent with the conformational states for loop 52–72 observed in crystal structures (19Nelson S.W. Choe J.-Y. Iancu C.V.

Thus far, the engaged conformation of loop 52–72 has appeared only in R-state crystal structures and the disengaged conformer has appeared only in T-state structures; however, disordered conformations of the dynamic loop have appeared in both the R- and T-states (16Choe J.-Y.

Crystal structures of the R- and T-states are the endpoints of the allosteric transition and leave much to speculation regarding intermediate conformational states of FBPase. The immediate consequences of AMP binding to the R-state are unknown. Does the dynamic loop become disengaged in response to the binding of AMP or in response to the allosteric transition to the T-state? How does the binding of AMP destabilize the R-state and stabilize the T-state? A recent study (23Choe J.-Y. Nelson S.W. Arienti K.L. Axe F.U. Collins T.L. Jones T.K. Kimmich R. D.A. Newman M.J. Norvell K. Ripka W.C. Romano S.J. Short K.M. Slee D.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51175-51183Google Scholar) revealed the first intermediate state of porcine FBPase, a T-like conformation due to the binding of an allosteric effector to the center of the tetramer. The results of that study indicated the potential for trapping intermediate conformational states of FBPase by crystallization.The mutation of Ala54 to leucine disrupts key packing interactions of the disengaged loop conformation. The resulting Leu54 enzyme has wild-type catalytic properties and retains cooperativity in AMP inhibition but exhibits a 50-fold increase in the IC50 for AMP. In the absence of AMP, Leu54 FBPase is in its canonical R-state. However, two crystal forms grow in the presence of saturating AMP. In one crystal form, the enzyme is in its T-state but with a disordered dynamic loop. In the other crystal form, the tetramer is in an R-like quaternary state with an engaged dynamic loop. The latter crystal form reveals the immediate consequences of AMP association in the absence of an allosteric transition. The observed conformational changes suggest the mechanism by which AMP leverages the allosteric transition in FBPase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—F16P2, F26P2, NADP+, and AMP were purchased from Sigma. DNA-modifying and restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligase were from Promega. Glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase came from Roche Applied Science. Other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent. Escherichia coli strains BMH 71–18 mutS and XL1-Blue came from Clontech and Stratagene, respectively. The FBPase-deficient E. coli strain DF 657 came from the Genetic Stock Center at Yale University.Mutagenesis of Wild-type FBPase—The mutation of Ala54 to leucine was accomplished by specific base changes in a double-stranded plasmid containing the gene coding for FBPase using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The mutagenic primer for Ala54→ Leu was 5′-GGCGGGCATCCTGCACCTC-3′ (the codon with the point mutation is underlined in boldface). The selection primer for mutagenesis, 5′-CAGCCTCGCCTCGAGAACGCCA-3′ (digestion site underlined in boldface), changed an original NruI site on the plasmid into a XhoI site. The mutation and the integrity of the construct were confirmed by sequencing the promoter region and the entire open reading frame. The Iowa State University sequencing facility provided DNA sequences using the fluorescent dye-dideoxy terminator method.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Leu54 FBPases—Cell-free extracts of wild-type and Leu54 FBPases were subjected to heat treatment (63 °C for 7 min) followed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a Cibracon Blue-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was washed first with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Enzyme was eluted with a solution of 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl of the same pH. After pressure concentration (Amicon PM-30 membrane) and dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the protein sample was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Purified enzyme was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for kinetic investigations and for crystallization experiments. Purity and protein concentrations of FBPase preparations were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar), respectively.Kinetic Experiments—Assays for the determination of kcat and specific activity ratios at pH 7.5/9.5 employed the coupling enzymes, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Benkovic S.T. de Maine M.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 45-82PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. All of the other assays used the same coupling enzymes but monitored the formation of NADPH by its fluorescence emission at 470 nm using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Assays were performed at 22 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, or in 50 mm CAPS, pH 9.5. Assay solutions contained EDTA and KCl at concentrations of 10 μm and 150 mm, respectively. Initial rates were analyzed with programs written either in MINITAB using an α value of 2.0 (26Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by ENZFITTER (27Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A Non-Linear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1987: 13-75Google Scholar). The kinetic data for AMP inhibition with respect to Mg2+ and F26P2 inhibition with respect to F16P2 were fit to several models, but only the parameters associated with the best-fitting mechanism of inhibition are reported under “Results.”Crystallization of the Product Complex—Crystals of Leu54 FBPase were grown by the method of hanging drops. Equal parts of a protein solution and a precipitant solution were combined in a droplet of 4 μl of total volume. Wells contained 500 μl of the precipitant solution. R-state crystals grew from a protein solution (Leu54 FBPase (10 mg/ml), Hepes (25 mm, pH 7.4), MgCl2 (5 mm), and F16P2 (5 mm)) combined with a precipitant solution (Hepes (100 mm, pH 7.4), polyethylene glycol 3350 (8% (w/v)), glycerol (27% (v/v)), and t-butyl alcohol (5% (v/v))). Crystals of the R-like AMP complex grew from a protein solution (Leu54 FBPase (10 mg/ml), Hepes (25 mm, pH 7.4), MgCl2 (5 mm), F16P2 (5 mm), and AMP (5 mm)) combined with a precipitant solution (Hepes (100 mm, pH 7.4), polyethylene glycol 3350 (12% (w/v)), glycerol (23% (v/v)), and t-butyl alcohol (5% (v/v))). Crystals of the T-state AMP complex grew from a protein solution (Leu54 FBPase (10 mg/ml), Hepes (25 mm, pH 7.4), MgCl2 (5 mm), F16P2 (5 mm), and AMP (5 mm)) combined with a precipitant solution (Hepes (100 mm, pH 7.4), polyethylene glycol 3350 (14% (w/v)), 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (21% (v/v)), and t-butyl alcohol (5% (v/v))). Crystals were of equal dimensions (0.2–0.4 mm), growing in approximately 3 days at 20 °C. Conditions of crystallization include cryoprotectants. Crystals can be transferred directly from droplet to liquid nitrogen.Data Collection—Data were collected at Iowa State University from single crystals on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system and a temperature of 110 K. Data were reduced with the program package CrystalClear provided with the instrument.Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—Crystals of Leu54 FBPase are isomorphous to either the AMP/Zn2+-product complex (16Choe J.-Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or the Zn2+-product complex (10Choe J-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 11441-11450Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Phase angles used in the generation of initial electron density maps were based on model 1EYJ or 1CNQ of the Protein Data Bank from which water molecules, metal cations, small molecule ligands, and residues 52–72 had been omitted. Residues 52–72 were built into the electron density of omit maps using the program XTALVIEW (28McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Ligands were added to account for omit electron density at the active site and/or the AMP site. The resulting models underwent refinement using CNS (29Brü nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu M.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) with force constants and parameters of stereochemistry from Engh and Huber (30Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). A cycle of refinement consisted of slow cooling from 1000 to 300 K in steps of 25 K followed by 120 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and concluded by the refinement of individual thermal parameters. Thermal parameter refinement employed restraints of 1.5 Å2 on nearest neighbor and next-to-nearest neighbor main chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 on nearest neighbor side chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 on next-to-nearest neighbor side chain atoms.In subsequent cycles of refinement, water molecules were fit to difference electron density of 2.5σ or better and were added until no significant decrease was evident in the Rfree value. Water molecules in the final models make suitable donor-acceptor distances to each other and the protein and have thermal parameters under 60 Å2. Stereochemistry of the models was examined by the use of PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).RESULTSRationale for the Leu54→ Ala Mutation—The Cβ atom of Ala54 is at the center of a cluster of hydrophobic side chains, which forms only when the dynamic loop is in its T-state-disengaged conformation. A mutation at position 54 to a large side chain should disrupt packing interactions and thereby destabilize the disengaged conformation of the dynamic loop. In contrast, ample room is available for large side chains at position 54 in the R-state-engaged conformation of the loop. The Ala54→ Leu mutation then should shift the equilibrium population of AMP complexes of FBPase toward the R-state.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Leu54 FBPases—Expression and isolation procedures described above provide wild-type and Leu54 FBPases in at least 95% purity, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Gels indicated no proteolysis of the purified enzymes.Kinetics Experiments—Kinetics parameters for Leu54 and wild-type FBPases are in Table I. The determination of kcat and Km for F16P2 (listed as KmF16P2 in Table I) at pH 7.5 employed a saturating concentration of Mg2+ (2 mm for Leu54 FBPase and 5 mm for wild-type FBPase) and concentrations of substrate ranging from 0.5 to 20 μm. A fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data provided values for kcat and KmF16P2 (Michaelis constant for F26P2). Ratios of specific activities at pH 7.5–9.5 for wild-type and Leu54 FBPases (each above 3) are indicative of tetrameric enzymes with intact (nonproteolyzed) polypeptide chains.Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and Leu54 FBPases Parameters are defined under “Results.”Wild typeLeu54→AlaActivity ratio, pH 7.5:9.53.5 ± 0.53.9 ± 0.4kcat (s-1)20 ± 111.3 ± 0.6KmF16P2 (μm)1.2 ± 0.050.94 ± 0.04A0.5 (mm)0.84 ± 0.040.14 ± 0.03Hill coefficient Mg2+1.7 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.2I0.5 (μm)1.23 ± 0.0462 ± 1Hill coefficient AMP2.2 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.1Ka (mm2)0.78 ± 0.20.087 ± 0.005KiAMP (μm2)0.6 ± 0.13000 ± 200Kb (μm)2.4 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.1KiF26P2 (μm)0.23 ± 0.040.38 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab The Hill coefficient for Mg2+ was determined at a saturating concentration of F16P2 (20 μm) and concentrations of free Mg2+ ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mm. Data were fit to Equation 1, v/Vm=1/[1+(A0.5/A)n](Eq. 1) where v is the velocity, Vm is the maximum velocity at saturating concentrations of F16P2 and Mg2+, A is the concentration of Mg2+, n is the Hill coefficient for Mg2+, and A0.5 is the concentration of Mg2+ that gives v/Vm of 50%.The Hill coefficient for AMP was determined at saturating F16P2 (20 μm), Mg2+ concentrations of 0.8 and 0.15 mm for wild-type and Leu54 FBPases, and AMP concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 μm. Data were fit to Equation 2, v/V0=1/[1+(I/I0.5)n](Eq. 2) where v is the velocity, V0 is the velocity at an AMP concentration of zero, I is the concentration of AMP, n is the Hill coefficient for AMP, and I0.5 is the concentration of AMP that gives v/V0 of 50%.The kinetic mechanism of AMP inhibition with respect to Mg2+ was determined from assays that employed saturating (20 μm) F16P2, five different Mg2+ concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 mm for wild-type enzyme or 0.2 to 0.6 mm for Leu54 FBPase, and five different AMP concentrations ranging from 0 to 150 μm. A model for linear competitive inhibition (Equation 3) provided the best result (goodness-of-fit of <4%), Vm/v=1+Ka/A2+(Ka/KiAMP)(I/A)2(Eq. 3) where v is the velocity, Vm is the velocity at an inhibitor concentration of zero saturating concentrations of F16P2 and Mg2+, A is the concentration of Mg2+, I is the concentration of AMP, Ka is the Michaelis constant for Mg2+, and KiAMP is the dissociation constant for AMP from the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Equation 3 constrains the Hill coefficients for Mg2+ and AMP to 2, consistent with independent determinations of these quantities.The kinetic mechanism of F26P2 inhibition with respect to F16P2 was determined from assays that employed saturating Mg2+ (5 mm for wild-type enzyme and 2 mm for Leu54 FBPase), five different concentrations (1–6 μm) of F16P2, and five different concentrations (0–1.0 μm) of F26P2. A model for linear competitive inhibition provided the best fit to the data (goodness-of-fit of <3%), Vm/v=1+Kb/B+(Kb/KiF26P2)(I/B)(Eq. 4) where Vm is the velocity at an inhibitor concentration of zero and saturating concentrations of F16P2 and Mg2+, B is the concentration of F16P2, I is the concentration of F26P2, Kb is the Michaelis constant for F16P2, and KiF26P2 is the dissociation constant for F26P2 from the inhibitor-enzyme complex.Product Complex of Leu54 FBPase (Protein Data Bank code 1YXI)—Crystals belong to the space group I222 (a = 52.8, b = 82.8, and c = 165.5 Å) and are isomorphous to those of wild-type FBPase in its R-state, containing one subunit of the tetramer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (10Choe J-Y.

Superposition of the Leu54 subunit onto the wild-type subunit reveals no deviation in the relative positions of Cα atoms in excess of 0.43 Å. Superposition of the Leu54 tetramer onto canonical wild-type R- and T-states clearly indicates an R-state complex. We refer the reader to other descriptions of R-state product complexes (10Choe J-Y.

The model begins at residue 10 and continues to the last residue of the sequence. Thermal parameters vary from 10 to 75 Å2. The model has stereochemistry comparable to that of structures of equivalent resolution (31Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).The subunit of the AMP-product complex of Leu54 FBPase has one molecule each of Fru-6-P and Pi with three atoms of Mg2+ at the active site. In addition, strong electron density is present in the allosteric inhibitor pocket, which represents a bound molecule of AMP (Fig. 1). The dynamic loop (residues 52–72) adopts the engaged conformation. Superposition of the Leu54 tetramer onto canonical wild-type R- and T-states reveals a change in quaternary state (Table III). Subunit pair C1-C2 has rotated 3° relative to C3-C4 (Fig. 2). The subunit rotation lies between that of the canonical R-state (0° rotation) and T-state (15° rotation) and differs from the intermediate quaternary state (9° rotation) stabilized by the allosteric inhibitor OC252 (Fig. 2). Hereafter, we will use the label IR to represent the R-like state of the AMP-product complex of Leu54 FBPase and IT to represent the T-like state of the OC252 complex.Table IIIRoot mean square deviations between conformational states of FBPase Protein"

This enzyme was mainly studied in the liver, but while detected in the small intestine little is known about the regulation of its intestinal expression. This study describes the mechanisms of the glucose-dependent regulation of G6Pase expression in intestinal cells. Results obtained in vivo and in Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes showed that glucose increases the G6Pase mRNA level. In Caco-2/TC7 cells, glucose stabilized G6Pase mRNA and activated the transcription of the gene, meaning that glucose-dependent G6Pase expression involved both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Reporter-gene studies showed that, although the –299/+57 region of the human G6Pase promoter was sufficient to trigger the glucose response in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, the –1157/–1133 fragment was required for maximal activation of glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription in Caco-2/TC7 cells. This fragment binds the aryl receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and upstream stimulatory factor transcription factors. The DNA binding activity of these transcription factors was increased in nuclear extracts of differentiated cells from the intestinal villus of mice fed sugar-rich diets as compared with mice fed a no-sugar diet. A direct implication of ARNT in the activation of G6Pase gene transcription by glucose has been observed in Caco-2/TC7 cells using RNA interference experiments.

These results support a physiological role for G6Pase in the control of nutrient absorption in the small intestine. The intestinal absorption of glucose, allowing its transfer from the lumen to the blood, occurs through enterocytes. The uptake of glucose is mediated at the apical membrane of the absorptive cells by the sodium/glucose co-transporter SGLT1 and by the rapid and transient sugar-dependent recruitment of the glucose transporter GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane (1Kellett G.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Gouyon F. Caillaud L. Carriere V. Klein C. Dalet V. Citadelle D. Kellett G.L. Thorens B. Leturque A. Brot-Laroche E. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Glucose is then released into the blood by GLUT2 in the basolateral membrane. Glucose is also metabolized by enterocytes via several metabolic pathways such as glycogen and triglyceride synthesis. Moreover, it has been shown recently that, in fasted or diabetic animals, the small intestine is able to release endogenous glucose in the blood, thus significantly contributing to the total endogenous production of glucose (3Croset M. Rajas F. Zitoun C. Hurot J.M. Montano S. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The last step of gluconeogenesis, which is the hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate into glucose and inorganic phosphate, is catalyzed by the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) 1The abbreviations used are: G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; ARNT, aryl receptor nuclear translocator; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; ChREBP, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; HNF4α, hepatic nuclear factor 4α.

However, most of the mechanisms, which modulate G6Pase expression, still need to be elucidated. G6Pase is also expressed in human and rat small intestine (4Van Schaftingen E. Gerin I. Biochem.

Maestracci D. Menard D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 21: 426-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Korieh A. Crouzoulon G. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. Biophys. 1991; 99: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of G6Pase expression by nutrients in the intestine remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether simple carbohydrates, such as glucose, regulate the expression of G6Pase in enterocytes and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. Caco-2/TC7 Cell Culture—Caco-2/TC7 cells (20Chantret I. Rodolosse A. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brot-Laroche E. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 213-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/cm2 on 6-well semipermeable filters (3 μm high pore density, BD Biosciences, Meylan, France). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 20% heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal bovine serum (AbCys, France). From the confluence, only the basal compartment contained 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed 48 h after seeding and daily thereafter. To ensure the same growth rate, cells were cultured with the same glucose concentration (i.e. no glucose or 25 mm glucose in both compartments) until confluence. From the confluence (i.e. before differentiation), and for 6 days (i.e. during the process of differentiation), cells were switched to the appropriate glucose concentration or to mannitol containing medium. The final glucose concentration was obtained by addition of 2.5 m glucose to glucose-free DMEM, and supplied in the upper and/or lower compartments, as required. Fetal bovine serum (20%) provided 1 mm glucose in the lower compartment. Plasmids—The luciferase reporter-gene constructs containing the –3970/+57, –1227/+57, and –299/+57 regions of the human G6Pase promoter (phG6Pase-luc) were previously described (21Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The –1227Δsite4/+57 G6Pase promoter fragment was generated from the –1227/+57phG6Pase-luc plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCCCATCTCTACAAAAGATAGAAAAATTAGCAATGTGGTCCCAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAGCTGGGACCACATTGCTAATTTTTCTATCTTTTGTAGAGATGGGG-3′. The –1227Δsite4/+57 G6Pase fragment was then sequenced and subcloned into the –1227/+57phG6Pase-luc plasmid instead of the wild-type –1227/+57 fragment. RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNAs (small interfering RNA (siRNA)) were designed and synthesized by Dharmacon Research (LaFayette, CO) according to the “custom smart pool” option. Caco-2/TC7 cells, stably transfected with the –1227/+57phG6Pase-luc construct, were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates. One day before the confluence, cells were transfected with 500 pmol of aryl receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) medium. After transfection, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented or not with 25 mm glucose. Post-confluent cells were harvested 72 h after the transfection for luciferase assays and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Homogenates (100 μg) from Caco-2/TC7 cells transfected with the –1227/+57phG6Pase-luc construct and cultured in the presence of ARNT siRNA, as described under “RNA Interference,” were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated in 5% low fat milk powder (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline-T (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). They were then probed with a rabbit antibody against human ARNT (dilution: 1/4000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Tebu-bio s.a., Le Perray en Yvelines, France) followed by an anti-goat peroxidase-conjugated antibody (dilution: 1/10000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. A mouse antibody against human E-cadherin (dilution: 1/2500, clone 36, BD Biosciences) was used as loading control. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analyses were performed using Image J software. Transfection Experiments and Luciferase Assay—For stable transfection experiments, Caco-2/TC7 cells were seeded at 4 × 103 cells/cm2 in Petri dishes (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY). The cells were transfected 48 h after seeding using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with phG6Pase-luc constructs and pPUR vector (Clontech), which contains the puromycin-resistance gene. Stable transfectants were selected with 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Total puromycin-resistant cellular populations were analyzed. After selection, all experiments were performed in six-well semi-permeable filters, using the appropriate culture medium without puromycin. For transient transfection, Caco-2/TC7 cells were seeded at 8.4 × 104 cells/cm2 on 6-well semipermeable filters and cultured in DMEM (25 mm glucose). The cells were transfected 48 h after seeding with 2 μg of phG6Pase-luc constructs and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid, using Lipofectamine. The cells were then cultured in low glucose until confluence. After confluence, the cells were maintained for 72 h in low glucose (0 mm apical/1 mm basal) or switched to high glucose (25 mm apical/25 mm basal) medium. For stable transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.7 × 104 cells/cm2 in Petri dishes (Corning Glassworks) and cultured in DMEM (5 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected 24 h after seeding using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with phG6Pase-luc constructs and pPUR vector. Stable transfectants were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Total puromycin-resistant cellular populations were analyzed. After selection, all experiments were performed using the appropriate culture medium without puromycin. For glucose experiments, stably transfected HepG2 cells seeded at 3.75 × 104 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) were cultured for 48 h in low glucose (1 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) medium in the presence of 1% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded at 4.2 × 104 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture plates and cultured in DMEM (5 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected 24 h after seeding by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 4 μg of the phG6Pase-luc constructs and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid. After transfection, HepG2 cells were cultured for 48 h in low glucose (1 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) medium in the presence of 1% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase activities were assayed as previously described (22Rodolosse A. Carrière V. Rousset M. Lacasa M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and were equalized for the transient transfection efficiencies by β-galactosidase assays using standard protocol. Animals—C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson, France) were fed for 3 days with standard carbohydrate diet (23% proteins, 51% carbohydrates, 3% lipids) obtained from Dietex (Saint-Gratien, France), a no-sugar diet (80% casein, 0.3% methionine, 2.7% cellulose), or a glucose-rich diet (19% casein, 0.3% methionine, 65% dextrose) as previously described (2Gouyon F. Caillaud L. Carriere V. Klein C. Dalet V. Citadelle D. Kellett G.L. Thorens B. Leturque A. Brot-Laroche E. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The two last diets (obtained from UAR) contained 1% vitamin, 7% mineral salt, and 5% lipids. All the diets used were isocaloric. Mice were sacrificed at 9 a.m. on the 4th day and total RNA was prepared from the jejunum as described under “Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Analysis.” Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNAplus reagent (qBiogene Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcription experiments were performed as previously described (23Carrière V. Rodolosse A. Lacasa M. Cambier D. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1101-G1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 2 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 40 μl. Messenger RNA was quantified using the Light-Cycler System according to the manufacturer's procedures (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR were performed with a 1:400 final dilution of the reverse transcription product in the SYBR Green I master mixture with specific primers (0.4 μm final of each primer) for the cDNA of interest. PCR conditions were one step of denaturation (8 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles (each cycle consisted of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C). The following specific primers used were: 5′-TCATCTTGGTGTCCGTGATCG-3′ and 5′-TTTATCAGGGGCACGGAAGTG-3′ for human G6Pase, 5′-TTACCAAGACTCCCAGGACTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCTGTTGCTGTAGTAGTCG-3′ for mouse G6Pase, 5′-AGAACCATATGAAGGCGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CACAAACGACAGGCTTGC-3′ for mouse L-pyruvate kinase. As control for the RNA extraction and reverse transcription experiments, the following primers for ribosomal protein L19 were used in the same PCR conditions: 5′-TGCGTGCTTCCTTGGTCTTAGA-3′ and 5′-AAGATCGATCGCCACATGTATCA-3′. The mRNA level of L19 was unaffected by the presence or absence of sugars in the culture medium. Results were expressed as the ratio between the levels of G6Pase or L-pyruvate kinase mRNA and L19 mRNA. The same results were obtained if specific primers for the 18 S ribosomal RNA (using a 1:2000 dilution of reverse transcriptase) were used, instead of L19 primers, as internal control. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by the guanidium isothiocyanate method as previously described (23Carrière V. Rodolosse A. Lacasa M. Cambier D. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1101-G1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After glyoxal denaturation, 20 μg were electrophoresed on 1% agarose and transferred onto nylon membranes (Appligene, France) with 20× SSC. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described previously (23Carrière V. Rodolosse A. Lacasa M. Cambier D. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1101-G1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G6Pase mRNA was detected with the cDNA human G6Pase prepared from phG6Pase plasmid obtained from G. Mithieux (12Rajas F. Bruni N. Montano S. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for human phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA isolated from Caco-2/TC7 cells, as previously described (23Carrière V. Rodolosse A. Lacasa M. Cambier D. Zweibaum A. Rousset M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G1101-G1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normalization of total RNA loading was performed using a 18 S RNA probe. mRNA Stability Studies—To analyze the stability of G6Pase mRNA, Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured on semipermeable filters in the presence of high glucose concentrations (25 mm glucose) in both upper and lower compartments, from seeding until confluence. From the confluence, the cells were cultured in the presence of low glucose medium (0 mm apical/1 mm basal) or high glucose medium (25 mm apical/5 mm basal) for 6 days. 0.2 mm 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (Invitrogen) was then added to the apical culture medium and maintained during the entire experiment (7 h). Total RNA was extracted and the mRNA level of G6Pase was determined as described under “Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR Analysis.” Nuclear Extracts and EMSA—Mouse intestinal villi were prepared as previously described (24Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Citadelle D. Chatelet F.P. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. Le Beyec J. Ribeiro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34540-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the small intestine was everted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and cut into 5-mm fragments. Fragments were incubated for 2 h in 5 ml/intestine of Matrisperse (BD Pharmingen) at 4 °C, without shaking. The fragments were then shaken gently and the isolated villous epithelial cells were filtered and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts from villous intestinal cells were then prepared as previously described (25Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin) and protein phosphatases inhibitors (2 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). EMSA was performed as previously described (22Rodolosse A. Carrière V. Rousset M. Lacasa M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using 5 μgof nuclear extracts. The oligonucleotides used in the gel shift assay were: 5′-GGGATTACAGGTGTGAGCCA-3 and 5′-GTGGCTCACACCTGTAAT-3′ for site 1, 5′-GGTACACCATCACACACACCAAAACAATTT-3′ and 5′-GGAAATTGTTTTGGTGTGTGTGATGGTGTA-3′ for site 2, 5′-TCCTGGGCTCAAGCAATCCTCCTGCCTCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGCTGAGGCAGGAGGATTGCTTGAGC-3′ for site 3, and 5′-GCCAGGCATGGTGGCGTGTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGGCACAGGCACACGCCACCATG-3′ for site 4. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with the corresponding antibodies at 20 °C during 20 min before addition of the radioactive probe. Monoclonal antibody against ARNT (MAb2B10) was kindly provided by Dr. Perdew (26Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar), polyclonal antibody against USF2a was kindly provided by Dr. Raymondjean (27Viollet B. Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M.

(Tebu-bio s.a., Le Perray en Yvelines, France). Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Glucose Increases the Expression of G6Pase in Intestinal Cells—The effect of glucose on the expression of G6Pase in intestinal cells was first analyzed in vivo, using the real-time PCR method, with C57Bl/6J mice fed no-sugar or a glucose-rich diet for 3 days (Fig. 1A). To maintain the same caloric supply to animals, sugar was replaced by casein in the no-sugar diet. The glucose-rich diet provoked a 5-fold increase of the mRNA level of G6Pase in intestinal cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). A 2.5-fold increase of the L-pyruvate kinase mRNA level was observed in the same condition (Fig. 1A, right panel). We further analyzed the glucose-dependent expression of human G6Pase in Caco-2/TC7 cells, which were cultured on semipermeable filters to reproduce the physiological conditions of glucose supply at the basal and apical poles of intestinal cells. Serum was supplied in the lower compartment and different concentrations of glucose were applied in the basal and/or apical compartments. The mRNA level of G6Pase was first analyzed by Northern blot and compared with that of PEPCK (another gluconeogenic enzyme) (Fig. 1B). We observed a glucose-dependent increase of the G6Pase mRNA level. In the same conditions a slight glucose-dependent increase of the PEPCK mRNA level was also observed. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the glucose-dependent increase of G6Pase mRNA was similar whether glucose was supplied at the apical or at the basal pole of the cells, with a 5- to 6-fold increase in the presence of 25 mm glucose (Fig. 1C). In the same culture conditions, incubation of Caco-2/TC7 cells with 25 mm mannitol, used as an osmotic control, had no effect on G6Pase mRNA level as compared with the low glucose condition (0 mm apical/1 mm basal). As shown in the time course analysis (Fig. 1D), the glucose-dependent increase of the G6Pase mRNA level was detectable as soon as 4 h after incubation in a high glucose medium, and reached a plateau after 24 h incubation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the enterocyte expression of G6Pase depends on glucose supply, which may have an impact on transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional steps. Glucose Stabilizes G6Pase mRNA in Caco-2/TC7 Cells—To evaluate a post-transcriptional effect of glucose on G6Pase expression, Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured in low (0 mm apical/1 mm basal) or high glucose (25 mm apical/5 mm basal) in the presence of the transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole for the last 7 h of culture. As shown in Fig. 2, the half-life of human G6Pase mRNA was higher in high glucose (t½ = 3 h) than in low glucose (t½ = 1 h), demonstrating that glucose contributes to the stabilization of human G6Pase mRNA in the enterocytic Caco-2/TC7 cells. In the same time glucose did not modify the half-life of human intestinal apolipoprotein A-IV mRNA used here as a control (data not shown). Glucose Activates the Transcription of the Human G6Pase Gene via Different Glucose-responsive Regions in Caco-2/TC7 and HepG2 Cells—The effect of glucose on human G6Pase gene transcription was analyzed by transfection of different fragments of the –3970/+57 region of the human G6Pase promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. Stably (black bars) or transient (hatched bars) transfected Caco-2/TC7 cells were cultured on semipermeable filters in low (0 mm apical/1 mm basal) or high glucose (25 mm apical/25 mm basal) conditions (Fig. 3A). A 1.5–2-fold increase in luciferase activity was measured in response to high glucose in Caco-2/TC7 cells transfected with the –3970/+57 and –1227/+57 fragments of the human G6Pase promoter. This stimulation by glucose was not observed with the –299/+57 region of the human G6Pase promoter in both transient and stably transfected cells. Similar results were obtained when stably transfected cells were subjected to long-term (6 days, Fig. 3A) or short-term treatment (48 h, not shown) with glucose-containing medium. A glucose-dependent transcription of G6Pase was reported using run-on experiments in hepatocytes (7Massillon D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4055-4062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed the effect of glucose on the activity of the same promoter fragments of the human G6Pase gene in HepG2 cells. In stably or transiently transfected HepG2 cells, all three fragments of human G6Pase promoter (including the –299/+57 fragment) displayed glucose dependence (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that distinct molecular mechanisms account for the hepatic and intestinal response to glucose and that an enterocyte-specific glucose-responsive region is located between nucleotide –1227 and –299 on the human G6Pase promoter. Identification of Putative DNA-binding Sites Involved in the Intestine-specific Glucose-dependent Transcription of G6Pase— To determine which intestine-specific sequences are involved in the glucose-dependent transcription of G6Pase, we made a computer-assisted research for putative transcription factor DNA-binding sites within the –1227 to –299 glucose-responsive region of the human G6Pase promoter. Four putative DNA-binding sites were potentially related to glucose-dependent gene transcription (Table I). Three of these DNA-binding sites were for the ARNT protein (numbered 2, 3, and 4), a basic helix loop helix/PAS transcription factor known to be involved in several physiological functions among which is the regulation of the glucose metabolism (28Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These three potential ARNT DNA-binding sites are homologous to the consensus DNA-binding sequence of the ARNT/AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) heterodimer. Such DNA-binding sites for the ARNT protein were not found within the –299/+57 region. DNA-binding sites 3 and 4 also comprise putative DNA binding sequences for the USF (site 3 and 4), SP1 (sites 3 and 4), and CREB (site 4) transcription factors. The last DNA-binding site (site 1, between nucleotide –466 and –445) contains an E-box sequence. Such E-box sequences are known to bind basic helix loop helix transcription factors.Table IPutative DNA-binding sites involved in the glucose-dependent transcription of the human G6Pase geneDNA-binding siteNucleotide positionSequenceTranscription factors (position)Site 1-466/-4555′-GGGATTACAGGTGTGAGCCACC-3′USF (-459/-454)Sit"
https://openalex.org/W2059769321,"Although SB202190 and SB203580 are described as specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, several reports have indicated that other enzymes are also sensitive to SB203580. Using a pharmacological approach, we report for the first time that compounds SB202190 and SB203580 were able to directly and selectively interact with a G-protein-coupled receptor, namely the cholecystokinin receptor subtype CCK1, but not with the CCK2 receptor. We demonstrated that these compounds were non-competitive antagonists of the CCK1 receptor at concentrations typically used to inhibit protein kinases. By chimeric construction of the CCK2 receptor, we determined the involvement of two CCK1 receptor intracellular loops in the binding of SB202190 and SB203580. We also showed that two CCK antagonists, L364,718 and L365,260, were able to regulate p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity. Using a reporter gene strategy and immunoblotting experiments, we demonstrated that both CCK antagonists inhibited selectively the enzymatic activity of p38 MAP kinase. Kinase assays suggested that this inhibition resulted from a direct interaction with both CCK antagonists. Molecular modeling simulations suggested that this interaction occurs in the ATP binding pocket of p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that SB202190 and SB203580 bind to the CCK1 receptor and, as such, these compounds should be used with caution in models that express this receptor. We also found that L364,718 and L365,260, two CCK receptor antagonists, directly interacted with p38 MAP kinase and inhibited its activity. These findings suggest that the CCK1 receptor shares structural analogies with the p38 MAP kinase ATP binding site. They open the way to potential design of either a new family of MAP kinase inhibitors from CCK1 receptor ligand structures or new CCK1 receptor ligands based on p38 MAP kinase inhibitor structures.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; CCK8s, sulfated octapeptide of cholecystokinin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ATF2, activating transcription factor 2; BH, Bolton-Hunter; NBMPR, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thiol]-9-β-d-ribofuranosyl purine; CDTA, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAPKAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase. is a peptide involved in a wide range of biological functions. It acts as a hormone in the gastrointestinal tract as well as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. This hormone was first isolated as a 33-amino acid peptide; the major fully active form is the C-terminal sulfated octapeptide termed CCK8s (1Jensen R.T. Lemp G.F. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5549-5554Google Scholar). To induce its biological functions, CCK8s binds to two specific receptors, the CCK1 and CCK2 receptors. They have been classified according to their pharmacological profile for endogenous CCK and gastrin peptide agonists (2Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 32: G628-G646Google Scholar). The CCK1 receptor is highly selective for sulfated analogues of CCK and for the nonpeptide antagonist L364,718 (2Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 32: G628-G646Google Scholar, 3Chang R.S. Lotti V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4923-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), whereas the CCK2 receptor also has high affinity for sulfated or non-sulfated peptide analogues of CCK and gastrin and for the nonpeptide antagonist L365,260 (2Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 32: G628-G646Google Scholar, 4Lotti V.J. Chang R.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 162: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The CCK1 receptor is mainly localized in the gastrointestinal tract where it regulates pancreatic enzyme secretions, gallbladder contraction, gastric emptying, and satiety (5Noble F. Wank S.A. Crawley J.N. Bradwejn J. Seroogy K.B. Hamon M. Roques B.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 745-781PubMed Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, CCK1 receptor is coupled to a Gq/11 protein that is activated upon binding of CCK8s and then induces the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C, producing both diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) (6Piiper A. Stryjek-Kalinska D. Klengel R. Zeuzm S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G135-G140PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent IP3-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production both activate protein kinase C-mediated digestive enzyme secretions (7Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go W. Pancreas, Biology, Pathobiology, and Disease. Raven Press, New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that CCK8s activates several members of the MAPK signaling cascades like ERK1/2 (8Duan R.D. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G401-G408PubMed Google Scholar), stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (9Dabrowski A. Grady T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar). ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinases belong to the MAPK family. They mediate cellular growth and differentiation following activation by environmental stress (12Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). p38 MAP kinase is involved in inflammatory responses through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α (13Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Drugs called cytokine synthesis anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) have been used to understand the physiological roles of p38 MAP kinase. These pyridinyl imidazole-derived compounds are able to bind p38 MAP kinase (13Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). The development of p38 MAP kinase inhibitors is regarded as the main therapeutic strategy for stopping the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory and immunoresponsive diseases (14English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15Cohen P. Nature Rev.

Among such compounds, SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole) and SB202190 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole) were described as potent and selective inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, having no effect on ERKs and JNKs (16Cuenda A.

J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that several other enzymes and a tyrosine kinase receptor were sensitive to SB203580, including cyclo-oxygenase 2 (18Börsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the protein kinase Raf (19Hall-Jackson C.A. Goedert M. Hedge P. Cohen P.

Cohen P. Goedert M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 321-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More recently, SB compounds were described as preventing nucleoside transport by interacting with the NBMPR-sensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1 (22Huang M. Wang Y. Collins M. Gu J.J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This emphasizes the need to ensure the specificity of SB203580 when this compound is used in studies involving the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. While studying the involvement of the CCK1 receptor in the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, we found that SB203580 and SB202190 (Fig. 1) were able to interact with this G-protein-coupled receptor. In addition, we showed that the two nonpeptide CCK antagonists, L364,718 and L365,260, respectively selective for the CCK1 and the CCK2 receptors (Fig. 1) (3Chang R.S. Lotti V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CCK8s was synthesized in our laboratory and radiolabeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent (125I-BH) as previously described (24Sankaran H. Deveney C.W. Goldfine I.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9349-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of CCK2 Chimeric Receptors—Chimeric CCK2 receptors were constructed by the two-step procedure (25Pont-Kingdon G. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 1010-1011PubMed Google Scholar) using purified oligonucleotides synthesized by Invitrogen. Construction of plasmids encoding the two mutants of the human CCK2 receptor was performed according to classical methods (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Irwin N. Ford N. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing performed at Genome Express. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 0.25 mm l-glutamine, and streptomycin-penicillin (250 μg/ml-250 units/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The Jurkat T cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and streptomycin-penicillin (250 μg/ml-250 units/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfection of COS7 cells was performed by electroporation. Ten million cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA 1X. Cells were rinsed once with electroporation buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA) and resuspended with electroporation buffer supplemented with 5 μm glutathione, 2 μm ATP in a final volume of 500 μl. Cells to be used either for binding experiments, plasma membrane preparation, or analysis of inositol phosphate production were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid encoding the rat CCK1 receptor (27Pootsi R. di Malta L. Gagne D. Bernad N. Galleyrand J.C. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Fourmy D. Martinez J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or 10 μg of the mutant receptor. Cells to be used for the luciferase assay were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding chimeric transcription factors Gal4-ATF2 (pFA2-ATF2), Gal4-Elk1 (pFA2-Elk1), or Gal4-c-Jun (pFA2-c-Jun) and 5 μg of the reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc) in addition to 5 μg of plasmid encoding MKK3b-E (pcDNA3-MKK3b-E), a gift from Dr. R.

Electroporations were performed at 250 V, 1500 μF using an Easyject Optima electroporator (Equibio). Upon transfection, cells were diluted by addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium devoid of phenol red, supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine, and streptomycin-penicillin. 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates were seeded for receptor binding assays and 1 × 105 cells/well for inositol phosphate assays. For plasma membrane preparation and immunoblotting experiments, electroporated cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish. For luciferase activity measurements, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates. Binding Assays—For 125I-BH-CCK8s binding experiments on COS7 cells expressing the rat CCK1 receptor or one of the mutant receptors, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 0.1% BSA ∼2 days following transfection. They were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA with 10 pm 125I-BH-CCK8s in the presence or absence of either CCK8s, SB202190, or SB203580 at various concentrations. Cells were washed once with PBS (pH 7.4), 2% BSA and lysed by addition of 0.1 N NaOH. Samples were collected in tubes and their radioactivity content determined in a γ counter. For binding experiments on plasma membranes of COS7 cells transiently transfected with the rat CCK1 receptor, 2 days after transfection plasma membranes were prepared as previously described (28Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (8 μg) were incubated for 90 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7), 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with 0.05% BSA, in the presence of 10 pm 125I-BH-CCK8s and with or without competitive ligands. To stop the reaction, 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer were added. To pellet the bound fraction, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with binding buffer, and their radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. The binding experiments with Jurkat T cells were performed using 4 × 106 cells/ml incubated in PBS containing 10 pm 125I-BH-CCK8s and either unlabeled peptide, SB202190, or SB203580 at increasing concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. Incubations were stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 2% BSA. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g, 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and pellets measured for their radioactivity content in a γ counter. For [3H]-SB202190 binding experiments, COS7 cells expressing the rat CCK1 receptor were washed once with PBS, 0.1% BSA. They were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 nm [3H]-SB202190 and increasing concentrations of either SB202190, SB203580, or CCK8s in a final volume of 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% BSA. Following the incubation, cells were washed once with 1 ml of PBS, 2% BSA to remove unbound ligand and then lysed with 0.1 N NaOH. The samples were neutralized by addition of 0.1 N HCl. 10 ml of Complete Phase combining system were added to each vial for determination of the radioactivity content using a liquid scintillation β counter. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and mean values were used for calculations. Inositol Phosphate Assay in COS7 Cells Transiently Transfected with the Rat CCK1 Receptor—Inositol phosphate assays were determined according to Qian et al. (29Qian J.M. Rowley W.H. Jensen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G718-G727PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The day before the experiment, transfected cells were incubated overnight with 2 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol in Medium 199 at 37 °C. Cells were washed with Medium 199 (1 ml/well) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Medium 199 supplemented with 30 mm LiCl. Cells were washed with inositol phosphate buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, supplemented with 11.1 mm d-glucose and 0.5% BSA. Incubations were performed in the absence or presence of ligands for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The incubation medium was removed, and cells were lysed with 12 N HCl containing ethanol 0.3% (v/v). Supernatants were collected and applied to a column containing Dowex AG1-X8 anion-exchange resin in distilled water (1:4, w/w, 1.6 ml). Columns were successively washed with distilled water and 40 mm ammonium formate. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 1 m ammonium formate. The radioactivity of each eluate was determined in a liquid scintillation β counter upon addition of Complete Phase combining system in each vial. Luciferase Activity Assay—Approximately 36 h after transfection, COS7 cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of each compound to be tested. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm CDTA, 10 mm DTT, 50% glycerol, and 5% Triton X-100. Lysates were transferred in a 96-well plate, and luciferase activity was measured using a Wallac 1450 Microbeta Jet upon injection of luciferase detection buffer (pH 7.4) containing 15 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1.05 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.53 mm ATP, 0.27 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm luciferin. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, Kinase and Pulldown Assays—For immunoblotting experiments, after washing twice with ice-cold PBS COS7 cells transiently transfected either with the rat CCK1 receptor or with MKK3b-E and untransfected cells treated by anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min were scraped in lysis buffer containing 12.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 195 mm DTT, 0.1 m SDS, and 2.2 m glycerol. Lysed cells and membranes were then boiled for 10 min. Each sample contained an equal amount of protein according to the Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation and the pulldown assay, COS7 cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for JNK and p38 MAP kinase assays or for 5 min in the presence of epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C for ERK assays. Following incubation, cells containing active p38 MAP kinase, JNK, or ERK were lysed with non-denaturing lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin completed with 1 mm AEBSF. Proteins (200 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 15 μl of either phospho-p38 MAP kinase, phospho-ERK monoclonal antibodies immobilized on beads for the kinase assays, or GST-c-Jun immobilized on beads for the pulldown assay. In vitro kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 μg of GST-ATF2 or GST-Elk1, 200 μm ATP in a kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped by addition of 3× SDS sample buffer containing 187.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm DTT, and 0.03% bromphenol blue. Samples for Western immunoblotting were subjected to a 10% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose ECL membranes by electrophoresis. Membranes were blocked and then incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C. Anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase, anti-MAPKAPK-2, and anti-phospho-MAP-KAPK-2 antibodies were used for Western immunoblotting, and anti-phospho-ATF2, anti-phospho-Elk1, and anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies were used for kinase and pulldown assays (all were diluted at 1/1000). Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bound antibody was detected by reaction with the LumiGLO® chemiluminescent reagent and exposed to Biomax ML scientific imaging film. Dynamic Docking Studies in the ATP Binding Site of p38 MAP Kinase—The molecular model of the ATP binding site of p38 MAP kinase was constructed on the basis of the co-crystallized structure of p38 MAP kinase with the SB203580 compound (30Wang Z. Canagarajah B.J. Boehm J.C. Kassisa S. Cobb M.H. Young P.R. Abdel-Meguid S. Adams J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1117-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The docking of L364,718 and L365,260 compounds was improved by intensive annealing calculations. The resulting structure obtained for each nonpeptide CCK analogue complexed with the ATP binding site of p38 MAP kinase was further refined using molecular dynamics and energy minimization. All the annealing refinement and docking calculations were performed using Biosym software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Data Analysis—Dose response curves and binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism nonlinear regression software programs (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Significance was determined using the Student's unpaired t test with p < 0.05. Pharmacological Studies of the Interaction of SB202190 and SB203580 with the Rat CCK1 Receptor—We investigated the effect of the two p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580) on the binding of 125I-BH-CCK8s to rat CCK1 transiently transfected in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, whereas the natural ligand CCK8s bound with a Ki value of 14 ± 3.5 nm, SB202190 and SB203580 were able to inhibit the specific binding of 125I-BH-CCK8s with Ki values of 4.2 ± 0.2 and 23 ± 3.8 μm, respectively (p < 0.02, n = 9). Interestingly, these Ki values are in the range of inhibitor concentrations classically used to block the p38 MAP kinase activity. We also performed binding experiments using [3H]-SB202190 on COS7 cells expressing the CCK1 receptor to determine the binding site of both p38 MAP kinase inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 2B, SB202190 and SB203580 displaced the binding of [3H]-SB202190 with Ki values of 2.3 ± 0.7 and 8.5 ± 1.7 μm, respectively, whereas CCK8s was without effect, suggesting distinct binding sites on the CCK1 receptor. To determine the competitive nature of the interaction between SB202190 or SB203580 and the CCK1 receptor, binding experiments using 125I-BH-CCK8s in competition with CCK8s were undertaken in the absence or in the presence of 1 or 10 μm SB202190 or SB203580 (Fig. 3A). The specific binding of CCK8s decreased by 2.4-fold in the presence of SB202190 1 μm and 7.2-fold in the presence of SB202190 10 μm. Moreover, the affinity of CCK8s was not affected by the presence of SB202190, because close Ki values were measured under each situation: 8.9 ± 0.9 nm in the absence of SB202190, 28 ± 4 and 12 ± 2 nm in the presence of SB202190, 1 μm and 10 μm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The same behavior was observed with SB203580 (data not shown). These data suggested that both p38 MAP kinase inhibitors were non-competitive ligands for the CCK binding site. To determine whether these observations were or were not related to the inhibitory property of SB202190 and SB203580 on p38 MAP kinase, we first controlled for the absence of p38 MAP kinase on COS7 cell plasma membranes in comparison with whole cells (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoblotting experiments with a p38 MAP kinase antibody confirmed the absence of p38 MAP kinase in membrane fractions compared with whole cells. We performed additional binding experiments using plasma membranes and observed that both compounds maintained their ability to displace 125I-BH-CCK8s with Ki values of 0.9 ± 0.3 μm for SB202190 and 14.7 ± 5 μm for SB203580 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that they interact with the CCK1 receptor independently of the presence of p38 MAP kinase. Additionally, we performed the same binding experiments on rat pancreatic acini, which endogenously express CCK1 receptor. We measured affinity values for the two p38 MAP kinase inhibitors identical to those previously found (data not shown).Fig. 4Binding properties of SB202190 and SB203580 on plasma membranes not expressing p38 MAP kinase. A, comparative immunoblotting of either whole cell samples taken from COS7 cells expressing the rat CCK1 receptor or plasma membrane samples. Detection was performed using a specific antibody against the unphosphorylated form of p38 MAP kinase. B, binding experiments using plasma membranes prepared from COS7 cells transiently expressing the rat CCK1 receptor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membranes (8 μg proteins) were incubated with 10 pm 125I-BH-CCK8s and with various concentrations either of CCK8s (□), SB202190 (▵), or SB203580 (○). Data are expressed as the percentage of the maximal specific binding measured in the absence of unlabeled CCK8s.

Whereas CCK8s displaced the specific binding of 125I-BH-CCK8s with an expected affinity of 0.4 ± 0.05 nm, SB202190 and SB203580 were unable to compete with the radiolabeled ligand (Fig. 5), indicating a specificity for the CCK1 receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2081567951,"The search for new drugs against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is driven by the 1.5 million deaths it causes annually. Choline-binding proteins attach to the pneumococcal cell wall through domains that recognize choline moieties, and their involvement in pneumococcal virulence makes them potential targets for drug development. We have defined chemical criteria involved in the docking of small molecules from a three-dimensional structural library to the major pneumococcal autolysin (LytA) choline binding domain. These criteria were used to identify compounds that could interfere with the attachment of this protein to the cell wall, and several quinolones that fit this framework were found to inhibit the cell wall-degrading activity of LytA. Furthermore, these compounds produced similar effects on other enzymes with different catalytic activities but that contained a similar choline binding domain; that is, autolysin (LytC) and the phage lytic enzyme (Cpl-1). Finally, we resolved the crystal structure of the complex between the choline binding domain of LytA and ofloxacin at a resolution of 2.6 A. These data constitute an important launch pad from which effective drugs to combat pneumococcal infections can be developed."

Initiation of φ29 DNA replication, as well as that of most other linear genomes containing a terminal protein attached to its DNA ends, occurs via a so-called protein-primed mechanism (5Meijer W.J.J.

The φ29 genome encodes most, if not all, proteins required for phage DNA replication making φ29 an attractive system to study membrane-associated DNA replication.The early-expressed φ29 gene 16.7, which is conserved in all φ29-related phages studied so far, encodes a well characterized membrane protein, p16.7 (130 amino acids), that plays an important role in membrane-associated φ29 DNA replication (5Meijer W.J.J.

Analyses of a soluble variant lacking the N-terminal membrane anchor, p16.7A, revealed that it has affinity for both single-stranded (ss) and dsDNA, as well as for the φ29 terminal protein. Moreover, p16.7A, which is a dimer in solution, can form multimers, especially upon DNA binding, and multimerization is important for the mode by which it binds DNA (9Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A.

To obtain 15N and 13C/15N-labeled p16.7C proteins, cells were grown in U-15N and U-13C/15N Bio-express medium, respectively (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA).Protein Concentration—The protein (monomer) concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry, measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients ϵ280 of p16.7C, p16.7Cb, and pE72Q were 11360 m-1·cm-1 and that of pR98W was 16800 m-1 ·cm-1.Cross-linking Assays—Cross-linking reactions using 10 μm protein and disuccinimidyl suberate as cross-linking agent were performed as described before (9Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After cross-linking, proteins were precipitated upon the addition of 1 volume of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and, after resuspension, analyzed by PAGE in the presence of SDS. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel retarding assays were performed as described before (11Serna-Rico A. Muñoz-Espín D. Villar L. Salas M.

Labeled fragments were either used directly (dsDNA) or after heat-denaturation (ssDNA). Micrococcal nuclease digestions of the ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes were performed as described before (11Serna-Rico A. Muñoz-Espín D. Villar L. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J.

DNase I reactions contained, in 20 μl, besides the end-labeled dsDNA fragment and the indicated amount of protein, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2. Binding reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before 0.05 unit of DNase I (Promega) was added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C after which the reaction was stopped upon EDTA addition to a final concentration of 20 mm. For both the micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestions, a phenol/chloroform extraction step was performed before the DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 15 μg of linear polyacrylamide as carrier. Next, the resuspended DNA was analyzed in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Finally, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments: Sedimentation Equilibrium—The experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics, using an An50Ti rotor. Whole cell buoyant molecular masses (kDa) were determined by fitting a sedimentation equilibrium model for a single sedimenting solute to individual datasets with the program EQASSOC (17Minton A.P. Schuster T.M. Lave T.M. Modern Analytical Centrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 81-93Google Scholar) (supplied by Beckman).NMR Experiments—1H NMR spectra were recorded in 85:15 1H2O: 2H2O on Bruker Avance 800, Bruker AMX-600, and Varian Unity 500-MHz spectrometers. Protein concentrations for the structural analysis of the protein dimer were in the 400–800 μm range in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and 4 mm dithiothreitol at pH 5.0. Protein assignments were obtained using a set of 2D- and 3D- and homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments performed on the unlabeled, 15N-labeled, and 13C/15N double-labeled molecules. Thus, HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA spectra were employed for backbone assignment. The side-chain assignments were completed with 3D-HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy experiments. NOE distance restraints were obtained from 15N- or 13C-edited 3D-NOESY spectra. In addition, 2D-NOESY, 13C-selected/12C-filtered experiments were performed on a heterolabeled dimer to analyze the interprotein contacts. This protein sample was generated by mixing equimolar amounts of unlabeled and 13C/15N double-labeled protein to a global protein concentration of 100 μm in 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phosphate buffer and pH 5.0. The sample was incubated at 40 °C for 24 h and then concentrated for the NMR analysis.Upper limits for proton-proton distances were obtained from NOESY cross-peak intensities at three mixing times, 50, 75, and 150 ms. Cross-peaks were classified as strong, medium, and weak corresponding to upper limits of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 Å. The lower limit for proton/proton distances was set as the sum of the van der Waals radii of the protons. Structure calculations were performed using the program DYANA (18Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). A set of 2180 constraints (204 interprotein) were used in the final round of calculations. The 30 best DYANA structures in terms of target function were submitted to a simulated annealing protocol with the AMBER 5.0 package with the Cornell et al. force field (19Cornell W.D. Cieplack P.C.

NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 203-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1440) Google Scholar) experiments. The average diffusion coefficients of the protein were determined at two different protein concentrations (350 and 3500 μm) and two different pH values (pH 5.0 and 7.0) in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer. To get structural information about the protein oligomers 2D-NOESY experiments were also carried out with these samples. In addition, 13C-HSQC and 15N-HSQC spectra were recorded at high and low protein concentration. The high protein concentration sample was prepared by mixing unlabeled with 13C/15N double-labeled protein (4:1 ratio) to a final protein concentration of 3500 μm. Finally 2D-NOESY, 13C-selected/12C-filtered experiments were performed on this sample to analyze the interprotein contacts responsible for oligomerization.Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization experiments were carried out with a p16.7C solution at 10 mg/ml containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. Protein crystallization was achieved by dialysis of the protein solution against a solution containing 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl. Prismatic crystals (0.05 × 0.05 × 0.2 mm) appear after 2 or 3 days of incubation at 4 °C. Crystals were successively transferred to a series of solutions with increased percentage of glycerol (from 5% to 35%) and mounted in a fiber loop and frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected in a charge-coupled device detector using the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) synchrotron radiation source at wavelength 0.92 at the BM16 beam-line. Diffraction data were processed using MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Machin J.R. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend.

For the r.m.s.d. values between pairs of structures the two values correspond to superimposition of the monomeric (residues 68–125) and dimeric (residues 68a to 125a and 68b to 125b) structures.Distance constraintsNumberNOE-derived upper distance limits (Å)2180Intraresidue530Short range466Medium range670Long range514Intramonomer1976Intermonomer204r.m.s.d. from ideal geometryBonds0.0086Angle2.16Ramachandran analysis (%)Residues in most favored regions81.9Residues in additionally allowed regions18.1r.m.s.d. between pairs of structures (Å)Backbone (68–125)0.77/0.96Heavy atoms (68–125)1.46/1.56 Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—As mentioned above, the x-ray structure of p16.7C was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of an ensemble of 10 preliminary NMR models (AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar)). The preliminary electron density map was improved by a density average protocol performed with DM (23Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The averaged density map was good enough to manually refine the NMR model from residues 66a to 86b. This model was then refined using the simulated annealing routine of CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). Several cycles of restrained refinement with REF-MAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) and iterative model building with O (26Jones T.A. Zon J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) were carried out. Water structure was also modeled. Calculations were performed using CCP4 programs (27Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The final model was refined by iterative maximum likelihood positional and translation, libration, and screw rotation displacement refinement (28Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the model was verified with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Ribbon figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER (28Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). The accessible surface area of p16.7C dimer and protomer was calculated with the program “naccess” from the LIGPLOT package (31Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Functional Domain of Protein p16.7 Can Form Multimers—Gel retardation studies demonstrated that the C-terminal half of protein p16.7 (p16.7C, containing p16.7 residues 63–130) has ss- and dsDNA-binding activities (12Muñoz-Espín D. Mateu M.G. Villar L. Marina A. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 1: 1-10Google Scholar). These experiments were performed with protein p16.7Cb, the derivative of p16.7C lacking its N-terminal (His6) tag, to exclude possible effects of this positively charged region on DNA binding. Although these experiments unequivocally demonstrated DNA-binding activity, they did not provide insight as to the ability of p16.7Cb to form multimers or the mode of DNA binding, which can be deduced by nuclease digestion analyses of the nucleoprotein complexes. Therefore, increasing amounts of p16.7Cb were incubated with 5′-labeled ss- or dsDNA probes. Next, the nucleoprotein complexes formed with ss- and dsDNA were challenged to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion, respectively, after which the fragments were fractionated through denaturing polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 1, b and c). In the absence of p16.7Cb nearly all the end-labeled ssDNA fragment was degraded into small oligonucleotides (Fig. 1b, lane 6). In the presence of p16.7Cb, in the range of 5–20 μm, however, the amount of small oligonucleotides decreased giving rise to a variety of larger ssDNA digestion products (Fig. 1b, lanes 1–3). At higher p16.7Cb concentrations, hardly any degradation products were observed (lanes 4 and 5) indicating that the ssDNA was (almost) completely protected from micrococcal nuclease attack. Together, these results confirm that p16.7Cb binds to ssDNA and, importantly, provide strong evidence that, at elevated concentrations, p16.7Cb forms multimers upon ssDNA binding leading to the generation of a continuous array of protein protecting the entire DNA fragment from micrococcal nuclease attack. Similar results were obtained when dsDNA was used (Fig. 1c). Thus, whereas a typical DNase I digestion pattern was observed in the absence or in the presence of a low amount (5 μm) of p16.7Cb (lanes 1 and 2, respectively), full protection of the dsDNA fragment was seen at higher p16.7Cb concentrations (lanes 3 and 4). Contrary to the analyses with ssDNA, though, no intermediate levels of nuclease protection were observed with dsDNA. This might indicate that multimer formation of p16.7Cb is enhanced upon binding to dsDNA, although this difference may also be due to different digestion characteristics of DNase I versus micrococcal nuclease. In vitro cross-linking carried out in the presence of dsDNA followed by Western blot analyses confirmed the ability of p16.7Cb to form multimers (Fig. 1d). Similar results were obtained using ssDNA instead of dsDNA or using p16.7C (not shown).Structure Determination of p16.7C Dimer—Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that p16.7C was mainly in its dimeric form at the temperature (30–40 °C), pH (5Meijer W.J.J.

Full backbone and side-chain assignment for p16.7C (Supplemental Table SI) was obtained using standard 2D and 3D NMR techniques on 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled samples. To distinguish intrafrom intermolecular NOEs, half-filtered NOESY experiments (Fig. 2A) were carried out on a heterolabeled dimer obtained by mixing equivalent amounts of unlabeled and 13C/15N-labeled protein. A summary of the experimental constraints employed and the characterization of the final NMR ensemble are shown in Table I.Fig. 2Solution and crystal structure of p16.7C.

These conditions were then used as a starting point for crystallographic studies. A preliminary NMR-derived ensemble of ten models was initially employed in the x-ray structural determination of p16.7C by molecular replacement at 2.9-Å resolution (see Table II and “Experimental Procedures”). The r.m.s.d. values for superimposition show that the NMR and crystal structures of p16.7C dimer are very similar (0.87 and 1.04 Å for the monomer and dimer backbone superimposition, respectively, in ordered regions; i.e. residues 68–125). The combined NMR and x-ray structures not only provide validation of one another but also give a more complete picture of the structure and dynamics of p16.7C than either structure alone.Table IIX-ray data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP61Unit cell (Å)a = 95.40 c = 47.57Resolution limits (Å)20–2.9I/σ (I)12.3 (3.2)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 2.97–2.9 ÅRmerge (%)bRmerge = ΣhklΣΣi |Ihkl–Ihkl|/ΣhklIhkl4.9 (16.7)Completeness (%)99.1 (99.8)Multiplicity7.2 (5.2)Temperature (K)120RefinementResolution range (Å)20–2.9R factor (%)23.9 (32.0)R free (%)26.5 (39.0)Number of atoms1094Number of reflections5257ModelMolecules per a.u./solvent content (%)2/65Protein/water atoms1064/19r.m.s.d. ideal bond lengths/angles (Å/deg)0.014/1.64ObservationsNo electron density for residues from 61 to 66a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell: 2.97–2.9 Åb Rmerge = ΣhklΣΣi |Ihkl–Ihkl|/ΣhklIhkl Open table in a new tab Architecture of the Dimer—The solution and crystallographic 3D structures of p16.7C dimer are shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), respectively. Each polypeptide chain (green and red) contains three α helices (corresponding to p16.7 residues 72–81 (H1), 88–95 (H2), and 103–121 (H3)). Helices H1 and H2, connected by a six-residue loop (82–87; loop 1), are oriented in an antiparallel fashion with a crossing angle of ∼160°. Helix H3 is connected to H2 by a seven-residue loop (96–102; loop 2) and packs against both helix H1 and H2 with crossing angles of 54° and 139°, respectively. The C-terminal region (residues 122–128) adopts an extended structure. Finally, residues 63–66 and 129–130 are disordered (Supplemental Fig. 1B). The secondary and ternary structure of each monomer is stabilized by formation of a hydrophobic core resulting from the packing of the three helices.According to both NMR and x-ray data, p16.7C forms a symmetric dimer that corresponds to a novel six-helical fold. Indeed, none of the proteins present in the Rutgers Protein Data Bank exhibit high structural homology with p16.7C according to DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and SCOP (33Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5567) Google Scholar). The two monomers, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, are held together by a combination of extensive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. In the following description of the main intermolecular contacts, letters a and b will be employed to specify the polypeptide chain only when essential to avoid ambiguities. The primary dimer interface is formed by helices H3a/H3b and the extended C-terminal region of both monomers, which are oriented in an antiparallel fashion. Thus, the extended C-terminal region of each protein packs against helices H1 and H3 of the other, being involved in both hydrophobic and polar intermolecular contacts. Especially relevant for the dimer stability seems the role of Leu-124 of each monomer, which is totally buried in a hydrophobic patch formed by Tyr-79, Leu-78, and Leu-106 of the other protein monomer. In addition, there are polar intermolecular contacts between Arg-113/Lys-122, Ser-88a/Ser-88b, and Arg-85/Tyr-115. Recent studies have highlighted the influence of CH-π interactions involving proline and aromatic side chains on protein stability (34Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In p16.7C the P87a and P87b side chains, 4 Å apart at the dimer interface, pack against the Trp-116 indol ring of both polypeptides (Trp-116a and Trp-116b, Supplemental Fig. S2). This particular arrangement is likely to make a significant contribution to the stability of the complex.It has been shown that nonspecific binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes such as DNA is purely electrostatic and can be quantitatively explained in terms of competitive condensed counterion displacement from DNA by polycationic regions of the protein (35Record M.T. Lohman M.L. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In this sense, the distribution of basic residues on the surface of a protein can provide important clues regarding nucleic acid binding sites. Thus, the surface electrostatic distribution of the p16.7C dimer was calculated to determine the most probable DNA binding site location. Fig. 3 shows that the negatively charged residues are clustered at the surface defined by helices H1/H2. In contrast, the opposite side of t"
