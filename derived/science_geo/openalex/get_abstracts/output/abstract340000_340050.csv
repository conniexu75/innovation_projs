https://openalex.org/W2011497284,"The toluene extract of the fluffy carbon material produced by resistive heating of graphite contains a variety of molecules larger than C(60) and C(70) in a total amount of 3 to 4% by weight. Repeated chromatography of this material on neutral alumina has led to the isolation of stable solid samples of C(76), C(84), C(90), and C(94). The characterization, which includes mass spectrometry, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance, electronic absorption (ultraviolet/visible) and vibrational (infrared) spectroscopy identifies these all-carbon molecules as higher fullerenes. In addition, C(70)O, a stable oxide, has been isolated that is structurally and electronically closely related to D5h-C(70). This compound forms during the resistive heating process and probably has an oxygen atom inserted between two carbon atoms on the convex external surface of the C(70) skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2043345540,"Studies of C(60) overlayer growth on GaAs(110) with scanning tunneling microscopy show large first monolayer islands that are locally well ordered, structurally stable, and commensurate with the GaAs surface owing to molecule-substrate interactions. Within the distorted close-packed structure, two distinct adsorption sites were identified, one of them being elevated because of stress in the C(60) monolayer."

These temperatures, observed through the greater part of a Jovian year, exhibit the influence of seasonal radiative forcing. Distinct bands of high temperature are located at the poles and mid-latitudes, while the equator alternates between warm and cold with a period of approximately 4 years. Substantial longitudinal variability is often observed within the warm mid-latitude bands, and occasionally elsewhere on the planet. This variability includes small, localized structures, as well as large-scale waves with wavelengths longer than approximately 30,000 kilometers. The amplitudes of the waves vary on a time scale of approximately 1 month; structures on a smaller scale may have lifetimes of only days. Waves observed in 1985, 1987, and 1988 propagated with group velocities less than +/-30 meters per second."

https://openalex.org/W2042827564,"Back-action evasion is a measurement technique originally devised to overcome certain limits imposed by quantum mechanics on the sensitivity of gravitational radiation detectors. The technique is, however, more generally applicable and can be used to improve the sensitivity of instrumentation with noise floors much greater than the quantum noise floor. The principle of back-action evasion is described here by means of a simple example. A comparison of back-action evasion with impedance matching is made to clarify when back-action evasion may be useful. Back-action evasion allows one to achieve a sensitivity comparable to that achieved by impedance matching."
