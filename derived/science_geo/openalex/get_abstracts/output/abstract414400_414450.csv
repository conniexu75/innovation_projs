https://openalex.org/W1994532676,"Over the past two decades, research has identified extrasynaptic GABAA receptor populations that enable neurons to sense the low ambient GABA concentrations present in the extracellular space in order to generate a form of tonic inhibition not previously considered in studies of neuronal excitability. The importance of this tonic inhibition in regulating states of consciousness is highlighted by the fact that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are believed to be key targets for anesthetics, sleep-promoting drugs, neurosteroids, and alcohol. The neurosteroid sensitivity of these extrasynaptic GABAARs may explain their importance in stress-, ovarian cycle-, and pregnancy-related mood disorders. Moreover, disruptions in network dynamics associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease may well involve alterations in the tonic GABAAR-mediated conductance. Extrasynaptic GABAARs may therefore present a therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases, with the potential to enhance cognition and aid poststroke functional recovery.

The GABAergic system of the mammalian brain consists of GABA-releasing cells and receptors that bind GABA. GABA-releasing cells are extraordinarily diverse and highly specialized (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), both controlling the activity of local networks (e.g., interneurons) and forming the output of some brain areas and nuclei (e.g., striatal medium spiny neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells). Receptors that bind GABA are present on virtually every neuron in the brain and represent a diverse array of receptor types (Mody and Pearce, 2004Mody I. Pearce R.A. Diversity of inhibitory neurotransmission through GABA(A) receptors.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This review focuses on GABAA receptors (GABAARs) that are excluded from synapses (see Figure 1). It has long been appreciated that ligand-gated ion channels that bind glutamate and GABA are found outside synapses in the somatic, dendritic, and even axonal membranes of mammalian neurons (Brown et al., 1979Brown D.A. Adams P.R. Higgins A.J. Marsh S. Distribution of gaba-receptors and gaba-carriers in the mammalian nervous system.J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 667-671PubMed Google Scholar, Soltesz et al., 1990Soltesz I. Roberts J.D. Takagi H. Richards J.G. Mohler H. Somogyi P.

Neurosci. 1990; 2: 414-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The first indication that a persistent, tonic conductance could result from activation of extrasynaptic GABAAR populations came from whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings made from developing neurons when synapses are being formed (Ben-Ari et al., 1994Ben-Ari Y. Tseeb V. Raggozzino D. Khazipov R. Gaiarsa J.L. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA): a fast excitatory transmitter which may regulate the development of hippocampal neurones in early postnatal life.Prog.

Lett. 1993; 155: 199-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, the addition of GABAAR blockers reduced the standing holding current indicating that a tonic GABAAR-mediated conductance had to be present that was not associated with conventional IPSCs (Otis et al., 1991Otis T.S. Staley K.J. Mody I. Perpetual inhibitory activity in mammalian brain slices generated by spontaneous GABA release.Brain Res. 1991; 545: 142-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that these early developmental forms of GABA signaling may play a role in controlling neuronal differentiation (LoTurco et al., 1995LoTurco J.J. Owens D.F. Heath M.J. Davis M.B.

Changing properties of GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling during early neocortical development.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This type of intercellular communication is fundamentally different from the “point-to-point” communication that underlies both synaptic transmission and gap-junction-mediated electrical coupling. It is more similar to the volume and paracrine transmission associated with the actions of neuromodulators such as serotonin, histamine, dopamine, acetycholine, and peptides in the brain (Agnati et al., 2010Agnati L.F. Guidolin D. Guescini M. Genedani S. Fuxe K. Understanding wiring and volume transmission.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2010; 64: 137-159Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Attention has subsequently focused on the molecular identity of the extrasynaptic GABAARs that generate the tonic conductance and on exploring their physiological relevance for the adult brain (Farrant and Nusser, 2005Farrant M. Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). GABAARs are pentameric assemblies usually made up from at least three different proteins selected from 19 different subunits (Olsen and Sieghart, 2008Olsen R.W. Sieghart W. International Union of Pharmacology. LXX. Subtypes of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors: classification on the basis of subunit composition, pharmacology, and function. Update.Pharmacol. Rev. 2008; 60: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These include α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3 (Olsen and Sieghart, 2008Olsen R.W. Sieghart W.

GABA-A receptor subtypes in the brain: a paradigm for CNS drug discovery?.Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A receptor's regional and developmental expression pattern, as well as its physiological and pharmacological properties, are determined by differences in subunit gene expression and composition (Hevers and Lüddens, 1998Hevers W.

Diversity of inhibitory neurotransmission through GABA(A) receptors.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the rules governing these relationships have received a great deal of attention in the search for highly specific drug targets in the CNS (Olsen and Sieghart, 2009Olsen R.W.

GABA-A receptor subtypes in the brain: a paradigm for CNS drug discovery?.Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The subunit identity of the final assembly also determines the synaptic or extrasynaptic localization of GABAARs within a neuron (Pirker et al., 2000Pirker S. Schwarzer C. Wieselthaler A. Sieghart W. Sperk G. GABA(A) receptors: immunocytochemical distribution of 13 subunits in the adult rat brain.Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 815-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), reflecting the existence of various subunit assembly rules and anchoring/trafficking mechanisms (Luscher et al., 2011Luscher B.

Rev. 2011; 91: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following the original description of the GABAAR δ-subunit (Shivers et al., 1989Shivers B.D. Killisch I. Sprengel R. Sontheimer H. Köhler M. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Two novel GABAA receptor subunits exist in distinct neuronal subpopulations.Neuron. 1989; 3: 327-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its expression patterns in the brain (Wisden et al., 1992Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. The distribution of 13 GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. I. Telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was first shown for mature cerebellar granule cells that extrasynaptic α6βδ subunit-containing GABAARs mediate a tonic form of inhibition both in vitro (Brickley et al., 2001Brickley S.G.

Margrie T.W. Häusser M.

Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A tonic conductance mediated by α4βδ subunit-containing GABAARs has now also been reported in dentate gyrus granule cells, thalamic relay neurons, neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, and medium spiny neurons of the striatum (Ade et al., 2008Ade K.K.

USA. 2007; 104: 14831-14836Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) is probably generated by the persistent activation of extrasynaptic α1βδ subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABAARs (Oláh et al., 2009Oláh S. Füle M. Komlósi G. Varga C. Báldi R. Barzó P. Tamás G. Regulation of cortical microcircuits by unitary GABA-mediated volume transmission.Nature. 2009; 461: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Given that persistently active δ-GABAAR openings make such a major contribution to the total charge that flows across the membrane (Belelli et al., 2005Belelli D. Peden D.R. Rosahl T.W. Wafford K.A.

Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2624-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising that this type of conductance is capable of modulating both cell and network behavior (Farrant and Nusser, 2005Farrant M. Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In thalamic relay neurons, for example, the membrane hyperpolarization associated with the persistent chloride flux through δ-GABAARs leads to burst firing (Cope et al., 2005Cope D.W. Hughes S.W. Crunelli V. GABAA receptor-mediated tonic inhibition in thalamic neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11553-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and slow thalamo-cortical oscillations (Winsky-Sommerer et al., 2007Winsky-Sommerer R. Vyazovskiy V.V. Homanics G.E. Tobler I. The EEG effects of THIP (Gaboxadol) on sleep and waking are mediated by the GABA(A)delta-subunit-containing receptors.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 1893-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the tonic conductance may not always result in membrane hyperpolarization. In cerebellar granule cells, the membrane shunt associated with tonic inhibition attenuates excitatory drive with little impact on the membrane potential (Brickley et al., 2001Brickley S.G. Revilla V. Cull-Candy S.G. Wisden W. Farrant M. Adaptive regulation of neuronal excitability by a voltage-independent potassium conductance.Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that a shunting inhibition associated with a tonic conductance could result in a small but persistent membrane depolarization (Farrant and Kaila, 2007Farrant M. Kaila K. The cellular, molecular and ionic basis of GABA(A) receptor signalling.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 160: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another striking feature of the tonic conductance measured in adult neurons is that it represents the simultaneous opening of only a very small fraction of the available extrasynaptic GABAARs (Kasugai et al., 2010Kasugai Y. Swinny J.D. Roberts J.D. Dalezios Y. Fukazawa Y. Sieghart W. Shigemoto R. Somogyi P. Quantitative localisation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptor subunits on hippocampal pyramidal cells by freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 1868-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Nusser et al., 1995Nusser Z. Roberts J.D. Baude A. Richards J.G. Somogyi P. Relative densities of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors on cerebellar granule cells as determined by a quantitative immunogold method.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2948-2960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that receptor occupancy is low and/or a large number of receptors are heavily desensitized. δ-GABAARs recorded at room (Mortensen et al., 2010Mortensen M. Ebert B. Wafford K. Smart T.G. Distinct activities of GABA agonists at synaptic- and extrasynaptic-type GABAA receptors.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1251-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and physiological (Bright et al., 2011Bright D.P. Renzi M. Bartram J. McGee T.P. MacKenzie G. Hosie A.M. Farrant M. Brickley S.G. Profound desensitization by ambient GABA limits activation of δ-containing GABAA receptors during spillover.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) temperatures are predicted to be profoundly desensitized. Although tonic inhibition can be generated by a desensitized receptor population as long as receptor number is high, this feature could limit the ability of these receptors to operate as spillover detectors and other less desensitized extrasynaptic GABAARs could be better suited to this role. Slow-rising and slow-decaying IPSCs generated by GABA spillover is a significant feature of GABA release from Ivy/neuorgliaform cells (Capogna and Pearce, 2011Capogna M. Pearce R.A. GABA A,slow: causes and consequences.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Szabadics et al., 2007Szabadics J. Tamás G. Soltesz I.

Orser B.A. Paulsen O. alpha5 Subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate a slowly decaying inhibitory synaptic current in CA1 pyramidal neurons following Schaffer collateral activation.Neuropharmacology. 2010; 58: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, Zarnowska et al., 2009Zarnowska E.D.

Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One challenge for the future is to establish whether the spillover currents observed in these and other cell types reflect activation of distinct extrasynaptic GABAAR populations separate from those responsible for generating tonic inhibition (Farrant and Nusser, 2005Farrant M. Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). It is now appreciated that in addition to δ-GABAARs, other GABAAR types are also capable of generating a tonic conductance in a number of adult brain regions. Most notably, α5βγ2 subunit-containing GABAARs (α5-GABAARs) generate a tonic conductance that regulates the excitability of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Caraiscos et al., 2004Caraiscos V.B.

Cortex. 2007; 17: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). High-affinity GABAARs made up of only αβ subunits are also a possibility (Mortensen and Smart, 2006Mortensen M. Smart T.G. Extrasynaptic alphabeta subunit GABAA receptors on rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 841-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as are GABAARs that can open even in the absence of an agonist (Hadley and Amin, 2007Hadley S.H. Amin J.

Physiol. 2007; 581: 1001-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as reported in some immature neurons (Birnir et al., 2000Birnir B. Everitt A.B. Lim M.S. Gage P.W. Spontaneously opening GABA(A) channels in CA1 pyramidal neurones of rat hippocampus.J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also possible, given the large number of γ2-GABAARs present in both the synaptic and extrasynaptic membrane (Kasugai et al., 2010Kasugai Y. Swinny J.D. Roberts J.D. Dalezios Y. Fukazawa Y.

Neurosci. 1990; 2: 414-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), that more conventional low-affinity GABAARs make a contribution to the steady-state conductance when ambient GABA concentrations are high (Farrant and Kaila, 2007Farrant M. Kaila K. The cellular, molecular and ionic basis of GABA(A) receptor signalling.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 160: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is now appreciated that specific high-affinity GABAAR populations, such as δ-GABAARs and α5-GABAARs, are predominantly responsible for generating the tonic conductance found in many brain regions under normal physiological conditions. The study of these extrasynaptic GABAAR populations is now entering a defining stage and this review focuses on new insights into the potential involvement of these receptors in the cellular and molecular abnormalities underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders including sleep disturbances, stress-related psychiatric conditions, and epilepsy. We also further discuss the potential role of these receptors in cognition, in recovery from stroke, and in mediating the effects of alcohol. Adequate sleep is essential for our well being, and many neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and schizophrenia, are associated with severe disruptions in sleep patterns. It is thus disappointing that we understand little about the mechanisms that control sleep and rely on limited repertoires of clinical interventions to treat sleep disorders (Wafford and Ebert, 2008Wafford K.A. Ebert B. Emerging anti-insomnia drugs: tackling sleeplessness and the quality of wake time.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 530-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GABAARs play a pivotal role in the control of our sleep rhythms, and for many decades benzodiazepines and zolpidem, known for their ability to potentiate GABAAR currents, have remained the most widely prescribed treatment for insomnia, in spite of producing tolerance, addiction, and withdrawal problems. In a search for more refined drug interventions, it has become clear that the hypnotic actions of the sleep promoting drug gaboxadol (Wafford and Ebert, 2006Wafford K.A. Ebert B. Gaboxadol—a new awakening in sleep.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisothiazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol; THIP) can be attributed to this drug's selective action on δ-GABAARs (Brown et al., 2002Brown N. Kerby J. Bonnert T.P. Whiting P.J. Wafford K.A. Pharmacological characterization of a novel cell line expressing human alpha(4)beta(3)delta GABA(A) receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). At concentrations of around 500 nM, this drug activates δ-GABAARs with little action on synaptic GABAAR types. This selectivity arises from gaboxadol's lower apparent affinity at γ2-GABAARs compared to δ-GABAARs (Mortensen et al., 2010Mortensen M. Ebert B. Wafford K. Smart T.G. Distinct activities of GABA agonists at synaptic- and extrasynaptic-type GABAA receptors.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1251-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gaboxadol acts as a hypnotic in humans to increase sleep duration by promoting slow-wave or non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep (Faulhaber et al., 1997Faulhaber J. Steiger A. Lancel M. The GABAA agonist THIP produces slow wave sleep and reduces spindling activity in NREM sleep in humans.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1997; 130: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When δ-GABAARs are removed by genetic manipulations in mice, gaboxadol-induced slow oscillations are absent from the EEG (Winsky-Sommerer et al., 2007Winsky-Sommerer R. Vyazovskiy V.V. Homanics G.E. Tobler I. The EEG effects of THIP (Gaboxadol) on sleep and waking are mediated by the GABA(A)delta-subunit-containing receptors.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 25: 1893-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the anesthetic potency of gaboxadol is reduced (Boehm et al., 2006Boehm 2nd, S.L. Homanics G.E. Blednov Y.A. Harris R.A. delta-Subunit containing GABAA receptor knockout mice are less sensitive to the actions of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 541: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, due to side-effects such as hallucinations and disorientation in a subset of patients, gaboxadol failed phase III clinical trials as an alternative to benzodiazepines, but more potent δ-GABAAR selective agonists are being developed (Wafford et al., 2009Wafford K.A. van Niel M.B.

https://openalex.org/W2105336002,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are implicated in brain development and function but the underlying mechanisms have been difficult to study in part due to the cellular heterogeneity in neural circuits. To systematically analyze miRNA expression in neurons, we have established a miRNA tagging and affinity-purification (miRAP) method that is targeted to cell types through the Cre-loxP binary system in mice. Our studies of the neocortex and cerebellum reveal the expression of a large fraction of known miRNAs with distinct profiles in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and subtypes of GABAergic neurons. We further detected putative novel miRNAs, tissue or cell type-specific strand selection of miRNAs, and miRNA editing. Our method thus will facilitate a systematic analysis of miRNA expression and regulation in specific neuron types in the context of neuronal development, physiology, plasticity, pathology, and disease models, and is generally applicable to other cell types and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2026866676,"Introduction MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA molecules with relevance as regulators of gene expression thereby affecting crucial processes in cancer development. MiRNAs offer great potential as biomarkers for cancer detection due to their remarkable stability in blood and their characteristic expression in many different diseases. We investigated whether microarray-based miRNA profiling on whole blood could discriminate between early stage breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Methods We performed microarray-based miRNA profiling on whole blood of 48 early stage breast cancer patients at diagnosis along with 57 healthy individuals as controls. This was followed by a real-time semi-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) validation in a separate cohort of 24 early stage breast cancer patients from a breast cancer screening unit and 24 age matched controls using two differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-202, miR-718). Results Using the significance level of p<0.05, we found that 59 miRNAs were differentially expressed in whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls. 13 significantly up-regulated miRNAs and 46 significantly down-regulated miRNAs in our microarray panel of 1100 miRNAs and miRNA star sequences could be detected. A set of 240 miRNAs that was evaluated by radial basis function kernel support vector machines and 10-fold cross validation yielded a specificity of 78.8%, and a sensitivity of 92.5%, as well as an accuracy of 85.6%. Two miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR in an independent cohort. The relative fold changes of the RT-qPCR validation were in line with the microarray data for both miRNAs, and statistically significant differences in miRNA-expression were found for miR-202. Conclusions MiRNA profiling in whole blood has potential as a novel method for early stage breast cancer detection, but there are still challenges that need to be addressed to establish these new biomarkers in clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2047448689,"Dendrites of the same neuron usually avoid each other. Some neurons also repel similar neurons through dendrite-dendrite interaction to tile the receptive field. Nonoverlapping coverage based on such contact-dependent repulsion requires dendrites to compete for limited space. Here we show that Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which tile the larval body wall, grow their dendrites mainly in a 2D space on the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the epidermis. Removing neuronal integrins or blocking epidermal laminin production causes dendrites to grow into the epidermis, suggesting that integrin-laminin interaction attaches dendrites to the ECM. We further show that some of the previously identified tiling mutants fail to confine dendrites in a 2D plane. Expansion of these mutant dendrites in three dimensions results in overlap of dendritic fields. Moreover, overexpression of integrins in these mutant neurons effectively reduces dendritic crossing and restores tiling, revealing an additional mechanism for tiling."
https://openalex.org/W1998116909,"Recent studies suggest that synaptic vesicles (SVs) giving rise to spontaneous neurotransmission are distinct from those that carry out evoked release. However, the molecular basis of this dichotomy remains unclear. Here, we focused on two noncanonical SNARE molecules, Vps10p-tail-interactor-1a (vti1a) and VAMP7, previously shown to reside on SVs. Using simultaneous multicolor imaging at individual synapses, we could show that compared to the more abundant vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin2, both vti1a and VAMP7 were reluctantly mobilized during activity. Vti1a, but not VAMP7, showed robust trafficking under resting conditions that could be partly matched by synaptobrevin2. Furthermore, loss of vti1a function selectively reduced high-frequency spontaneous neurotransmitter release detected postsynaptically. Expression of a truncated version of vti1a augmented spontaneous release more than full-length vti1a, suggesting that an autoinhibitory process regulates vti1a function. Taken together, these results support the premise that in its native form vti1a selectively maintains spontaneous neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2058888545,"Dendrites achieve characteristic spacing patterns during development to ensure appropriate coverage of territories. Mechanisms of dendrite positioning via repulsive dendrite-dendrite interactions are beginning to be elucidated, but the control, and importance, of dendrite positioning relative to their substrate is poorly understood. We found that dendritic branches of Drosophila dendritic arborization sensory neurons can be positioned either at the basal surface of epidermal cells, or enclosed within epidermal invaginations. We show that integrins control dendrite positioning on or within the epidermis in a cell autonomous manner by promoting dendritic retention on the basal surface. Loss of integrin function in neurons resulted in excessive self-crossing and dendrite maintenance defects, the former indicating a role for substrate interactions in self-avoidance. In contrast to a contact-mediated mechanism, we find that integrins prevent crossings that are noncontacting between dendrites in different three-dimensional positions, revealing a requirement for combined dendrite-dendrite and dendrite-substrate interactions in self-avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2094536296,"Previous reports have implicated an induction of genes in IFN/STAT1 (Interferon/STAT1) signaling in radiation resistant and prosurvival tumor phenotypes in a number of cancer cell lines, and we have hypothesized that upregulation of these genes may be predictive of poor survival outcome and/or treatment response in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) patients. We have developed a list of 8 genes related to IFN/STAT1 that we hypothesize to be predictive of poor survival in GBM patients. Our working hypothesis that over-expression of this gene signature predicts poor survival outcome in GBM patients was confirmed, and in addition, it was demonstrated that the survival model was highly subtype-dependent, with strong dependence in the Proneural subtype and no detected dependence in the Classical and Mesenchymal subtypes. We developed a specific multi-gene survival model for the Proneural subtype in the TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) discovery set which we have validated in the TCGA validation set. In addition, we have performed network analysis in the form of Bayesian Network discovery and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to further dissect the underlying biology of this gene signature in the etiology of GBM. We theorize that the strong predictive value of the IFN/STAT1 gene signature in the Proneural subtype may be due to chemotherapy and/or radiation resistance induced through prolonged constitutive signaling of these genes during the course of the illness. The results of this study have implications both for better prediction models for survival outcome in GBM and for improved understanding of the underlying subtype-specific molecular mechanisms for GBM tumor progression and treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2056372405,"DNA vaccines are a promising approach to vaccination since they circumvent the problem of vector-induced immunity. DNA plasmid cytokine adjuvants have been shown to augment immune responses in small animals and in macaques.We performed two first in human HIV vaccine trials in the US, Brazil and Thailand of an RNA-optimized truncated HIV-1 gag gene (p37) DNA derived from strain HXB2 administered either alone or in combination with dose-escalation of IL-12 or IL-15 plasmid cytokine adjuvants. Vaccinations with both the HIV immunogen and cytokine adjuvant were generally well-tolerated and no significant vaccine-related adverse events were identified. A small number of subjects developed asymptomatic low titer antibodies to IL-12 or IL-15. Cellular immunogenicity following 3 and 4 vaccinations was poor, with response rates to gag of 4.9%/8.7% among vaccinees receiving gag DNA alone, 0%/11.5% among those receiving gag DNA+IL-15, and no responders among those receiving DNA+high dose (1500 ug) IL-12 DNA. However, after three doses, 44.4% (4/9) of vaccinees receiving gag DNA and intermediate dose (500 ug) of IL-12 DNA demonstrated a detectable cellular immune response.This combination of HIV gag DNA with plasmid cytokine adjuvants was well tolerated. There were minimal responses to HIV gag DNA alone, and no apparent augmentation with either IL-12 or IL-15 plasmid cytokine adjuvants. Despite the promise of DNA vaccines, newer formulations or methods of delivery will be required to increase their immunogenicity.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00115960 NCT00111605."
https://openalex.org/W2104560002,"Chromatin remodeling by histone deacetylases (HDACs) is a key mechanism regulating behavioral adaptations to cocaine use. We report here that cocaine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling induce the transient nuclear accumulation of HDAC5 in rodent striatum. We show that cAMP-stimulated nuclear import of HDAC5 requires a signaling mechanism that involves transient, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-dependent dephosphorylation of a Cdk5 site (S279) found within the HDAC5 nuclear localization sequence. Dephosphorylation of HDAC5 increases its nuclear accumulation, by accelerating its nuclear import rate and reducing its nuclear export rate. Importantly, we show that dephosphorylation of HDAC5 S279 in the nucleus accumbens suppresses the development, but not expression, of cocaine reward behavior in vivo. Together, our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which cocaine regulates HDAC5 function to antagonize the rewarding impact of cocaine, likely by putting a brake on drug-stimulated gene expression that supports drug-induced behavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W2125616763,"The discovery that drugs targeting a single G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) can differentially modulate distinct subsets of the receptor signaling repertoire has created a challenge for drug discovery at these important therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that a single label-free assay based on cellular impedance provides a real-time integration of multiple signaling events engaged upon GPCR activation. Stimulation of the β₂-adrenergic receptor (β₂AR) in living cells with the prototypical agonist isoproterenol generated a complex, multi-featured impedance response over time. Selective pharmacological inhibition of specific arms of the β₂AR signaling network revealed the differential contribution of G(s)-, G(i)- and Gβγ-dependent signaling events, including activation of the canonical cAMP and ERK1/2 pathways, to specific components of the impedance response. Further dissection revealed the essential role of intracellular Ca²⁺ in the impedance response and led to the discovery of a novel β₂AR-promoted Ca²⁺ mobilization event. Recognizing that impedance responses provide an integrative assessment of ligand activity, we screened a collection of β-adrenergic ligands to determine if differences in the signaling repertoire engaged by compounds would lead to distinct impedance signatures. An unsupervised clustering analysis of the impedance responses revealed the existence of 5 distinct compound classes, revealing a richer signaling texture than previously recognized for this receptor. Taken together, these data indicate that the pluridimensionality of GPCR signaling can be captured using integrative approaches to provide a comprehensive readout of drug activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013067663,"Peripheral axons from auditory spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) form an elaborate series of radially and spirally oriented projections that interpret complex aspects of the auditory environment. However, the developmental processes that shape these axon tracts are largely unknown. Radial bundles are comprised of dense SGN fascicles that project through otic mesenchyme to form synapses within the cochlea. Here, we show that radial bundle fasciculation and synapse formation are disrupted when Pou3f4 (DFNX2) is deleted from otic mesenchyme. Further, we demonstrate that Pou3f4 binds to and directly regulates expression of Epha4, Epha4−/− mice present similar SGN defects, and exogenous EphA4 promotes SGN fasciculation in the absence of Pou3f4. Finally, Efnb2 deletion in SGNs leads to similar fasciculation defects, suggesting that ephrin-B2/EphA4 interactions are critical during this process. These results indicate a model whereby Pou3f4 in the otic mesenchyme establishes an Eph/ephrin-mediated fasciculation signal that promotes inner radial bundle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2010919804,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is well known for mediating the toxic effects of TCDD and has been a subject of intense research for over 30 years. Current investigations continue to uncover its endogenous and regulatory roles in a wide variety of cellular and molecular signaling processes. A zebrafish line with a mutation in ahr2 (ahr2(hu3335)), encoding the AHR paralogue responsible for mediating TCDD toxicity in zebrafish, was developed via Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) and predicted to express a non-functional AHR2 protein. We characterized AHR activity in the mutant line using TCDD and leflunomide as toxicological probes to investigate function, ligand binding and CYP1A induction patterns of paralogues AHR2, AHR1A and AHR1B. By evaluating TCDD-induced developmental toxicity, mRNA expression changes and CYP1A protein in the AHR2 mutant line, we determined that ahr2(hu3335) zebrafish are functionally null. In silico modeling predicted differential binding of TCDD and leflunomide to the AHR paralogues. AHR1A is considered a non-functional pseudogene as it does not bind TCCD or mediate in vivo TCDD toxicity. Homology modeling, however, predicted a ligand binding conformation of AHR1A with leflunomide. AHR1A-dependent CYP1A immunohistochemical expression in the liver provided in vivo confirmation of the in silico docking studies. The ahr2(hu3335) functional knockout line expands the experimental power of zebrafish to unravel the role of the AHR during development, as well as highlights potential activity of the other AHR paralogues in ligand-specific toxicological responses."

Although this process controls long-term depression (LTD) induction in the hippocampus, how it is regulated by neuronal activities is not completely clear.

We found that Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor, but not through VDCC, activated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and calcineurin and dephosphorylated PIP5Kγ661, which then bound to AP-2 at postsynapses. NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and the LFS-induced LTD were completely blocked by inhibiting the association between PIP5Kγ661 and AP-2 and by overexpression of a kinase-dead PIP5Kγ661 mutant in postsynaptic neurons. These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation dynamically controls early steps of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis during hippocampal LTD by regulating the PIP5Kγ661 activity. Of the three splice variants of PIP5Kγ, PIP5Kγ661 was selectively expressed in mouse hippocampus in vivo and in vitro (Figures 1A and 1B ). PIP5Kγ661 expression was observed in mouse hippocampus from approximately 2 weeks after birth in vivo and in vitro, and it increased during late postnatal development (Figures 1A and 1B). To examine whether PIP5Kγ661 is present on postsynapses, we first analyzed cultured hippocampal neurons at 18 days in vitro (DIV) by immunocytochemistry. When green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PIP5Kγ661 (GFP-PIP5Kγ661) was expressed in hippocampal neurons, the GFP signal was observed in dendrites, which were immunopositive for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and in spines protruding from the dendrites (Figure 1C). Like postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and filamentous actin (F-actin), which were concentrated in the dendritic spines, endogenous PIP5Kγ661 was enriched in dendritic spine-like protrusions (see Figures S1A–S1E available online). Endogenous PIP5Kγ661 partially colocalized with PSD-95 and F-actin (Figures 1D and 1E). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of the subcellular fractions of adult mouse brain showed PIP5Kγ661 not only in the SV fraction, which was immunonegative for PSD-95, but also in the PSD fractions, which were immunonegative for an SV marker synaptophysin (Figure 1F). Together, these results indicate that PIP5Kγ661 localizes at least in part to postsynapses. The dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 by calcineurin plays an essential role in the activity-dependent production of PI(4,5)P2 at presynapses (Lee et al., 2005Lee S.Y. Voronov S. Letinic K. Nairn A.C.

To examine whether PIP5Kγ661 is also dephosphorylated at postsynapses, we treated hippocampal neurons with NMDA, which induces AMPA receptor endocytosis and LTD (Beattie et al., 2000Beattie E.C.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To block action potential-induced VDCC activation at presynapses, we included tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the culture medium. Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates with an anti-PIP5Kγ antibody revealed that an additional PIP5Kγ661 band, which migrated faster on electrophoresis gels, appeared after NMDA treatment (Figure 2A ). This band likely corresponds to the dephosphorylated form of PIP5Kγ661, because PIP5Kγ661 migrated to the same position when the lysates were treated with λ-phosphatase before electrophoresis (Figure 2A). NMDA treatment increased the dephosphorylated form of PIP5Kγ661 in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of approximately 30 μM (Figure 2B). The dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 was observed as early as 5 min and was saturated by 20 min after 50 μM NMDA treatment (Figure 2C). These results indicate that PIP5Kγ661 is mostly phosphorylated at the basal level and is rapidly dephosphorylated upon NMDA treatment. The concentration and duration of NMDA treatment were similar to those used previously to induce AMPA receptor endocytosis in cultured neurons (Beattie et al., 2000Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. Yu X.

To examine the molecular mechanism responsible for the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661, we treated hippocampal neurons with various pharmacological reagents. The NMDA antagonist D-APV or the Ca2+ chelator EGTA completely blocked the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 (Figure 2D), demonstrating that Ca2+ entry through the NMDA receptor is essential for this process. Calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine A and FK-520, partially inhibited the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 (Figure 2D). In contrast, the dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 was almost completely blocked by a high concentration (1 μM) of okadaic acid (Figure 2D), which inhibits both PP1 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Because a low concentration (10 nM) of okadaic acid and fostriecin, which specifically inhibit PP2A (Bialojan and Takai, 1988Bialojan C. Takai A.

Inhibition of type II topoisomerase by fostriecin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), were ineffective (Figure 2D), the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 was probably mediated by PP1 and partially by calcineurin. These results were in contrast to the dominant role of calcineurin in the high-KCl-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 at presynapses (Nakano-Kobayashi et al., 2007Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. Role of activation of PIP5Kgamma661 by AP-2 complex in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 was not inhibited by a cocktail of Ca2+ channel blockers (Figures 2E and S2). Therefore, the direct calcium influx through NMDA receptors likely activates a specific pathway that involves PP1 and calcineurin and dephosphorylates PIP5Kγ661 at postsynapses. The AP-2 subunit β2 adaptin was previously shown to interact directly with the dephosphorylated form of PIP5Kγ661 in vitro (Nakano-Kobayashi et al., 2007Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. Role of activation of PIP5Kgamma661 by AP-2 complex in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine whether NMDA treatment induces the interaction of PIP5Kγ661 with AP-2 in neurons, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using cultured hippocampal neurons. AP-2 subunits (α and β adaptins) were coimmunoprecipitated with PIP5Kγ661 upon NMDA treatment (Figure 3A ). Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis of hippocampal neurons expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PIP5Kγ661 and FLAG-tagged β2 adaptin revealed that as early as 5 min after NMDA application, colocalization of HA and FLAG immunoreactivities was detected and saturated by 10 min in the dendrites (Figure S3). To examine whether this interaction occurs at postsynapses, we performed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay using N- and C-terminal subfragments of Venus, which were fused to the ear domain of β2 adaptin (VN-β2 ear) and wild-type PIP5Kγ661 (VC-PIP5K-WT), respectively. In this assay, interaction of fused proteins mediates the reconstitution of Venus, resulting in efficient fluorescence emission (Kerppola, 2006Kerppola T.K. Design and implementation of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for the visualization of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging of hippocampal neurons expressing these fusion proteins showed Venus fluorescent puncta appearing along the neurites, approximately 2 min after NMDA treatment (Figure 3B and Movie S1). Changes in fluorescence intensity were detected faster than those reported for full chromophore maturation in BiFC studies (Kerppola, 2006Kerppola T.K. Design and implementation of bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for the visualization of protein interactions in living cells.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1278-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), but several studies of interaction between various proteins have reported rapid changes in fluorescence intensity in response to stimuli (Guo et al., 2005Guo Y.

Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis confirmed that most Venus puncta corresponded to spines on MAP2-positive dendrites (Figure 3C) and colocalized with PSD-95 and F-actin (Figures 3D and 3E). As a negative control, we expressed N- and C-terminal fragments of Venus fused to proteins that do not interact with each other in hippocampal neurons. The combination of VN-tagged glutathione S-transferase (GST) and VC, VN-β2 ear, and VC, or VN-GST and VC-PIP5K-WT gave rise to diffuse background fluorescence throughout dendrites and never showed punctate fluorescence (Figure S4A). These results indicate that NMDA receptor activation triggers the interaction of PIP5Kγ661 with AP-2 at postsynapses in hippocampal neurons. The phosphorylation of Ser at position 645 of PIP5Kγ661 blocks its interaction with β2 adaptin (Nakano-Kobayashi et al., 2007Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. Role of activation of PIP5Kgamma661 by AP-2 complex in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine whether such a dephosphorylation-dependent interaction occurs at postsynapses, we used the phosphomimetic mutant of PIP5Kγ661, VC-PIP5K-S645E, in which Glu replaced Ser at 645. The BiFC assay using VN-β2 ear and VC-PIP5K-S645E revealed no Venus fluorescent puncta after NMDA treatment in hippocampal neurons (Figures 3C and 3G). When dephosphorylation was inhibited by FK520 (1 μM) or okadaic acid (1 μM), the NMDA-induced formation of Venus fluorescent puncta was significantly reduced in neurons expressing VN-β2 ear and VC-PIP5K-WT (Figures 3F and 3G). Because Ser645 of PIP5Kγ661 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 (Lee et al., 2005Lee S.Y. Voronov S. Letinic K. Nairn A.C. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Regulation of the interaction between PIPKI gamma and talin by proline-directed protein kinases.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we performed the BiFC assay in the presence of a Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine. The NMDA-induced formation of Venus fluorescent puncta in neurons expressing VN-β2 ear and VC-PIP5K-WT was significantly increased by olomoucine (Figures S4B and S4C). Together, these results confirm that the emergence of Venus fluorescent puncta reflects specific interaction between β2 adaptin and PIP5Kγ661. They also indicate that the NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of PIP5Kγ661 at Ser 645 plays an essential role in its association with AP-2 at postsynapses. In contrast, immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates at 5 min after NMDA application showed that only approximately 35% of PI5Kγ661 was dephosphorylated compared to the maximum dephosphorylation level (Figure 2C). The rapid emergence of the BiFC signal may be caused by the high sensitivity of fluorescence detection (Kerppola, 2009Kerppola T.K. Visualization of molecular interactions using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis: characteristics of protein fragment complementation.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 2876-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in spines, whereas the immunoblot assay reflects total endogenous PIP5Kγ661. The dephosphorylated form of PIP5Kγ661 was mostly observed in the membrane fractions, such as SV and PSD (Figure 1F), probably because it is more tightly associated with the plasma membrane via AP-2. Association with AP-2 activates PIP5Kγ661, leading to the production of PI(4,5)P2 in vitro (Nakano-Kobayashi et al., 2007Nakano-Kobayashi A. Yamazaki M. Unoki T. Hongu T. Murata C. Taguchi R. Katada T. Frohman M.A. Yokozeki T. Kanaho Y. Role of activation of PIP5Kgamma661 by AP-2 complex in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); PI(4,5)P2 triggers further accumulation of AP-2 and other endocytic components at presynapses. Thus, we hypothesized that the NMDA-induced association of PIP5Kγ661 with AP-2 (Figure 3) plays an essential role in NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis at postsynapses. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the GluA2 subunit tagged with HA at its extracellular N terminus in cultured hippocampal neurons. As reported previously (Beattie et al., 2000Beattie E.C.

When the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of PIP5Kγ661 (PIP5K-CT-WT) was expressed, the NMDA-induced reduction of surface AMPA receptors was blocked (Figures 4B and 4E). Similarly, the expression of the GFP-tagged dephosphomimetic mutant of the PIP5Kγ661 C-terminal fragment (PIP5K-CT-S645A), in which Ala replaced Ser 645, blocked NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis (Figures 4C and 4E). In contrast, expression of GFP-tagged phosphomimetic mutant of the PIP5Kγ661 C-terminal fragment (PIP5K-CT-S645E) failed to do so (Figures 4D and 4E). GST pull-down assays confirmed that wild-type and PIP5K-CT-S645A, but not PIP5K-CT-S645E, bound to β2 adaptin (Figure S5A). These results suggest that overexpression of the wild-type and dephosphomimetic C-terminal fragment of PIP5Kγ661 interferes with the interaction between endogenous PIP5Kγ661 and AP-2, thereby inhibiting the NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis. The C terminus of PIP5Kγ661 is also reported to bind to the μ2 adapti"

Although conspicuous male traits are typically implicated with intersexual selection, there are examples where sex-specific displays play a role in an intrasexual context, e.g. when they serve as signals for aggression level and/or status. Here, we focus on the function of a conspicuous male ornament in the most species-rich tribe of cichlid fishes, the haplochromines. A characteristic feature of these ca. 1500 species are so-called egg-spots in form of ovoid markings on the anal fins of males, which are made up of carotenoid based pigment cells. It has long been assumed that these yellow, orange or reddish egg-spots play an important role in the courtship and spawning behavior of these maternal mouth-brooding fishes by mimicking the eggs of a conspecific female. The exact function of egg-spots remains unknown, however, and there are several hypotheses about their mode of action. To uncover the function of this cichlid-specific male ornament, we used female mate choice experiments and a male aggression test in the haplochromine species Astatotilapia burtoni. We manipulated the number and arrangement of egg-spots on the anal fins of males, or removed them entirely, and tested (1) female preference with visual contact only using egg-traps, (2) female preference with free contact using paternity testing with microsatellites and (3) male aggression. We found that females did not prefer males with many egg-spots over males with fewer egg-spots and that females tended to prefer males without egg-spots over males with egg-spots. Importantly, males without egg-spots sired clutches with the same fertilization rate as males with egg-spots. In male aggression trials, however, males with fewer egg-spots received significantly more attacks, suggesting that egg-spots are an important signal in intrasexual communication."
https://openalex.org/W2048353097,"In order to study oxidative stress in peripheral cells of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, immortalized lymphocytes derived from two peculiar cohorts of patients, referring to early onset AD (EOSAD) and subjects harboured AD related mutation (ADmut), were used. Oxidative stress was evaluated measuring i) the typical oxidative markers, such as HNE Michel adducts, 3 Nitro-Tyrosine residues and protein carbonyl on protein extracts, ii) and the antioxidant capacity, following the enzymatic kinetic of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRD). We found that the signs of oxidative stress, measured as oxidative marker levels, were evident only in ADmut but not in EOSAD patients. However, oxidative imbalance in EOSAD as well as ADmut lymphocytes was underlined by a reduced SOD activity and GRD activity in both pathological groups in comparison with cells derived from healthy subjects. Furthermore, a redox modulated p53 protein was found conformational altered in both EOSAD and ADmut B lymphocytes in comparison with control cells. This conformational altered p53 isoform, named “unfolded p53”, was recognized by the use of two specific conformational anti-p53 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation experiments, performed with the monoclonal antibodies PAb1620 (that recognizes p53wt) and PAb240 (that is direct towards unfolded p53), and followed by the immunoblotting with anti-4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and anti- 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) antibodies, showed a preferential increase of nitrated tyrosine residues in unfolded p53 isoform comparing to p53 wt protein, in both ADmut and EOSAD. In addition, a correlation between unfolded p53 and SOD activity was further found. Thus this study suggests that ROS/RNS contributed to change of p53 tertiary structure and that unfolded p53 can be considered as an early marker of oxidative imbalance in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2065534647,"Grading schemes for breast cancer diagnosis are predominantly based on pathologists' qualitative assessment of altered nuclear structure from 2D brightfield microscopy images. However, cells are three-dimensional (3D) objects with features that are inherently 3D and thus poorly characterized in 2D. Our goal is to quantitatively characterize nuclear structure in 3D, assess its variation with malignancy, and investigate whether such variation correlates with standard nuclear grading criteria.We applied micro-optical computed tomographic imaging and automated 3D nuclear morphometry to quantify and compare morphological variations between human cell lines derived from normal, benign fibrocystic or malignant breast epithelium. To reproduce the appearance and contrast in clinical cytopathology images, we stained cells with hematoxylin and eosin and obtained 3D images of 150 individual stained cells of each cell type at sub-micron, isotropic resolution. Applying volumetric image analyses, we computed 42 3D morphological and textural descriptors of cellular and nuclear structure.We observed four distinct nuclear shape categories, the predominant being a mushroom cap shape. Cell and nuclear volumes increased from normal to fibrocystic to metastatic type, but there was little difference in the volume ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm (N/C ratio) between the lines. Abnormal cell nuclei had more nucleoli, markedly higher density and clumpier chromatin organization compared to normal. Nuclei of non-tumorigenic, fibrocystic cells exhibited larger textural variations than metastatic cell nuclei. At p<0.0025 by ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, 90% of our computed descriptors statistically differentiated control from abnormal cell populations, but only 69% of these features statistically differentiated the fibrocystic from the metastatic cell populations.Our results provide a new perspective on nuclear structure variations associated with malignancy and point to the value of automated quantitative 3D nuclear morphometry as an objective tool to enable development of sensitive and specific nuclear grade classification in breast cancer diagnosis."

Design We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 503 Japanese patients who commenced on either tenofovir- or abacavir-based initial ART. Methods The incidence of renal dysfunction, defined as more than 25% fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the baseline, was determined in each group. The effect of tenofovir on renal dysfunction was estimated by univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models as the primary exposure. Changes in eGFR until 96 weeks were estimated in both groups with a repeated measures mixed model. Results The median body weight of the cohort was 64 kg. The estimated incidence of renal dysfunction in the tenofovir and the abacavir arm was 9.84 per 100 and 4.55 per 100 person-years, respectively. Tenofovir was significantly associated with renal dysfunction by univariate and multivariate analysis (HR = 1.747; 95% CI, 1.152–2.648; p = 0.009) (adjusted HR = 2.080; 95% CI, 1.339–3.232; p<0.001). In subgroup analysis of the patients stratified by intertertile baseline body weight, the effect of tenofovir on renal dysfunction was more evident in patients with lower baseline body weight by multivariate analysis (≤60 kg: adjusted HR = 2.771; 95%CI, 1.494–5.139; p = 0.001) (61–68 kg: adjusted HR = 1.908; 95%CI, 0.764–4.768; p = 0.167) (>68 kg: adjusted HR = 0.997; 95%CI, 0.318–3.121; p = 0.995). The fall in eGFR was significantly greater in the tenofovir arm than the abacavir arm after starting ART (p = 0.003). Conclusion The incidence of renal dysfunction in low body weight patients treated with tenofovir was twice as high as those treated with abacavir. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients with small body weight especially those with baseline body weight <60 kg treated with tenofovir."
https://openalex.org/W2021600421,"Measures of dopamine-regulating proteins in somatodendritic regions are often used only as static indicators of neuron viability, overlooking the possible impact of somatodendritic dopamine (DA) signaling on behavior and the potential autonomy of DA regulation between somatodendritic and terminal field compartments. DA reuptake capacity is less in somatodendritic regions, possibly placing a greater burden on de novo DA biosynthesis within this compartment to maintain DA signaling. Therefore, regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity may be particularly critical for somatodendritic DA signaling. Phosphorylation of TH at ser31 or ser40 can increase activity, but their impact on L-DOPA biosynthesis in vivo is unknown. Thus, determining their relationship with L-DOPA tissue content could reveal a mechanism by which DA signaling is normally maintained. In Brown-Norway Fischer 344 F1 hybrid rats, we quantified TH phosphorylation versus L-DOPA accumulation. After inhibition of aromatic acid decarboxylase, L-DOPA tissue content per recovered TH protein was greatest in NAc, matched by differences in ser31, but not ser40, phosphorylation. The L-DOPA per catecholamine and DA turnover ratios were significantly greater in SN and VTA, suggesting greater reliance on de novo DA biosynthesis therein. These compartmental differences reflected an overall autonomy of DA regulation, as seen by decreased DA content in SN and VTA, but not in striatum or NAc, following short-term DA biosynthesis inhibition from local infusion of the TH inhibitor α-methyl-p-tyrosine, as well as in the long-term process of aging. Such data suggest ser31 phosphorylation plays a significant role in regulating TH activity in vivo, particularly in somatodendritic regions, which may have a greater reliance on de novo DA biosynthesis. Thus, to the extent that somatodendritic DA release affects behavior, TH regulation in the midbrain may be critical for DA bioavailability to influence behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2084522798,"Listening to music has been found to reduce acute and chronic pain. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood; however, emotion and cognitive mechanisms have been suggested to influence the analgesic effect of music. In this study we investigated the influence of familiarity, emotional and cognitive features, and cognitive style on music-induced analgesia. Forty-eight healthy participants were divided into three groups (empathizers, systemizers and balanced) and received acute pain induced by heat while listening to different sounds. Participants listened to unfamiliar Mozart music rated with high valence and low arousal, unfamiliar environmental sounds with similar valence and arousal as the music, an active distraction task (mental arithmetic) and a control, and rated the pain. Data showed that the active distraction led to significantly less pain than did the music or sounds. Both unfamiliar music and sounds reduced pain significantly when compared to the control condition; however, music was no more effective than sound to reduce pain. Furthermore, we found correlations between pain and emotion ratings. Finally, systemizers reported less pain during the mental arithmetic compared with the other two groups. These findings suggest that familiarity may be key in the influence of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of music-induced analgesia, and that cognitive styles may influence pain perception."
https://openalex.org/W2159220104,"Interpersonal violence in South Africa is the second highest contributor to the burden of disease after HIV/AIDS and 62% is estimated to be from intimate partner violence (IPV). This study aimed to evaluate how women experiencing IPV present in primary care, how often IPV is recognized by health care practitioners and what other diagnoses are made.At two urban and three rural community health centres, health practitioners were trained to screen all women for IPV over a period of up to 8 weeks. Medical records of 114 thus identified women were then examined and their reasons for encounter (RFE) and diagnoses over the previous 2-years were coded using the International Classification of Primary Care. Three focus group interviews were held with the practitioners and interviews with the facility managers to explore their experience of screening.IPV was previously recognized in 11 women (9.6%). Women presented with a variety of RFE that should raise the index of suspicion for IPV- headache, request for psychiatric medication, sleep disturbance, tiredness, assault, feeling anxious and depressed. Depression was the commonest diagnosis. Interviews identified key issues that prevented health practitioners from screening.This study demonstrated that recognition of women with IPV is very low in South African primary care and adds useful new information on how women present to ambulatory health services. These findings offer key cues that can be used to improve selective case finding for IPV in resource-poor settings. Universal screening was not supported by this study."
https://openalex.org/W1973082657,"1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) was reported to induce premature organismal aging in fibroblast growth factor-23 (Fgf23) and klotho deficient mice, which is of main interest as 1,25D3 supplementation of its precursor cholecalciferol is used in basic osteoporosis treatment. We wanted to know if 1,25D3 is able to modulate aging processes on a cellular level in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Effects of 100 nM 1,25D3 on hMSC were analyzed by cell proliferation and apoptosis assay, β-galactosidase staining, VDR and surface marker immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR of 1,25D3-responsive, quiescence- and replicative senescence-associated genes. 1,25D3 treatment significantly inhibited hMSC proliferation and apoptosis after 72 h and delayed the development of replicative senescence in long-term cultures according to β-galactosidase staining and P16 expression. Cell morphology changed from a fibroblast like appearance to broad and rounded shapes. Long term treatment did not induce lineage commitment in terms of osteogenic pathways but maintained their clonogenic capacity, their surface marker characteristics (expression of CD73, CD90, CD105) and their multipotency to develop towards the chondrogenic, adipogenic and osteogenic pathways. In conclusion, 1,25D3 delays replicative senescence in primary hMSC while the pro-aging effects seen in mouse models might mainly be due to elevated systemic phosphate levels, which propagate organismal aging."
https://openalex.org/W2091659606,"During the first trimester of human pregnancy, Natural Killer (NK) cells of the maternal uterine mucosa (e.g. decidua) have a unique phenotype and are involved in crucial physiological processes during pregnancy. We investigated whether modifications of the NK receptor repertoire occur during the first trimester of pregnancy. We found significantly decreased expression of KIR2DL1/S1 and KIR2DL2/L3/S2 receptors, NKp30 and NKp44 activatory receptors, and the CD85j (ILT-2) inhibitory receptor. We also observed significantly increased expression of the NKG2D activatory receptor at the decidual NK cell surface. By flow cytometry, we further highlighted an evolution of NK subsets between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation, with a shift from the KIR2DL1/S1+/KIR2DL2/L3/S2+ subset towards the double negative subset, coupled with a decrease of the CD85j+/NKG2D− subset in favour of the CD85j−/NKG2D+ subset. Furthermore, cell surface expression of NK receptor ligands, including CD85j and NKG2D ligands, has been characterized by flow cytometry on decidual immune CD14+ and CD3+ cells. HLA-G, the high affinity ligand of CD85j, was detected on both cell types. In contrast, NKG2D ligands ULBP-2 ULBP-3 and MICA/B were not expressed on CD14+ and CD3+ cells, however a variable expression of ULBP-1 was observed. The ligand expression of KIR2DL1/S1 and KIR2DL2/L3/S2 was also analyzed: the HLA-C molecule was expressed at a low level on some CD14+ cells whereas it was not detected on CD3+ cell surface. NK receptor ligands are known to be also expressed on the invading placental trophoblast cells. Thus, the phenotypic evolutions of decidual NK cells described in this present study may preserve their activation/inhibition balance during the first trimester of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2067535795,"The homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2-1 is essential for normal lung development and homeostasis. In lung tumors, it is considered a lineage survival oncogene and prognostic factor depending on its expression levels. The target genes directly bound by Nkx2-1, that could be the primary effectors of its functions in the different cellular contexts where it is expressed, are mostly unknown. In embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) mouse lung, epithelial cells expressing Nkx2-1 are predominantly expanding, and in E19.5 prenatal lungs, Nkx2-1-expressing cells are predominantly differentiating in preparation for birth. To evaluate Nkx2-1 regulated networks in these two cell contexts, we analyzed genome-wide binding of Nkx2-1 to DNA regulatory regions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by tiling array analysis, and intersected these data to expression data sets. We further determined expression patterns of Nkx2-1 developmental target genes in human lung tumors and correlated their expression levels to that of endogenous NKX2-1. In these studies we uncovered differential Nkx2-1 regulated networks in early and late lung development, and a direct function of Nkx2-1 in regulation of the cell cycle by controlling the expression of proliferation-related genes. New targets, validated in Nkx2-1 shRNA transduced cell lines, include E2f3, Cyclin B1, Cyclin B2, and c-Met. Expression levels of Nkx2-1 direct target genes identified in mouse development significantly correlate or anti-correlate to the levels of endogenous NKX2-1 in a dosage-dependent manner in multiple human lung tumor expression data sets, supporting alternative roles for Nkx2-1 as a transcriptional activator or repressor, and direct regulator of cell cycle progression in development and tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2079978416,"Memory performance in everyday life is often far from perfect and therefore needs to be monitored and controlled by metamemory evaluations, such as judgments of learning (JOLs). JOLs support monitoring for goal-directed modification of learning. Behavioral studies suggested retrieval processes as providing a basis for JOLs. Previous functional imaging research on JOLs found a dissociation between processes underlying memory prediction, located in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and actual encoding success, located in the medial temporal lobe. However, JOL-specific neural correlates could not be identified unequivocally, since JOLs were given simultaneously with encoding. Here, we aimed to identify the neurocognitive basis of JOLs, i.e., the cognitive processes and neural correlates of JOL, separate from initial encoding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we implemented a face-name paired associative design. In general, we found that actual memory success was associated with increased brain activation of the hippocampi bilaterally, whereas predicted memory success was accompanied by increased activation in mPFC, orbital frontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Masking brain activation during predicted memory success with activation during retrieval success revealed BOLD increases of the mPFC. Our findings indicate that JOLs actually incorporate retrieval processes."

A number of methods have been established to detect and quantify miRNA expression. However, method for high-throughput miRNA function detection is still lacking.We describe an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based microRNA (miRNA) sensor (Asensor) array for high-throughput functional miRNA profiling. Each Asensor contains a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and a firefly luciferase (Fluc) expression cassette to sense functional miRNA and to serve as an internal control respectively. Using this array, we acquired functional profiles of 115 miRNAs for 12 cell lines and found ""functional miRNA signatures"" for several specific cell lines. The activities of specific miRNAs including the let-7 family, miR-17-92 cluster, miR-221, and miR-222 in HEK 293 cells were compared with their expression levels determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). We also demonstrate two other practical applications of the array, including a comparison of the miRNA activity between HEK293 and HEK293T cells and the ability to monitor miRNA activity changes in K562 cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).Our approach has potential applications in the identification of cell types, the characterization of biological and pathological processes, and the evaluation of responses to interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1984580977,"Disruption of fronto-temporal connections involving the arcuate fasciculus (AF) may underlie language processing anomalies and psychotic features such as auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. No study to date has specifically investigated abnormalities of white matter integrity at particular loci along the AF as well as its regional lateralization in schizophrenia. We examined white matter changes (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), asymmetry indices) along the whole extent of the AF and their relationship with psychotic symptoms in 32 males with schizophrenia and 44 healthy males. Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping and Fiber Assignment Continuous Tracking were employed to characterize FA and AD along the geometric curve of the AF. Our results showed that patients with schizophrenia had lower FA in the frontal aspects of the left AF compared with healthy controls. Greater left FA and AD lateralization in the temporal segment of AF were associated with more severe positive psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. Disruption of white matter integrity of the left frontal AF and accentuation of normal left greater than right asymmetry of FA/AD in the temporal AF further support the notion of aberrant fronto-temporal connectivity in schizophrenia. AF pathology can affect corollary discharge of neural signals from frontal speech/motor initiation areas to suppress activity of auditory cortex that may influence psychotic phenomena such as auditory hallucinations and facilitate elaboration of delusional content."

In addition, specific histone modifications on nucleosomes positioned over the exons have been shown to correlate both positively and negatively with exon expression. Here, we trained a model of “IF … THEN …” rules to predict exon inclusion levels in a transcript from histone modification patterns. Furthermore, we showed that combinations of histone modifications, in particular those residing on nucleosomes preceding or succeeding the exon, are better predictors of exon inclusion levels than single modifications. The resulting model was evaluated with cross validation and had an average accuracy of 72% for 27% of the exons, which demonstrates that epigenetic signals substantially mark alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1981652419,"Visceral leishmaniasis is associated with atrophy and histological disorganization of splenic compartments. In this paper, we compared organized and disorganized splenic lymphoid tissue from dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum assessing the size of the white pulp compartments, the distribution of T, B and S100+ dendritic cells, using immunohistochemistry and morphometry and the expression of CCR7 and the cytokines, CXCL13, lymphotoxin (LT)-α, LT-β, CCL19, CCL21, TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ and TGF-β, using by real time RT-PCR. The lymphoid follicles and marginal zones were smaller (3.2 and 1.9 times, respectively; Mann-Whitney, P<0.02) in animals with disorganized splenic tissue in comparison to those with organized splenic lymphoid tissue. In spleens with disorganized lymphoid tissue, the numbers of T cells and S100+ dendritic cells were decreased in the follicles, and the numbers of B cells were reduced in both the follicles and marginal zones. CXCL13 mRNA expression was lower in animals with disorganized lymphoid tissue (0.5±0.4) compared to those with organized lymphoid tissue (2.7±2.9, both relative to 18S expression, P = 0.01). These changes in the spleen were associated with higher frequency of severe disease (7/12) in the animals with disorganized than in animals with organized (2/13, Chi-square, P = 0.01) splenic lymphoid tissue. The data presented herein suggest that natural infection with Leishmania infantum is associated with the impairment of follicular dendritic cells, CXCL13 expression, B cell migration and germinal center formation and associates these changes with severe clinical forms of visceral leishmaniasis. Furthermore the fact that this work uses dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum emphasizes the relevance of the data presented herein for the knowledge on the canine and human visceral leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2063363028,"Some enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) produce a type II heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-II) that activates adenylate cyclase in susceptible cells but is not neutralized by antisera against cholera toxin or type I heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-I). LT-I variants encoded by plasmids in ETEC from humans and pigs have amino acid sequences that are ≥ 95% identical. In contrast, LT-II toxins are chromosomally encoded and are much more diverse. Early studies characterized LT-IIa and LT-IIb variants, but a novel LT-IIc was reported recently. Here we characterized the LT-II encoding loci from 48 additional ETEC isolates. Two encoded LT-IIa, none encoded LT-IIb, and 46 encoded highly related variants of LT-IIc. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the predicted LT-IIc toxins encoded by these loci could be assigned to 6 subgroups. The loci corresponding to individual toxins within each subgroup had DNA sequences that were more than 99% identical. The LT-IIc subgroups appear to have arisen by multiple recombinational events between progenitor loci encoding LT-IIc1- and LT-IIc3-like variants. All loci from representative isolates encoding the LT-IIa, LT-IIb, and each subgroup of LT-IIc enterotoxins are preceded by highly-related genes that are between 80 and 93% identical to predicted phage lysozyme genes. DNA sequences immediately following the B genes differ considerably between toxin subgroups, but all are most closely related to genomic sequences found in predicted prophages. Together these data suggest that the LT-II loci are inserted into lambdoid type prophages that may or may not be infectious. These findings raise the possibility that production of LT-II enterotoxins by ETEC may be determined by phage conversion and may be activated by induction of prophage, in a manner similar to control of production of Shiga-like toxins by converting phages in isolates of enterohemmorhagic E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1988372189,"In higher eukaryotes, PAPS synthases are the only enzymes producing the essential sulphate-donor 3′-phospho-adenosine-5′-phosphosulphate (PAPS). Recently, PAPS synthases have been associated with several genetic diseases and retroviral infection. To improve our understanding of their pathobiological functions, we analysed the intracellular localisation of the two human PAPS synthases, PAPSS1 and PAPSS2. For both enzymes, we observed pronounced heterogeneity in their subcellular localisation. PAPSS1 was predominantly nuclear, whereas PAPSS2 localised mainly within the cytoplasm. Treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B had little effect on their localisation. However, a mutagenesis screen revealed an Arg-Arg motif at the kinase interface exhibiting export activity. Notably, both isoforms contain a conserved N-terminal basic Lys-Lys-Xaa-Lys motif indispensable for their nuclear localisation. This nuclear localisation signal was more efficient in PAPSS1 than in PAPSS2. The activities of the identified localisation signals were confirmed by microinjection studies. Collectively, we describe unusual localisation signals of both PAPS synthase isoforms, mobile enzymes capable of executing their function in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2083929048,"17β-estradiol (E2), the most potent estrogen in humans, known to be involved in the development and progession of estrogen-dependent diseases (EDD) like breast cancer and endometriosis. 17β-HSD1, which catalyses the reduction of the weak estrogen estrone (E1) to E2, is often overexpressed in breast cancer and endometriotic tissues. An inhibition of 17β-HSD1 could selectively reduce the local E2-level thus allowing for a novel, targeted approach in the treatment of EDD. Continuing our search for new nonsteroidal 17β-HSD1 inhibitors, a novel pharmacophore model was derived from crystallographic data and used for the virtual screening of a small library of compounds. Subsequent experimental verification of the virtual hits led to the identification of the moderately active compound 5. Rigidification and further structure modifications resulted in the discovery of a novel class of 17β-HSD1 inhibitors bearing a benzothiazole-scaffold linked to a phenyl ring via keto- or amide-bridge. Their putative binding modes were investigated by correlating their biological data with features of the pharmacophore model. The most active keto-derivative 6 shows IC50-values in the nanomolar range for the transformation of E1 to E2 by 17β-HSD1, reasonable selectivity against 17β-HSD2 but pronounced affinity to the estrogen receptors (ERs). On the other hand, the best amide-derivative 21 shows only medium 17β-HSD1 inhibitory activity at the target enzyme as well as fair selectivity against 17β-HSD2 and ERs. The compounds 6 and 21 can be regarded as first benzothiazole-type 17β-HSD1 inhibitors for the development of potential therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2047200270,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, mainly at mRNA post-transcriptional level. Functional maturation of most miRNAs requires processing of the primary transcript by Dicer, an RNaseIII-type enzyme. To date, the importance of miRNA function for normal organogenesis has been demonstrated in several mouse models of tissue-specific Dicer inactivation. However, the role of miRNAs in thyroid development has not yet been addressed. For the present study, we generated mouse models in which Dicer expression has been inactivated at two different stages of thyroid development in thyroid follicular cells. Regardless of the time of Dicer invalidation, the early stages of thyroid organogenesis, preceding folliculogenesis, were unaffected by the loss of small RNAs, with a bilobate gland in place. Nevertheless, Dicer mutant mice were severely hypothyroid and died soon after weaning unless they were substituted with T4. A conspicuous follicular disorganization was observed in Dicer mutant thyroids together with a strong down regulation of Nis expression. With increasing age, the thyroid tissue showed characteristics of neoplastic alterations as suggested by a marked proliferation of follicular cells and an ongoing de-differentiation in the center of the thyroid gland, with a loss of Pax8, FoxE1, Nis and Tpo expression. Together, our data show that loss of miRNA maturation due to Dicer inactivation severely disturbs functional thyroid differentiation. This suggests that miRNAs are mandatory to fine-tune the expression of thyroid specific genes and to maintain thyroid tissue homeostasis."

In contrast, RDR2, but not RDR6, is required for DNA methylation and TGS mediated by 24-nt siRNAs, and for cell-to-cell spreading of IR-PTGS mediated by 21-nt siRNAs produced by inverted repeat transgenes under the control of a phloem-specific promoter.In this study, we examined the role of RDR2 and RDR6 in S-PTGS. Unlike RDR6, RDR2 is not required for DNA methylation of transgenes subjected to S-PTGS. RDR6 is essential for the production of siRNAs by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS, but RDR2 also contributes to the production of transgene siRNAs when RDR6 is present because rdr2 mutations reduce transgene siRNA accumulation. However, the siRNAs produced via RDR2 likely are counteractive in wildtype plants because impairement of RDR2 increases S-PTGS efficiency at a transgenic locus that triggers limited silencing, and accelerates S-PTGS at a transgenic locus that triggers efficient silencing.These results suggest that RDR2 and RDR6 compete for RNA substrates produced by transgenes subjected to S-PTGS. RDR2 partially antagonizes RDR6 because RDR2 action likely results in the production of counteractive siRNA. As a result, S-PTGS efficiency is increased in rdr2 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2056762324,"Background Since the implementation of the 2002 Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act, point-of-sale (PoS) tobacco displays are one of few remaining means of communication between the tobacco industry and customers in the UK. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of tobacco displays in a UK city, and particularly to assess the tobacco prices and promotional offers, types and pack sizes on display. Methods Digital pictures of PoS displays were taken in 117 small retail shops in Nottingham in mid 2010. Data were analysed using Windows Photo Gallery software and SPSS version 16. Results Just over half (52%) of cigarette packs on display were packs of 20, and 43% packs of 10. Cigarette prices differed substantially between brands, ranging from £4.19 to £6.85 for 20-packs, and from £2.12 to £3.59 for 10-packs. Forty four percent of cigarette packs and 40% of RYO (Roll-Your-Own) tobacco pouches, almost exclusively lower priced brands, were displayed with a pricemark, implying a promotional price offer. Eighty percent of 20-pack cigarette brand or brand variants on sale were priced below the EU-defined Most Popular Price Category (MPPC) for the UK in 2010; 45% were priced below the Weighted Average Price (WAP), which replaced the MPPC in 2011. Conclusion PoS displays communicate value by displaying a high proportion of lower cost brands, and smaller and hence lower-cost packs, and by displaying price discounts on packs. The MPPC substantially overestimated the prices at which most 20-cigarette packs were available. Removal of PoS displays will prevent this means of price marketing but our study also suggests that minimum pricing of 20-pack cigarettes, prohibition of sale of cigarettes in packs less than 20, and plain packaging to prevent pricemarking are necessary if price is to be used effectively as a tobacco control measure."
https://openalex.org/W2130671494,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 have been shown to mediate the metastasis of many malignant tumors including breast carcinoma. Interaction between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the Met receptor tyrosine kinase mediates development and progression of cancers. HGF is able to induce CXCR4 expression and contributes to tumor cell invasiveness in breast carcinoma. However, the mechanism of the CXCR4 expression modulated by c-Met-HGF axis to enhance the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells is still unclear. In this study, we found that HGF induced functional CXCR4 receptor expression in breast cancer cells. The effect of HGF was specifically mediated by PKCζ activity. After transfection with PKCζ-siRNA, the phosphorylation of PKCζ and CXCR4 was abrogated in breast cancer cells. Interference with the activation of Rac1, a downstream target of HGF, prevented the HGF-induced increase in PKCζ activity and CXCR4 levels. The HGF-induced, LY294002-sensitive translocation of PKCζ from cytosol to plasma membrane indicated that HGF was capable of activating PKCζ, probably via phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases. HGF treatment also increased MT1-MMP secretion. Inhibition of PKCζ, Rac-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may attenuate MT1-MMP expression in cells exposed to HGF. Functional manifestation of the effects of HGF revealed an increased ability for migration, chemotaxis and metastasis in MDA-MB-436 cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings thus provided evidence that the process of HGF-induced functional CXCR4 expression may involve PI 3-kinase and atypical PKCζ. Moreover, HGF may promote the invasiveness and metastasis of breast tumor xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice via the PKCζ-mediated pathway, while suppression of PKCζ by RNA interference may abrogate cancer cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W1971284833,"Identifying gene-gene interactions or gene-environment interactions in studies of human complex diseases remains a big challenge in genetic epidemiology. An additional challenge, often forgotten, is to account for important lower-order genetic effects. These may hamper the identification of genuine epistasis. If lower-order genetic effects contribute to the genetic variance of a trait, identified statistical interactions may simply be due to a signal boost of these effects. In this study, we restrict attention to quantitative traits and bi-allelic SNPs as genetic markers. Moreover, our interaction study focuses on 2-way SNP-SNP interactions. Via simulations, we assess the performance of different corrective measures for lower-order genetic effects in Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction epistasis detection, using additive and co-dominant coding schemes. Performance is evaluated in terms of power and familywise error rate. Our simulations indicate that empirical power estimates are reduced with correction of lower-order effects, likewise familywise error rates. Easy-to-use automatic SNP selection procedures, SNP selection based on ""top"" findings, or SNP selection based on p-value criterion for interesting main effects result in reduced power but also almost zero false positive rates. Always accounting for main effects in the SNP-SNP pair under investigation during Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis adequately controls false positive epistasis findings. This is particularly true when adopting a co-dominant corrective coding scheme. In conclusion, automatic search procedures to identify lower-order effects to correct for during epistasis screening should be avoided. The same is true for procedures that adjust for lower-order effects prior to Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction and involve using residuals as the new trait. We advocate using ""on-the-fly"" lower-order effects adjusting when screening for SNP-SNP interactions using Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2004040468,"Background Despite the increasing worldwide use of global positioning system (GPS) telemetry in wildlife research, it has never been tested on any freshwater diving animal or in the peculiar conditions of the riparian habitat, despite this latter being one of the most important habitat types for many animal taxa. Moreover, in most cases, the GPS devices used have been commercial and expensive, limiting their use in low-budget projects. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a low-cost, easily constructed GPS GSM/GPRS (Global System for Mobile Communications/General Packet Radio Service) and examined its performance in stationary tests, by assessing the influence of different habitat types, including the riparian, as well as water submersion and certain climatic and environmental variables on GPS fix-success rate and accuracy. We then tested the GPS on wild diving animals, applying it, for the first time, to an otter species (Lutra lutra). The rate of locations acquired during the stationary tests reached 63.2%, with an average location error of 8.94 m (SD = 8.55). GPS performance in riparian habitats was principally affected by water submersion and secondarily by GPS inclination and position within the riverbed. Temporal and spatial correlations of location estimates accounted for some variation in the data sets. GPS-tagged otters also provided accurate locations and an even higher GPS fix-success rate (68.2%). Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that GPS telemetry is reliably applicable to riparian and even diving freshwater animals. They also highlight the need, in GPS wildlife studies, for performing site-specific pilot studies on GPS functioning as well as for taking into account eventual spatial and temporal correlation of location estimates. The limited price, small dimensions, and high performance of the device presented here make it a useful and cost-effective tool for studies on otters and other aquatic or terrestrial medium-to-large-sized animals."
https://openalex.org/W2037317357,"Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) is the second most common type of all long QT syndromes. It is well-known that trafficking deficient mutant human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) proteins are often involved in LQT2. Cells respond to misfolded and trafficking-deficient proteins by eliciting the unfolded protein response (UPR) and Activating Transcription Factor (ATF6) has been identified as a key regulator of the mammalian UPR. In this study, we investigated the role of ER chaperone proteins (Calnexin and Calreticulin) in the processing of G572R-hERG and E637K-hERG mutant proteins.pcDNA3-WT-hERG, pcDNA3-G572R-hERG and pcDNA3-E637K-hERG plasmids were transfected into U2OS and HEK293 cells. Confocal microscopy and western blotting were used to analyze subcellular localization and protein expression. Interaction between WT or mutant hERGs and Calnexin/Calreticulin was tested by coimmunoprecipitation. To assess the role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the degradation of mutant hERG proteins, transfected HEK293 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors and their effects on the steady state protein levels of WT and mutant hERGs were examined.Our results showed that levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of G572R-hERG and E637K-hERG in association with Calnexin and Calreticulin were higher than that in WT-hERG. Both mutant hERG proteins could activate the UPR by upregulating levels of active ATF6. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition increased the levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of WT and mutant hERGs. In addition, interaction between mutant hERGs and Calnexin/Calreticulin was stronger after proteasome inhibition, compared to WT-hERG. These results suggest that trafficking-deficient G572R-hERG and E637K-hERG mutant proteins can activate ER stress pathways and are targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Calnexin and Calreticulin play important roles in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W1998527528,"The developing retinotectal system of the Xenopus laevis tadpole is a model of choice for studying visual experience-dependent circuit maturation in the intact animal. The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been shown to play a critical role in the formation of sensory circuits in this preparation, however a comprehensive neuroanatomical study of GABAergic cell distribution in the developing tadpole has not been conducted. We report a detailed description of the spatial expression of GABA immunoreactivity in the Xenopus laevis tadpole brain at two key developmental stages: stage 40/42 around the onset of retinotectal innervation and stage 47 when the retinotectal circuit supports visually-guided behavior. During this period, GABAergic neurons within specific brain structures appeared to redistribute from clusters of neuronal somata to a sparser, more uniform distribution. Furthermore, we found that GABA levels were regulated by recent sensory experience. Both ELISA measurements of GABA concentration and quantitative analysis of GABA immunoreactivity in tissue sections from the optic tectum show that GABA increased in response to a 4 hr period of enhanced visual stimulation in stage 47 tadpoles. These observations reveal a remarkable degree of adaptability of GABAergic neurons in the developing brain, consistent with their key contributions to circuit development and function."
https://openalex.org/W1979083010,"The Genetic screened homeobox 2 (Gsx2) transcription factor is required for the development of olfactory bulb (OB) and striatal neurons, and for the regional specification of the embryonic telencephalon. Although Gsx2 is expressed abundantly by progenitor cells in the ventral telencephalon, its precise function in the generation of neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs) is not clear. Similarly, the role of Gsx2 in regulating the self-renewal and multipotentiality of NSCs has been little explored. Using retroviral vectors to express Gsx2, we have studied the effect of Gsx2 on the growth of NSCs isolated from the OB and ganglionic eminences (GE), as well as its influence on the proliferation and cell fate of progenitors in the postnatal mouse OB. Expression of Gsx2 reduces proliferation and the self-renewal capacity of NSCs, without significantly affecting cell death. Furthermore, Gsx2 overexpression decreases the differentiation of NSCs into neurons and glia, and it maintains the cells that do not differentiate as cycling progenitors. These effects were stronger in GESCs than in OBSCs, indicating that the actions of Gsx2 are cell-dependent. In vivo, Gsx2 produces a decrease in the number of Pax6+ cells and doublecortin+ neuroblasts, and an increase in Olig2+ cells. In summary, our findings show that Gsx2 inhibits the ability of NSCs to proliferate and self-renew, as well as the capacity of NSC-derived progenitors to differentiate, suggesting that this transcription factor regulates the quiescent and undifferentiated state of NSCs and progenitors. Furthermore, our data indicate that Gsx2 negatively regulates neurogenesis from postnatal progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004618394,"Although genetic variation among humans in their susceptibility to infectious diseases has long been appreciated, little focus has been devoted to identifying patterns in levels of variation in susceptibility to different diseases. Levels of genetic variation in susceptibility associated with 40 human infectious diseases were assessed by a survey of studies on both pedigree-based quantitative variation, as well as studies on different classes of marker alleles. These estimates were correlated with pathogen traits, epidemiological characteristics, and effectiveness of the human immune response. The strongest predictors of levels of genetic variation in susceptibility were disease characteristics negatively associated with immune effectiveness. High levels of genetic variation were associated with diseases with long infectious periods and for which vaccine development attempts have been unsuccessful. These findings are consistent with predictions based on theoretical models incorporating fitness costs associated with the different types of resistance mechanisms. An appreciation of these observed patterns will be a valuable tool in directing future research given that genetic variation in disease susceptibility has large implications for vaccine development and epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2126681180,"Malaria has had the largest impact of any infectious disease on shaping the human genome, exerting enormous selective pressure on genes that improve survival in severe malaria infections. Modern humans originated in Africa and lost skin melanization as they migrated to temperate regions of the globe. Although it is well documented that loss of melanization improved cutaneous Vitamin D synthesis, melanin plays an evolutionary ancient role in insect immunity to malaria and in some instances melanin has been implicated to play an immunoregulatory role in vertebrates. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that melanization may be protective in malaria infections using mouse models. Congenic C57BL/6 mice that differed only in the gene encoding tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin, showed no difference in the clinical course of infection by Plasmodium yoelii 17XL, that causes severe anemia, Plasmodium berghei ANKA, that causes severe cerebral malaria or Plasmodium chabaudi AS that causes uncomplicated chronic disease. Moreover, neither genetic deficiencies in vitamin D synthesis nor vitamin D supplementation had an effect on survival in cerebral malaria. Taken together, these results indicate that neither melanin nor vitamin D production improve survival in severe malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2028678619,"When skeletal muscles are activated and mechanically shortened, the force that is produced by the muscle fibers decreases in two phases, marked by two changes in slope (P₁ and P₂) that happen at specific lengths (L₁ and L₂). We tested the hypothesis that these force transients are determined by the amount of myosin cross-bridges attached to actin and by changes in cross-bridge strain due to a changing fraction of cross-bridges in the pre-power-stroke state. Three separate experiments were performed, using skinned muscle fibers that were isolated and subsequently (i) activated at different Ca²⁺ concentrations (pCa²⁺ 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0) (n = 13), (ii) activated in the presence of blebbistatin (n = 16), and (iii) activated in the presence of blebbistatin at varying velocities (n = 5). In all experiments, a ramp shortening was imposed (amplitude 10%L₀, velocity 1 L₀•sarcomere length (SL)•s⁻¹), from an initial SL of 2.5 µm (except by the third group, in which velocities ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 L₀•s⁻¹). The values of P₁, P₂, L₁, and L₂ did not change with Ca²⁺ concentrations. Blebbistatin decreased P₁, and it did not alter P₂, L₁, and L₂. We developed a mathematical cross-bridge model comprising a load-dependent power-stroke transition and a pre-power-stroke cross-bridge state. The P₁ and P₂ critical points as well as the critical lengths L₁ and L₂ were explained qualitatively by the model, and the effects of blebbistatin inhibition on P₁ were also predicted. Furthermore, the results of the model suggest that the mechanism by which blebbistatin inhibits force is by interfering with the closing of the myosin upper binding cleft, biasing cross-bridges into a pre-power-stroke state."
https://openalex.org/W2088681815,"Atherosclerosis is responsible for the death of thousands of Americans each year. The carotid constriction model of plaque development has recently been presented as a model for unstable plaque formation in mice. In this study we 1) validate ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) for the determination of carotid plaque size, percent stenosis, and plaque development in live animals, 2) determine the sensitivity of UBM in detecting changes in blood flow induced by carotid constriction and 3) test whether plaque formation can be predicted from blood flow parameters measured by UBM. Carotid plaques were induced by surgical constriction in Apo E−/− mice. Arteries were imaged bi-weekly by UBM, at which time PW-Doppler measurements of proximal blood flow, as well as plaque length and percent stenosis were determined. Histology was performed 9 weeks post surgery. When compared to whole mount post-mortem measurements, UBM accurately reported carotid plaque length. Percent stenosis, based on transverse B-mode UBM measurements, correlated well with that calculated from histological sections. PW-Doppler revealed that constriction reduced maximum systolic velocity (vmax) and duration of the systolic velocity peak (ts/tt). Pre-plaque (2 week post-surgery) PW-Doppler parameters (vmax and ts/tt) were correlated with plaque length at 9 weeks, and were predictive of plaque formation. Correlation of initiating PW-Doppler parameters (vmax and ts/tt) with resulting plaque length established the degree of flow disturbance required for subsequent plaque development and demonstrated its power for predicting plaque development."
https://openalex.org/W2048015966,"It is well known that familial sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is caused by functional alterations of ion channels and gap junction. Limited information is available on the mechanism of age-related non-familial SSS. Although evidence shows a close link between arrhythmia and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), it remains to be determined whether the RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of non-familial SSS.In this study, 113 patients with documented non-familial SSS and 125 controls were screened for angiotensinogen (AGT) and gap junction protein-connexin 40 (Cx40) promoter polymorphisms by gene sequencing, followed by an association study. A luciferase assay was used to determine the transcriptional activity of the promoter polymorphism. The interaction between nuclear factors and the promoter polymorphism was characterized by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).Association study showed the Cx40 -44/+71 polymorphisms are not associated with non-familial SSS; however, it indicated that four polymorphic sites at positions -6, -20, -152, and -217 in the AGT promoter are linked to non-familial SSS. Compared to controls, SSS patients had a lower frequency of the G-6A AA genotype (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.58-5.22, P = 0.001) and a higher frequency of the G allele at -6 position (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.54-4.57, P = 0.0003). EMSA and luciferase assays confirmed that nucleotide G at position -6 modulates the binding affinity with nuclear factors and yields a lower transcriptional activity than nucleotide A (P<0.01).G-6A polymorphism, which modulates the transcriptional activity of the AGT promoter, may contribute to non-familial SSS susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2041458201,"Mucin depleted foci (MDF) are precancerous lesions of the colon in carcinogen-treated rodents and humans at high risk. Since MDF show signs of inflammation we hypothesized that the defective mucous production would expose them to the risk of being penetrated by intestinal bacteria, which can be sensed by Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) and activate inflammatory pathways. To verify this hypothesis we tested the expression of 84 genes coding for Tlrs and associated pathways using RT-qPCR in MDF (n = 7) from 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-treated rats. Among the 84 tested genes, 26 were differentially expressed in MDF with 5 genes significantly up-regulated and 21 down-regulated when compared to the normal mucosa. Tlr2, as well as other downstream genes (Map4k4, Hspd1, Irak1, Ube2n), was significantly up-regulated. Among the genes regulating the NFkB pathway, only Map4k4 was significantly up-regulated, while 19 genes were not varied and 6 were down-regulated. Tlr2 protein was weakly expressed both in normal mucosa and MDF. To determine whether inflammation observed in MDF could be caused by bacteria contacting or infiltrating crypts, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with a rRNA universal bacterial probe. None of the 21 MDF tested, showed bacteria inside the crypts, while among the colonic tumors (n = 15), only one had very few bacteria on the surface and on the surrounding normal mucosa. In conclusion, the up-regulation of Tlr2 in MDF, suggests a link between this receptor and carcinogenesis, possibly related to a defective barrier function of these lesions. The data of FISH experiments do not support the hypothesis that inflammation in MDF and tumors is stimulated by bacterial infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W2075226074,"Methamphetamine is one of the fastest growing illicit drugs worldwide, causing multiple organ damage and excessive natural deaths. The authors aimed to identify potential laboratory indices and clinical characteristics associated with natural death through a two-phase study.Methamphetamine-dependent patients (n = 1,254) admitted to a psychiatric center in Taiwan between 1990 and 2007 were linked with a national mortality database for causes of death. Forty-eight subjects died of natural causes, and were defined as the case subjects. A time-efficient sex- and age-matched nested case-control study derived from the cohort was conducted first to explore the potential factors associated with natural death through a time-consuming standardized review of medical records. Then the identified potential factors were evaluated in the whole cohort to validate the findings.In phase I, several potential factors associated with natural death were identified, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), comorbid alcohol use disorder, and the prescription of antipsychotic drugs. In phase II, these factors were confirmed in the whole cohort using survival analysis. For the characteristics at the latest hospital admission, Cox proportional hazards models showed that the adjusted hazard ratios for natural death were 6.75 (p<0.001) in the group with markedly elevated AST (>80 U/L) and 2.66 (p<0.05) in the group with mildly elevated AST (40-80 U/L), with reference to the control group (<40 U/L). As for ALT, the adjusted hazard ratios were 5.41 (p<0.001), and 1.44 (p>0.05). Comorbid alcohol use disorder was associated with an increased risk of natural death, whereas administration of antipsychotic drugs was not associated with lowered risk.This study highlights the necessity of intensive follow-up for those with elevated AST and ALT levels and comorbid alcohol use disorder for preventing excessive natural deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2040869434,"Background Intentional forgetting refers to the surprising phenomenon that we can forget previously successfully encoded memories if we are instructed to do so. Here, we show that participants cannot only intentionally forget episodic memories but they can also mirror the “forgetting performance” of an observed model. Methodology/Principal Findings In four experiments a participant observed a model who took part in a memory experiment. In Experiment 1 and 2 observers saw a movie about the experiment, whereas in Experiment 3 and 4 the observers and the models took part together in a real laboratory experiment. The observed memory experiment was a directed forgetting experiment where the models learned two lists of items and were instructed either to forget or to remember the first list. In Experiment 1 and 3 observers were instructed to simply observe the experiment (“simple observation” instruction). In Experiment 2 and 4, observers received instructions aimed to induce the same learning goal for the observers and the models (“observation with goal-sharing” instruction). A directed forgetting effect (the reliably lower recall of to-be-forgotten items) emerged only when models received the “observation with goal-sharing” instruction (P<.001 in Experiment 2, and P<.05 in Experiment 4), and it was absent when observers received the “simple observation” instruction (P>.1 in Experiment 1 and 3). Conclusion If people observe another person with the same intention to learn, and see that this person is instructed to forget previously studied information, then they will produce the same intentional forgetting effect as the person they observed. This seems to be a an important aspect of human learning: if we can understand the goal of an observed person and this is in line with our behavioural goals then our learning performance will mirror the learning performance of the model."
https://openalex.org/W1559305849,"Complex network dynamics have been analyzed with models of systems of coupled switches or systems of coupled oscillators. However, many complex systems are composed of components with diverse dynamics whose interactions drive the system's evolution. We, therefore, introduce a new modeling framework that describes the dynamics of networks composed of both oscillators and switches. Both oscillator synchronization and switch stability are preserved in these heterogeneous, coupled networks. Furthermore, this model recapitulates the qualitative dynamics for the yeast cell cycle consistent with the hypothesized dynamics resulting from decomposition of the regulatory network into dynamic motifs. Introducing feedback into the cell-cycle network induces qualitative dynamics analogous to limitless replicative potential that is a hallmark of cancer. As a result, the proposed model of switch and oscillator coupling provides the ability to incorporate mechanisms that underlie the synchronized stimulus response ubiquitous in biochemical systems."
