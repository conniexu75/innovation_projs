https://openalex.org/W1976605764,"In principle, the temporal beating of superposed high harmonics obtained by focusing a femtosecond laser pulse in a gas jet can produce a train of very short intensity spikes, depending on the relative phases of the harmonics. We present a method to measure such phases through two-photon, two-color photoionization. We found that the harmonics are locked in phase and form a train of 250-attosecond pulses in the time domain. Harmonic generation may be a promising source for attosecond time-resolved measurements."

However, previous YFPs show excessive pH sensitivity, chloride interference, poor photostability, or poor expression at 37 °C. Protein evolution in Escherichia coli has produced a new YFP named Citrine, in which the mutation Q69M confers a much lower pK a (5.7) than for previous YFPs, indifference to chloride, twice the photostability of previous YFPs, and much better expression at 37 °C and in organelles. The halide resistance is explained by a 2.2-Å x-ray crystal structure of Citrine, showing that the methionine side chain fills what was once a large halide-binding cavity adjacent to the chromophore. Insertion of calmodulin within Citrine or fusion of cyan fluorescent protein, calmodulin, a calmodulin-binding peptide and Citrine has generated improved calcium indicators. These chimeras can be targeted to multiple cellular locations and have permitted the first single-cell imaging of free [Ca2+] in the Golgi. Citrine is superior to all previous YFPs except when pH or halide sensitivity is desired and is particularly advantageous within genetically encoded fluorescent indicators of physiological signals.

These sensitivities can be exploited for specialized applications such as measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and sensing pH and halide concentrations, but are deleterious for using YFPs either as simple fusion tags or as acceptors for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). YFPs are becoming very popular in such roles, particularly as partners for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) mutants of GFP (2Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar, 5Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Tsien R.Y.

CFPs and YFPs are spectroscopically well enough separated to be easily distinguishable in either excitation or emission spectra, yet the emission wavelengths of CFPs and excitation wavelengths of YFPs overlap well enough to make them good partners for FRET. They have largely superseded the initial pairing of blue mutants and improved green forms of GFP (16Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), because the blue mutants were too dim and photobleachable, and because shorter wavelengths generically excite more autofluorescence and raise more concerns of phototoxicity. Measurements of FRET between CFP and YFP are becoming increasingly common to monitor protein-protein interactions nondestructively in live cells (5Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Tsien R.Y. Miyawaki A. Science. 1998; 280: 1954-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17Zacharias D.A.

Because FRET requires that the CFP and YFP be within a few nanameters of each other, it can detect proximity at molecular dimensions, with 2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than simple co-localization of the two colors. This approach has been used to monitor interactions of nuclear receptors and coactivators (18Llopis J. Westin S. Ricote M. Wang J. Cho C.Y. Kurokawa R. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Tsien R.Y. Glass C.K.

Genetically encoded indicators offer the major advantages of versatile and modular construction, applicability to intact transgenic organisms, and precise targetability to specific tissues, organelles, and subcellular microenvironments. These advantages are particularly important for Ca2+ indicators, which have been the subject of more effort than any of the other indicator classes. Both ratiometric and non-ratiometric indicators of Ca2+ have been constructed from CFP, GFP, or YFP (2Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar) as fluorophores and calmodulin as calcium binding moiety in several configurations. In cameleons (26Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar), an N-terminal CFP is fused to calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13 from myosin light chain kinase, and a C-terminal YFP. Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin leads to a conformational change that enhances the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the shorter wavelength emitting CFP to the longer wavelength emitting YFP. Subsequent modifications in the YFP acceptor protein led to improved cameleons with decreased sensitivity to cytosolic pH changes (8Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The YFP portion of these improved cameleons (termed EYFP V68L/Q69K) had a pK a of 6.1, rendering it largely insensitive to pH changes near neutrality. However, due to poor folding at 37 °C, specific targeting was hard to achieve. In a different approach, calmodulin was directly inserted into the backbone of YFP in place of Tyr145 to generate a medium affinity Ca2+ indicator termed camgaroo-1 that increased fluorescence intensity ∼8-fold upon saturation with Ca2+(34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). A problem with this non-ratiometric indicator was that the fluorescence of the indicator in transfected cells at resting Ca2+ levels was almost zero, making it difficult to identify transfected cells for experiments. Also, the protein did not express well at 37 °C. In an effort to overcome these problems, we undertook an expression screen in Escherichia coli and identified an improved mutant of YFP, consisting of GFP with mutations S65G/V68L/Q69M/S72A/T203Y. For brevity we have named this mutation Citrine to reflect its yellow color and acid resistance. Citrine folds well at 37 °C, can be targeted to subcellular compartments, and has a pK a of 5.7. Some aspects of the photophysics of Citrine, including two-photon spectra, light-driven flickering, excitation state decay kinetics, and translational and rotational diffusion were recently described (35Heikal A.A. Hess S.T. Baird G.S. Tsien R.Y. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11996-12001Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but these measurements were wholly in vitro, did not document the superiority of Citrine over previous YFPs, and did not explain why the Q69M mutation conferred beneficial properties. Using Citrine, we have now constructed new genetic indicators of cellular Ca2+ dynamics and assessed their properties with respect to pH interference, folding, and targeting in mammalian cells. In addition, we have determined the 2.2-Å x-ray structure of Citrine and propose a structural explanation for the various improvements conferred upon Citrine by the Q69M mutation. cDNA encoding camgaroo-1 (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) in the vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) was subjected to error-prone PCR using Taq polymerase. The 5′ primer included a BamHI site and ended at the starting Met of the GFP, and the 3′ primer included an EcoRI site and ended at the stop codon, theoretically allowing mutagenesis of every base of camgaroo-1 other than Met1. The PCR (38 cycles with annealing at 55 °C) was run in four 100-µl batches, each containing 10 µl of 10 × PCR buffer with Mg2+ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 150 µm Mn2+, 250 µm of three nucleotides, 50 µm of the remaining nucleotide, and 5 ng of template. Mutagenic PCR products were combined, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and repurified by QiaQuick columns (Qiagen). The resulting fragment was ligated into pRSETB, and the crude ligation mixture was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) Gold (Stratagene) by electroporation. Bacteria plated on LB/agar plates were imaged as described (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), and colonies that became fluorescent after overnight incubation at 37 °C were grown in liquid culture and the plasmid DNA obtained by Miniprep (Qiagen). Protein was expressed and purified as previously described (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy of purified protein was typically performed in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.25, in a fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog-2, Spex Industries). pH titrations were performed as described (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). All DNA sequencing was performed by the Molecular Pathology Shared Resource, University of California, San Diego, Cancer Center. Mutations Q69M (Citrine), C48L, and C70V were introduced into EYFP V68L/Q69K by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). To generate yellow cameleon-2.3 (YC2.3) and YC3.3, Citrine was inserted into the previously described cameleons YC2 and YC3 (26Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) in the cloning vector pUC119, and then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was achieved by the calreticulin signal peptide and the KDEL ER-retention sequence (36Kendall J.M. Dormer R.L. Campbell A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Targeting to the medial/trans-Golgi was achieved using the type II membrane-anchored protein galactosyltransferase (GT), which has been used to target GFP to this organelle (6Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial targeting of camgaroo-2 was achieved by replacing ECFP with the camgaroo-2 coding sequence in the pECFP-Mito vector (CLONTECH), which uses the targeting sequence of subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase. In order to evaluate targeted expression of YFP mutants, identical amounts of DNA (20 µg) of EYFP V68L/Q69K-ER, Citrine-ER, or Citrine C48L/C70V-ER in pcDNA3 were transfected into HeLa cells (3 × 105 per 35-mm dish) with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 days of expression cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced saline solution, normalized atA 600, and measured in the fluorescence spectrometer. Single HeLa cells were imaged with a charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) as described (26Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) at room temperature 1–5 days after transfection. The excitation filter for ratiometric imaging was 440DF10 with a 455DCLP dichroic mirror. The emission filters were 480DF30 (CFP) or 535DF25 (Citrine). Experiments were processed digitally using Metafluor software version 2.75 or 4.01 (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). For imaging camgaroo-2, a 480DF30 excitation filter was used in combination with a fluorescein dichroic mirror and emission filter 535DF25. Citrine in vector pRSETB was expressed in E. coli JM109(DE3) and the protein purified as previously described (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Following enterokinase (Invitrogen) catalyzed proteolysis of the 6-His tag, 1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added to bind residual uncleaved protein and 6-His peptides and the solution was gently agitated (4 °C for 2 h). Agarose resin was removed by filtration and the protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml with a Micron-30 (Amicon). Citrine was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C by addition of equal volumes of protein and crystallization buffer (7% PEG 3400, 50 mm NH4OAc, 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0). Crystals were visible after 3–4 days and grew to ∼0.5 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm within 14 days. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 52.50 Å,b = 61.76 Å, and c = 70.68 Å and one monomer per asymmetric unit. X-ray intensity data on a single crystal were collected at room temperature on a Mar 345 image plate detector (Mar Research) with a multilayer mirror monochromated CuKα beam from a Rigaku FR rotating anode x-ray generator with mirrors. The crystal diffracted to 2.2-Å resolution with an R mergeof 5.5 and 99.3% completeness with 4.8-fold redundancy. All data were integrated and scaled with DENZO/SCALEPACK (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The WilsonB factor is 29.7 Å2. The atomic coordinates of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2YFP (3Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) with all solvent molecules, the chromophore, and residue Gln 69 removed were used as the starting model for refinement. The B factor for all atoms was set to 25 Å2. One round of rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and individual B factor refinement in CNS (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Cryst. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) resulted in an R factor = 24% and anR free = 29%. Refinement proceeded with alternate rounds of manual adjustment in XTALVIEW (39McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and simulated annealing/B factor refinement in CNS. The stereochemistry of the model was evaluated with PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot contained 89.6% of the nonglycine residues with the remaining 10.4% in the additional allowed regions. Cavity volumes were determined with MSMS (41Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our newest and best YFP arose from efforts to improve camgaroo-1 (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator consisting ofXenopus calmodulin inserted in place of residue 145 of EYFP-Q69K (2Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar). Camgaroo-1 had the desirable feature of a rather large (∼7-fold) increase in fluorescence in response to Ca2+binding, but it unfortunately expressed poorly at 37 °C and could not be targeted to organelles such as mitochondria (34Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We therefore randomly mutated the cDNA encoding camgaroo-1 by error-prone PCR, transformed the resulting library into E. coli, and screened colonies grown at 37 °C for maximal fluorescence. Sequencing of the brightest clones (camgaroo-2) revealed just one new mutation, replacement of residue 69 (Gln in wild type, Lys in EYFP V68L/Q69K) by Met. The excitation and emission maxima as well as the response toin vitro titration with Ca2+ (5.3 ± 0.3 µm apparent dissociation constant, Hill coefficient 1.24, fluorescence enhancement of ∼7-fold) (Fig.1 A) were much the same as for camgaroo-1. However, camgaroo-2 produced far brighter expression in HeLa cells grown at 37 °C, where it filled the cytosol and nucleus uniformly (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of the cells with histamine produced only about 5% intensity increase (Fig. 1 C), consistent with the bias of camgaroos toward higher amplitude [Ca2+] transients. A saturating elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] induced with ionomycin increased the fluorescence about 6-fold (Fig. 1 C). We also targeted camgaroo-2 to mitochondria using the pECFP-Mito vector (CLONTECH), which uses the targeting sequence of subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase. Transfected cells showed a pattern typical of mitochondria (Fig. 1 D), indistinguishable from that of the accepted mitochondrial marker rhodamine 123 (data not shown). Camgaroo-2 is functional in mitochondria because a response to histamine was detected and ionomycin produced a significant fluorescence increase, although lower in dynamic range than in the cytosol (Fig. 1 E). The desirable effects of mutation Q69M in camgaroo-2 prompted transfer of this same mutation into EYFP V68L/Q69K not containing any inserted proteins. This improved variant of YFP, i.e. Citrine, has excitation and emission peaks of 516 and 529 nm, respectively, a quantum yield of 0.76, and an extinction coefficient of 7.7 × 104 (Table I). These properties are comparable to those of previous YFPs. One unexpected spectroscopic difference is that Citrine photobleaches at about half the rate as EYFP V68L/Q69K (Fig.2 A). Based on the illumination intensity of 1.9 W/cm2, we estimate the photobleaching quantum yield of Citrine to be about 2.3 × 10−5, in surprisingly good agreement with an estimate of 2.6 × 10−5 obtained at much higher illumination intensities (35Heikal A.A.

The corresponding value for EYFP V68L/Q69K is 5 × 10−5 from Fig. 2 A and Ref. 42Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11984-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar. Citrine also has a considerably lower pK a, 5.7, than previous YFPs such as EYFP V68L/Q69K (Fig. 2 B and Table I) making it less sensitive to fluctuations in intracellular pH. Cytosolic pH can range from ∼7.3 to 6.8, depending on cell type and stimulation (43Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), so cytosolic Citrine should not be expected to vary in fluorescence during normal physiological stimulation. Furthermore, pH titrations were the same in 100 mm potassium chloride and 100 mmsodium gluconate (Fig. 2 B), indicating that Citrine is not perturbed by chloride. The pK a values of all previous YFPs increase with increasing halide concentrations (10Wachter R.M. Yarbrough D. Kallio K. Remington S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Curr.

For example, Fig. 2 B also shows the chloride dependence of EYFP V68L/Q69K, which is actually one of the less halide-sensitive YFPs. Citrine folded efficiently at 37 °C, and with appropriate targeting sequences, could be expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of HeLa cells. In contrast, EYFP V68L/Q69K did not tolerate attachment of ER-targeting sequences, and remained mostly nonfluorescent, with sporadic cells showing cytosolic fluorescence (data not shown). In addition, circular permutations of Citrine were observed to develop fluorescence at 37 °C (Table I), in contrast to comparable permutations of EYFP V68L/Q69K that become fluorescent only at 20 °C or less. In summary, the Q69M mutation improves many of the shortcomings of YFP including pH and chloride sensitivity as well as the inability to fold well in organelles or as a circular permutation.Table ISpectral properties and pKa of selected YFP variantsλex1-aExcitation maximum (nm).λcm1-bEmission maximum (nm).ε1-cExtinction coefficient (m−1 cm−1).Quantum yieldpK a1-dDetermined in 147 mmchloride.

Open table in a new tab To investigate why the mutation Q69M improves YFPs chloride and pH resistance, we determined the x-ray structure of Citrine at 2.2-Å resolution (Table II and PDB accession code 1HUY). As expected, the effect of the Q69M mutation on the overall structure of YFP is minor. The root mean square deviation between Citrine and the same protein with Gln at 69 (PDB accession code 1YFP) is 0.32 Å (3Wachter R.M. Elsliger M.-A. Kallio K. Hanson G.T. Remington S.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1267-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In the immediate vicinity of the chromophore and the adjacent Met69 residue, small positional shifts (on the order of 0.3 Å when compared with 1YFP) resulting from the introduction of the bulky methionine side chain are apparent (Fig.3 A). There is a localized slight outward displacement of the two closest strands of the β-barrel due to steric contact of the side chains of residues Val150 and Leu201 with the methionine. Additional residues in the local environment, including the chromophore and its π-stacked partner Tyr203, have undergone compensatory shifts and thus the majority of the packing interactions and hydrogen bond network are unchanged.Table IIData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionResolution (Å)2-aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.28.3–2.2 (2.28–2.20)No. of reflection"
https://openalex.org/W2151613225,"A novel human G protein-coupled receptor named AXOR12, exhibiting 81% homology to the rat orphan receptor GPR54, was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. Heterologous expression of AXOR12 in mammalian cells permitted the identification of three surrogate agonist peptides, all with a common C-terminal amidated motif. High potency agonism, indicative of a cognate ligand, was evident from peptides derived from the gene KiSS-1, the expression of which prevents metastasis in melanoma cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to study the expression of AXOR12 and KiSS-1 in a variety of tissues. The highest levels of expression of AXOR12 mRNA were observed in brain, pituitary gland, and placenta. The highest levels ofKiSS-1 gene expression were observed in placenta and brain. A polyclonal antibody raised to the C terminus of AXOR12 was generated and used to show localization of the receptor to neurons in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and brainstem. The biological significance of these expression patterns and the nature of the putative cognate ligand for AXOR12 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2098848421,"Acetylation of core histone tails plays a fundamental role in transcription regulation. In addition to acetylation, other posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and methylation, occur in core histone tails. Here, we report the purification, molecular identification, and functional characterization of a histone H4-specific methyltransferase PRMT1, a protein arginine methyltransferase. PRMT1 specifically methylates arginine 3 (Arg 3) of H4 in vitro and in vivo. Methylation of Arg 3 by PRMT1 facilitates subsequent acetylation of H4 tails by p300. However, acetylation of H4 inhibits its methylation by PRMT1. Most important, a mutation in the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding site of PRMT1 substantially crippled its nuclear receptor coactivator activity. Our finding reveals Arg 3 of H4 as a novel methylation site by PRMT1 and indicates that Arg 3 methylation plays an important role in transcriptional regulation."

Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of this transporter is sensitive to the flux of bile acids through the hepatocyte, possibly at the level of transcription of the BSEP gene. To determine the mechanisms underlying the regulation of BSEP by bile acids, the promoter of the BSEP gene was cloned. The sequence of the promoter contained an inverted repeat (IR)-1 element (5′-GGGACA T TGATCCT-3′) at base pairs −63/−50 consisting of two nuclear receptor half-sites organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide. This IR-1 element has been shown in several recent studies to serve as a binding site for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor for bile acids. FXR activity requires heterodimerization with RXRα, and when bound by bile acids, the complex effectively regulates the transcription of several genes involved in bile acid homeostasis. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of FXR/RXRα heterodimers to the IR-1 element in the BSEP promoter. In HepG2 cells, co-transfection of FXR and RXRα is required to attain full transactivation of the BSEP promoter by bile acids. Two FXR transactivation-deficient mutants (an AF-2 deletion and a W469A point mutant) failed to transactivate, indicating that the effect of bile acids is FXR-dependent. Further, mutational analysis confirms that the FXR/RXRα heterodimer activates transcription through the IR-1 site in the human BSEP promoter.

The transport capacity of the canalicular membrane is remarkably large. In humans with a bile acid synthetic rate of 500–600 mg/day, the liver maintains a pool of 2–3 g in transit through hepatocytes and the biliary tree and, due to an efficient enterohepatic circulation, secretes 20–30 g of bile acids each day. The overall process of bile acid transport allows the hepatocyte to maintain a concentration gradient for bile acids 100–1000-fold higher in bile than in portal blood (1Nathanson M. Boyer J.L.

The transporter, the bile salt export pump (BSEP,1ABCb11), has been cloned and is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of proteins. BSEP is related to the multidrug resistance gene products or P-glycoproteins, is expressed exclusively in liver, and has been localized by immunohistochemistry to the canalicular domain of hepatocytes (6Childs S.

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been shown to be involved in regulation of BSEP transport activity.

However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional control of BSEP expression including possible regulatory effects of bile acids have not been defined. Recent studies have shown that bile acids act as signaling molecules that regulate their own biosynthesis and transport by binding to and activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4, RXR-interacting protein 14) (17Makishima M.

In the current study, the promoter for the BSEP gene was cloned with the goal of identifying cis elements that mediate bile acid-induced changes in gene expression. Our results show that induction of the BSEP gene expression occurs through the direct interaction of the bile acid-activated FXR/RXR heterodimer with a highly conserved IR-1 element in the proximal BSEPpromoter. These findings provide further evidence for the critical role of FXR in integrating and regulating bile acid homeostasis.

Comparison of the human BSEP cDNA sequence by the BLAST algorithm revealed that one BAC clone (GenBankTM accession number AC008177) contained regions 5′-upstream to the untranslated cDNA sequence. Based on this sequence, two primers were synthesized (−1445FOR and +86REV with HindIII adapters) and used in a PCR to amplify a 1.5-kb (−1445 to +86 of BSEP) fragment. Conditions for PCR were as follows: 1) 94 °C for 2 min; 2) 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and 3) a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The product was subcloned into TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing of a few clones. One of the clones was digested with HindIII, and the 1.5-kb insert was subcloned into the luciferase expression vector pSV0ALΔ5′ (p−1445/Luc). DNAs from a few clones were sequenced, and one clone containing the insert in the sense orientation was used for transfection studies. Another clone containing the insert in the antisense orientation was used as a negative control. A second plasmid containing a 0.2-kb minimal promoter (−145 to +86) was prepared by PCR amplification using the REV primer described above with a −145FOR primer, and the product of 231 bp was subcloned into pSV0ALΔ5′ after digestion with HindIII (p−145/Luc) to a similarly restricted vector. p−64/Luc, which contained 5′-sequences upstream of the FXR-responsive element (FXRE), was synthesized using −64REV and −1445FOR as primers with HindIII adaptors and subcloning into pSV0ALΔ5′ as described above. The sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. FXRE in the BSEP promoter was mutated using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Open table in a new tab Preparation of nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells transfected with FXR and RXRα, and controls were done using NE-PER™. FXR and RXR cDNAs (5 µg/dish) were transfected into HepG2 cells (5 × 106cells/100-mm dish) in three dishes using Lipofectin at a DNA/lipofectin ratio of 1:3. Control untransfected cells were left in minimum essential medium. Lipofectin was replaced with minimum essential medium 1 day later, and 3 days later nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PERTM from Pierce according to the manufacturer's directions. Nuclear extracts were stored in aliquots at −80 °C until used. Using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), cDNAs encoding mouse RXRα and rat FXR were transcribed and translated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of the transcribed/translated extracts were used for EMSAs. Oligonucleotide probes for the EMSAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 or 6000 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The gel shift assay protocol was according to that of Zhang and Dufau (26Zhang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2663-2670Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 µl of RXRα and FXR cDNA-programmed lysates alone or together were added to 20 µl of binding reaction containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 µg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid, 1 µg of salmon sperm DNA, and 5 × 104 cpm of probe on ice for 45 min. As a control, the probe was also incubated with the same amount of unprogrammed TNT lysate. In competition assays, unlabeled wild type or mutant oligonucleotides were added to the reaction 15 min before the addition of the probe. EMSA assays with HepG2 extracts were done using 10 µg of protein and omitting salmon sperm DNA from the binding reaction. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 0.5× TBE (0.89 m Tris, 0.89m boric acid, 0.02 m disodium EDTA for 10× TBE). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for varying lengths of time until a suitable image was obtained. HepG2 cells were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin and subcultured at 1:5 dilution every week. For transfection, 12-well plates were seeded on day 0 with 2 × 105 cells/well. On day 3, they were transfected in triplicate with 1 µg/well of vector or promoter-luciferase constructs (p−1445/Luc or p−145/Luc) using Lipofectin or FuGene 6 at a DNA/lipid ratio of 1:3. In addition, co-transfections were done by adding 200 ng each of rat FXR and mouse RXRα cDNAs. Control wells were supplemented with same amount of vector DNAs such that the total amount of DNA added to each well remained constant. All wells were also transfected with a Renilla luciferase vector driven by a thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK; Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After exposure of the cells to a DNA/Lipofectin or FuGene 6 mixture for 22 h, the wells were replaced with medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-adsorbed serum. After a further 24 h, 1 µm 9-cis-RA and 100 µm chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) were added as ligands for RXRα and FXR, respectively. Luciferase activity was assayed in anAmersham Pharmacia Biotech luminometer using the Dual Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the Renilla luciferase expression. Results are expressed as -fold increase of activity over vector control. All experiments were done in triplicate and were repeated at least once. Values are expressed ± S.D. The statistical significance of the difference between the means was calculated using Student's t test, and pvalues < 0.05 are considered significant. The transcription start site of the human BSEP promoter was mapped by primer extension analysis using total RNA from human liver. One 23-mer primer, PE-75 (Table I) was utilized, and the results are shown in Fig.1. One major band of 78 bp (Fig. 1,straight arrow) and a second minor band (comprising ∼10% of the major band) of 77 bp were obtained (Fig. 1,lane L). Based on these results, the transcription start site was found to be 3 bp upstream of the reported BSEP cDNA sequence in the NCBI data base (accession numberAF091582). Since the 78-bp product was the major band, this nucleotide was assigned nt +1 in the promoter sequence. Extended products were not seen when yeast tRNA was used as a control template in the primer extension analysis (Fig. 1, lane Y). DNA sequence of the antisense strand obtained using p−1445/Luc as a template is indicated, with the start site marked with a bent arrow. Using the sequence of the human BSEP cDNA, a BLAST search of the NCBI data base was performed against human genomic sequences. A BAC clone (AC008177) was identified that contained part of the 5′-untranslated and upstream sequences of the BSEP gene. Based upon this sequence, sense and antisense primers (−1445FOR and +78REV) spanning 1.5 kb were synthesized and used in a PCR with human genomic DNA. A 1.5-kb product of the expected size was obtained and was cloned into the TA cloning vector and sequenced. The deduced DNA sequence of the human BSEP promoter is shown in Fig.2. The sequence of the PCR product was identical to the BAC sequence except for three differences: 1) at nt −1084, c instead of t; 2) at nt −1152, c instead of t; and 3) at nt −1271, a instead of g. Analysis of the BSEP promoter sequence against a transcription factor-binding site data base, TRANSFAC 4.0 (MatInspector, available on the World Wide Web at transfac.gbf.de) revealed the presence of many general and liver-specific transcription factor-binding sites. Among the general basic DNA elements are 1) a TATA-like element (nt −33) (27Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); 2) two AP-1 sites (nt −179 and −566, also a glucocorticoid-responsive element (28Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar); 3) an AP-2 site (nt −68) (29Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar); 4) an NF-κB site (nt −357) (30Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); 5) an NF-Y/CAAT box (nt −596) (31Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar); and 6) an SP-1 site (nt −1129) (32Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In addition, binding sites for transcription factors shown to be involved in liver-specific gene expression are found at nt −39 and −429 (HNF-5 site) and at nt −454 and −713 (C/EBP/NF interleukin-6 site) (33Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the sequence contained an FXR/RXR-binding element (FXRE) at bp −50/−63 consisting of two nuclear receptor half-sites of the consensus (G/A)GGTGA organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). This IR-1 element is conserved in the human, rat, and mouse promoters (data not shown) (46Balasubramanian N. Swaby I. Suchy F.J. Ananthanarayanan M. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (abstr.): 762Google Scholar), but in the human promoter the second half-site contained an extra base pair (5′-GGGACA T TGATCCT-3′). This FXRE sequence was present in the original BAC clone as well as in the sequence of several clones amplified from human genomic DNA. The IR-1 element has been shown in several recent studies to serve as an FXR/RXR (bile acid response element) binding site and is similar to the FXR element identified previously in the promoter of the ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBAB-P) gene. The FXR/RXRα heterodimer recognizes an inverted repeat separated by a single nucleotide (IR). To determine whether the FXR/RXRα heterodimer can bind to this IR-1 motif (FXRE) in theBSEP promoter, EMSAs were done using 32P-labeled FXRE oligonucleotides from the human BSEP promoter in the presence of nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding FXR and RXRα. The results of the EMSA assay are shown in Fig. 3 A. The addition of nuclear extract from FXR/RXR-transfected cells led to the appearance of a shifted DNA-protein complex (top arrow labeled Sp, lane 4), whose intensity was in proportion to the amount of nuclear extract (data not shown). This shifted band was not detected using extracts prepared from untransfected HepG2 cells or from cells transfected with either RXRα or FXR alone (lanes 1–3). FXR/RXR binding was specifically competed off by the addition of a 25-fold molar excess of wild type oligonucleotide (lane 6) but not an IR-1 mutant oligonucleotide (lane 7), demonstrating the specificity of the complex. In addition, major (Fig. 3 A, NSp arrow) and minor faster migrating, nonspecific complexes were also seen. In order to verify that the complex formed by BSEP FXRE is the same as that formed by a bona fide IR-1 element, the FXRE from IBAB-P the promoter was used as a probe in the EMSA assay. As seen inlane 5, the complex formed with IR-1-IBABP migrated at the same position as the BSEP FXRE complex. Moreover, as shown in lane 8, a 50-fold molar excess of the IBAB-P oligonucleotide abolished the formation of the BSEP FXRE band. These data indicate that the BSEP FXRE element is an authentic FXR/RXRα binding cis element. Next, to investigate whether the formation of the DNA-protein complex requires the presence of the FXR/RXRα heterodimer, EMSA was repeated using in vitro translated FXR and RXRα proteins as shown in Fig. 3 B. Neither unprogrammed lysate nor FXR or RXRα alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3, respectively) bound to FXRE probe. However, when both FXR and RXRα were incubated together, a complex was formed, indicating that it is the FXR/RXR heterodimer that is bound (Fig. 3 B,lane 4, Sp arrow) by the IR-1 element. The binding was specific, as demonstrated by competition with an excess (25-fold) of FXRE oligonucleotide (lane 5) but not a mutated oligonucleotide (lane 6). It has been shown previously that FXR regulates several genes involved in bile acid metabolism by binding to its response element (IR-1) as a heterodimer that is activated by bile acids and the RXR ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid. To determine whether this heterodimer is involved in bile acid-dependent regulation of the BSEP gene, a 1531-bp fragment of the BSEPpromoter (bp −1445 to +86) was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. This construct (p−1445/Luc) was transiently transfected into the liver cell line HepG2 together with FXR and/or RXRα expression vectors in the presence or absence of 100 µmCDCA and/or 1 µm 9-cis-RA. A diagram of the promoter-reporter gene constructs is shown in Fig.4 A. As shown in Fig.4 B, luciferase activity was markedly induced (52.7 ± 6.3-fold over control; p < 0.001) in the presence of FXR and CDCA. No significant activation was observed with transfection of RXRα alone (data not shown) and after incubation with its ligand 9-cis retinoic acid (Fig. 4 B). Maximum transactivation was induced when both FXR and RXRα expression vectors were co-transfected followed by incubation with CDCA and 9-cis-RA (110.9 ± 20.3-fold; p < 0.001). Transactivation was also observed with FXR and RXRα in the absence of exogenous addition of ligands (29.4 ± 6.3-fold,p < 0.01), suggesting suboptimal amounts of endogenous ligands in HepG2 cells under basal growth conditions. It has been previously demonstrated that HepG2 cells can synthesize CDCA at a rate of 58 ± 4.9 µg/96 h (16 µm per 10 ml of medium) (34Javitt N.B. Pfeffer R. Kok E. Burstein S. Cohen B.I. Budai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10384-10387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was only a ∼4-fold increase in luciferase activity in the absence of FXR/RXRα, indicating that these nuclear receptors may be important even for basal transcription of the BSEP gene. The activity observed with transfection of FXR alone is probably related to the presence of some RXRα in nuclei of HepG2 cells. In order to further refine the requirement for FXR/RXRα transactivation, we next constructed a minimal promoter (p−145/Luc, −145 to +86 bp) that contained the IR-1 element. HepG2 cells were transfected with this 0.2-kb promoter along with co-transfection of RXRα and FXR alone or together. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4 C. Luciferase activity was significantly induced when FXR was expressed in the presence of CDCA (27.8 ± 6.0-fold; p < 0.01) or when FXR/RXRα were co-transfected in the absence and presence of ligands (32.1 ± 1.5-fold (p < 0.02) and 44.9 ± 5.3-fold (p < 0.001), respectively). There was no induction after transfection with the promoter construct alone (1.02 ± 0.15-fold) or on co-transfection with RXRα (1.1 ± 0.01-fold). This result was confirmed by synthesis of an additional luciferase construct in which the 3′-region of the BSEPpromoter from nt −63 to +78 including the FXRE was deleted (p−64/Luc). Transfection of this 3′-deleted construct (p−64/Luc) into HepG2 cells with FXR and RXRα with their cognate ligands produced minimal transactivation. Luciferase activity was induced 2.9 ± 0.063-fold over control for the p−64/Luc versus 34.6 ± 4.9-fold for p−1445/Luc, which contained the intact 3′-sequence. The specificity of the transactivation of BSEP promoter by FXR was then assessed by expression of other nucle"

Here we show that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling promotes endothelial cell survival by inhibiting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent apoptosis. Blockade of the PI 3-kinase or Akt pathways in conjunction with serum withdrawal stimulates p38-dependent apoptosis. Blockade of PI 3-kinase/Akt also led to enhanced VEGF activation of p38 and apoptosis. In this context, the pro-apoptotic effect of VEGF is attenuated by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580.

Conversely, activation-deficient Akt decreases VEGF-stimulated MEKK3 phosphorylation and increases MKK/p38 activation. Activation of MKK3/6 is not dependent on Rac activation since dominant negative Rac does not decrease p38 activation triggered by inhibition of PI 3-kinase.

The local balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic stimuli will determine the fate of each individual cell. In vascular endothelial cells, which line all the blood vessels of the body, tight regulation of apoptotic and survival signals contributes to physiological and pathological processes such as angiogenesis, vascular homeostasis, and ischemic diseases (2Stefanec T.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 an angiogenic cytokine secreted by a variety cells, functions as a survival factor for endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro (3Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A.

PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids at the D-3 position producing PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Direct binding of Akt to the membrane phosphoinositide products of the PI 3-kinase reaction, through its pleckstrin homology domain, permits phosphorylation by a phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1). PDK1 is also activated by phosphoinositol lipids and phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308, resulting in autophosphorylation of Ser-473 (11Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), thus increasing Akt catalytic activity toward a variety of diverse substrates (12Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Akt is an important regulator of various cellular processes including metabolism, cell survival, migration, and nitric oxide release (13Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y.

In contrast to the anti-apoptotic signals of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, VEGF also stimulates the activation of the stress-activated serine/threonine protein kinase, p38 MAPK, which appears to be an important modulator of the proapoptotic program in various cell types including endothelial cells.

Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Dual phosphorylation by the upstream MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) of the characteristic Thr-Gly-Tyr motif is required for p38 activation (20Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This activation is blocked by the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors of p38, SB203580 and SB202190, which inhibit p38α and -β but not p38γ or -δ (21Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C.

Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar)). Together these data indicate that VEGF is capable of eliciting biochemical responses that either enhance cell survival (PI 3-kinase/Akt) or might lead to cell death (p38 MAPK). However the activation of p38 MAPK by VEGF in endothelial cells has only been studied in the context of cellular motility and actin reorganization; furthermore, VEGF is mostly known as an anti-apoptotic angiogenic growth factor. In this paper we reveal that blockade of PI 3-kinase or Akt signaling attenuates VEGF-stimulated MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) phosphorylation and increases p38 signaling, thus enhancing apoptosis. On the other hand, overexpression of constitutively active Akt enhances MEKK3 phosphorylation and down-regulates p38 activation. These data suggest that cross-talk between PI 3-kinase/Akt and p38 signaling pathways contributes to the balance of pro- versusanti-apoptotic signaling that occurs in endothelial cells.

Cell culture media and supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Beverly, MA). PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin and p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) and tetracycline were purchased from Sigma and CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) respectively. BAECs and HUVECs were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPP, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin).

Adenovirus expressing Myc-tagged Rac1 dominant negative (Rac1-DN) under control of tetracycline repressor elements and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (tet-mCMV), and adenovirus constitutively expressing a tetracycline represor-Vp16 fusion protein, which was required to activate expression of the tet-mCMV were generated as described previously (29Kalman D. Gomperts S.N. Hardy S. Kitamura M. Bishop J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1665-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HUVECs or BAECs were infected with adenovirus (m.o.i. of 100) containing the β-galactosidase, AA-Akt, myr-Akt, Rac1-DN, or tetracycline represor-VP16 for 12 h. The virus was removed and cells left to recover for 12 h in complete medium. These conditions resulted in uniform expression of the transgenes in close to 95% of the cells (determined by infection with β-galactosidase, followed by staining for β-galactosidase activity) and equal expression of Akt proteins, based on Western blotting. To avoid Rac1-DN expression in HUVECs infected with Rac1-DN and tetracycline repressor-VP16, cells were supplemented with tetracycline (1 µg/ml). HUVECs were grown on 12-well tissue culture plates and were subjected to serum and growth factor withdrawal (1% fatty acid-free BSA). Following treatment, floating and trypsin-detached HUVECs were pooled and washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 70% cold ethanol. After fixation, cells were stained in a PBS propidium iodide (50 µg/ml), RNase A (100 µg/ml), and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 45 min. DNA content of HUVECs was analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACSort, Becton Dickinson). At least 10,000 events were analyzed, and the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 population was calculated. Aggregates of cell debris at the origin of the histogram were excluded from the analysis of sub-G1 cells, as indicated in the legends to Figs. 2 and 4. In each experiment, serum-grown as well as serum-deprived HUVECs were used as controls and compared with cells treated with either VEGF or the different drugs.Figure 4VEGF-induced p38 activation in a PI 3-kinase/Akt-deficient background is associated with the induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. A, HUVECs were treated with VEGF (40 ng/ml) for 6 h in absence or in presence of LY294002 (10 µm; 5-h pretreatment) and SB203580, and the frequency of cells with pyknotic nuclei was counted using the Hoechst 33258 DNA stain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.

For each panel, the percentage of HUVECs with hypodiploid (apoptotic) DNA content is indicated (M1) as determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Similar results were obtained in three additional experiments. C, serum-starved HUVECs were treated for 5 h with or without LY294002 (10 µm) or SB203580 (10 µm) before immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins and in vitro kinase assay. Cells extracts were incubated overnight with immobilized p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) monoclonal antibody. After extensive washing, the kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 100 µm cold ATP and 2 µg of ATF-2 fusion protein. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-71 was measured by Western blot using phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) antibody. Identical results were obtained in another three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternatively, cells were analyzed for the appearance of pyknotic nuclei. Confluent, serum-starved HUVECs, cultured in 12-well plates, were treated as indicated in the legend of Figs. 2 and 4. Following removal of culture media, 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS was added to the culture. After fixation for 20 min, cells were washed in PBS twice and stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/ml; 20 min) and washed with PBS. Cells were examined with a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Percentage of pyknotic nuclei was determined by counting four different fields (32× objective) per well. At least 200 nuclei/well were counted. BAECs were placed into phosphate-free DMEM with or without 10% of 0.15 m NaCl-dialyzed (for removal of phosphate contamination in FBS) fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 µCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate overnight prior to stimulation with VEGF. In some samples, cells were infected with adenovirus encoding dominant-negative Akt or constitutively active Akt at an m.o.i. of 100 for 24 h, or followed by incubation with LY294002 (100 nm) for 4 h prior to stimulation with VEGF. After 10 min of stimulation with VEGF, cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and harvested with lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation buffer plus 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4). The lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using mouse monoclonal anti-MEKK3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into each protein was visualized after SDS-PAGE (10%) by autoradiography. For the MEKK3 kinase activity, BAECs were harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above). The lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the above anti-MEKK3 antibody for 2 h. The protein A-precipitated complex was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with the kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The kinase assay was performed using 25 µl of the protein A-complexed MEKK3 and 10 µl of glutathione-agarose-bound GST-MKK3 as a substrate. The kinase assay was preformed in a total of 50 µl of kinase assay buffer for 20 min at 30 °C in presence of 2 mmdithiothreitol, 100 µm cold ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmeli buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie staining followed by autoradiography. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were measured by two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test.p value of <0.05 was considered as significant. To investigate the cross-talk between the PI 3-kinase and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways, we studied the effects LY294002, a known PI 3-kinase inhibitor, on the phosphorylation state of p38 MAPK. Fig.1 A shows that treatment of serum-starved HUVECs with LY294002 (10 µm) induces a time-dependent increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The addition of 10% FBS to the media reduces the phosphorylation state of p38 (Fig. 1 B, top two panels, lane 1) and LY294002 (10 µm; 5 h) induces an increase in p38 phosphorylation even in the presence of serum (lane 2). Again, in the absence of serum, basal p38 phosphorylation is enhanced and LY294002 further stimulates p38 phosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, in the presence or absence of serum, LY294002 reduces the phosphorylation levels of Akt, a downstream component of the of PI 3-kinase pathway (Fig. 1 B,bottom two panels). Identical results were obtained in serum-deprived COS cells treated with LY294002 (data not shown). We then monitored the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibition on serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis in HUVECs (Fig. 1 C shows a representative experiment out of four individual experiments and Fig.1 D the summary of theses experiments). Under control conditions with serum, ∼4% of HUVECs were hypodiploid based on fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells and LY294002 did not significantly increase this population when serum was present (Fig. 1 D) consistent with low level p38 activation in the presence of serum (see Fig. 1 B,lane 2). In the absence of serum, the level of apoptosis significantly increased (p < 0.05,n = 4) and this effect is enhanced by PI 3-kinase inhibition (p < 0.05, comparing lane 4 to lanes 3 and 1,n = 4). The increase in apoptosis and the stimulatory effects of LY294002 on cell death correlates with the increase of p38 phosphorylation in serum-deprived HUVECs. In order to verify that the increase in p38 MAP kinase activity is participating in the proapoptotic effects produced by PI 3-kinase inhibition, we studied the effect of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (25 µm) on wortmannin-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. Wortmannin is a structurally distinct PI 3-kinase inhibitor (30Gao Z. Konrad R.J. Collins H. Matschinsky F.M. Rothenberg P.L. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig.2 B shows that serum deprivation (12 h) induces the appearance of pyknotic nuclei, a marker of apoptosis, when compared with serum-grown HUVECs (from 5.2 ± 1.0% in presence of 10% FBS to 20.6 ± 1.6% in absence of serum; p < 0.05). The number of pyknotic nuclei are significantly reduced when HUVECs are incubated with the known survival factor VEGF (40 ng/ml) (from 20.6 ± 1.6% to 14.3 ± 0.6% in presence of VEGF; p < 0.05versus no serum). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin (100 nm) in serum-free conditions induces significant apoptosis (40.9 ± 2.1%, p < 0.05versus no serum). The inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase isoforms α and β, SB203580 (25 µm) alone did not further increase cell death but reduces apoptosis in HUVECs treated with wortmannin (from 40.9 ± 2.1% to 29.1 ± 2.9% in presence of SB203580; p < 0.05). Collectively, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase stimulates p38 MAPK-mediated proapoptotic pathways. Next, we wanted to examine the relationship between the p38 MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways in HUVECs treated with VEGF. VEGF (40 ng/ml) stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its upstream activators MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6 (MKK3, MKK6) in serum-deprived HUVECs (Fig.3, lanes 1 and2, top and bottom panels). LY294002 induces activation of p38 (top panel,lane 3) as well as MKK3 and 6 (bottom panel, lane 3). VEGF stimulation following LY294002 treatment of HUVECs produces a slight but consistent further activation of p38 MAPK and MKK3 and MKK6 (lane 4). We also monitored apoptosis under the exact same conditions (Fig. 4 A shows a representative experiment out of four). As expected, in the absence of serum, VEGF significantly reduces the number of pyknotic nuclei compared with serum-starved cells (Fig. 4 A,p < 0.05, n = 6, comparinglane 2 to lane 3). Treatment of cells with SB203580 did not influence the cytoprotective effects of VEGF (lane 4), whereas LY294002 augmented apoptosis compared with serum withdrawal (comparelane 2 to lane 5) and blunted the anti-apoptotic actions of VEGF (lane 6). Interestingly, the addition of VEGF to LY294002-treated cells results in further apoptosis compared with LY294002-treated cells alone (lanes 5 and 6). However, when HUVECs are treated with VEGF and LY294002 to maximally increase cell death, SB203580 significantly reduces the level of apoptosis (comparelane 7 to lanes 5 and6). Similar data were obtained using propidium iodide staining of hypodiploid cells as an index of apoptosis, i.e. SB203580 reduces the level of apoptosis triggered by the combination of VEGF and LY294002 (Fig. 4 B, compare middle andbottom histograms on right side; these data are representative of four experiments). Fig. 4 C shows that serum depletion increases kinase activity of p38 MAPK, as monitored by in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant ATF-2, and that inhibition of PI 3-kinase increases p38 activity. SB203580 abolishes this increase in p38 activity. These data imply that VEGF uses a PI 3-kinase pathway for endothelial cell protection and that the p38-driven death pathway becomes important when the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is blocked. However, in the absence of PI 3-kinase blockade, VEGF-stimulated p38 signaling leading apoptosis is likely offset by other prosurvival mechanisms. To test the involvement of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase downstream of PI 3-kinase, in the cross-talk with the p38 pathway, we used adenoviral mediated gene transfer to endothelial cells. Fig.5 A shows that infection of HUVECs with the activation-deficient mutant of Akt (AA-Akt, HA-tagged) modestly increases the basal and LY294002-stimulated phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK and more strongly activates its upstream activators MKK3 and MKK6 compared with control cells infected with a β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 5 A, lane 1 versus lane 3). Infection of HUVECs with a constitutively activated form of Akt (myr-Akt, HA-tagged) markedly reduces p38 and MKK3/6 phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, myr-Akt prevents the increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation induced by LY294002. In panel B, VEGF-induced increases in p38 MAPK phosphorylation are also blunted by adenovirus transduction of HUVECs with myr-Akt. The data demonstrate that Akt is the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase mediating the cross-talk between the PI 3-kinase and p38 pathways. In order to identify a potential substrate for Akt phosphorylation that would lead to the negative regulation of the p38 signaling pathway, we investigated the putative role of the upstream activator of MKK6 (31Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16604-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), MEKK3, and the small GTPase protein Rac1 (32Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this signaling pathway. In Fig. 6 A, we examined MEKK3 phosphorylation in BAECs in response to Akt activation by VEGF or via infection with myr-Akt. VEGF or serum stimulated the incorporation of 32P into immunoprecipitated MEKK3 (comparelanes 1, 2, and 6). Both conditions induced Akt phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown). VEGF- or serum-dependent incorporation of 32P was completely abolished when cells were treated with LY294002 or infected with the AA-Akt adenoviruses (compare lanes 2, 3, and 4 for VEGF andlanes 6, 7, and 8 for serum-induced phosphorylation of MEKK3, respectively).

Amino acid and mRNA sequences of these receptors have been published for several species including man. The 5-HT2 receptors have been reported to act on nervous, muscle, and endothelial tissues. Here we report the presence of 5-HT2B receptor in fetal chicken bone cells. 5-HT2B receptor mRNA expression was demonstrated in osteocytes, osteoblasts, and periosteal fibroblasts, a population containing osteoblast precursor cells. Pharmacological studies using several agonists and antagonists showed that occupancy of the 5-HT2B receptor stimulates the proliferation of periosteal fibroblasts. Activity of the 5-HT2A receptor could however not be excluded. mRNA for both receptors was shown to be equally present in adult mouse osteoblasts. Osteocytes, which showed the highest expression of 5-HT2B receptor mRNA in chicken, and to a lesser extent osteoblasts, are considered to be mechanosensor cells involved in the adaptation of bone to its mechanical usage. Nitric oxide is one of the signaling molecules that is released upon mechanical stimulation of osteocytes and osteoblasts. The serotonin analog α-methyl-5-HT, which preferentially binds to 5-HT2 receptors, decreased nitric oxide release by mechanically stimulated mouse osteoblasts.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells of hemopoietic origin and are related to the monocyte/macrophage (1Scheven B.A.A. Visser J.W.M. Nijweide P.J.

Osteoblasts on the other hand are of mesenchymal stock. Their stem and progenitor cells are present in the periosteum, endosteum, and bone marrow stroma (4Aubin J.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Osteocytes differentiate from osteoblasts. During the process of bone formation, a number of cells from the osteoblast layer is encapsulated in the newly formed bone matrix, whereas the other cells retract with the bone formation front. The cells that are incorporated in the bone matrix change from a cuboidal into a more stellate-shaped morphology and become osteocytes. The result of this process is a three-dimensional cellular network of osteocytes within the mineralized matrix connected to each other and to the bone surface cells by thin cell processes (5Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Klein-Nulend J. Van der Plas A. Principles of Bone Biology. 1st Ed. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 115-126Google Scholar). Together these three cell types produce, maintain, and adapt or repair, if necessary, the mineralized bone matrix. Osteoclasts are capable of bone resorption, osteoblasts of bone formation. The function of osteocytes is less well understood. Because of their location within the bone matrix, osteocytes are in a prime position for the detection of mechanical inadequacies of the tissue. They are believed to act as sensor cells that translate mechanical stimuli resulting from gravitational and muscular forces on the skeleton into biochemical signals. These biochemical signals in turn activate the effectors of bone turnover, osteoclasts and osteoblasts, leading to adaptation of mass and structure of bone (6Goodship A.E. Lanyon L.E. McFie H. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1979; 61A: 539-546Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Indeed, both in vivo andin vitro, osteocytes were shown to be very sensitive to mechanical perturbation and to produce prostaglandins and nitric oxide upon mechanical stimulation (7Skerry T.M.

These locally produced factors have been reported to be involved in the adaptation of bone to its mechanical environment in vivo (12Forwood M.R. J. Bone Miner.

The activities of the osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their precursor cells, are regulated by a multitude of factors. Some of these factors are of humoral origin (hormones), whereas others are locally produced (growth factors and cytokines), often in response to hormonal or mechanical activation. Apart from the clearly bone-related classical hormones (parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, estrogen, calcitonin) and well established or recently discovered local factors (insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factors, prostaglandins, osteoclast differentiation factor, bone morphogenetic proteins, and others), a number of neurotransmitters that seem unlikely to be related to bone metabolism have been found to play a role in bone (14Lerner U.H.

Bingmann D. Bone. 1998; 23: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) was identified in osteoblasts and osteocytes (19Mason D.J. Suva L.J. Genever P.G. Patton A.J. Stueckle S. Hillam R.A. Skerry T.M. Bone. 1997; 20: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), as was a glutamate receptor in osteoblasts and osteoclasts (20Patton A.J. Genever P.G. Birch M.A. Suva L.J. Skerry T.M. Bone. 1998; 22: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the presence of another regulatory system in bone, primarily known as a neural system. To gain better insight into the properties of osteocytes, we have used suppression subtractive hybridization (21Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar). Using this method cDNA reverse-transcribed from mRNA derived from osteocytes was hybridized to an excess of cDNA prepared from mRNA derived from osteoblasts. One of the genes found to be preferentially (although not exclusively), expressed in osteocytes proved to be the serotonin receptor subtype 2B (5-hydroxytryptamine 2B; 5-HT2B). The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) receptor family is divided into seven subfamilies (5-HT1–7 receptors), each of which is further subdivided into a number of subtypes (22Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). Except for the 5-HT3 receptor, serotonin receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which is characterized by seven membrane-spanning hydrophobic regions, an N-terminal extracellular and a C-terminal intracellular domain. The 5-HT2 receptor subfamily consists of three members, i.e.5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C(previously designated as 5-HT1C) receptors. The 5-HT2B receptor has been detected in many peripheral organs in several mammalian species including humans, primarily in the cardiovascular system, the gut, and the stomach fundus. Its expression level in the brain is, however, generally found to be relatively low compared with that of most other 5-HT receptors (23Kursar J.D. Nelson D.L. Wainscott D.B. Baez M. Mol.

The 5-HT2B receptor has not yet been described in birds, nor in bone or bone cells. In this work, we have studied the mRNA expression of the 5-HT2B receptor in bone and other tissues of 18-day-old fetal chickens and compared its expression in isolated osteocytes with the expression in isolated osteoblasts and periosteal fibroblasts (PF) isolated from the outer periosteum. This last population consists of mesenchymal cells with a fibroblast-like morphology in cell culture. The outer periosteum contains osteoblast precursor cells as is shown by their capacity for bone matrix formation (30Nijweide P.J. Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch. 1975; C78: 410-417Google Scholar). To show that not only 5-HT2B receptor mRNA but also 5-HT2Breceptor protein is present in bone cells, we have examined the effects of α-methyl-5-HT, a 5-HT analog, which preferentially binds to 5-HT2 receptors (31Ismaiel A.M. Titeler M. Miller K.J. Smith T.S. Glennon R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), on the proliferation of periosteal fibroblasts. A number of specific agonists and antagonists were used in pharmacological studies to investigate whether 5-HT2Breceptors are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Finally, we have studied the expression of serotonin receptors in isolated mouse osteoblasts to demonstrate that the expression of 5-HT2 receptors in bone is not restricted to chicken. In addition, mouse osteoblasts were used to study possible effects of serotonin in the response of bone cells to mechanical loading. Although osteocytes are the pivotal cells in the mechanoregulation of bone, (mouse) osteoblasts have also been shown to be mechanosensitive (32Klein-Nulend J. Burger E.H. Semeins C.M. Raisz L.G. Pilbeam C.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since osteocytes are extremely difficult to isolate in adequate numbers (33Van der Plas A. Nijweide P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), mouse osteoblasts were used in a preliminary study to examine whether serotonin could modulate the mechanosensitivity of bone cells. If serotonin does modulate the mechanosensitivity of bone cells, this could justify the relatively high expression of 5-HT2Breceptor in osteocytes, the mechanosensory cells par excellence. Various tissues (skin, heart, liver, brain, intestine, skeletal muscle, and both calvarial and long bone) were dissected from 18-day-old fetal chickens, immediately put into RNAzol (CAMPRO Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands), cut into small pieces and homogenized for the isolation of RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Various bone cell types were isolated from fetal chicken calvarial bones as described (33Van der Plas A. Nijweide P.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In short, calvariae were aseptically dissected and periostea were removed. A mixed population of primarily osteoblasts and osteocytes (OBmix) was obtained from the calvariae by sequential treatments with collagenase (1 mg/ml; Sigma, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and EDTA (4 mm). The OBmix population was cultured in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands), supplemented with 200 µg/ml glutamine (Sigma), 50 µg/ml gentamycin sulfate (Sigma), 50 µg/mll-ascorbic acid (BDH, Brunschwig Chemie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), 1 mg/ml d-glucose (BDH) (complete medium), and 2% chicken serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 1 day of culture, the OBmix cells were harvested by 3 min of trypsin/EDTA treatment (0.05:0.01% in phosphate-buffered saline) at 37 °C. Osteoblasts (OB) and osteocytes (OCY) were separated from each other by immunomagnetic separation, using monoclonal antibody MAb OB 7.3 (34Nijweide P.J. Mulder R.J.P. Histochemistry. 1986; 84: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the OBmix cell suspension was filtered through a nylon filter (pore size, 30 µm). The resulting single cell suspension was incubated with MAb OB 7.3 bound to magnetic beads via a DNA linker (Dynal). MAb OB 7.3 binds to a cell surface antigen present on OCY only. The cell suspension was placed in a magnetic field, which attracted the bead-bound cells to one side of the tube. The non-bound cells (OB) were removed, leaving only the bead-bound OCY in the tube. The OB population was treated for a second time with MAb OB7.3 bound to magnetic beads to ensure the removal of all OCY from the OB population. Periosteal fibroblasts (PF) were isolated from the periostea by collagenase treatment. This population was shown to contain osteoblast precursor cells (30Nijweide P.J. Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch. 1975; C78: 410-417Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were seeded in a culture flask, cultured for 1 day in complete medium with 2% chicken serum, and then removed from their support with trypsin/EDTA. Mouse osteoblasts were obtained from the limbs (tibiae, femurs, humeri) of adult Swiss albino mice as described previously (35Sterck J.G.H. Klein-Nulend J. Burger E.H. Lips P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the long bones were aseptically dissected and the diaphyses chopped into small fragments of ±1 mm2. The bone fragments were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 mg/ml collagenase in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), to remove all soft tissue from the surface of the bone chips, washed, transferred to 25 cm2 flasks, 20–30 fragments per flask, and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.6 mml-ascorbic acid (Merck), 60 µg/ml penicillin-G (Sigma), 50 µg/ml streptamycin (Sigma), 1.25 µg/ml fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 µg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Bone cells started to migrate from the bone chips after 4–5 days. When the cell monolayer growing from the bone fragments reached confluency after 7–10 days, cells were removed from their support with trypsin/EDTA, seeded at 25 × 103 cells/well in 6-well culture dishes, and grown until subconfluency in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and other additives as mentioned above. The PCR-Select cDNA SubtractionTM kit (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) allows the isolation of genes that are expressed to a higher extent in one cell type compared with another cell type (suppression subtractive hybridization; Ref. 21Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar) and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to compare gene expression in isolated chicken osteocytes to that in osteoblasts. In short, cDNA was amplified from total RNA of both cell populations, using the SMARTTM cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). The resulting cDNA samples were digested with RsaI. Subsequently, the OCY cDNA was subdivided into two portions, and each was ligated to a different double-stranded cDNA adaptor. The ends of the adaptors lacked a phosphate group, so only one strand of each adaptor attached to the 5′-ends of the cDNAs. In the first hybridization step, an excess of OB cDNA was added to each sample of OCY cDNA, the samples were heat-denatured and allowed to hybridize for 6 h at 68 °C. Hereafter, the two primary hybridization samples were mixed, a fresh aliquot of denatured OB cDNA was added, and the samples were allowed to hybridize for 16 h at 68 °C. During hybridization several double-stranded cDNA hybrids were formed (21Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2733) Google Scholar), but only hybrids containing two different adaptors, could be amplified by suppression PCR. These fragments represent genes that are differentially expressed in OCY. The resulting subtracted cDNA pool was cloned using the TOPOTMTA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Total RNA was extracted from cells and homogenized tissues with RNAzol B (CAMPRO Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA synthesis, 2 µl of random hexamers (0.1 µg/µl; Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) was added to 10-µl RNA samples, which were incubated for 10 min at 72 °C and then cooled to 4 °C. Subsequently, 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 10 mm dithiothreitol (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) and 1× first strand buffer (Promega) were added to each sample. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, after which the reaction was terminated by incubating 5 min at 95 °C. To check for genomic DNA contamination, controls were incorporated by omitting the reverse transcriptase. PCR reactions were performed using specific primer sets (See Table I). All primer combinations were designed with the PrimeTMprogram of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis PackageTM(Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Madison, WI). The primer set for chicken 5-HT2B receptor was selected from the sequence obtained in this study, the others from published sequences (Table I). PCR reactions were performed using serial dilutions of 1:30, 1:90, and 1:270 of the original cDNA samples (36Singer-Sam J. Robinson M.O. Bellvé A.R. Simon M.I. Riggs A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) in a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer 2400). PCR reactions contained 1× PCR-buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 0.2 mm of each primer, and 0.5 U AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were denatured for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30-s denaturing at 94 °C, 30 s at the annealing temperature indicated in Table I, and a 30-s extension at 72 °C. A final extension of 7 min at 72 °C concluded the PCR. Intron-spanning GAPDH-specific primers were used to equalize the starting amounts of cDNA and to check for possible genomic DNA contamination. PCR fragments were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1.6% agarose gel in 0.5× Tris/Borate/EDTA containing ethidium bromide. The intensity of each band was analyzed using image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Digital Science, ID Image Analysis).Table IList of primer setsGenePrimer 1/primer 2Product lengthGenBank™ Acc.

Total RNA samples from various tissues and cells were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in 1× Tris/Borate/EDTA containing 5 mm guanidine thiocyanate (37Goda S.K. Minton N.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3357-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized overnight at 55 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes in NaPi/SDS hybridization buffer (0.4 mNa2HPO4, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). Probes were made by PCR using the appropriate primer pairs (TableI), electrophoresed, extracted from gel by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) and labeled using Ready-to-go DNA-labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with ProbeQuantTMG-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Next day, the blots were washed 2–3 times for 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Northern blots were then exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) screen, scanned the next day, and net intensities were determined using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Loading of RNA was assessed with a GAPDH probe. Autoradiographs of the blots were obtained by exposure to Fuji Medical x-ray films at −80 °C. Chicken OB were seeded at various cell densities in 24-well plates in complete medium (see “Materials and Methods”) containing 2% chicken serum and cultured for 1 day to attach. Then the cells were cultured for 1, 2, or 3 days in complete medium containing either 2% chicken serum or 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA Fraction V; ICN Biomedicals Inc., Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), and α-methyl-5-HT (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) in a concentration range of 0–10−5m (dissolved in medium). Cultures were terminated by washing the cell layers with αMEM and lysing the cells with CyQuant lysis buffer (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). DNA content was measured using the CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in the same cell lysates using the method of Bessey et al. (38Bessey O.A. Lowry O.H. Breck M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 49: 321-326Google Scholar). In this method alkaline phosphatase activity is expressed as the amount ofp-nitrophenyl formed from p-nitrophenylphosphate under alkaline conditions. Chicken PF were suspended in complete medium with 2% chicken serum (105 cells/ml) and seeded into a Petri dish containing multiwell slides (10 wells per slide; ICN Biomedicals Inc.). The cells were allowed to attach overnight. Then the medium was replaced by complete medium, containing 0.1% serum. After 2 days of culture, the medium was exchanged for fresh complete medium in which all serum was substituted by 0.5% bovine serum albumin to synchronize the cells and prevent down-regulation of receptors by serotonin in serum (39Saucier C. Morris S.J. Albert P.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The factors to be studied were added to this medium. The cell culture was continued for another 24 h. Two hours before termination of the culture bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Aldrich Chem. Co.) was added in a final concentration of 3 × 10−5m. After termination of the culture period, the cells were fixed with zinc fixative (40Beckstead J.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and BrdUrd incorporated in the DNA was visualized with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody MoBu-1 (41Harms G. Van Goor H. Koudstaal J. De Ley L. Hardonk M.J. Histochemistry. 1986; 85: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Nordic Immunological Laboratories, Tilburg, The Netherlands), and NovaRED (Vector Laboratories Inc., Brunschwig, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as substrate according to standard procedures. Proliferation was expressed as the percentage BrdUrd-positive cells. The following compounds were dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions and tested for their effects on PF proliferation: the 5-HT2 receptor agonist α-methyl-5-HT (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), the 5-HT2B receptor selective agonist BW723C86 (RBI-Sigma), and selective antagonists ketanserin (5-HT2Aand 5-HT2C; RBI-Sigma), SB206553 (5-HT2B and 5-HT2C; RBI-Sigma) and SB215505 (5-HT2B; a generous gift from Dr. M. S. Duxon, SmithKline Beecham). Controls were incorporated by adding only appropriate vehicle. Subconfluent mouse osteoblast cultures were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were seeded onto polylysine-coated glass slides at 5 × 105 cells/slide, cultured for 1 day in DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum, and then incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of PFF at 37 °C and 5% CO2. PFF was generated as described before (32Klein-Nulend J. Burger E.H. Semeins C.M. Raisz L.G. Pilbeam C.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In short, 15 ml of culture medium was pumped through a parallel-plate flow chamber in a pulsating manner. This resulted in a pulsating (5 Hz) fluid shear stress of 0.7 ± 0.03 pascal and an estimated peak stress rate of 12 pascal/s. A glass slide on which osteoblasts had been seeded served as the bottom of the chamber. At 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, samples of 0.5 ml were taken from the PFF medium and the stationary control cultures. In these samples NO release was measured as NO 2− using Griess reagent (10Klein-Nulend J. Semeins C.M. Ajubi N.E. Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After 60 min, the osteoblasts of PFF and control slides were lysed with CyQuant lysis buffer, and DNA contents were measured using the CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit. All data were tested for normality with Shapiro-Wilk. Normality was assumed at p values higher than 0.05. Non-normally distributed data were analyzed for overall differences with a univariate general linear model (GLM), significancy was assumed at p values lower than 0.05. When differences were present, Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction for repeated testing were used to determine individual differences. The suppression subtractive hybridization method we used to compare gene expression in isolated chicken osteocytes (OCY) and osteoblasts (OB) resulted in a large number of clones. Sequence analysis revealed that about one-third of the clones showed homology to known genes. These results will be published elsewhere. The nucleotide sequence of one"

In addition, the c-IAP-2-MALT1 fusion protein resulting from the t(11;18)(q21;q21) chromosomal translocation strongly activates NF-κB (12Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S.

These observations suggest that MALT1 functions as a downstream effector in a Bcl10-MALT1 complex, and that Bcl10 and MALT1, although independent targets of chromosomal translocation, act in a common NF-κB signaling pathway to promote MALT lymphoma. Analysis of mutant mice lacking Bcl10 have shown that this protein plays a critical role in lymphoid activation and proliferation (14Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl10 is important for neural development, because a significant percentage of mice deficient in Bcl10 exhibit a defect in neural tube closure (14Ruland J. Duncan G.S.

Bcl10 −/− lymphocytes fail to activate NF-κB in response to CD3, CD3/CD28, and IgM ligation, indicating that Bcl10 is a signal transducer between lymphoid antigen receptors and NF-κB (14Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W.

One class of signaling molecules that has been implicated in mediating both T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor signaling is the family of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. Mounting evidence suggests that the PMA-activated isoforms such as PKCθ and PKCβ are important in CD3/CD28 and IgM receptor-mediated NF-κB induction, respectively (15Leitges M. Schmedt C.

Bcl10 −/− lymphoid cells retain normal Ca2+ mobilization but are defective in NF-κB stimulation induced by PMA/Ca2+ ionophore, suggesting that Bcl10 acts downstream of PKC in the antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway (14Ruland J.

Until now, proteins operating upstream of the Bcl10-MALT1 signaling complex have not been definitively identified. MALT1, a proposed downstream effector of Bcl10, does not contain a CARD, and therefore cannot participate in a CARD/CARD interaction with Bcl10. Recently, the protein CARD9 was identified as a CARD-containing protein that interacts selectively with the CARD of Bcl10, but the physiological significance of this binding has not yet been explored (19Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.-L. Merriam S. Du M.-Q. Dyer M.J.S. Robison K.E. Distefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41082-41086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanisms by which surface receptors and PKC activation are linked to Bcl10 are unknown. Here we characterize a new Bcl10-binding molecule, Bimp1 (Bcl10-interacting MAGUKprotein), a CARD-containing protein with homology to CARD9. Unlike CARD9, Bimp1 contains Src homology (SH3), Z0–1 homologous (PDZ), and guanylate kinase (GUK)-like domains. Bimp1 is a member of the MAGUK (membrane-associatedguanylate kinase) family, a class of proteins that function as molecular scaffolds in assembling multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane (20Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryan P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We show that Bimp1 is a component of a novel NF-κB signaling pathway that links surface receptor signaling and PKC activation to Bcl10, MALT1, and the IκB kinases (IKKs). The nucleotide sequence of cDNAs encoding peptides with homology to the CARD of CARD9 (GenBankTM accession number AF311287) were found in the EST data bases of GenBankTM using the TBLASTN program. cDNAs encoding a full-length coding region corresponding to Bimp1 and Bimp2 were obtained from Incyte Genomics Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The authencity of the cDNAs was verified by DNA sequencing. A 430-base pair fragment of Bimp1 cDNA was obtained by digestion with BlnI andPmlI. The fragment was radiolabeled by random priming using a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then used to probe a mouse poly(A)+ multi-tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH Laboratories).

Moscat (Universidad Autonoma, Madrid, Spain), and the pCMV-CD4/TLR2 expression plasmid was provided by R. Metzhitov (Yale University School of Medicine). The plasmids pcDNA3-Bimp1 (HA and FLAG), pcDNA3-Bimp1-CARD-FLAG, pcDNA3-Bimp1ΔCARD-FLAG and pcDNA3-Bimp2-HA were created using a polymerase chain reaction method. For Bimp1, the cDNA insert of EST clone BE287025 was used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction reaction using Bimp1-specific primers to generate wild-type Bimp1, Bimp1-CARD (residues 1–116), and Bimp1ΔCARD (residues 117–1021). The inserts were subcloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG and pcDNA3-HA expression vectors. For Bimp2, the cDNA insert of EST clone BF100075 was used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction reaction to generate a fragment that was ligated into pcDNA3-HA. All inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. 2 × 105 HEK293T cells were plated in standard 12-well culture dishes and transfected with the reporter constructs pEF1-BOS-β-gal (30 ng) and pBVIx-Luc (3.0 ng) plus the indicated expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate method. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 vector such that it was constant within each individual experiment. NF-κB activation was assessed by measuring luciferase activity (normalized for β-galactosidase expression) in cell extracts 24 h after transfection (8Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J.

For transfections of Rat-1 and 5R fibroblast cell lines, 0.5 × 105 cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with indicated expression plasmids as described (13Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M.

The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and the lysates were assayed for NF-κB activation as described above. In experiments using the T-cell hybridoma cell line 68-41, 1 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 ng of pBVIx-Luc and 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega), 10 ng of pcDNA3-p35 plus 50 ng of indicated expression plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method, and NF-κB induction was assessed using the dual luciferase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). 10 ng/ml of TNFα was added to the medium 4 h prior to harvest when indicated. For cells treated with PMA/Ca2+ ionophore, 50 ng/ml of PMA and 0.7 µg/ml of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 were added to the medium 4 h prior to harvest. 68-41 cells were stimulated with 5 µg/ml anti-CD3 2C11 coated onto 12-well plates 4 h prior to harvest when indicated. Bcl10 −/− and Bcl10 +/− MEFs were generated as described (14Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W.

For transfections of Bcl10 +/− and Bcl10 −/− MEFs, 1 × 105 cells/well were plated 24 h prior to transfection. 750 ng of pEF1-BOS-β-gal and 250 ng of pBVIx-Luc plus indicated expression plasmids were transfected using the Superfect (Qiagen) system. The cells were lysed and assayed 48 h after transfection using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MEFs from IKKα-, IKKβ-, and double IKKα/β-deficient mice were generated as described (28Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected as indicated above for Rat-1 cells. HEK293T cells were harvested 24 h following transfection and lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (29Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Bimp1 and its binding partners were immunoprecipitated by combining 25 µl of a 50% suspension of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) with 1 ml of soluble cell lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Santa Cruz) antibodies. In an effort to identify potential binding partners that could participate in a CARD/CARD interaction with Bcl10, we searched public data bases of ESTs for clones with homology to the CARD of CARD9 (19Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.-L. Merriam S. Du M.-Q. Dyer M.J.S. Robison K.E. Distefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Sequence analysis of one of the ESTs obtained from our search revealed a mouse cDNA that encodes a 1021-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 114 kDa. This protein was designated Bimp1 (Fig. 1 A). A search for a human orthologue revealed several overlapping partial cDNAs that could be constructed to form a single open reading frame encoding a 1032-amino acid protein with 90% identity to the mouse sequence. The corresponding human gene mapped to chromosome 22q13 (GenBankTM accession numbers AL022315 and AL049851). In our search, we also identified a second mouse cDNA encoding a protein with significant homology to Bimp1 that we have designated Bimp2 (Fig.1 A). Bimp2 is 1000 amino acids in length with a predicted molecular mass of 113 kDa.Figure 1Sequence and domain structure of Bimp 1 and Bimp2.

Hydrophobic and aromatic residues are highlighted inblack. Positively charged residues are shown in dark gray shading, and negatively charged residues are in light gray shading.

The expression of Bimp1 mRNA in various mouse tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Sk., skeletal; kb, kilobases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the amino acid sequence of Bimp1 revealed that its structure is comprised of five putative functional domains: an N-terminal CARD, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal structure comprised of SH3, PDZ, and GUK-like domains (Fig.1 B). The presence of the PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains identifies Bimp1 and Bimp2 as members of the growing MAGUK family of proteins (20Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryan P.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These proteins serve as molecular scaffolds for signaling pathway components by utilizing multiple protein/protein interaction domains to cluster receptors, adaptor proteins, and cytosolic signaling proteins at the cell membrane (20Dimitratos S.D.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The central coiled-coil structure in Bimp1 is predicted to participate in protein oligomerization (30Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The CARD of Bimp1 does share some degree of sequence homology with the CARD of a variety of cell death pathway components (Fig. 1 C), but it is most strikingly similar to the CARD of CARD9 (47% identity) and Bimp2 (47% identity) (19Bertin J. Guo Y. Wang L. Srinivasula S.M. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.-L. Merriam S. Du M.-Q. Dyer M.J.S. Robison K.E. Distefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41082-41086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). We performed Northern blot analysis to determine the distribution of Bimp1 transcripts in various mouse tissues. A ∼6.8-kilobase Bimp1 transcript was detected in all tissues examined including heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testes (Fig. 1 D). The transcript was most abundant in heart and kidney. A smaller ∼3.8-kilobase Bimp1 transcript was also detected in brain but was not detected in any of the other tissues sampled (Fig. 1 D) The significance of this alternative form of Bimp1 mRNA is not currently known. Several CARD-containing proteins, including Bcl10, have been shown to induce NF-κB activation (8Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Hottiger M.O. Nabel G. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9955-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). To test whether Bimp1 activates NF-κB, a Bimp1 expression plasmid was co-transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid. HA-tagged Bimp1 induced NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of ∼250-fold induction as compared with empty vector (Fig. 2 A). Transfection of untagged Bimp-1 expression plasmid also resulted in NF-κB activation, showing that this activity cannot be attributed to the epitope tag (data not shown). To test the importance of the CARD of Bimp1 in NF-κB activation, we utilized two mutants of Bimp1, one that lacked the entire CARD (Bimp1ΔCARD) and one that contained only the CARD (Bimp1CARD) (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of the CARD completely abolished NF-κB activation, indicating that the CARD is essential for Bimp1-mediated NF-κB signaling (Fig. 2 B). However, the Bimp1CARD mutant was also inactive when expressed by itself, suggesting that Bimp1 domains other than the CARD are also required for NF-κB-inducing activity. Immunoblotting confirmed that the mutant forms of Bimp1 were expressed as effectively as wild-type Bimp1 (Fig.2 B, inset). In response to certain stiumuli, IκB is phosphorylated by the IKK complex, which includes two IκB kinases, IKKα and β, and one regulatory subunit, IKKγ. The phosphorylation of IκB leads to its ubiquitination and degradation, thus allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it activates transcription of target genes (31Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex in Bimp1 signaling, we tested the ability of Bimp1 to induce NF-κB activation in wild-type MEFs and in MEFs deficient in IKKα or IKKβ subunit or both (28Li Q. Estepa G. Memet S. Israel A. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bimp1 induced comparable levels of NF-κB activation in wild-type MEFs and MEFs deficient in IKKβ but reduced levels in cells deficient in IKKα (Fig.3 A). No detectable Bimp1-mediated NF-κB induction was observed in MEFs deficient in both IKKα and IKKβ subunits (Fig. 3 A). Transfection of Nod1, a molecule known to activate NF-κB through the IKK complex yielded similar results (Fig. 3 A) (22Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In control experiments, expression of IKKβ effectively induced NF-κB activation in cells lacking IKKα/IKKβ, showing that NF-κB signaling machinery downstream of the IKK complex is intact in these MEFs (data not shown). To determine whether the IKKγ regulatory subunit was important for Bimp1-mediated NF-κB activation, we co-expressed Bimp1 with a dominant negative form of IKKγ that lacks amino acids 1–134 and is therefore unable to bind IKKα and β (23Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the dominant negative IKKγ resulted in effective inhibition of Bimp1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 B). The IKKγ dominant negative mutant did not block NF-κB activation mediated by IKKi, a kinase that is known to activate NF-κB independently of IKKγ (27Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). As a positive control, a dominant negative form of IκBα (IκBα-S32A/S36A), which cannot be phosphorylated and therefore cannot be degraded (26Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), blocked both Bimp1 and IKKi-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 B). A dominant negative form of MyD88, a key factor in NF-κB signaling from the interleukin-1/Toll receptors (25Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Gosh S. Janeway C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), did not block either Bimp1 or IKKi-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 B). Using a different approach, we confirmed the requirement for IKKγ in Bimp1 signaling by testing NF-κB induction in the IKKγ-defective 5R cell line, a derivative of the Rat-1 fibroblast line (32Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). While in the parental Rat-1 cells Bimp1 effectively induced NF-κB, we observed no Bimp1-mediated NF-κB activation in the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells (Fig. 3 C). As a control, treatment of cells with TNFα was also unable to activate NF-κB in IKKγ-deficient cells. In contrast, transfection with IKKβ, which is downstream of IKKγ in this signaling pathway, activated NF-κB in both the parental Rat-1 cells as well as the IKKγ-deficient 5R cells, showing that the NF-κB transcriptional machinery remained intact"
https://openalex.org/W2059569036,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear pore complex is a supramolecular assembly of 30 nucleoporins that cooperatively facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. Thirteen nucleoporins that contain FG peptide repeats (FG Nups) are proposed to function as stepping stones in karyopherin-mediated transport pathways. Here, protein interactions that occur at individual FG Nups were sampled using immobilized nucleoporins and yeast extracts. We find that many proteins bind to FG Nups in highly reproducible patterns. Among 135 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, most were karyopherins and nucleoporins. The PSFG nucleoporin Nup42p and the GLFG nucleoporins Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p exhibited generic interactions with karyopherins; each bound 6–10 different karyopherin βs, including importins as well as exportins. Unexpectedly, the same Nups also captured the hexameric Nup84p complex and Nup2p. In contrast, the FXFG nucleoporins Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p were more selective and captured mostly the Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimer. When the concentration of Gsp1p-GTP was elevated in the extracts to mimic the nucleoplasmic environment, the patterns of interacting proteins changed; exportins exhibited enhanced binding to FG Nups, and importins exhibited reduced binding. The results demonstrate a global role for Gsp1p-GTP on karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions and provide a rudimentary map of the routes that karyopherins take as they cross the nuclear pore complex.

Among 135 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, most were karyopherins and nucleoporins. The PSFG nucleoporin Nup42p and the GLFG nucleoporins Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p exhibited generic interactions with karyopherins; each bound 6–10 different karyopherin βs, including importins as well as exportins. Unexpectedly, the same Nups also captured the hexameric Nup84p complex and Nup2p. In contrast, the FXFG nucleoporins Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p were more selective and captured mostly the Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimer. When the concentration of Gsp1p-GTP was elevated in the extracts to mimic the nucleoplasmic environment, the patterns of interacting proteins changed; exportins exhibited enhanced binding to FG Nups, and importins exhibited reduced binding. The results demonstrate a global role for Gsp1p-GTP on karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions and provide a rudimentary map of the routes that karyopherins take as they cross the nuclear pore complex. nuclear pore complex nuclear pore complex protein GTPase activating protein glutathione S-transferase matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight small ubiquitin-like modifier The nuclear pore complex (NPC)1 forms an aqueous conduit between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of cells that allows passive diffusion of small molecules and facilitates transport of macromolecules (1Talcott B. Moore M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae 30 distinct nucleoporins (Nups or nuclear pore complex proteins) interact to form an NPC, and each Nup is present in many copies per NPC (2Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Mobile receptors termed karyopherin βs (importins, exportins, and transportins) recognize nuclear import or export signals of cargo molecules and facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport by interacting with nucleoporins (3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thirteen yeast nucleoporins that contain FG peptide repeats (FG Nups) (Fig. 1 A) are proposed to function as stepping stones for karyopherin-mediated transport reactions (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), but the actual mechanism of protein transport across the NPC is unknown.The GTPase Gsp1p binds directly to karyopherin βs and modulates their interaction with cargo and nucleoporins (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Because of the cytoplasmic location of Rna1p (the Gsp1p GTPase activating protein (GAP)) and the nucleoplasmic location of Prp20p (the Gsp1p guanine nucleotide exchange factor), it is generally assumed that the GTP-bound form of Gsp1p is more abundant in the nucleoplasm than in the cytoplasm, thus creating a gradient of Gsp1p-GTP across the nuclear envelope (6Gørlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). A steep gradient of Gsp1p-GTP across the NPC is thought to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport. Indeed, Gsp1p-GTP binding to importins causes dissociation of their cargo whereas Gsp1p-GTP binding to exportins enhances their association with cargo (5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The effect of Gsp1p-GTP on karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions is less well characterized. In some cases, it has been shown that Gsp1p-GTP causes dissociation of importins from FG Nups (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 7Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and enhances association of exportins with FG Nups (8Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16279-16286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Knowledge of all protein interactions that occur at each nucleoporin within the NPC would greatly enhance our understanding of the transport mechanism.DISCUSSIONKaryopherins exhibited a wide range of binding interactions with the immobilized FG Nups, and in most cases Gsp1p-GTP modulated the interactions. These results support the hypothesis that Gsp1p-GTP promotes the association and dissociation of karyopherins and FG nucleoporins to facilitate transport of karyopherin·cargo complexes across the NPC (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The fact that each FG Nup captured a highly reproducible set of proteins that included mostly karyopherins and nucleoporins and that interactions changed in a Gsp1p-GTP dependent manner, suggests that all binding interactions detected here are highly specific and may reflect the true occupancy of these nucleoporins in vivo. Karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions not detected here but detected elsewhere using more sensitive techniques (i.e. two-hybrid assays, overlay assays, Western blots, etc.) (20Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) may be too low in affinity to score with our assay.The exportins Msn5p and Crm1p were the most abundant karyopherins detected bound to immobilized Nups. Binding of Crm1p to FG Nups was significantly enhanced by Gsp1p-GTP (see Fig. 2 B, for example), yet binding of Msn5p to the Nups was not, implying that Msn5p is not a stereotypical exportin. Indeed, Msn5p is unique among karyopherins in that it carries cargo in both directions across the NPC (14Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida K. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The observation that Kap120p associates best with FG Nups in the presence of Gsp1p-GTP (Fig. 2) provides biochemical evidence that it is an exportin, a suggestion previously made based on genetic data (16Stage-Zimmermann T. Schmidt U. Silver P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3777-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, no exportins were detected bound to the FG Nups of the nuclear basket structure (i.e. Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p) (Figs. 2 and 3) even though these Nups are at the nucleoplasmic entryway of the NPC. In stark contrast, the exportin Crm1p binds tightly to Nup42p, a component of cytoplasmic fibrils at the opposite end of the NPC; their tight interaction resists extraction by 1m NaCl (Fig. 2 A, lane 3, bottom panel). In comparison, the binding avidity of Crm1p toward FG Nups of the central transporter region (i.e. Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p) is clearly “intermediate” relative to the avidity of Crm1p for FG Nups of the nuclear basket or cytoplasmic fibrils (Fig. 2). Thus, it would appear that Crm1p binds FG Nups with increasing affinity as it moves along the NPC out of the nucleus (i.e. little or no binding to FG Nups in the nuclear basket, intermediate binding to FG Nups in the transporter region, and strong binding to FG Nups in the cytoplasmic fibrils). A similar hierarchy of binding sites provided by FG Nups is proposed to aid the movement of importins across the NPC but in the opposite direction (17Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In that model, Nups located in the nuclear basket structure would function as an “affinity trap” by providing the highest affinity docking sites for importins anywhere in the NPC (2Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, the three yeast nuclear basket Nups (Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p) did not bind all importins with high affinity as predicted by that model. In fact, these nuclear basket Nups had an exclusive preference for Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers and Kap123p in the case of Nup60p (Figs. 2 and 3). We therefore suggest that most importins (except Kap95p·Kap60p) do not use an affinity-trap mechanism at the nuclear basket structure to move directionally across the NPC.It is currently unknown how importins of the karyopherin β family exit the nucleus, but it is generally assumed that each departs in a complex with Gsp1p-GTP. However, at least in the case of the importin Kap95p, Gsp1p-GTP interferes with its binding to most FG Nups when using all purified proteins in solution binding assays (data not shown). A similar situation occurs with mammalian components; binding of RanGTP to purified importin β blocks its binding to all FG Nups except Nup358 (19Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is therefore unclear how Kap95p·Gsp1p-GTP complexes interact with the NPC to move out of the nucleus. In that regard it is interesting to note that in the context of yeast extracts, binding of Kap95p to immobilized FG Nups was diminished (in most cases) but not prevented by the excess of Gsp1p-GTP added, even though the interaction between Kap95p and Kap60p was completely abolished (for the best example see Fig. 2 E). Gsp1-GTP disrupts the Kap95p·Kap60p complex via direct binding to Kap95p (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Thus, an auxiliary factor(s) in yeast extracts may stabilize binding of Kap95p·Gsp1p-GTP heterodimers to FG Nups such as Nup42p, Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p (Fig. 2, A–E).Four of the fourteen yeast karyopherin βs (3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were absent from the list of proteins captured by the FG Nups. Missing were the importins Nmd5p and Kap114p and the exportins Cse1p and Los1p. Several possibilities can explain this unexpected result. The missing Kaps could have degraded in the yeast extract or may be naturally scarce in abundance. However, in the case of Nmd5p and Cse1p, Western blots with specific antibodies confirmed their presence in yeast extracts at the expected molecular weight. The presence of Los1p and Kap114p could not be tested in the same manner as specific antibodies were unavailable. We favor the explanation that Nmd5p, Kap114p, Cse1p, and Los1p were not captured simply because they exhibit low affinities toward the FG Nups (K d weaker than 1 µm). In fact, we find that Cse1p binds Kap60p and Gsp1p-GTP with high affinity in solution binding assays with all purified proteins yet fails to bind stably to the immobilized FG Nups (with the exception of Nup116p to which it binds weakly) (data not shown). In that aspect, Nup116p was unique among the FG Nups tested as it also was the only nucleoporin that captured the importins Mtr10p and Pdr6p (Fig. 2 E). Hence Nup116p may constitute the most permissive and generic docking site for karyopherins within the NPC.The mRNA-binding proteins Mex67p and Pab1p were among the proteins captured by the FG Nups. Mex67p promotes mRNA export from the nucleus and binds FG Nups (21Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 22Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Strawn L.A. Shen T. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 6445-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, we detected Mex67p bound to Nup100p using mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 D) and detected it bound to most other FG Nups using Western blots also with specific antibodies. A technical limitation made difficult the mass spectrometric identification of Mex67p in our experiments. This is because the interaction of Mex67p with FG Nups is resistant to extraction with 1 m NaCl but is disrupted efficiently with 1 m MgCl2 or SDS. Unfortunately, these harsher extraction conditions also remove the GST-Nups from the beads which in turn mask any Mex67p present in the SDS eluates; Mex67p is similar in molecular size (67 kDa) to five of the eight GST-Nups used (60–80 kDa). Nevertheless, a small amount of Mex67p was extracted by NaCl from the FG Nups, and in the case of Nup100p, it was sufficient to detect it by mass spectrometry as the protein between Pab1p and Kap60p (Fig. 2 D). A protein band at the same location is also visible in Nup49p, Nup57p, and Nup116p NaCl eluates and is likely Mex67p (Fig. 2, B, C, and E;lanes 1). However, its presence in the NaCl eluates was scarce and variable making it difficult to identify by mass spectrometry. Pab1p is an abundant poly(A) RNA-binding protein required for the initiation of translation (24Tarun S.Z.J. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 25Gray N.K. Coller J.M. Dickson K.S. Wickens M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). mRNA did not mediate its binding to FG Nups (Fig. 2, lanes 1), as treatment of the yeast extracts with RNase did not diminish the amount of Pab1p bound (data not shown). As purified Pab1p does not bind directly to FG Nups (data not shown), its interaction is likely bridged by an unidentified factor.The FG Nups can be categorized in three distinct groups based on their location within the NPC, their content of FG motifs, and the patterns of karyopherins bound. The PSFG Nups (containing SAFGXPSFG motifs) are located in the cytoplasmic fibrils, the GLFG Nups are located in the central transporter region, and the FXFG Nups (except for Nsp1p) are located in the nuclear basket structure (Figs. 1and 3) (2Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). In regard to karyopherin binding, the PSFG nucleoporin Nup42p and the central GLFG nucleoporins Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p (Fig. 1) exhibited generic interactions with karyopherins; each bound 6–10 different karyopherin βs including exportins as well as importins (Figs. 2 and 3). In contrast, the FXFG nucleoporins of the nuclear basket structure (Nup1p, Nup2p, and Nup60p) bound mostly Kap95p· Kap60p heterodimers (Fig.2, F–H, lanes 1) and one additional importin (Kap123p) in the case of Nup60p (Fig. 2 F). The apparent preference for Kap95p·Kap60p by FXFG Nups may be a consequence of the amino acid sequences surrounding the FG motif. In the FXFG Nups these regions are highly charged whereas in GLFG and PSFG Nups they are mostly uncharged. Alternatively, the binding specificity may be related to the presence of two phenylalanine residues in close proximity to each other: the FXF motif. Indeed, the phenylalanines in FXFG peptides are a dominant feature in the binding interface between importin β (vertebrate Kap95p) and a peptide containing FXFG peptide repeats (26Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).The capture of the Nup84p complex by all GLFG and PSFG Nups (but not by FXFG Nups) was surprising (Fig. 2, A—E, and Fig.3). The Nup84p subcomplex consists of the six proteins Nup84p, Nup85p, Nup120p, Sec13p, Seh1p, and the C terminus of Nup145p (cNup145p) that altogether play essential roles in nuclear pore biogenesis and nuclear export of polyadenylated RNA (27Siniossoglou S. Lutzmann M. Santos-Rosa H. Leonard K. Mueller S. Aebi U. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sec13p and Seh1p were not among the proteins identified here as they are smaller than 60 kDa, our arbitrary cutoff point for protein identification. Binding of the Nup84p complex to the immobilized Nups was not mediated by karyopherins as the amounts of Nup84p complex bound did not change (as karyopherins did) in experiments that contained Gsp1p-GTP (Fig. 2). It is attractive to speculate that the Nup84p complex interacts directly with FG repeat regions of Nups to move within the NPC much like karyopherins do. Alternatively, the Nup84p complex may perform a more structural role. It may be a component of the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings of the NPC that binds FG Nups to stabilize or manipulate their structure. Notably, the nucleoporin Nup133p and the Nup84p complex co-fractionate when binding FG Nups (Figs. 2 and 3) and when fractionated in sizing columns after extraction from Nup100p beads (data not shown); thus, we suggest that Nup133p is a component of the Nup84p complex.It was also surprising to find Nup2p among the proteins captured by the FG Nups (Figs. 2 and 3). Its interaction with PSFG and GLFG Nups (and its modulation by Gsp1p-GTP) always coincided with the presence of Kap60p (Figs. 2 and 3). Binding of Nup2p to PSFG and GLFG Nups was mediated by Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers as demonstrated by stepwise reconstitution in solution binding assays with all purified proteins (data not shown). In the case of Nup60p, however, its interaction with Nup2p is direct and is enhanced by Gsp1p- GTP (Fig.2 F). 2D. Denning, B. Mykytka, N. P. C. Allen, L. Huang, A. Burlingame, and M. Rexach, submitted for publication. Altogether the results imply that Nup2p is a mobile nucleoporin that uses its interaction with Kap95p· Kap60p to move across the NPC.Curiously Nup42p served as a stable docking site for Rna1p (the Gsp1p GAP) when the concentration of Gsp1p-GTP was increased (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The interaction between Rna1p and Nup42p was mediated by Crm1p as demonstrated by stepwise reconstitution in solution binding assays with purified proteins (data not shown). The fact that Rna1p has a nuclear export signal recognized by Crm1p (28Feng W. Benko A.L. Lee J.H. Stanford D.R. Hopper A.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar) explains their interaction. The interaction between Rna1p, Crm1p, and Nup42p may provide a mechanism by which S. cerevisiae NPCs concentrate Rna1p at the cytoplasmic fibrils, much like vertebrate cells concentrate RanGAP (via SUMO-1) at Nup358, an FG Nup in cytoplasmic fibrils (29Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 30Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Rna1p was also detected bound to Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p in a Gsp1p-GTP dependent manner but at reduced levels (data not shown); this is consistent with the proposal that Rna1p shuttles across the NPC (28Feng W. Benko A.L. Lee J.H. Stanford D.R. Hopper A.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar).The observation that Sec23p interacts with Nup42p and to a lesser extent with Nup116p (Fig. 2, A and E, lanes 3) is interesting because a genetic link between vesicular transport and the nuclear transport machinery has been reported (31Nanduri J. Mitra S. Andrei C. Liu Y., Yu, Y. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33785-33789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sec23p is a structural component of COPII vesicle coats and functions as the Sar1p GAP (32Yoshihisa T. Barlowe C. Schekman R. Science. 1993; 259: 1466-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); it also exhibits genetic interactions with Sec13p, which is a component of the Nup84p complex (33Siniossoglou S. Wimmer C. Rieger M. Doye V. Tekotte H. Weise C. Emig S. Segref A. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1996; 84: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and of COPII complexes (34Barlowe C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A binding partner of Sec23p, Sfb2p/Iss1p (35Peng R. De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11521-11528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was also detected among the proteins bound to Nup42p (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). We speculate that Sec23p modulates a putative interaction between the Nup84p complex and the nuclear pore membrane in a manner similar to its modulation of COPII binding to membranes (34Barlowe C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The remainder of proteins identified included potential cargoes for karyopherins (the nuclear proteins Lpg15p, Nop8p, Rsc1p, Smc2p, and Tfc1p), known cargoes for Kap104p (Nab2p and Nab4p) (36Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), several cytoplasmic proteins (Ded1p, Eft2p, Rpl2ap, Tef2p, and Tof1p), one protein of unknown function (Ydr101cp), one peripheral protein of the plasma membrane (Ede1p) (37Gagny B. Wiederkehr A. Dumoulin P. Winsor B. Riezman H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3309-3319PubMed Google Scholar), and several heat shock proteins (Hsps). The presence of Ssa1p and Ssa2p Hsps among the proteins bound may be related to their auxiliary role in nuclear import reactions involving Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimers (38Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Lastly, a few additional nucleoporins were detected bound to select FG Nups (i.e.Nup57p captured Nsp1p, Nup100p captured Nup188p and Nup170p, and Nup116p captured Nup60p). An interaction of Nup116p with Nup60p and Nup100p with Nup188p and Nup170p has not been previously reported; the interaction of Nsp1p with Nup57p is well documented (39Schlaich N.L. Haner M. Lustig A. Aebi U. Hurt E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Fig. 3 lists all protein interactions detected in our proteomic survey and denotes with an asterisk interactions previously reported in the literature. Note that most of the interactions discovered here are novel. This proteomic approach will be useful in the identification of additional networks of protein interactions and their dynamic response to cellular cues. The nuclear pore complex (NPC)1 forms an aqueous conduit between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of cells that allows passive diffusion of small molecules and facilitates transport of macromolecules (1Talcott B. Moore M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae 30 distinct nucleoporins (Nups or nuclear pore complex proteins) interact to form an NPC, and each Nup is present in many copies per NPC (2Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Mobile receptors termed karyopherin βs (importins, exportins, and transportins) recognize nuclear import or export signals of cargo molecules and facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport by interacting with nucleoporins (3Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thirteen yeast nucleoporins that contain FG peptide repeats (FG Nups) (Fig. 1 A) are proposed to function as stepping stones for karyopherin-mediated transport reactions (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), but the actual mechanism of protein transport across the NPC is unknown. The GTPase Gsp1p binds directly to karyopherin βs and modulates their interaction with cargo and nucleoporins (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Because of the cytoplasmic location of Rna1p (the Gsp1p GTPase activating protein (GAP)) and the nucleoplasmic location of Prp20p (the Gsp1p guanine nucleotide exchange factor), it is generally assumed that the GTP-bound form of Gsp1p is more abundant in the nucleoplasm than in the cytoplasm, thus creating a gradient of Gsp1p-GTP across the nuclear envelope (6Gørlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). A steep gradient of Gsp1p-GTP across the NPC is thought to drive nucleocytoplasmic transport. Indeed, Gsp1p-GTP binding to importins causes dissociation of their cargo whereas Gsp1p-GTP binding to exportins enhances their association with cargo (5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The effect of Gsp1p-GTP on karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions is less well characterized. In some cases, it has been shown that Gsp1p-GTP causes dissociation of importins from FG Nups (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 7Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and enhances association of exportins with FG Nups (8Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16279-16286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Knowledge of all protein interactions that occur at each nucleoporin within the NPC would greatly enhance our understanding of the transport mechanism. DISCUSSIONKaryopherins exhibited a wide range of binding interactions with the immobilized FG Nups, and in most cases Gsp1p-GTP modulated the interactions. These results support the hypothesis that Gsp1p-GTP promotes the association and dissociation of karyopherins and FG nucleoporins to facilitate transport of karyopherin·cargo complexes across the NPC (4Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The fact that each FG Nup captured a highly reproducible set of proteins that included mostly karyopherins and nucleoporins and that interactions changed in a Gsp1p-GTP dependent manner, suggests that all binding interactions detected here are highly specific and may reflect the true occupancy of these nucleoporins in vivo. Karyopherin-nucleoporin interactions not detected here but detected elsewhere using more sensitive techniques (i.e. two-hybrid assays, overlay assays, Western blots, etc.) (20Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) may be too low in affinity to score with our assay.The exportins Msn5p and Crm1p were the most abundant karyopherins detected bound to immobilized Nups. Binding of Crm1p to FG Nups was significantly enhanced by Gsp1p-GTP (see Fig. 2 B, for example), yet binding of Msn5p to the Nups was not, implying that Msn5p is not a stereotypical exportin. Indeed, Msn5p is unique among karyopherins in that it carries cargo in both directions across the NPC (14Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Neill E.M. Huang L.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 1998; 396: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida K. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The observation that Kap120p associates best with FG Nups in the presence of Gsp1p-GTP (Fig. 2) provides biochemical evidence that it is an exportin, a suggestion previously made based on genetic data (16Stage-Zimmermann T. Schmidt U. Silver P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3777-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, no exportins were detected bound to the FG Nups of the nuclear basket"

However, the pathway for ATP release and the eliciting physiological stimulus are unclear. Recently, we showed that ATP activates P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors on pancreatic ducts. Thus, it was relevant to ask whether the upstream acini could be the source of releasable ATP and what the stimulus might be. We used freshly prepared rat pancreatic acini and applied conventional luminescence measurements of luciferin/luciferase reaction. As a new application of this reaction in confocal microscopy, we monitored luciferin fluorescence as a sign of ATP release by single acini. In addition we used quinacrine to mark ATP stores, which were similar to those marked with fluorescent ATP, 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate, but only partially overlapping with those marked by acridine orange and LysoTracker Red. In functional studies we show that native pancreatic acini release ATP in response to various stimuli but most importantly to cholinergic stimulation, a very likely physiological stimulus in this epithelium. In a close vicinity of acini we detect about 9 µm ATP after cholinergic stimulation. Thus, ATP is poised as the paracrine mediator between pancreatic acini and ducts.

ATP and other nucleotides can be released from various cells by several mechanisms including a nonselective release from cytoplasm, transport via a plasma membrane transporter, or a release from exocytotic granules where ATP is compartmentalized. The latter type of ATP release is found in neuronal, neuro-endocrine, and endocrine cells (1Fields R.D. Stevens B. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2White T.D. Bourke J.E. Livett B.G. J.

Endocrinology. 1975; 96: 662-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In epithelia many stimuli can elicit release of ATP by yet unresolved mechanisms, and in many cases it is not clear to what extent these are physiological rather than experimental stimuli. For example, in epithelia ATP release has been shown in response to stretch, stress, and cell volume changes (4Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Salter K.D. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). As one of the possible mechanisms, it has been discussed whether the intracellular ATP is transported by ATP-binding cassette proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (7Grygorczyk R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.-H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Pancreatic ducts contain a number of luminal and also basolateral purinergic receptors from both P2X and P2Y families (P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2, and P2Y4) (9Hede S.E. Amstrup J. Christoffersen B.C. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31784-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to find where ATP is released and under what conditions. Pancreatic acini form the bulk of the pancreatic tissue, they surround pancreatic ducts, and empty their enzyme-rich secretion into the ductal lumen. The major aim of the present study was to find whether acini are the source of releasable ATP and to find the possible physiological stimulus. One hurdle in ATP research field is the difficulty of monitoring ATP release directly from living cells. Presently, the most commonly used method is the luminometer measurement of photon generation from the reaction of luciferin and ATP that is catalyzed by luciferase. When applied to a group of cells, mostly cultured cells, however, it is not possible to distinguish between ATP releases from healthy cells compared with release from lysed or dead cells (see below). Consequently, a lot of effort has been put into developing new methods to monitor ATP release (10Hazama A. Hayashi S. Okada Y. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 437: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schneider S.W.

In the present study, in an extension of the conventional luminescence methods on pancreatic acini, we developed new methods of monitoring of ATP release in single acini utilizing luciferin fluorescence, as well as quinacrine and MANT-ATP1 fluorescence detected by the confocal laser scanning microscopy. All standard chemicals, Collagenase V, and quinacrine dihydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. Fluorophores, H2DIDS, luciferin, and luciferase were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). The ATP bioluminescence kit HS II was from (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tissue culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Pancreas was obtained from female Wistar rats and cut into small pieces. For some experiments pancreatic lobules were dissected with sharpened forceps and used without further treatments. Acinar preparation was based on our earlier published method of collagenase digestion with some modifications (13Novak I. Hug M.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 5: 344-352Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tissue was incubated with 1.3 mg/ml collagenase V for 40 min and finely dispersed by passages through glass pipettes. Homogenized suspension was passed through a 150-µm nylon filter, and acini were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1000/Ham's F-12 medium. Finally, acini were suspended in 3 ml of bicarbonate-free Ringer (−BIC) containing 145 mmol/liter Na+, 3.6 mmol/liter K+, 1.5 mmol/liter Ca2+, 1 mmol/liter Mg2+, 122 mmol/liter Cl−, 25 mmol/liter gluconate, 2 mmol/liter phosphate, 5 mmol/liter glucose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.25 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (pH 7.4). After equilibration for 15–20 min at 37 °C, the acinar suspension was gently rotated to ensure proper mixing of the cells, except for experiments shown in Fig. 1. A hypotonic shock was induced by reducing NaCl from 122 mmol/liter to 72 mmol/liter by exchanging half of the −BIC medium with a medium containing 30 mmol/liter NaCl. In one series of experiments acini were stimulated with carbachol (CCH). Samples of supernatants were taken at timed intervals, and each sample was immediately centrifuged (15 s at 1000 × g) to remove cells possibly present in the supernatant and heated to 98 °C for 1 min to eliminate ecto-nucleotidase activity. The amount of ATP in the samples was measured using the high sensitivity ATP bioluminescence kit HS II following the instructions of the manufacturer. ATP standards were dissolved in the same medium used for cell suspensions. For ATP measurements 100 µl of luciferin-luciferase reagent was injected into a 100-µl sample or an ATP standard. The resulting light emission was measured in our laboratory-made luminometer. Standard curves were generated for each series of measurements. ATP concentrations in the supernatant were normalized to 10% cytocrit. A confocal spectral laser scanning microscope (Leica SP CLSM, Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Germany) equipped with ArKr and UV lasers and 63× 1.2NA PL APO and 20× 1.7 NA HC PL APO objectives was used to monitor fluorescent signals. The real frame scanning time for time series was usually set at 0.88 s for 512 × 512 pixels. Emission intensities of various fluorophores were selected with the CLSM spectrophotometer unit and collected with a photomultiplier. Analysis of the data was performed with Leica's physiology package software and MetaMorph 4.0 software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA). The tissues were held in the experimental chamber by means of holding pipettes and/or attached to a coverslip with Cell-Tak (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA). The tissues/cells were suspended in the control −BIC, and the experiments were performed at 25 °C. For volume measurements, acini were loaded with 5 µmcalcein acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min (14Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal was monitored at 500–540 nm upon 488 nm excitation. Putative ATP stores in pancreatic cells were monitored with quinacrine. The cells were incubated with 1–5 µm quinacrine dihydrochloride for 5–15 min, and fluorescence was detected at 490–540 nm with 476 nm excitation. For detection of acidic organelles, pancreatic tissues were incubated with 5 µm acridine orange for 15–20 min or with 25–50 nm LysoTracker Red for 40–50 min. Acridine orange was excited with 476 and 488 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 510–550 and 620–680 nm. LysoTracker Red was excited with 568 nm, and the fluorescence signal was detected at 580–640 nm. In several experiments acini were incubated with 25–50 µm MANT-ATP for 1–5 h in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 100/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Upon excitation with 364 nm, the fluorescence signal was detected at 430–480 nm. Unlike other fluorophores used in this study, MANT-ATP bleached relatively fast. Luciferin-luciferase reagent (HSII) was added to pancreatic cells (about 10% cytocrit) suspended in −BIC solution in a 1:5 dilution, and the luciferin fluorescence measurements were begun within 10 min. In some experiments D-luciferin (0–1.67 mm) and luciferase (25–188 µg/ml) were added separately. All of the experiments were performed at 25 °C. Luciferin was excited with 364 nm, and the emission fluorescence was monitored at 510–550 nm (see “Results”). In measurements on pancreatic cells fluorescence signals were collected from regions around and inside of acini. Pancreatic cells were stimulated with carbachol and as a control with −BIC blanks. ATP concentration was determined indirectly as a disappearance of the substrate luciferin, utilizing the luciferin fluorescence. Subsequently, one or more concentrations of ATP were used for in situ calibrations. Agonists dissolved in small volumes were added directly to the bath, and only experiments where acini did not move or were not affected by mechanical stimulation were evaluated. In some experiments 0.5 mm H2DIDS was added to the bathing medium. The results are presented as single experiments; summaries are given with the mean values ± S.E., where n refers to a number of independent preparations; fluorescence and transmission images and as time sequences of fluorescence intensities in regions of interests. Presently, the most commonly used method for measurement of ATP release in cultured epithelia is the luminometer detection of photon generation from reaction of luciferin and ATP that is catalyzed by luciferase. Initially, we applied this method to measure ATP release from freshly prepared pancreatic acini obtained from rat pancreas. Acini were gently shaken to ensure proper mixing with the medium. This mechanical stimulation caused a clear transient increase in ATP in the supernatant collected from acinar suspension immediately following the mechanical stress (Fig. 1). Subsequent decrease in ATP was most likely due to hydrolysis of ATP by ecto-nucleotidases, including CD39 present in pancreatic acini (15Hamlyn J.M. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Sevigny J. Grondin G. Gendron F.P. Roy J. Beaudoin A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G473-G482PubMed Google Scholar, 17Novak I. Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Ankorina-Stark I. Drug Dev. Res. 2000; 50: 112Google Scholar). We presume that in pancreatic acini, as in many other tissues, mechanical disturbances and stretch may be more relevant as the experimental tool rather than physiological stimulus. It is important to take account for this background mechanical disturbance. Acinar suspensions were shaken throughout the course of subsequent experiments, and extra care had to be taken in experiments with single acini. In exocrine glands secretory cells undergo volume changes during secretion (decrease and increase). Because cell swelling (caused by hypotonic stress) is known to release ATP in several epithelial cells (4Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Salter K.D. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether this also happens in pancreatic acini. Fig. 2a shows experiments where first a control solution and then a hypotonic solution was added to cell suspensions, such that the final ionic strength was 60% of the control. Although there was an indication that ATP was released in the hypotonic medium, there were large variations in responses. We considered whether these variations had something to do with cell swelling. Hence, in separate experiments using CLSM we monitored volume changes in single acinar cells loaded with calcein (Fig. 2,b and c), similar to the published study on airway epithelial cells (14Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immediately after the hypotonic shock as the cells swelled, concentration of the fluorophore within the single cells decreased as seen by a steeper slope in the intensity curve (Fig.2 c). Acinar cells swelled within about 60 s, but not in a synchrony. Because ATP release from acini may only be lasting during this short period of swelling and because ATP is hydrolyzed by ecto-nucleotidases, monitoring of small amounts of ATP released by sampling of supernatant is problematical. Pancreatic enzyme secretion is elicited by cholinergic stimulation normally mediated by parasympathetic nerves. Carbachol, a nondegradable cholinergic agonist, was used to stimulate pancreatic acini in a suspension. There was a transient increase in ATP in response to 10 and 100 µm carbachol, as shown in the depicted experiment (Fig. 3). In another five experiments we could observe that ATP increased transiently in some experiments, whereas in others the increase was more sustained. The peak ATP released after carbachol stimulation (100 µm) was 22.3 ± 2.8 nmol/liter and the prestimulation level was 7.1 ± 0.6 nmol/liter (n = 5). ATP detected in the supernatant is the balance between ATP released and ATP hydrolyzed. It is also clear that ATP released could be due to carbachol-stimulated release, but also, as in the above experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), it could be due to cell stress or even cell lysis. We calculated that it takes a lysis of 1 in 100,000 cells in 10% cytocrit to free about 4 nmol/liter of ATP in the suspension. The message from these experiments is that measurement of ATP release from a group of cells is difficult, if there is no control of cell viability at the time of the measurement. Therefore, we set out to develop other methods, and in the following paragraphs we will outline our new approach to monitor release of ATP in single pancreatic acini. Quinacrine, an acridine compound, binds to nucleic acids and therefore has been used as a marker of ATP stores in histological preparations of various cells (19White P.N. Thorne P.R. Housley G.D. Mockett B. Billett T.E. Burnstock G. Hear. Res. 1995; 90: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a couple of preparations it has been used as a marker of granular release (20Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We applied quinacrine to freshly dissected pancreatic lobules and pancreatic tissues prepared from suspensions (Fig. 4a). Pancreatic acini, even intact lobules, quickly accumulated quinacrine. In contrast, pancreatic ducts labeled only very weakly with this fluorophore. Using high magnifications and difference interference contrast optics, we could localize the predominant part of quinacrine in zymogen granules (Fig. 4 a) and in addition a very weak and diffuse fluorescence underneath the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4 e). In unstimulated pancreatic acini the quinacrine fluorescence was stable. However, after carbachol addition the fluorescence intensity in the apical and also basal poles of acini decreased (Fig.4 e), possibly as ATP was released. This was the case in both isolated acini and pancreatic lobules. Because quinacrine is a weak base, it could become accumulated in cellular acidic compartments. The following experiments were carried out to test this theory. Acridine orange, another marker of acidic stores, undergoes concentration and pH-dependent shift from the green to the red-orange emission. A similar shift is also seen when acridine orange binds to double- and single-stranded nucleic acids. In our experiments, acridine orange, unlike quinacrine, did not easily compartmentalize in intact pancreatic lobules, unless the tissue was enzymatically prepared (Fig. 4 b). Acridine orange showed an even green fluorescence in pancreatic ducts with a few red fluorescent vesicles (Fig. 4 b). In pancreatic acini the acridine orange distribution was pronounced in perinuclear regions, presumably trans-Golgi condensing vacuoles, lysosomes, and some early zymogen granules. The red-orange fluorescence was also detected in small vesicles close to the basolateral membrane, presumably endosomes. Another acid store indicator, LysoTracker Red, had a distribution in pancreatic acini similar to that of acridine orange (Fig.4 c). In several experiments pancreatic acini were incubated with the fluorescent ATP indicator MANT-ATP. Initially (1 h), the probe was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm, and after some time it became more concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions (2 h), presumably in the Golgi region. In acini that survived 3–5 h of incubation, and in which most likely de novo protein synthesis has taken place, MANT-ATP was accumulated in zymogen granules (Fig. 4 d). The oxidation of luciferin, catalyzed by luciferase and consuming ATP, results in a light emission that is detected by a luminometer. The design of the conventional confocal microscope is not suitable for luminescence detection. Therefore, we utilized another part of this reaction to monitor ATP in the extracellular medium. Namely, we monitored the disappearance of the substrate luciferin as a decrease in the luciferin fluorescence in the medium surrounding cells (see Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Luciferin was excited at 364 nm, and Fig.5(a and b) shows the emission spectrum for luciferin alone and for luciferin plus luciferase mix before and after addition of ATP. Utilizing the CLSM spectrophotometer unit, the emission spectra were collected in xz scans using the settings and the chamber similar to those in experiments with pancreatic cells. Fig. 5 c shows the relation between the luciferin concentration and the fluorescence intensity monitored at 510–550 nm. During the course of the experiment luciferin accumulated within acinar cells (see below). Nevertheless, it was the extracellular solution surrounding pancreatic cells that was most responsive to additions of small amounts of exogenous ATP in the presence of luciferase (Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Fig. 6 shows a control experiment with luciferin, initially in the absence of luciferase. Here the luciferin intensity in acinar cells and the surrounding medium remained constant, even at high ATP or carbachol concentrations. Only after luciferase was added did the fluorescence intensity in the medium decrease, and it further decreased with an extra addition of ATP. In experiments where both luciferin and luciferase were present in the bath, the background luciferin intensity decreased depending on the added exogenous ATP concentrations (Figs. 7and 8). We do not expect that the time course of the luciferin disappearance would be the same as the bioluminescence signal, where the flash or the sustained light generation measured as the photon flux depends on release of the inhibitory product oxyluciferin and a large number of factors affecting this process (22Ford S.R. Chenault K.H. Bunton L.S. Hampton G.J. McCarthy J. Hall M.S. Pangburn S.J. Buck L.M. Leach F.R. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1996; 11: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, one would expect that the time course of the luciferin concentration response is also complex, depending on the rate of luciferase-mediated ATP breakdown, composition of the physiological medium containing cells and cell products, ecto-nucleotidase activity of cells, diffusion of used up media and fresh media, and the mixing of added samples. In the present experimental system, some transient responses were observed with exogenous ATP (e.g. 16 µm ATP in Fig. 7). We estimated that the maximum decrease in the luciferin fluorescence immediately after each ATP addition was the most reliable indication of how much luciferin and therefore ATP was present in the test region. Standard curves of the exogenous ATP concentration versusthe changes in luciferin fluorescence were made for each experiment (Figs. 7 and 8).Figure 7Carbachol decreases luciferin intensity around pancreatic acini indicating ATP release. a, the transmission image of isolated acini. b–d, the luciferin fluorescence of the same acini at 30, 210, and 350 s.

Similar calibration curves of bath ATP concentrations versus changes in bath luciferin fluorescence were made for 11 experiments where CCH was tested and in seven further experiments where only exogenous ATP was tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Fluorescence emission spectrum of luciferin and dependence of fluorescence on luciferin concentration. a, D-luciferin was excited with 364 nm, and the emission fluorescence intensity of a solution in xz scans was monitored with the spectrophotometer unit of the confocal microscope. b, the same spectrum was obtained with the luciferin and luciferase mix (HSII). The addition of ATP (∼1 mm) only reduced the intensity of the fluorescence. c, the emission intensity (510–550 nm) was proportional to the luciferin concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The decisive experiment was that addition of carbachol to acini caused a decrease in the luciferin intensity around acini (Figs. 7 and 8). Addition of the blank solution (−BIC) without carbachol had no effect on the luciferin fluorescence (Fig. 8) and was used as a control. Furthermore, effects of the agonist or ATP on luciferin were dependent on luciferase (Fig. 6). The carbachol effect on the luciferin fluorescence indicated that there was a release of ATP from pancreatic acini (Figs. 7 and 8). In each experiment with pancreatic acini or in the subsequent cell free preparation under the same conditions, calibration curves with exogenous ATP were made (Figs. 7 gand 8 c). From these it was determined how much ATP acini released in response to carbachol in that particular experiment. From 11 independent experiments we estimated that cholinergic stimulation caused a release of 9 ± 3 µm ATP from acini (about 10% cytocrit) to the bath. Although the ATP release was most easily detected in the medium surrounding acini (Figs. 7 and 8), in some small acini it was also possible to detect a fall in the fluorescence in the acinar lumen following the carbachol stimulation (Fig. 8). This effect could indeed be due to ATP release from granules, if we assume that luciferin and luciferase could diffuse into the lumen during the incubation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a part of the fluorescence fall was due to a dilution of luciferin by the secreted fluid or due to quenching of the signal by the secreted protein. Nevertheless, in cell-free experiments, albumin (1 mg/ml) quenched the luciferin signal by less than 10%. Possibly then, these experiments indicate that some ATP is released into the lumen of acini. Lack of the effect of exogenous ATP on the luminal fluorescence is puzzling, but because the first generation of ducts that would be present in acinar clusters are lined with CD39, 2C. E. Sørensen, J. Amstrup, and I. Novak, manuscript in preparation. exogenous ATP at the given concentrations might have difficulties reaching the lumen. During the course of experiments, luciferin often accumulated in acinar cells, but not in duct cells (Fig.9, a–d) or blood vessels. In acinar cells luciferin accumulated in the cytoplasm and not in zymogen granules. One would not expect luciferin to accumulate passively, but because it has a carboxyl group, it is possible that one of the organic anion transporters might transport it into acinar cells. To test this theory we used H2DIDS as a broadly acting inhibitor. Fig. 9(e–h) shows that with H2DIDS in the medium, the luciferin uptake was markedly delayed. In another set of experiments, we have tested whether the luciferin uptake could be induced. Fig.10shows that at relatively high concentrations of extracellular ATP, luciferin is taken up by a few cells, presumably those that have P2 receptors. 3I. Novak, R. Nitschke, and J. Amstrup, submitted for publication. After some time the neighboring acini also fluoresce with luciferin, probably as luciferin spreads to other cells via gap junction.Figure 10Stimulation of luciferin uptake with high concentrations of ATP. The incubation medium contained luciferin (1.67 mm) and H2DIDS (0.5 mm). The following images were recorded: the differential interference contrast image (DIC); the luciferin fluorescence shown as accumulated scans (at 0 and 600 s) and single scans during the time series (at 10, 60, and 120 s). The addition of ATP evoked an increase in the luciferin fluorescence in two cells marked 1 and3. Image taken at 600 s indicates that the fluorescence spread to other cells within the acinus. The lower panelshows the intensity changes with ATP in six cells (regions 1–6) and the surrounding medium (regions 7–9). These results are representative of nine similar experiments. The scale bars indicate 20 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using the conventional luminescence measurements of luciferin/luciferase reaction, the present study on acinar suspensions shows that acini release ATP in response to a mechanical stress, cholinergic stimulation, and possibly volume changes. Clearly, the most physiologically relevant stimulus for this tissue would be the cholinergic stimulation. We verified this finding at a single cell/acinus level by using the luciferin fluorescence, the quinacrine release, and the fluorescent ATP marker and monitored signals in a confocal laser scanning microscope. Quinacrine is a putative marker of ATP and adenine nucleotide stores and as shown in histological preparations it is accumulated in intestinal nerves, marginal cells of cochlea, and adrenal chromaffin cells (19White P.N. Thorne P.R. Housley G.D. Mockett B. Billett T.E. Burnstock G. Hear. Res. 1995; 90: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Olson L. Alund M. Norberg K.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1976; 171: 407-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acini our study shows that it is accumulated in secretory vesicles, which release their contents upon stimulation (Fig. 4). Similar quinacrine release was reported for insulin secreting cells and acini, although the precise localization of the fluorophore to secretory granules was not possible in these imaging studies (20Belan P.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7615-7619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because quinacrine is a weak base, it is possible that it would accumulate in acidic stores. However, other acid store markers, acridine orange and LysoTracker Red, accumulated in stores that only partially overlapped with quinacrine stores (Fig. 4). Granules closest to the apical membrane were only marked with quinacrine. Interestingly, there are only a few contradicting reports about pH values in zymogen granules. Although some studies on isolated acinar cells and isolated zymogen granules propose that the granular pH is acidic, because they accumulate acridine orange (24De Lisle R.C. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: G711-G719PubMed Google Scholar, 25Niederau C. Van Dyke R.W. Scharschmidt B.F. Grendell J.H. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 1433-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), other reports indicate that pH of pancreatic and parotid gland granules are only slightly acidic and that their pH may depend on their maturity, with those most mature being least acidic (26Orci L. Ravazzola M. Anderson R.G. Nature. 1987; 326: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Arvan P. Rudnick G. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13567-13572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Qualitatively, our results with acridine orange and LysoTracker Red indicate that only some granules are acidic, whereas the apically positioned granules are least acidic. In addition, the zymogen granule pH may depend on the functional state of acini. Returning back to ATP stores, it seems that MANT-ATP also accumulates in zymogen granules after a prolonged incubation. Other fluorescent ATP derivatives, ε-ATP, have been used to study transport of ATP into isolated brain synaptic vesicles (28Gualix J. Pintor J. Miras-Portugal M.T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The advantage of MANT-ATP is that it has a more favorable excitation wavelength, making it more suitable for visualization in CLSM and intact preparations. If we assume that quinacrine and MANT-ATP mark ATP stores, this part of our study indicates that some ATP is stored in zymogen granules. In that respect the exocrine pancreas is similar to some endocrine, neuro-endocrine cells, and neurons in the way that they compartmentalize ATP. The method of luciferin fluorescence as a detector of extracellular ATP released from cells is a new application of the old well known reaction. In comparison with the sensitive luminometric detection of a few photons on the product side, use of the confocal microscope for detection of the fluorescence disappearance is not as sensitive. In addition the present system with acinar cells is not ideal to study the kinetics of the reaction (see “Results”). Nevertheless, the advantage of the method is that one can visualize single intact acini and cells and monitor their release of ATP into the medium semi-quantitatively (Figs. 7 and 8). Our estimate is that acini (about 10% cytocrit) release around 9 µm ATP to the surrounding medium after the carbachol application. Similar local ATP concentrations are suggested for activated platelets as estimated by surface-attached firefly luciferase, 14–20 µm (11Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and for pancreatic β cells as estimated by a biosensor technique, 25 µm (10Hazama A. Hayashi S. Okada Y. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 437: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In acini the ATP release is most easily detected in the medium surrounding acini (Figs. 7 and 8), but some release might occur into the acinar lumen (Fig. 8). This agrees with a detection of ATP release using the quinacrine method and using MANT-ATP as the ATP store marker (Fig. 4). Taking these findings together, it is likely that zymogen granules contain releasable ATP stores. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that ATP is also released or secreted from cytoplasm via an apical or basolateral transporter. The ATP release in acini is relatively slow (in the range of minutes) (Figs. 3,7, and 8) and intact with fluid and enzyme secretion. Nevertheless, one would expect ATP to be degraded by various ecto-nucleotidases, including the demonstrated CD39 (17Novak I. Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Ankorina-Stark I. Drug Dev. Res. 2000; 50: 112Google Scholar). This would explain the fact that the ATP detected in the supernatant of the acini suspension was some 100 times lower (Fig. 3). Interestingly, pancreatic acini take up luciferin by an H2DIDS-sensitive transport. Possibly this could be one of the carriers capable of transporting anions, such as the DIDS-sensitive kidney organic anion transporter, or hepatocyte multidrug resistance protein MRP3 that is found with Northern blotting also in pancreas (29Saito H. Masuda S. Inui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20719-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,30Konig J. Rost D. Cui Y. Keppler D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Luciferin transport is triggered by high ATP concentrations through a small number of cells possessing P2 receptors and may spread to other cells via gap junctions. Our recent study on ATP-mediated Ca2+ signals in pancreatic acini shows indeed that only about 10% of acinar cells have functional P2 receptors.3 Taken together, our experiments show that pancreatic acini release ATP in response to several stimuli. Clearly the most physiological relevant stimulus is the cholinergic stimulation. This conclusion is supported by three independent series of experiments: luminescence measurements on cells suspension, ATP markers (MANT-ATP, quinacrine), and on a cell level as luciferin consumption. Interestingly, our latest study shows that pancreatic acini have very few functional P2 receptors.3 We postulate that it might be a functional necessity for acini to avoid being stimulated by their own ATP, thus preventing autocrine initiation of autodigestive processes in pancreas. Instead, released ATP is “reserved” for the downstream ducts. Thus, ATP might act distally on pancreatic ducts possessing functional purinergic receptors. Luminal ATP acts via P2X4/P2X7 purinoceptors to increase Ca2+ and Na+ influx (9Hede S.E. Amstrup J. Christoffersen B.C. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31784-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ATP is broken down by luminal CD39 or other ecto-nucleotidases, and adenosine acts via P1 receptors to open luminal Cl− channels (17Novak I. Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Ankorina-Stark I. Drug Dev. Res. 2000; 50: 112Google Scholar). ATP (or its breakdown products) can thus affect ductal secretion and potentiate secretion evoked by secretin (31Ishiguro H. Naruse S. Kitagawa M. Hayakawa T. Case R.M. Steward M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 551-558Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hence, ATP released from acini may explain the long standing dilemma in pancreatic physiology, namely that cholinergic stimulation of acinar secretion potentiates ductal secretion evoked by secretin (32Chey W.Y. Kim M.S. Lee K.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 293: 435-446Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Park H.S. Lee Y.L. Kwon H.Y. Chey W.Y. Park H.J. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2044113269,"Identification of selective anchoring proteins responsible for specialized localization of specific signaling proteins has led to the identification of new inhibitors of signal transduction, inhibitors of anchoring protein-ligand interactions. RACK1, the firstreceptor for activated C kinase identified in our lab, is a selective anchoring protein for βII protein kinase C (βIIPKC). We previously found that at least part of the RACK1-binding site resides in the C2 domain of βIIPKC (Ron, D., Luo, J., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 24180–24187). Here we show that the V5 domain also contains part of the RACK1-binding site in βIIPKC. In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, the βIIV5-3 peptide (amino acids 645–650 in βIIPKC) selectively inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced translocation of βIIPKC and not βIPKC. In addition, the βIIV5-3 peptide inhibited cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in PMA-treated cells. Interestingly, βIV5-3 (646–651 in βIPKC), a selective translocation inhibitor of βIPKC, also inhibited PMA-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating that both βI- and βIIPKC are essential for this cardiac function. Therefore, the βIIV5 domain contains part of the RACK1-binding site in βIIPKC; a peptide corresponding to this site is a selective inhibitor of βIIPKC and, hence, enables the identification of βIIPKC-selective functions.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A number of these proteins have recently been identified; some anchor and coordinate multiple enzymes in the same signaling cascade (3Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and can bind to their selective proteins or enzymes depending on their activation state (2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Selective localization of signaling enzymes in cells results in tethering them in the proper subcellular location for their function. Disruption of the selective protein-protein interactions between the signaling enzymes and their anchoring proteins alters the specialized localization of the signaling enzymes and thus disrupts their function (5Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We have studied the mechanism leading to selective localization of protein kinase C (PKC).1 PKC isozymes are a family of serine/threonine, phospholipid-dependent protein kinases (6Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar) that translocate after stimulation to select subcellular sites where they bind their corresponding selective anchoring proteins, RACKs (receptor for activated Ckinase) (2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). RACKs bind only the active form of their respective PKCs. Our lab has identified some of the RACK-binding sites on β, ε, and δPKC and demonstrated that RACK binding is essential for both proper localization and function of these PKC isozymes (5Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). So far we have cloned and characterized two RACKs and demonstrated that RACK1 is selective for βIIPKC (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 8Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas RACK2, also known as β′COP (a coatomer protein involved in vesicle transport) is selective for εPKC (9Csukai M. Chen C.H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). βI- and βIIPKC, members of the classical family of PKCs, are differentially spliced products of the same gene and therefore differ only in their C-terminal variable domain, the V5 domain (10Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fujii T.

Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that βI- and βIIPKC are differentially localized in both their inactive and active states (12Luria A. Tennenbaum T. Sun Q.Y. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,13Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) in a number of cell types. We have demonstrated that the second conserved domain in βPKC, the C2 domain, contains part of the RACK-binding site in βPKC (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The βC2 domain binds RACK1in vitro and peptides derived from this domain inhibit this interaction (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2-derived peptides block translocation of both βI- and βIIPKC in cells (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the C2 domains of βI- and βIIPKC are identical and, therefore, cannot account for the differential localization of βI- and βIIPKC. We hypothesize that the distinct sequences in the βIV5 and βIIV5 domains should confer the RACK-binding specificity and differential localization of these isozymes. A selective RACK for βIPKC has yet to be identified. We therefore used RACK1, the selective anchoring protein for βIIPKC, to test our hypothesis. Using short peptides derived from the βIIV5 domain, we show here that unique sequences within βIIPKC contain part of the RACK1-binding site. In addition, we show that one of the V5-derived peptides functions as an isozyme-selective translocation inhibitor of βIIPKC in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. This peptide was used to demonstrate that βIIPKC mediates phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Of interest, a peptide-selective translocation inhibitor of βIPKC identified in this study also inhibited PMA-induced myocyte hypertrophy, suggesting that the two isozymes are required for this function. PMA was purchased from LC Laboratories. Diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine were purchased from Avanti. Luminol, p-coumaric acid, IGEPAL detergent, saponin, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-βI-PKC and anti-βIIPKC antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, and R&D Antibodies. Amylose resin was purchased from New England Biolabs. Monoclonal anti-βPKC antibodies were purchased from Seikagaku, Inc. and Transduction Laboratories. Anti-RACK1 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, glutathione Sepharose 4B beads, and [14C]phenylalanine were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant βI- and βIIPKC were purchased from PanVera. Recombinant βIIPKC was purchased from PanVera, or a clone (received from Alexandra Newton) was expressed in Tn5 insect cells and partially purified to homogeneity as previously described (15Mochly-Rosen D. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2291-2297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments of the βPKC C2 (amino acids 175–289), βIV5 (amino acids 622–671), and βIIV5 (amino acids 622–673) domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein (MBP) using the pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in amylose column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication. Fusion proteins were purified by immobilization on an amylose resin column. The column was washed with 8 column volumes of column buffer, and bound protein was eluted in 10 mm maltose in column buffer. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. RACK1 was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) using the pGEX-4T-1 GST gene fusion expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. Recombinant GST or GST-RACK1 bacterial lysate was incubated with 25 µl (∼20 µl packed bead volume) of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and the beads were washed with overlay wash (200 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 12 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). For competition experiments the complex was preincubated with the PKC-derived peptides (10 µm) or protein fragments (1–2.5 µm) in overlay buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min before the addition of PKC and PKC activators. The complex was then incubated with or without PKC or PKC fragments in the presence or absence of PKC activators (2 µg/ml diacylglycerol and 60 µg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature in overlay buffer. The beads were washed three times with overlay wash containing 1% IGEPAL detergent, and the third wash was used to transfer the beads to fresh Eppendorf tubes to help decrease background. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis. βPKC-selective antibodies were used to detect βPKC holoenzyme and C2 and V5 fragments. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from 4 litters of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (each with 8–10 animals) as described previously (16Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 12-well plates for [14C]phenylalanine incorporation experiments or laminin-coated 8-well chamber slides for immunofluorescence studies. Cells were maintained in media M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% serum after plating. For [14C]phenylalanine incorporation experiments, cells were transferred to serum-free media on day 3, and experiments were initiated on day 4. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on days after a change to serum-free media on day 4. All peptides were delivered into cells via transient permeabilization with the detergent saponin (50 µg/ml) as described previously (16Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were permeabilized in the presence or absence of peptide and then treated with 4α- or 4β-PMA. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with ice-cold acetone:methanol (1:1). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by two brief washes with water. Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting media was used for mounting of a coverslip. Cells were scored using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. In immunofluorescence studies, distinct changes in βI- and βIIPKC subcellular localization are apparent after activation (13Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Active βIPKC translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus, whereas active βIIPKC is found in both the perinuclear region and the cell periphery but not on fibrillar structures, where it is found before activation. We confirmed that scoring translocation in this manner is not subjective; when the experimentor was blinded to the identity of the treatment, the same results were obtained. Moreover, in several previous studies, we compared the quantitation method described above using immunofluorescence to others (i.e. Western blot analysis of cell fractions), and the same results were obtained (e.g. Ref. 17Dorn G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Isolated cardiac myocytes plated in 12-well plates were permeabilized in the presence or absence of peptide. Cells were transferred to serum-free media M199 containing 0.15 µCi/ml [14C]phenylalanine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), treated with 10 nm 4β-PMA or the inactive analog 4α-PMA, and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested as described (16Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, media was aspirated, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and protein was precipitated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Trichloroacetic acid was aspirated, and wells were washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was solubilized in 1% SDS for 2 h at 37 °C. Solubilized protein was mixed with UniversolTM scintillation fluid (ICN) and counted with a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Phase contrast pictures were obtained using a Zeiss light microscope. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that RACK1 co-localizes with active βIIPKC in CHO cells (8Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and in cardiac myocytes (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and endogenous RACK1 and βIIPKC co-immunoprecipitate. 2M. M. Rodriguez and D. Mochly-Rosen, unpublished observation. Here, we determined the binding affinity of βIIPKC for RACK1 in vitro. RACK1, expressed as a fusion protein with GST, was immobilized on glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads and incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant βIIPKC in the presence of activators. Binding of activated βIIPKC to RACK1 is both dose-dependent and saturable with a half-maximal binding of 3 ± 2 nm (n = 4; Fig.1, A and B). Furthermore, at all concentrations, binding of βIIPKC to RACK1 is at least 2-fold greater than that of βIPKC (n = 3; Fig.1 C). We previously demonstrated that the C2 domain of βPKC (βC2), identical in the two βPKC isozymes, contains part of the RACK1-binding site in βPKC (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, in vitro binding studies show that the half-maximal binding of the βC2 domain-MBP fusion protein to RACK1 is ∼500 nm (Fig.2 A). Since RACK1 is selective for βIIPKC (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 8Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and its subcellular localization overlaps that of βIIPKC and not βIPKC (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the unique sequences in the βIIV5 domain should confer specificity of βIIPKC for RACK1. This suggests that the distinct βIIV5 domain may bind RACK1 directly. We incubated the recombinant βIIV5 domain, expressed as an MBP fusion protein, with immobilized GST-RACK1 in vitro, as described under “Experimental Procedures” and found that βIIV5 binding to RACK1 was dose-dependent and saturable with a half-maximal binding of ∼400 nm (Fig. 2 B). This affinity is similar to that of the βC2 domain, having a half-maximal binding of ∼500 nm (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, the βIIV5 domain also contains part of the RACK1-binding site in βIIPKC. If part of the RACK1-binding site in βIIPKC is within the βIIV5 domain, then βIIV5 should inhibit βIIPKC binding to RACK1. Furthermore, if both C2 and V5 domains are required for βIIPKC binding to RACK1, an additive inhibitory effect may be seen when combining the βIIV5 domain along with the βC2 domain. To this end, recombinant βIIV5, βIV5, and/or βC2 fusion proteins were preincubated with immobilized GST-RACK1, and then full-length βIIPKC was added in the presence of PKC activators. We found that the βIIV5 domain competed with βIIPKC for RACK1 binding. Furthermore, an additive effect in competition for βIIPKC binding to RACK1 was observed in the presence of both βC2 and the βIIV5 domains (Fig.3). However, similar results were obtained when using the βIV5 domain, both alone or in combination with the βC2 domain. The non-selective inhibition of βIIPKC binding to RACK1 with both βIV5 and βIIV5 fragments (Fig. 3) was somewhat surprising, as βIPKC and βIIPKC display differences in binding to RACK1 (Fig. 1 C), and active βIPKC and RACK1 is not co-localized in cells (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of the βIV5 fragment on βIIPKC binding to RACK1 is due to some interactions with RACK1 or βIIPKC holoenzyme via conserved sequences within the βI- and βIIV5 domains. Although βI- and βIIPKC differ in the V5 domain, they display high homology (∼60%) within that domain (Fig.4 A). Therefore, we expect that the least similar sequences within the βIIV5 domain should confer βIIPKC RACK1-binding specificity. We synthesized short peptides corresponding to the least similar sequences in the βV5 domains, since we expected that they would contain the selective RACK1-binding sequences in βIIPKC. Three peptides corresponding to unique regions were selected from each of the βI and βII V5 domains: βIV5-1 (AGFSYTNPEFVINV), βIV5-2 (ARDKRDTS), βIV5-3 (KLFIMN) and βIIV5-1 (SFVNSEFLKPEVKS), βIIV5-2 (ACGRNAE), and βIIV5-3 (QEVIRN) (Fig. 4 A) (note that βIV5-1 and βIIV5-1 comprise part of the antigenic peptides used for production of many of the commercially available anti-βI and -βII PKC isozyme-specific antibodies). The V5-derived peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit βIIPKC binding to RACK1. Additionally, three peptides derived from the C2 domain (βC2-1, βC2-2, and βC2-4), previously shown to inhibit binding of a C2 domain-containing fragment to RACK-1 (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), were also used. Similar to the mixture of all three βC2-derived peptides (βC2-1, βC2-2, and βC2-4, 10 µm each), the mixtures of the three βI- or βIIV5-derived peptides did not inhibit βIIPKC holoenzyme-RACK1 interactions in vitro (Fig. 4, Band C). However, when used in combination with the mixture of all three βC2-derived peptides, the three βIIV5-derived peptides together (βIIV5-1, βIIV5-2, and βIIV5-3 , 10 µm of each) nearly abolished βIIPKC binding to RACK1, whereas the combined βC2- and βIV5- derived peptides had no effect (Fig. 4, Band C, n = 3). Therefore, the βIIV5-derived peptides provide the selectivity necessary to inhibit βIIPKC-RACK1 binding in the presence of the βC2-derived peptides, suggesting the βIIV5 unique sequences, not present in βIV5, correspond to the RACK1-selective binding sites within βIIPKC. In cells it is thought that RACKs act as isozyme-selective anchoring proteins, functioning to tether specific PKC isozymes nearby their respective substrates (2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 5Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We previously showed that disruption of intracellular PKC-RACK interactions inhibits PKC translocation and proper subcellular localization, therefore preventing PKC substrate phosphorylation and blocking downstream function (2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 5Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 18Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We show here that the combination of βC2- and βIIV5- derived peptides are necessary to inhibit βIIPKC-RACK1 interactionsin vitro (Fig. 4). However, we previously demonstrated that each of the peptides derived from the RACK1-binding site in the βC2 domain (βC2-1, βC2-2, and βC2-4) is sufficient alone to inhibit translocation of both βI- and βIIPKC in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine if individual peptides derived from the βIIV5 domain can also act alone as translocation inhibitors, we first determined their effects on βIIV5 fragment binding to RACK1 in vitro. We found that each of the βIIV5-1, βIIV5-2, and βIIV5-3 peptides (10 µm) alone inhibits binding of MBP-βIIV5 fusion protein (500 nm) to RACK1 in vitro by 37, 30, and 34%, respectively (average of 3 measurements), suggesting that each peptide contains part of the RACK1-binding site in the βIIV5 domain and, therefore, may be an effective inhibitor of translocation in cells. Consequently, we set out to test the effects of the individual V5-derived peptides on βIIPKC translocation in cells. Since none of the peptides stood out as the overall strongest inhibitor of βIIV5-RACK1 binding in vitro, we chose to start our in-cell studies with the βIIV5-3 peptide. We propose that the βIIV5-3 peptide, containing part of the RACK1-selective binding sequence in βIIPKC, may function as isozyme-selective translocation inhibitor by binding to the isozyme-selective RACK and inhibiting translocation of βIIPKC isozyme. The βIV5-3 peptide was used both as a control for βIIV5-3 and a possible selective inhibitor of βIPKC translocation. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were permeabilized in the presence or absence of 10 µm peptide and then treated with or without 10 nm PMA for 5 min (we showed previously that ∼10% of the applied peptide is internalized by the cells (16Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). Cells were then fixed and stained with isozyme-selective anti-βI- and anti-βIIPKC-selective antibodies followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In norepinephrine- or PMA-treated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, active βIPKC localizes in the nucleus of the cell, whereas active βIIPKC translocates to both the perinuclear region and the cell periphery upon activation (13Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In these experiments, cells were scored for the number of cells staining for active βIPKC or βIIPKC at their respective sites in the cell, as previously described (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). PMA-treated cells permeabilized in the absence of peptide showed 89% ± 4 of the cells staining βIIPKC at the perinuclear region and cell periphery (Fig.5). Whereas there was no change in βIIPKC translocation in cells treated with the βIV5-3 peptide followed by PMA (77% ± 6 versus 89% ± 4 of βIV5-3 and control, respectively, Fig. 5), treatment with βIIV5-3 reduced βIIPKC translocation to 17% ± 5 of the cells (Fig. 5). Therefore, βIIV5-3 selectively inhibited βIIPKC translocation, whereas βIV5-3 had no effect. Additionally, βIIV5-3 peptide had no effect on βIPKC translocation with 85% ± 3 of the cells displaying βIPKC staining in the nucleus of the cells versus the no peptide control (89% ± 3; Fig. 5). Conversely, the βIV5-3 peptide selectively inhibited βIPKC translocation, with βIV5-3 -treated cells showing 17% ± 3 of βIPKC nuclear staining (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data demonstrate that when introduced alone into cardiac myocytes, the βIV5-3 and βIIV5-3 peptides are effective isozyme-selective translocation inhibitors of βI- and βIIPKC, respectively; they prevent translocation of the corresponding isozyme with no effect on the other isozyme. Because greater than 70% inhibition of βIIPKC translocation was obtained using βIIV5-3 alone, the other βIIV5-derived peptides were not studied further. Previous studies demonstrate that isozyme-selective PKC translocation inhibitors can selectively inhibit isozyme function (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat.

Additionally, peptides derived from the βC2 domain (βC2-1, βC2-2, and βC2-4) inhibit a βPKC-mediated cellular function in Xenopusoocytes (7Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and regulation of L-type calcium channels (21Zhang Z.H. Johnson J.A. Chen L. El-Sherif N. Mochly-Rosen D. Boutjdir M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We proposed that the βIIV5-derived translocation inhibitor, βIIV5-3, determines βIIPKC-selective functions in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. βPKC has recently been reported to mediate cardiac hypertrophy (22Simpson P.C.

Bacterial factors responsible for induction of human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) mRNA expression in Caco-2 human carcinoma cells were determined. Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella dublin, and culture supernatants of these strains induced hBD-2 mRNA expression in Caco-2 human carcinoma cells. Using luciferase as a reporter gene for a ∼2.1-kilobase pair hBD-2 promoter, the hBD-2-inducing factor in culture supernatant of S. enteritidis was isolated. The supernatant factor was heat-stable and proteinase-sensitive. After purification by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, the hBD-2-inducing factor was identified as a 53-kDa monomeric protein with the amino-terminal sequence AQVINTNSLSLLTQNNLNK, which is identical to that of the flagella filament structural protein (FliC) of S. enteritidis. Consistent with this finding, the 53-kDa protein reacted with anti-FliC antibody, which prevented its induction of hBD-2 mRNA in Caco-2 cells. In agreement, the hBD-2-inducing activity in culture supernatant was completely neutralized by anti-FliC antibody. In gel retardation analyses, FliC increased binding of NF-κB (p65 homodimer) to hBD-2 gene promoter sequences. We conclude that S. enteritidis FliC induces hBD-2 expression in Caco-2 cells via NF-κB activation and thus plays an important role in up-regulation of the innate immune response.

Salmonella species are Gram-negative organisms that cause gastroenteritis and enteric fever in humans. As pointed out by Bäumler et al. (10Bäumer A.J. Hargis R.M. Tsolis R.M. Science. 2000; 287: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), an increase in numbers of human infections with Salmonella enteritidis began in the 1960s but was followed by an almost 50% decrease from 1970 to 1976. Another increase began in 1977, with signs of a decrease beginning in 1992. In contrast, the increasing frequency of S. enteritidisinfection in poultry did not begin until 1989, and a decline started in 1996 (11Ward L.R. Threlfall J. Smith H.R. O'Brien S.J. Science. 2000; 287: 1753-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reasons for the fluctuations are unknown, but the recent recognition of food-borne infection with S. enteritidis has renewed interest in how these organisms can invade, persist, and spread. To evaluate the role of defensins in S. enteritidisinfection, we investigated the induction of hBD-2 in Caco-2 cells, a human colon carcinoma line. S. enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, and Salmonella dublinincreased hBD-2 mRNA levels, as did the culture supernatant of these strains. The hBD-2-inducing protein in S. enteritidissupernatant was purified by sequential anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, and the amino-terminal sequence was determined. It was established that the hBD-2-inducing factor is flagella filament structural protein (FliC) of S. enteritidis, and induction results from NF-κB activation. S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. typhi, and S. dublinstrains were grown on tryptic soy agar and then in liquid culture overnight in 3 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB). A sample (500 µl) of the overnight culture was added to 20 ml of TSB, and bacteria harvested in log phase were used in this study. Caco-2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in 60-mm diameter plates in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. When 90% confluent, cells were incubated with 100 µl of log-phase bacteria (3 × 107 colony-forming units/ml) or 500 µl of filtered culture supernatant in 2 ml of FCS-free DMEM for 6 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was prepared from Caco-2 cells with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's specifications and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. cDNA, synthesized from 1 µg of Caco-2 cell total RNA, was incubated with 2.5 µmoligo(dT) primer, 1 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 42 °C. cDNA was mixed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase, and 50 pmol each of primer hBD-2 sense (GGTGAAGCTCCCAGCCATCA), hBD-2 antisense (TATCTTTGGACACCATAGTT), GAPDH sense (TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT), and GAPDH antisense (CATGTGGGCCGAGGTCCACCAC). The mixture was covered with mineral oil before initiating PCR for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were identified in ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels. To assess hBD-2 promoter activity, Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (1 × 105cells in 1 ml of DMEM per well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 2.5 µg of the hBD-2 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (5′-deletion constructs of the hBD-2 promoter (pGL3–2110, pGL3–938, pGL3–398, pGL3–229, and pGL3–197) or a mutated hBD-2 promoter construct (pGL3–938/mt)) (12Wada A.

Urakawa M. Niidome T. Aoyagi H. Pept. Sci. 1999; 1998: 453-456Google Scholar) in 250 µl of FCS-free DMEM for 15 min at room temperature before addition of DNA-peptide complexes to Caco-2 cells. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, 1 ml of DMEM was added, and 12 h later, the culture medium was replaced. After DNA transfection, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh FCS-free DMEM, and 250 µl of the sample to be assayed was then added. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, Caco-2 cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS and lysed by adding 300 µl of lysis buffer (Toyo Ink Co.). After 15 min at room temperature, the lysate was centrifuged (18,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Luciferase activity of the supernatant, measured using a luminometer (Berthold), was normalized to the activity of an internal control Renillaluciferase. S. enteritidis was grown in 100 ml of TSB at 37 °C for 16 h before centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 30 min and collection of culture supernatant. Proteins precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation (9000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) after incubation overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate, containing hBD-2-inducing factor, was dissolved in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material, and filtered (0.45 µmfilter (Sartorius)) before application to a column (1.6 × 3 cm) of ResourceQ ion exchange resin, which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Induction of hBD-2 by each fraction was determined by the luciferase reporter gene assay. Active fractions were pooled and applied to a column (1 × 30 cm) of Superose 12, which was eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The purified hBD-2-inducing factor was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 V for 1 h with transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.19m glycine, 20% methanol) followed by staining with Ponceau-S. The protein band was excised for amino acid sequencing with a gas-phase protein sequencer PPSQ-21 (Shimadzu, Japan). A peptide, NH2-QFTFDDKTKNESAKL (amino acids 339–353 of S. enteritidis FliC with an added carboxyl-terminal Cys), was synthesized and coupled to KLH. Rabbits were immunized with the KLH-coupled peptide (200 µg) or with purified FliC protein (40 µg) on day 0, with peptide (200 µg) or FliC (40 µg) on day 21 and with peptide (100 µg) or FliC (40 µg) at intervals of a week thereafter until the desired serum antibody titer against the peptide or protein was reached. All antigens were injected subcutaneous in complete Freund's adjuvant (1:1). Rabbits were bled 7 weeks after the first injection. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Immobilon-P membranes) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C with transfer buffer. Membranes were incubated with 5% milk powder in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h and washed with TBS-T, followed by incubation in a 1: 5000 dilution of anti-FliC peptide IgG in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in TBS-T, membranes were incubated in a 1: 5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A in TBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed in TBS-T, followed by incubation for 5 min in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmNaCl), before detection by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FliC of S. enteritidis was prepared as previously described (14Ibrahim G.F. Fleet G.H. Lyons M.J. Walker R.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vorderviszt F. Kanto S. Aizawa S.I. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with the following modifications.S. enteritidis, cultured in 2 liters of TSB at 37 °C for 16 h were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C and suspended in 40 ml of PBS, which was adjusted to pH 2 with 1 m HCl and maintained at that pH with constant stirring for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the pH of the supernatant containing detached monomeric flagellin was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 m NaOH and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 65% saturation. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in distilled water, dialyzed against distilled water, heated at 65 °C for 15 min, and placed on ice. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To the supernatant, which contained depolymerized FliC, solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to a concentration of 0.7 m. After storage overnight at room temperature, polymerized FliC was collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) and dissolved in PBS. A complete structural gene of the fliC gene was amplified by PCR using a set of oligonucleotide primers, primer 1 (5′-GGCCATGGCACAAGTCATTAAT-3′) and primer 2 (5′-GGGGATCCTTAACGCAGTAAAGAGAG-3′), followed by digestion withNcoI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and pET-FliC was yielded. pET-FliC was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (pLysS) to express FliC protein. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation 5 h after induction of mid-log phase culture with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Lysis was performed in the PBS by repeated sonication. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and adjusted to pH 2 with 1 m HCl, and it was maintained at that pH with constant stirring for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 m NaOH and dialyzed against PBS. To prepare nuclear extract, Caco-2 cells were grown to about 90% confluency in 100-mm dishes, the culture medium was replaced with 10 ml of FCS-free medium, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with FliC, 100 ng/ml, for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 12 h, washed with PBS, and scraped in 2 ml of PBS. After addition of 400 µl of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), pH 7.9, to the scraped cells and gentle rotation for 10 min at 4 °C, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and dispersed in 100 µl of Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets followed by gentle rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (18,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), the concentration of protein in the supernatant was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The positive strands of the double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to regions of the hBD-2 promoter, were prepared as follows, with mutated nucleotide sequences underlined: wild-type NF-κB (–213 to –196) for hBD-2, 5′-TTTTCTGGGGTTTCCTGA-3′; mutated NF-κB for hBD-2, 5′-TTTTCATAGGTTTAATGA-3′. The complementary strands in equal concentrations were mixed, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C in 50 mm NaCl. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and purified using ProbeQuantTM G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples (2 µg) of nuclear proteins were incubated with the indicated radiolabeled oligonucleotides for 20 min at 25 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin). Specificities of the binding reactions were tested in competition assays in which a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligonucleotide was added. Protein-nucleotide complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a 4% DNA retardation gel with Tris borate/EDTA (36 mm Tris-HCl, 36 mm boric acid, 0.8 mm EDTA) at constant current (20 mA) at 4 °C. Gels were dried, and complexes were analyzed by autoradiography using a Fuji imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). Supershift experiments were performed by adding antibody (1 µl) to the binding mixture 15 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe; complexes were then separated as described above. Antibodies against synthetic peptides derived from NF-κB/Rel family proteins (p65(A) against amino acids 3–19 of p65, p65(C) against amino acids 531–550 of p65, p50 (N-19) against the amino terminus of p50, p52 (K-27) against conserved epitope of p52, c-Rel (N) against the amino terminus of c-Rel, and Rel B (C-19) against the carboxyl terminus of Rel B) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). To evaluate the effect of Salmonella species on hBD-2 mRNA levels by RT-PCR, Caco-2 cells were incubated for 6 h with S. typhimurium, S. enteritidis,S. typhi, or S. dublin or their broth culture filtrates, each of which increased hBD-2 mRNA (Fig.1). The factor in S. enteritidis culture supernatant responsible for hBD-2 induction was stable to heating at 100 °C for 10 min (Fig. 2). However, incubation for 2 h with trypsin or proteinase K resulted in a loss of hBD-2-inducing activity, indicating that the factor in broth culture of S. enteritidis was heat-stable and proteinase-sensitive. hBD-2-inducing activity in S. enteritidissupernatant was estimated by induction of luciferase activity of pGL3–2110-transfected Caco-2 cells. pGL3–2110 contains the 5′ flanking region of the hBD-2 gene (–2110 to –1) in a luciferase-reporter plasmid (Fig. 7). pGL3–2110-transfected cells were incubated with S. enteritidis supernatant, before and after heat and proteinase treatment and before assay of luciferase activity (Fig. 3). As was shown in the RT-PCR assay (Fig. 2), in the luciferase assay, the hBD-2-inducing factor activity in culture supernatant was heat-stable and proteinase-sensitive (Fig. 3).Figure 3Stability of hBD-2-inducing factor inS. enteritidis culture supernatant assayed with luciferase as the reporter gene. hBD-2-inducing activity in Caco-2 cells was quantified by luciferase activity of pGL3–2110 (12Wada A.

The cells were incubated for 6 h with control TSB medium, S. enteritidis supernatant, heat-treated supernatant (10 min at 100 °C), or incubation for 2 h with 40 µg/ml trypsin or 200 µg/ml proteinase K (5Bensch K.W. Raida M. Magert H.J. Schulz-Knappe P. Forssman W.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), followed by heat treatment. Luciferase activity was then examined. Luciferase activity is reported relative to that of cells transfected with empty vector. Data are the means ± S.D. of values from three separate experiments with assays in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using the luciferase assay system, the hBD-2-inducing factor inS. enteritidis supernatant was purified by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4, A and B, and Table I). In pooled effluents from Superose 12, a single protein band of 53 kDa was seen by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE in 10% gel (Fig.4 C). The amino-terminal sequence of the 53-kDa protein, AQVINTNSLSLLTQNNLNK, is identical to that of flagella filament structural protein (FliC) of S. enteritidis. Consistent with this result, the 53-kDa protein reacted with anti-FliC peptide antibody (Fig. 4 D).Table IPurification of hBD-2-inducing factor in S. enteritidis culture supernatantVolumeTotal amount of proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmlmgunits1-a1 Unit = Sample can activate the level of EC50 of luciferase activity for pGL3-2110 transfected Caco-2 cells.units/mg%S. enteritidissupernatant1002.35114,32048,64710070% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation401.5580,00051,78070.0Resource Q160.2921,76075,03419.0Superose 1210.043,20080,0002.801-a 1 Unit = Sample can activate the level of EC50 of luciferase activity for pGL3-2110 transfected Caco-2 cells. Open table in a new tab When pGL3–2110-transfected Caco-2 cells were incubated with FliC for 6 h before assay of the luciferase activity, inducing activity was concentration-dependent up to 0–0.1 µg/ml and was maximal with 0.1–10 µg/ml (data not shown). Inhibition of hBD-2 induction by the 53-kDa protein or FliC with anti-FliC protein antibody confirmed that FliC is the hBD-2-inducing factor (Fig. 5 A). Inhibitory effects of the two proteins on hBD-2-inducing activity in the luciferase assay were similarly relieved by antibody, consistent with the conclusion that the 53-kDa protein in S. enteritidissupernatant is FliC and functions as an hBD-2-inducing factor. To determine whether FliC is the major hBD-2-inducing factor inS. enteritidis culture supernatant, the effect of anti-FliC protein antibody on this activity was examined. As shown in Fig.5 B, the hBD-2-inducing activity was completely neutralized by anti-53-kDa protein (FliC) antibody, indicating that FliC is responsible for the hBD-2-inducing activity in culture supernatant. To clarify that FliC is really hBD-2-inducing factor in S. enteritidis culture supernatant, a FliC expression plasmid was constructed, and recombinant FliC was expressed in E. coli, BL21. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the lysate with recombinant FliC but not control lysate has hBD-2-inducing activity in a dose-dependent manner. When pGL3-2110-transfected Caco-2 cells were incubated with recombinant FliC or original FliC for 6 h before assay of luciferase activity, hBD-2-inducing activity exhibited concentration-dependent effects up to 0–0.1 µg/ml and was maximal with 0.1–10 µg/ml (Fig.6 B). Gram-positive MSSA (ATCC25923) and its culture supernatant and E. coli BL21 strains and their supernatant did not activate the hBD-2 reporter gene in Caco-2 cells (data not shown). These all results support the hypothesis that FliC is a major hBD-2-inducing factor in S. enteritidis culture supernatant. Recently, we reported that induction of hBD-2 mRNA by H. pylori is regulated by NF-κB (12Wada A. Ogushi Kimura T. Hojo H. Mori N. Suzuki S. Kumatori A. May Se Nakahara Y. Nakamura M. Joel M. Hirayama T. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 115-123Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine FliC effects on hBD-2 mRNA may involve NF-κB activation, Caco-2 cells were transfected with different luciferase-reporter constructs and stimulated with FliC. FliC did not enhance luciferase activity in Caco-2 cells transfected with the control luciferase-reporter plasmid, pGL3 or of those transfected with pGL3–197, or pGL3–938mt (Fig. 7). It did increase activity of cells transfected with pGL3–2110, pGL3–938, pGL3–398, or pGL3–229 (Fig. 7), consistent with involvement of NF-κB in the induction of hBD-2 by FliC. Binding of proteins to 18-base pair oligonucleotides, with a sequence corresponding to that of the NF-κB site at position –208 to –199 in the hBD-2 promoter region, was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Caco-2 cells were incubated with FliC, 100 ng/ml, for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 12 h. Specific DNA-protein complexes that bound NF-κB sequence were not observed in control cells (Fig.8 A). After incubation with FliC for 1 h, levels of complexes were increased, but they decreased with longer incubation. Addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with wild-type sequence, but not that with the mutated sequence, specifically decreased the amount of radiolabeled complex (Fig. 8 A). To identify proteins that bound to the NF-κB site, mobility shift assays were performed using antibodies raised against p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, and RelB proteins. As shown in Fig. 8 B, in the presence of oligonucleotide with sequence of the NF-κB site in the hBD-2 promoter, p65-specific antibodies, but not several others, caused a marked supershift, suggesting that p65-p65 homodimer was a major component of the DNA-binding complex. Unlike hBD-1, which is produced constitutively, hBD-2 is synthesized in response to bacterial infection or proinflammatory agonists, suggesting a role for hBD-2 in epithelial innate host defense (7Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 86Crossref Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 16Singh P.K. Jia P.K. Wiles K. Hesselberth J. Liu L. Conway B.A.D. Greenberg E.P. Valore E.P.

The bacterial factors that induce hBD-2 in mammalian cells are still unclear, and the regulation of hBD-2 production in mammalian cells is poorly understood. For these reasons, we investigated hBD-2 induction by S. enteritidis in Caco-2 cells. Recently, O'Neil et al. (17O'Neil D.A. Porter E.M. Elewaut D. Anderson G.M. Eckmann L. Ganz T. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immun. 1999; 163: 6718-6724PubMed Google Scholar) showed that S. dublin and enteroinvasive E. coli induced hBD-2 mRNA in Caco-2 or HT-29 cells. In agreement with those findings, hBD-2 mRNA was detected in cells and also in culture supernatant following incubation with several Salmonella species (S. typhimurium,S. enteritidis, S. typhi, and S. dublin) or their culture supernatants (Fig. 1). Similarly, hBD-2 mRNA induction in MKN45 cells by S. typhimurium,S. enteritidis, S. typhi, and S. dublin has been reported (9Wada A. Mori N. Oishi K. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Hamanaka Y. Nakashima M.

Biol. 2000; 22: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a mucoid phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not two nonmucoid P. aeruginosastrains, induced hBD-2 mRNA in cultured normal bronchial and tracheal, as well as in normal and CF (cystic fibrosis)-derived nasal epithelial cells. In the present report, the hBD-2-inducing factor from S. enteritidis culture supernatant was purified and identified immunologically and by sequencing as FliC (flagella filament structural protein), the major flagella filament protein of S. enteritidis. FliC induced high levels of hBD-2 production in Caco-2 cells. Because hBD-2-inducing activity in S. enteritidis culture supernatant was completely neutralized by anti-FliC antibody (Fig. 5 B), we concluded that FliC was the hBD-2-inducing factor in S. enteritidis culture supernatant. Bacterial FliCs have been implicated in the production of cytokines. Purified phase I Salmonella flagellin andSalmonella FliC synthesized in E. coli each enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor α and IL-1 from a human promonocytic cell line (19Ciacci-Woolwine F.

Immun. 1999; 67: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induced a cytokine cascade in these cells (22Wyant T.L. Tanner M.K. Sztein M.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3619-3624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa flagella mutants demonstrated reduced pathogenicity in the mouse pneumonia model, consistent with the observation that purified flagella can themselves produce pulmonary inflammation (23Feldman M. Bryan R. Rajan S. Scheffler L. Brunnert S. Tang H. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 43-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FliC from enteroaggregative E. coli stimulated release of IL-8 from Caco-2 cells, and recombinant enteroaggregative E. coliFliC, synthesized in nonpathogenic E. coli, maintained its ability to induce IL-8 (24Steiner T.S. Nataro J.P. Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Guerrant R.L. J. Clin. Inv. 2000; 105: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recently, Gewirtz et al. (25Gewirtz A.T. Rao A.S. Simon Jr P.O. Merlin D. Carnes D. Madara J.L. Neish A.S. J. Clin. Inv. 2000; 105: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) reported that S. typhimurium induced expression of IL-8 via Ca2+-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway in epithelial cells. S. typhimurium invasion is not required for NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells, although bacterial contact is necessary (26Eaves-Pyles T. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 800-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The invasion-defective S. typhimurium mutant HilΔ, which lacks the type III secretion apparatus, was able to induce IL-8 in T84 cells. Thus, IL-8 induction was not dependent on the type III secretion system. Because IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-1 were induced in mammalian cells by bacterial FliC (19Ciacci-Woolwine F.

Activation of NF-κB by Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell wall components is well known, although whether FliC activated NF-κB was not shown. As shown here, NF-κB was activated by FliC, and only the p65-p65 NF-κB homodimer was shown to bind the hBD-2 promoter region. Thus, FliC can activate NF-κB in mammalian cells, and it appears to be responsible for a number of the critical effects ofSalmonella on mammalian cells. 2During the revision of this report, Hayashiet al.

Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). NF-κB also activates the transcription of viral genes and is involved in several pathological events including progression of AIDS by enhancing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription (6Rosemberg Z.F.

Virology. 1989; 169: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), contain functionally important NF-κB-binding sites. In the case of HSV-1, NF-κB-binding sites are located in the ICP0 and Vmw65 genes (12Rong B.L. Libermann T.A. Kogawa K. Ghosh S. Cao L. Pavan- Langston D. Dunkel E.C. Virology. 1992; 189: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to containing NF-κB-binding sites in its genome, HSV-1 can also induce NF-κB nuclear translocation (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and two immediate-early (IE) proteins, ICP4 and ICP27, were found to be required for this effect (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Margolis D.M. Rabson A.B. Straus S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1992; 186: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, the signaling pathway utilized by the virus to activate the factor has still not been defined. We now report that, like proinflammatory cytokines, HSV-1 induces NF-κB by the activation of IKK, followed by IκBα degradation, in the early phase of infection. As we have recently shown that cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) of the A and J type, which possess anti-inflammatory (15Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) and antiviral (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) activity, block TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by direct inhibition and modification of the IKKβ subunit of IKK (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), we have investigated their effect on IKK and NF-κB activation during HSV-1 infection. We report that cyPG are powerful inhibitors of IKK and NF-κB activation induced by HSV-1 infection and that this effect results in a potent antiviral activity in human cells. Human HEp-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells and neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, and monkey VERO cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Cell viability was determined by dye exclusion technique or by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to MTT formazan conversion assay. Prostaglandins (Cayman Chemicals) dissolved in ethanol were used as described (18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). MTT, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and acyclovir were obtained from Sigma. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Reporter plasmids pIE3-CAT, containing the HSV-1 ICP4 promoter (gift from Dr. R. D. Everett), and 2xNF-κB-LUC (gift from Dr. M. Karin), and IκBα super-repressor (IκBα-AA) expression vector have been described (4Di Donato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 19Disney G.H. McKee T.A. Preston C.M. Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h before infection with HSV-1. Twelve h after virus infection, cell extracts were prepared for gene reporter assays as described (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar,18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). HEp-2 cell monolayers were infected for 1 h at 37 °C with HSV-1 strain F1 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu/cell, unless stated otherwise. Prostaglandins were added after the 1-h adsorption period and maintained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. Controls received an equal amount of ethanol, which did not affect cell metabolism or virus replication. Virus titers were determined at different times post-infection (p.i.) by plaque assay or by cytopathic effect 50% (CPE50%) assay on confluent Vero cell monolayers (20Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16446-16452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired data. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E., and p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (10 µCi/105 cells) and lysed in L buffer (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS). Samples containing the same amount of radioactivity were separated by SDS-PAGE (3% stacking gel, 10% resolving gel) and processed for autoradiography (18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein (50 µg/sample) from HEp-2 whole-cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and filters were incubated with monoclonal anti-hsp70 antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), polyclonal anti-IκBα/MAD3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα or anti-JNK1 (PharMingen) antibodies followed by decoration with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Whole-cell extracts were prepared after lysis in a high salt extraction buffer (18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total or nuclear extracts (15 or 5 µg of protein, respectively) were incubated with 32P-labeled κB DNA probe (18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) followed by analysis of DNA binding activities by EMSA. Binding reactions were performed as described (18Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specificity of protein-DNA complexes was verified by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies specific for p65 (Rel A). Quantitative evaluation of NF-κB-κB complex formation was determined by Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager analysis. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-IKKα or anti-JNK1 antibodies in the presence of 15 µl of protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 12 h. After extensive washing, endogenous IKK and JNK1 activities were determined using GST-IκBα-(1–54) and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as substrates, respectively (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as a kinase loading control. Total RNA from uninfected and virus-infected cells was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (21Rozera C. Carattoli A. De Marco A. Amici C. Giorgi C. Santoro M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), fractionated (5 µg) on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of HSV-1 ICP4 mRNA, filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled pRB3094 probe (a gift from Dr. R. Monservigi) and processed for autoradiography. After being stripped, filters were rehybridized with an antisense oligonucleotide specific for the glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) 5′-end-labeled by T4 kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as a loading control (21Rozera C. Carattoli A. De Marco A. Amici C. Giorgi C. Santoro M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Confluent HEp-2 cell monolayers were infected with HSV-1 for 1 h at 37 °C. After the 1-h adsorption period, the virus inoculum was removed, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the following 24 h. Mock-infected cells were treated identically. At different times p.i., whole-cell extracts were analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA and IKK activity by kinase assay. The level of NF-κB DNA binding activity and phosphorylated IκBα were quantitated by Molecular Dynamics Phosphor- Imager analysis. HSV-1 potently induced IKK and NF-κB activation in HEp-2 cells starting at 3 h p.i. (Fig. 1 A). NF-κB activation was independent of the multiplicity of infection and persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 1 B). The IE proteins ICP4 and ICP27 were found to be required for NF-κB nuclear translocation following infection of C33 cells with HSV-1 (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB activation in HEp-2 cells was dependent onde novo synthesized viral products, cell monolayers were infected with HSV-1 in the presence or in the absence of actinomycin D (5 µg/ml), cycloheximide (50 µg/ml), or the antiviral drug acyclovir (5 µg/ml). Eight hours p.i., whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1 C, HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation is dependent on protein synthesis, since it was inhibited by both actinomycin D or cycloheximide treatment. Acyclovir, which does not affect the synthesis of viral α and DNA replication-independent proteins, had no effect on NF-κB activation by HSV-1, indicating that the synthesis of immediate-early or early viral gene products is responsible for NF-κB induction in HEp-2 cells. The HSV-1 genome harbors several consensus binding sites for NF-κB (12Rong B.L. Libermann T.A. Kogawa K. Ghosh S. Cao L. Pavan- Langston D. Dunkel E.C. Virology. 1992; 189: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the importance of NF-κB activation and the potential involvement of κB sites in the progression of the virus replication cycle are not completely understood. We have then investigated the role of NF-κB on HSV-1 gene expression. To investigate whether HSV-1-induced NF-κB was transcriptionally active, we utilized the IκBα super-repressor IκBα-AA, in which Ser32/36 residues critical for phosphorylation by IKK have been replaced by alanine (4Di Donato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). HEp-2 cells were transiently co-transfected with a 2xNF-κB-LUC reporter, together with “empty” or IκBα-AA vectors. After 24 h, cells were infected with HSV-1. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity 12 h p.i. HSV-1 infection induced luciferase expression, and this effect was prevented by co-transfection with IκBα-AA (Fig.2 A), indicating that HSV-1-induced NF-κB is transcriptionally functional. In a different experiment, HEp-2 cells were co-transfected with the IE3-CAT reporter, containing the HSV-1 ICP4 promoter, together with empty or IκBα-AA vectors, and after 24 h were infected with HSV-1. CAT assay was performed 12 h p.i. As expected, HSV-1 infection induced pIE3 expression (Fig. 2 B). Co-transfection with IκBα-AA completely blocked pIE3 expression, indicating that NF-κB is involved in the regulation of HSV-1 IE gene transcription. In a different experiment HEp-2 cells transfected with IκBα-AA or empty vectors were infected with HSV-1 24 h after transfection. At 16 h p.i. NF-κB DNA-binding activity was determined by EMSA in the cellular extracts, and virus titers were determined by CPE50% assay in the supernatant of infected cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, expression of IκBα-AA was effective in inhibiting HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation and resulted in a 70% reduction of virus yield in the supernatant of infected cells (Fig.2 D). These results indicate that transcriptionally active NF-κB plays an important role for efficient viral replication in HSV-1-infected human cells. The effect of different NF-κB inducers on HSV-1 replication was also analyzed. HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 and maintained at 37 °C in the presence or absence of TPA (25 ng/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml). Mock-infected cells were treated identically. Eight hours p.i., cells were harvested, and the levels of NF-κB DNA-binding activity were determined. HSV-1 infection induced NF-κB activation; levels of NF-κB DNA binding were found to be doubled in TPA-treated HSV-1-infected cells (Fig.3 A). In parallel samples HSV-1 ICP4 mRNA levels and infectious particle production were determined at 8 h p.i. by Northern blot analysis and by CPE50%assay, respectively. Both ICP4 mRNA levels and virus titers were increased by more than 100% by TPA treatment (Fig. 3, B andC). Similar results were shown in TNFα-treated HSV-1-infected cells (data not shown), indicating that enhancement of NF-κB activation by different stimuli contributes to increase the efficiency of HSV-1 replication. We have recently shown that cyPG inhibit NF-κB induced by TPA or TNFα treatment in Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells by preventing IKK activation (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). To investigate whether cyPG interfere with virus-mediated induction of IKK and NF-κB, HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 and treated with prostaglandin A1 (PGA1 30 µm) or control diluent soon after the 1-h adsorption period. At different time intervals, cell extracts were analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA, IκBα degradation by immunoblot analysis, and IKK activity by kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, treatment with PGA1 was effective in inhibiting IKK activity and preventing IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation by HSV-1. PGA1 treatment did not inhibit HSV-1-induced activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in the same samples, indicating that PGA1 targets a selected signaling pathway utilized by the virus. PGA1 also completely prevented HSV-1-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription in cells transiently transfected with the 2xNF-κB-LUC reporter (Fig. 4 C). A single treatment with PGA1 prevented HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation up to 24 h p.i. (Fig.5 A). The effect of PGA1 on viral mRNA accumulation, protein synthesis, and infectious virus production was then determined. HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 and treated with 30 µmPGA1 soon after the 1-h adsorption period. Mock-infected cells were treated identically. PGA1 toxicity was analyzed in uninfected and HSV-1-infected cells by microscopic examination and MTT assay. Levels of ICP4 mRNA were determined at 8 h p.i. by Northern blot analysis. Cellular and viral protein synthesis was determined at 24 h p.i. by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, after [35S]methionine labeling. At the concentration of 30 µm PGA1 did not alter cell viability up to 48 h after treatment and did not inhibit cell protein synthesis in uninfected or HSV-1-infected cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig.5, C and D, treatment with PGA1resulted in a dramatic decrease of viral gene expression and completely prevented HSV-1 protein synthesis. A single PGA1 treatment caused over 3000-fold reduction in infectious particle production up to 72 h p.i. (Fig. 5 B). In a different experiment confluent monolayers of HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 and treated with different concentrations of PGA1 1 h after infection. Levels of NF-κB-DNA binding activity were determined 8 h p.i. in cellular extracts. In parallel samples virus yield in the supernatant of infected cells was determined 24 h p.i. As shown in Fig.6 B, PGA1 exerts antiviral activity only at concentrations that inhibit NF-κB. PGA1 antiviral activity is dose-dependent and is correlated with inhibition of NF-κB activation by HSV-1 (IC50 for inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity = 20 µm; IC50 for HSV-1 replication = 18 µm). To investigate whether treatment with PGA1 started at later stages of infection, when the virus-induced events leading to NF-κB activation have already taken place, is still effective in inhibiting HSV-1 replication, HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 and treated with PGA1 (30 µm) at different times p.i. Cell extracts were assayed for NF-κB-DNA binding activity 24 h p.i. At the same time virus titers were determined in the supernatant of infected cells. As shown in Fig. 7 B, treatment with PGA1 started in the first 3 h after infection completely suppressed HSV-1 replication and HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation, whereas treatment started at 6 h p.i. was less effective; treatment started at 9 h p.i., when NF-κB activation is maximal, or at later times after infection had no effect on HSV-1 replication, suggesting that inhibition of NF-κB via IKK is an important factor in the antiviral activity of this molecule. Data shown in Fig. 7 A also indicate that treatment with PGA1 started at 9 h p.i. or later is not effective in preventing NF-κB activation by HSV-1. This finding further supports the hypothesis that early viral protein synthesis is responsible for NF-κB activation. The inability of PGA1 to inhibit NF-κB activity when given at late stages of infection could be due to the fact that, as shown in Fig. 4, HSV-1-induced IKK activity appears to reach a peak around 7 h p.i. and then decreases at 11 h after infection, suggesting that IKK activity at late stage of viral infection is not essential; treatment started at this time would then not be effective in inhibiting NF-κB activation. The fact that the activated form of NF-κB can still be detected at 24 h p.i. suggests that HSV-1 infection could affect NF-κB down-regulation, possibly by inhibiting cellular protein synthesis and therefore reducing IκBα production. In fact, we were unable to detect newly synthesized IκBα at late stages of infection up to 24 h p.i. (data not shown).Figure 7PGA1 inhibits an early event in HSV-1 replication cycle. HEp-2 cells were infected with HSV-1 (10 pfu/cell) and treated with control diluent (−) or PGA1 (30 µm) soon after the 1-h adsorption period (time 0) or at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h p.i. At 24 h p.i., whole-cell extracts were analyzed by EMSA for detection of NF-κB activity (A, upper panel). Levels of NF-κB-DNA binding activities were quantified by Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager analysis and expressed as arbitrary units (A, lower panel). Control lanesrepresent mock-infected untreated cells. In the same experiment, virus yield in the supernatant of infected cells was determined by CPE50% assay at 24 h p.i. and expressed as percentage of virus yield in untreated cells (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Herpes simplex viruses are known to infect a variety of human cell types. In particular, HSV are able to enter neuronal cells and establish latent infections, which play a major role in the recurrence of HSV-induced lesions. To investigate whether HSV-1 is able to activate NF-κB in neuronal cells, human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were infected with HSV-1 at the multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu/cell, and NF-κB activation was determined at different times p.i. by EMSA. To verify whether PGA1 was effective in blocking HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation and virus replication in neuronal cells, parallel SK-N-SH cultures infected with HSV-1 were treated with 12 µm PGA1. Virus titers were determined in the supernatant of infected cells 24 h p.i. Infection with HSV-1 caused a potent and persistent activation of NF-κB in neuroblastoma cells that, similar to the results shown for HEp-2 cells, started at 3 h p.i. and continued for at least 24 h, and was completely prevented by PGA1 treatment (data not shown). Treatment with PGA1 caused a significant reduction of virus yield also in neuroblastoma cells (control, 3.15 ± 0.09 × 106 CPE50%/ml; PGA1-treated, 0.12 ± 0.07 × 106 CPE50%/ml;p < 0.01). Viruses have evolved different strategies to target critical steps in the host cell life, taking over cellular functions to promote their replication. Several viruses take advantage of the preexisting cellular signaling pathways to induce cellular and/or viral gene expression. In the case of herpesviruses, it has been recently shown that HSV-1 activates the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and it has been suggested that activation of these kinases could influence virus replication (22McLean T.I. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8415-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2710-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present report we describe how HSV-1 mimics proinflammatory cytokines activating the IκB kinase IKK, triggering IκBα degradation in the early phase of infection, and causing a dramatic and persistent activation of NF-κB in human cells. Activation starts at 3 h p.i., and the level of NF-κB DNA binding activity increases up to 24 h after infection. Levels of IKK activity were also found to be elevated for several hours after infection. Different herpesviruses were reported previously to activate transiently NF-κB independently of gene expression during or immediately after virus adsorption, through a viral gB- and gH-receptor-dependent mechanism involving a TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-mediated signaling pathway (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have shown that in human cells HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation is persistent and is dependent on de novosynthesized proteins. The fact that the anti-herpetic drug acyclovir, which does not affect the synthesis of viral IE and DNA replication-independent proteins, was found to have no effect on HSV-1-induced NF-κB activation indicates that the synthesis of immediate-early or early viral gene products is necessary for NF-κB induction. These results are in agreement with the previous observation that two IE proteins, ICP4 and ICP27, were required for NF-κB nuclear translocation in C33 cells infected with a different strain of HSV-1 (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Margolis D.M. Rabson A.B. Straus S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1992; 186: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An important role for ICP4 protein not only in NF-κB nuclear translocation, but also in NF-κB activation and triggering NF-κB-dependent transcription, is indicated by a series of experiments, in which HEp-2 cells were transiently co-transfected with the pRB3094 vector (25Mavromara-Nazos P. Silver S. Hubenthal-Voss J. McKnight J.L. Roizman B. Virology. 1986; 149: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) containing the HSV-1ICP4 gene together with 2xNF-κB-LUC reporter or empty vectors. Results from these studies indicate that ICP4 is able to potently activate NF-κB and NF-κB-dependent transcription in HEp-2 cells in the absence of viral infection (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB is not specific for HEp-2 cells. We have found that HSV-1 can induce persistent activation of this factor also in HeLa and 293 cell lines, in Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells, as well as in cells of neuronal origin (SK-N-SH) (data not shown). Persistent activation of NF-κB appears then to be a general response of human cells to HSV-1 infection and could play an important role in viral pathogenesis. In fact, induction of NF-κB function is utilized by HSV-1 to enhance its replication, by increasing the efficiency of NF-κB-dependent viral gene transcription. Patel et al. (13Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) had previously shown that HSV-1-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation is critical for virus replication in C33 cells, as an 80–90% reduction in virus yield was demonstrated following infection of C33 cells expressing a constitutive repressor for IκBα. We have now shown that inhibition of HSV-1-induced NF-κB by transient transfection of HEp-2 cells with the IκBα super-repressor (IκBα-AA) prevents NF-κB-dependent transcription and expression of viral genes and results in a dramatic reduction of virus yield in infected human cells. On the other hand, stimulation of NF-κB with TPA or TNFα results in more than 100% increase in the level of viral mRNA expression and virus yield at early stages of infection (8 h p.i.). Moreover, HSV-1 infection and selected viral proteins have been shown to enhance the transcriptional activity also of heterologous viral gene promoters and, in particular, can activate transcription from the long terminal repeat promoter region of HIV-1 via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism (14Margolis D.M.

Finally, because of the critical role of NF-κB in promoting inflammation, persistent activation of NF-κB could be a key factor in triggering HSV-1-induced inflammatory processes by stimulating the expression of proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines (27Mikloska Z. Danis V.A. Adams S. Lloyd A.R. Adrian D.L. Cunningham A.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IKK and NF-κB could therefore be attractive therapeutic targets for novel anti-herpetic drugs. Prostaglandins (PG), a class of naturally occurring cyclic 20 carbon fatty acids with potent biological properties, participate in the regulation of a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including the immune response, cytoprotection, inflammation, the febrile response, and virus infection (28Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J.Z. Leslie C.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 29Ushikubi F. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Murata T. Matsuoka T. Kobayashi T. Hizaki H. Tuboi K. Katsuyama M. Ichikawa A. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 395: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The ability of prostaglandins of the A type to inhibit virus replication and prevent the establishment of persistent infections was first reported in 1980 (30Santoro M.G. Benedetto A. Carruba G. Garaci E. Jaffe B.M. Science. 1980; 209: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is now well established that PG containing an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring structure (cyclopentenone PG) possess a potent antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses in in vitro andin vivo experimental models (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the antiviral activity is distinct from any other known antiviral agent. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins act on the host cell by inducing a cellular defense mechanism, which involves the activation of the heat shock response (31Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), and can interfere with multiple events during the virus replication cycle (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of negative strand RNA viruses, cyPG were found to block selectively virus protein synthesis and/or to cause specific alterations in the maturation and intracellular translocation of viral glycoproteins (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of retroviruses, treatment with PGA1 or PGJ2 causes a dramatic block of HIV-1 RNA transcription in human lymphoblastoid cells, whereas it does not affect virus adsorption, penetration, reverse transcriptase activity, nor viral DNA accumulation (21Rozera C. Carattoli A. De Marco A. Amici C. Giorgi C. Santoro M.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Inhibition of viral RNA transcription after treatment with the cyclopentenone prostanoids Δ7-PGA1 and Δ12-PGJ2 was also described in human embryonic fibroblasts infected with HSV type 2 (32Yamamoto N. Fukushima M. Tsurumi T. Maeno K. Nishiyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1425-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cyclopentenone prostaglandins can control viral RNA transcription was not known. We have now identified the cellular transcription factor NF-κB and the kinase IKK as new targets for the antiviral activity of cyclopentenone prostanoids. In the present report we show that the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 is a potent inhibitor of IKK and NF-κB activation induced by HSV-1 infection. Treatment with PGA1 started 1 h after infection completely blocked HSV-1-induced IKK activity, preventing IκBα degradation. PGA1 appears to target a selected signaling pathway utilized by the virus, since it did not inhibit JNK activity which, as reported previously in other cell lines (22McLean T.I. Bachenheimer S.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8415-8426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zachos G. Clements B. Conner J. J. Biol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 2710-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was greatly induced in HEp-2 cells following HSV-1 infection. We have shown previously that cyclopentenone prostaglandins block phorbol ester- or TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by inhibition and direct modification of the β subunit of IKK, due to the binding of the prostanoid to cysteine 179 in the activation loop of IKKβ (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The presence of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring in fact allows cyclopentenone prostaglandins to bind covalently to thiol groups of target cysteine residues of specific proteins via the formation of Michael adducts (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The fact that PGA1 does not affect HSV-1-induced JNK activation confirms the previous finding that cyPG do not inhibit JNK1 or p38 activity after exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). This effect has been ascribed to the lack of a target Michael acceptor cysteine residue in the activation loop of these kinases (17Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). NF-κB inhibition by PGA1 results in the block of HSV-1 gene expression and in a dramatic decrease in the production of HSV-1 infectious particles by HEp-2 cells. A single treatment with PGA1 at the concentration of 30 µm, which did not inhibit protein or nucleic acid synthesis in HEp-2 cells, caused an over 3000-fold reduction in virus yield up to 72 h after treatment. Similar results were obtained in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. PGA1 antiviral activity is dose-dependent and is correlated with inhibition of NF-κB activation by HSV-1. Moreover, treatment with PGA1 started at later stages of infection, when NF-κB has already been activated by the virus, is ineffective. These results indicate that inhibition of IKK and NF-κB plays an important role in the prostaglandin-induced block of HSV-1 replication. However, since it is known that, like interferon, prostaglandins can act at multiple levels during the virus replication cycle (16Santoro M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms (i.e. the activation of the heat shock response) could contribute to the potent anti-herpetic activity of PGA1. Different types of prostaglandins are used clinically as cytoprotective drugs for gastroduodenal ulcers, in the treatment of congenital heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and to facilitate labor and are generally effective and well tolerated (33Vane J. O'Grady J. Therapeutic Applications of Prostaglandins. Hodder and Stroughton Publishers, Sevenoaks, U.K.1993Google Scholar, 34Shield M.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 65: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PGE1infusion was also shown to be beneficial in patients with fulminant viral hepatitis (35Sinclair S.B. Greig P.D. Blendis L.M. Abecassis M. Roberts E.A. Phillips M.J. Cameron R. Levy G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The results described suggest that cyclopentenone prostanoids or prostanoid-derived molecules could be good candidates for a new class of antiviral drugs exerting their effect by a novel pathway, inhibiting both virus replication and virus-induced inflammatory stimuli, and suitable for use in combination with conventional anti-herpetic chemotherapy.

A mature, fully glycosylated, form of CRLR was associated with 125I-CGRP binding, upon co-expression of RAMP1 and CRLR. In contrast, RAMP2 and -3 promoted the expression of smaller, core-glycosylated, CRLR forms, which were linked to AM receptor pharmacology.

(1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) reported that co-expression of two classes of polypeptides, a seven-transmembrane receptor known as the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR)1 and accessory proteins termed receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), are required to generate functional receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM). The formation of heterodimers between RAMPs and CRLR was found to be essential for the proper cell surface targeting and pharmacological characteristics of both CGRP and AM receptors (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Leuthäuser K. Gujer R. Aldecoa A. McKinney R.A. Muff R. Fisher J.A. Born W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The RAMP family comprises three members (RAMP1, -2, and -3) that share less than 30% sequence identity but a common topological organization. They are small intrinsic membrane proteins (predicted sizes: M r 14,000–17,000) with a large extracellular N terminus (∼100 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain, and a very short intracellular domain (10 amino acids). Co-expression of RAMP1 with CRLR led to the formation of a CGRP receptor, whereas RAMP2 and -3 promoted the expression of an AM receptor (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The distinct ligand-binding specificity imposed by the RAMP expressed with CRLR was accompanied by apparent differences in the receptor maturation pathways. The major CRLR species obtained upon co-expression with RAMP1 corresponded to a mature glycoprotein ofM r 66,000 containing fully processed complex oligosaccharides. This species was associated with the binding of125I-hαCGRP to the cell surface. In contrast, the major CRLR product observed with RAMP2 and -3 was an apparently immatureM r 58,000 form containing high mannose core oligosaccharides that were sensitive to endoglycosidase H (endo H) treatment (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These data suggested three ways in which RAMPs might confer CGRP or AM receptor properties: 1) the glycosylation state of CRLR may determine the binding selectivity; 2) RAMPs might contribute directly by contributing or masking binding sites; or 3) RAMPs might enable different binding states of CRLR by allosterically modifying its conformation (5Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although it was implicitly proposed that the M r 66,000 form of CRLR is the CGRP receptor while the immature M r 58,000 species represent the AM receptor, this hypothesis was never directly tested and not entirely satisfactory. First, the molecular weight of the AM receptor in native tissues has been reported as being significantly larger (6Owji A.A. Gardiner J.V. Upton P.D. Mahmoodi M. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2172-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, the idea that an incompletely processed CRLR could represent the AM receptor is somewhat surprising. Indeed, processing of the oligosaccharides from the high mannose to the complex type normally occurs during the transit through the Golgi apparatus, which is a normal prerequisite for cell surface expression of glycoproteins (7Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walkers P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is not clear how a receptor could bypass this maturation process. More recent data also argued that the difference in the glycosylation state of CRLR is unlikely to be responsible for the distinct pharmacology. Indeed, the transfection of CRLR-RAMP1 or CRLR-RAMP2 heterodimers in DrosophilaSchneider 2 cells led to CRLR moieties that had no apparent differences in their glycosylation status but still displayed distinct CGRP and AM receptor pharmacology, respectively (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, whether distinct maturation pathways that did not result in different glycosylation patterns in these insect cells could still be involved in defining their pharmacological properties was not directly assessed. Moreover, the particular glycosylation machinery characteristic of the insect cells (8Kuroda K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Doerfler W. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1990; 174: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) makes it difficult to extrapolate to the mammalian cells. The present study was therefore undertaken to further investigate the maturation of CRLR and its implication in the pharmacological properties of the receptors produced upon co-expression with the three RAMPs in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that RAMP2 and RAMP3 and not only RAMP1 can promote the full maturation of CRLR, leading to its terminal glycosylation. Moreover, only the fully processed receptors were found to bind AM and CGRP. Linked to the observation that the radiolabeled peptides could be cross-linked to RAMPs, our data suggest that direct protein-protein interactions between the RAMPs and CRLR and not the glycosylation state of the later determine the binding selectivity of the complex. 125I-rAM and 125I-hαCGRP (specific activity: 2000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human AM and αCGRP were from Bachem AG (Budenford, Switzerland). Mouse anti-Myc antibodies (9E10 clone) and mouse anti-HA antibodies (12CA5 clone) were produced by our core facility as ascite fluids. Rabbit anti-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and rat anti-HA antibodies (3F10 clone) were fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was from Pierce. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from various commercial suppliers. The expression vectors for RAMP1, RAMP2, RAMP3, Myc-CRLR, and HA-CRLR were constructed as previously described (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The RAMP1/2, RAMP2/1 chimeras were constructed using the conserved DPP motif, located at the amino-terminal side of the transmembrane domain, as the boundary between the two proteins (4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 µg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (9Mellon P.L. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cells in six-well plates or 100-mm Petri dishes were grown to 70% confluence and transfected with 0.1 µg of DNA for HA or Myc epitope-tagged CRLR or 0.05 µg for RAMPs per cm2. The total amount of DNA transfected in each condition was kept constant by adding empty pcDNA3 vector when needed. Twenty hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h and then replaced for an additional 24 h with fresh medium without sodium butyrate. All of the experiments were performed 72 h after transfection to allow correct glycosylation and cell surface targeting of CRLR and RAMPs. Transfected HEK293T cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed three times in PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h on ice followed by incubation with anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies (1:150 dilution) in blocking buffer on ice for 2 h. After two washes in blocking buffer and two washes in PBS, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmpefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was assessed by using Bio-Rad's DC assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For “total” immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with additional anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies (1:500 dilution) before the addition of 30 µl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h. For “cell surface” immunoprecipitation, only protein G-Sepharose was added. The same quantity of proteins was used for “total” and “cell surface” immunoprecipitation in each experiment. A higher quantity of proteins was immunoprecipitated for RAMP3/Myc-CRLR than other conditions due to the reduced level of Myc-CRLR expression for this combination. Protein G-Sepharose/antibody/antigen complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The immunoprecipitate was then washed four times with cold lysis buffer containing 150, 250, 350, and finally 150 mm NaCl. The final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4.5m urea, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies (1:8000 dilution), or rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (3F10 clone, 1:3000 dilution). The Renaissance chemiluminescence kit was used for the Western blot development (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Deglycosylation of immunopurified Myc-CRLR was carried out with endo H or peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein G-Sepharose/antibody/Myc-CRLR complexes were washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 40 µl of 50 mm sodium phosphate at either pH 5.5 (endo H) or pH 7.5 (PNGase F) containing 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 50 mm EDTA, 1 mm pefabloc, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.25 µg/ml leupeptin, 1% β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 50 milliunits/ml endoglycosidase H or 50 units/mlN-glycosidase F. Sample incubation in the absence of either enzyme were carried out as control. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× protein sample buffer (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 8.5 murea) and heating of the samples at 50 °C. HEK293T cells in six-well plates were transfected with Myc-CRLR or HA-CRLR in the presence of empty vector or vector encoding RAMPs (RAMP1, -2, and -3) or chimeric constructs (RAMP1/2 and -2/1). Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were washed three times in cold PBS and incubated on ice for 3 h in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with125I-rAM (80 pm) or with125I-hαCGRP (40 pm) in the absence or presence of 1 µm unlabeled ligand, human AM 1–52 or hαCGRP, respectively. After incubation, cells were washed once with binding buffer and twice with PBS and then cross-linked for 1 h with 1 mm BS3 in PBS. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by incubating cells (3 × 10 min) in PBS containing 25 mm glycine. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-Myc antibodies (9E10) or mouse anti-HA antibodies (12CA5), and the immunocomplexes were treated or not treated with endo H or PNGase F as described above. Proteins were separated on 10 or 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Cross-linked 125I-rAM and 125I-hαCGRP were detected with BioMax MS Eastman Kodak Co. films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identity of the CRLR species targeted to the cell surface was initially assessed in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged CRLR alone or in combination with RAMP1, -2, or -3. In the absence of co-transfected RAMP, a major species ofM r 58,000, which was previously shown to be the precursor core-glycosylated form of CRLR (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar), was detected in the total extract (Fig. 1, lane 1). However, this species was not detected upon cell surface immunoprecipitation (lane 2), indicating that it does not reach the plasma membrane. A higher molecular form ofM r 90,000, the nature of which will be discussed later, was present both in the total extract and at the cell surface. In the presence of RAMP1, only a M r 66,000 species was observed. This form, previously described as terminally glycosylated (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar), was detected both in the total extract (lane 3) and at the cell surface (lane 4), indicating that RAMP1 promoted additional maturation of CRLR and its transport to the cell surface. In cells co-expressing Myc-CRLR and RAMP2, both theM r 58,000 and 66,000 forms were detected in the total extract (lane 5), indicating that RAMP2 is less efficient than RAMP1 in promoting the maturation of CRLR to theM r 66,000 form. Despite the fact that theM r 58,000 form represented the major species in the total extract, only the M r 66,000 form was observed at the cell surface (lane 6). As in the absence of co-transfected RAMP, the M r 90,000 form was also observed in the total extract and at the cell surface. When expressed with RAMP3, equal amounts of M r58,000 and 64,000 forms were observed, in both total extracts and at the cell surface (lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, these results suggest that not only RAMP1 but also RAMP2 and -3, albeit to a lesser extent, can promote further processing of the core glycosylated M r 58,000 form toM r 66,000 and 64,000 species that can be expressed at the cell surface. In order to confirm that the M r 66,000 and 64,000 species represented CRLR mature species that underwent Golgi processing, the glycosylation state of the forms obtained in each co-transfection condition were analyzed. As expected, when Myc-CRLR was expressed alone, the M r 58,000 form (Fig.2, lane 1) was reduced to M r 48,000 by treatments with both endo H (lane 2) and PNGase F (lane 3), the endo H sensitivity confirming the lack of Golgi processing and suggesting that this species represents an immature form of the receptor. In contrast, the M r 90,000 form, which was detected at the cell surface, was found to be sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to endo H, indicating that it may represent an SDS-resistant complex involving the fully processed form of the receptor. When co-expressed with either RAMP1, -2, or -3, the CRLR species targeted to the cell surface (M r 66,000, 66,000 or 64,000, respectively) were found to be sensitive to PNGase F (being reduced to M r 48,000) but resistant to the action of endo H (lanes 6and 5, respectively). The small decrease in mobility observed in all cases following endo H treatment most likely reflects a contaminating mannosidase activity. These data therefore confirm that the three RAMPs can promote Golgi transit and terminal glycosylation of CRLR. The initial studies that led to the suggestion that RAMP2 and -3 cannot promote terminal glycosylation of CRLR were carried out using an HA-tagged receptor. To test the possibility that the presence of the HA tag may explain the difference observed between these studies and the present report, the expression pattern of the HA-CRLR was also investigated. Consistent with these previous studies, the core-glycosylated M r 58,000 form represented the major species found both in the total extract and at the cell surface when HA-CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP2 (Fig.3, lanes 5 and6) or RAMP3 (lanes 7 and8). Interestingly, a significant amount of core glycosylated HA-CRLR was observed even when RAMP1 was co-expressed (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the choice of epitope tag may be a critical factor. However, in agreement with what was seen when using Myc-CRLR, the terminally glycosylated form (M r 66,000 for RAMP1 and -2 andM r 64,000 for RAMP3) could also be detected in total extracts (lanes 3, 5, and7) and at the cell surface (lanes 4,6, and 8), albeit to a lesser extent. This confirms that the three RAMPs can promote the maturation of CRLR, although RAMP2 and -3 appear to do so less efficiently. The difference with previous studies (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), in which noM r 66,000 species could be detected when total extracts of cells co-expressing HA-CRLR and RAMP2 was examined, is most likely due to the longer transfection time used in the present study (72 versus 48 h) allowing a longer period for the accumulation of the fully processed receptor. The reason for the lower maturation efficiency of the HA-tagged receptor and the appearance, at the cell surface, of an important quantity of core-glycosylated (M r 58,000) HA-CRLR is not clear. One could hypothesize that the presence of the HA tag (and not the Myc tag) precludes the efficient trimming of the receptor carbohydrate in the Golgi, resulting in the transit of the RAMP-CRLR complex through the Golgi without the concurrent processing of the sugar. Alternatively, the presence of the HA tag may favor the escape of incompletely folded receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum. In any case, despite the quantitative difference between the two tagged CRLR versions, the data clearly indicate that RAMP2 and RAMP3, albeit to a lesser extent than RAMP1, can also promote the proper maturation and cell surface trafficking of the receptor. The lower extent of maturation observed with RAMP2 and -3 as compared with RAMP1 may reflect differences in the folding efficacy of the RAMP-CRLR heterodimers or a different level of expression of the three RAMPs. As it was observed for the Myc-tagged receptor, a significant amount of immunoreactive HA-tagged CRLR was detected at the cell surface even in the absence of co-expressed RAMP (Fig. 3, lane 2). This indicates either that the receptor can be targeted to the cell surface in the absence of RAMPs or that endogenous RAMPs may be involved. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, endogenous RAMP1 and RAMP2 mRNAs have previously been detected in HEK293 cells (1McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AM binding and signaling was detected in HEK293 cells transfected with CRLR-GFP in the absence of overexpressed RAMP (10Kuwasako K. Shimekake Y. Masuda M. Nakahara K. Yoshida T. Kitaura M. Kitamura K. Eto T. Sakata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29602-29609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that endogenous RAMP2 is expressed in this cell type. The presence of endogenous RAMP2 is also supported in the present study by the similar pattern of immunoreactive species observed with Myc-CRLR expressed alone or in combination with exogenous RAMP2 (Fig.1, compare lanes 2 and 6). Indeed, aM r 90,000 form involving the terminally glycosylated CRLR (see Fig. 1) is detected at the cell surface in both cases. Based on the electrophoretic mobility, this species could correspond to an SDS-stable complex between CRLR and RAMP2. TheM r 66,000 species, which represents the terminally glycosylated form of the receptor was also observed in some cases when CRLR is expressed alone (data not shown). TheM r 90,000 complex was not detected when RAMP1 or RAMP3 was overexpressed, suggesting a competition between these RAMPs and the endogenous RAMP2 for CRLR. As indicated above, such competition between RAMPs has been previously reported in a rabbit aortic endothelial cell line, in rat osteoblast-like UMR 106 cells, and in Xenopus oocytes (11Muff R. Leuthauser K. Bülhmann N. Foord S.M. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Bülhmann N. Leuthäuser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W.

Trans. 1999; 27: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the case of the HA-tagged CRLR, no M r 90,000 form was detected by Western blot. This may not be surprising, since very little terminally glycosylated M r 66,000 form was seen. In addition, no SDS-resistant complex between the cell surfaceM r 58,000 and endogenous RAMP2 was observed, indicating that the lack of terminal glycosylation destabilizes the complex. This is consistent with the observation that PNGase F treatment of the Myc-CRLR/endogeneous RAMP2 leads to the dissociation of the M r 90,000 and the appearance of a partially deglycosylated CRLR (Fig. 2, lanes 4and 6). Experiments were undertaken to determine which CRLR species could bind AM and CGRP. Cross-linking experiments using125I-rAM and 125I-hαCGRP and the cell-impermeable cross-linker BS3 were carried out in cells expressing either HA- or Myc-tagged CRLR in the presence or absence of the three RAMPs. In addition, the role of the amino-terminal domain of RAMPs on the binding properties of CRLR were assessed using the chimeric constructs, RAMP1/2 and RAMP2/1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 4 A,125I-rAM labeling was predominantly observed when Myc-CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP2 or the RAMP2/1 chimera. In each case, two AM-labeled bands of M r ∼70,000 andM r ∼95,000 were observed. The strong signal atM r ∼70,000 is consistent with the binding of125I-rAM (M r 6000) to the fully processed CRLR (M r 66,000), while the band atM r ∼95,000 most likely represents the AM-bound CRLR-RAMP2 complex. Albeit to a lesser extent, labeling was also observed for the RAMP3/Myc-CRLR combination. The slightly faster electrophoretic mobility of the labeled bands is consistent with the observation that the terminally glycosylated form of CRLR promoted by RAMP3 is smaller (M r 64,000 versus66,000; see Fig. 1). This most likely results from a differential glycosylation, since PNGase F treatment leads to the expectedM r 48,000 form (Fig. 2, lane 6 of the myc-CRLR + RAMP3 panel). This biochemical difference, however, does not seem to lead to any detectable pharmacological differences, since both RAMP2 and RAMP3 generate AM receptors. The weaker labeling observed with RAMP3 does not indicate a lower affinity for AM but rather a reduced expression level of Myc-CRLR upon co-expression of RAMP3 as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). When Myc-CRLR was expressed with RAMP1 and RAMP1/2, only a weak labeling was observed (despite equivalent expression of CRLR; data not shown), in agreement with the previously reported (4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) low affinity of the Myc-CRLR/RAMP1 combination for AM. The labeling obtained when CRLR is expressed alone most likely reflects the expression of endogenous RAMP2 as discussed above. When cross-linking experiments were carried out with125I-hαCGRP (Fig. 4 B), two major species ofM r ∼70,000 and ∼85,000 were labeled only upon co-expression of Myc-CRLR with RAMP1 or RAMP1/2. TheM r values of these labeled forms are consistent with the size of CGRP (M r 4000) incorporated into the terminally glycosylated CRLR (M r66,000) and CRLR-RAMP1 complex (M r 80,000). The lack of CGRP binding when RAMP2, RAMP2/1, and RAMP3 were expressed is consistent with the lack of binding affinity of the AM receptor for CGRP (4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The difference in electrophoretic mobility between the AM-labeled CRLR-RAMP2 complex (M r ∼95,000; see Fig. 4 A) and the CGRP-labeled CRLR-RAMP1 complex (M r ∼85,000; see Fig. 4 B) results from the difference in theoretical size between the two RAMPs (M r 16,000 versus 14,000) and the fact that RAMP2 and not RAMP1 is glycosylated (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6). RAMP2/1 mimicked the effect of RAMP2 in promoting intense AM labeling, whereas RAMP1/2 favored CGRP labeling similarly to RAMP1. This suggests, as previously reported in radioligand binding and functional assays (4Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), that the extracellular domain of the RAMPs determines the binding selectivity of the CRLR species. Fig. 4, C and D, illustrate the labeling obtained for both 125I-rAM and 125I-hαCGRP when the HA-tagged CRLR was used. Although looking somewhat different from the one generated with Myc-tagged CRLR, the pattern of radiolabel incorporation obtained for HA-CRLR shows that the same species (M r ∼70,000 and ∼95,000 for125I-rAM and M r ∼70,000 and ∼85,000 for 125I-hαCGRP) are involved in ligand recognition. The weaker labeling observed with the HA-tagged receptor is consistent with the low amounts of terminally glycosylated receptor at the cell surface (see Fig. 3). The glycosylation status of the AM- and CGRP-bound receptor was assessed to determine whether or not the immature form of CRLR could bind ligand. As seen in Fig.5 A, theM r ∼70,000 bands labeled with125I-rAM were found to be resistant to the action of endo H (lanes 2, 5, 8,11, 14, and 17) but reduced to aM r ∼52,000 band upon PNGase F treatment (lanes 3, 6, 9,12, 15, and 18), confirming that they represent fully processed receptor. The M r∼95,000 band observed upon co-expression of RAMP2 (lanes 10–12), RAMP2/1 (lanes 13–15), and RAMP3 (lanes 16–18) was also found to be endo H-resistant, indicating that the labeled CRLR-RAMP complexes also contained terminally glycosylated receptor. As in the case of Fig.4 A, the lower level of labeling observed with RAMP3 (Fig.5 A, lanes 16–18), is the result of a reduced expression level of Myc-CRLR as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Surprisingly, and in contrast with the M r∼70,000 bands, the M r ∼95,000 complex was unaffected by the PNGaseF treatment (Fig. 5 A,lanes 12, 15, and 18). Such a resistance has also been reported for the AM-bound CRLR-RAMP2 complex expressed in insect cells (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This indicates that the cross-linking of CRLR and RAMP2 (or RAMP2/1 or RAMP3) with AM leads to a conformation of the receptor in which the glycosylation sites are no longer accessible to the deglycosylation enzyme. Weaker AM labeling was observed upon RAMP1 (lanes 4–6) and RAMP1/2 (lanes 7–9) co-expression, as would be predicted by the poor affinity of AM for CGRP receptors. However, as was the case for RAMP2, RAMP2/1, and RAMP3, the labeled M r ∼70,000 form was found to be endo H-resistant and thus terminally glycosylated. Interestingly, unlike the M r ∼95,000 CRLR-RAMP2 complex, theM r ∼85,000 CRLR-RAMP1 or CRLR-RAMP1/2 complexes were sensitive to PNGase F (lanes 6 and9, respectively), indicating that distinct conformations are promoted by the different RAMPs. Some AM (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–3) but not CGRP (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–3) cross-linking was observed when Myc-CRLR was expressed alone, again consistent with the notion that endogenous RAMP2 is present. Also in agreement with this notion is the relative labeling of the M r ∼85,000–95,000 complexes versus the M r ∼70,000 CRLR bands. Indeed, as observed for RAMP2, RAMP2/1, and RAMP3, the labeling of the M r ∼70,000 bands is favored in the absence of overexpressed RAMP (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10, 13, 16, and 1, respectively). This contrasts with the equivalent labeling of the two species occurring in the case of RAMP1 and RAMP1/2 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 7). As for AM, 125I-hαCGRP binding was only observed for mature forms of the receptor. Indeed, both theM r ∼70,000 CRLR and 85,000 CRLR-RAMP complexes observed upon co-expression of Myc-CRLR and RAMP1 (Fig. 5 B,lanes 4–6) or RAMP1/2 (lanes 7–9) were resistant to endoH (lanes 5and 8) but sensitive to PNGase F treatment (lanes 6 and 9). The sensitivity of the complex to PNGase F, which contrasts with the resistance of CRLR-RAMP2 to this treatment, suggests that the distinct conformation (PNGase F-resistantversus -sensitive) imposed by the different RAMPs is independent of the agonist bound. In order to determine if the RAMPs are close to the ligand binding site within the CRLR-RAMP heterodimer, the same samples, previously used to show ligand-CRLR binding, were loaded on higher percentage polyacrylamide gels, enabling the co-visualization of CRLR and RAMP proteins. As shown in Fig. 6 A, AM was cross-linked to a species of M r 30,000 in cells co-expressing Myc-CRLR and RAMP2 (lanes 10–12) or RAMP2/1 (lanes 13–15). This band, which was not observed with other combinations (pcDNA3, RAMP1, -1/2, or -3), was found to be resistant to endo H treatment (lanes 11 and 14) but reduced to aM r 24,000 form after PNGase F treatment (lanes 12 and 15). This is consistent with the fact that RAMP2 is glycosylated (one potentialN-linked glycosylation site) and that it is targeted to the cell surface as a fully processed protein (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling observed for RAMP is significantly less than that observed for CRLR. For RAMP3 (lanes 16–18), virtually no labeling could be observed in the untreated and endo H-treated sample, but a weak labeling of a M r 19,000 band could be seen following PNGase F treatment (lane 18), probably as a result of the band sharpening after deglycosylation (RAMP3 harbors four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (14Sexton P.M. Albiston A. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). This first demonstration that RAMP2 and RAMP3 can be labeled with125I-rAM suggests that they lie close to the binding pocket within the CRLR-RAMP2 heterodimer and that they could play a role in determining binding specificity. A weak labeling of a M r 17,000 band was also observed when Myc-CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP1 (lanes 4–6) or RAMP1/2 (lanes 7–9). These bands, corresponding to RAMP1 and RAMP1/2, were found to be unaffected by either endo H (lanes 5 and 8) or PNGase F (lanes 6–9) treatment, consistent with the lack of N-glycosylation site in this protein. SuchM r 17,000 bands were strongly labeled by125I-hαCGRP when CRLR was co-expressed with RAMP1 or RAMP1/2 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–6 and7–9, respectively). As for RAMP2 and RAMP3, these results suggest that RAMP1 is close to the ligand binding site. Interestingly, 125I-rAM labeling observed for RAMP2, RAMP2/1, or RAMP3 is very weak in comparison with CRLR, whereas CRLR, RAMP1, and RAMP1/2 were similarly labeled by 125I-hαCGRP. These differences in labeling intensity cannot be explained by the number of lysines available for the BS3 cross-linking, since CGRP contains two lysines compared with four for AM, and the NH2terminus of RAMP1 contains only one lysine versus three for RAMP2 or RAMP3. Thus, the difference in the relative labeling intensity between CRLR and RAMP most likely reflects different conformations for CRLR-RAMP1 versus CRLR-RAMP2 and CRLR-RAMP3 complexes. Taken together, our results directly demonstrate that the distinct pharmacology conferred by each RAMP is independent of the glycosylation state of the CRLR. Indeed, both AM and CGRP were found to bind only to the endo H-resistant terminally glycosylated form of the receptor. This is consistent with previous results obtained in insect cells in which the distinct pharmacology of the CRLR-RAMP complexes was observed despite similar glycosylation (2Aldecoa A. Gujer R. Fischer J.A. Born W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RAMP1 and -3 were also found to confer amylin binding to the calcitonin receptor gene product without affecting its maturation/glycosylation state (15Muff R. Bülhmann N. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2924-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16Zumpe E.T Tilakaratne N. Fraser N.J. Christopoulos G. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Since the difference in glycosylation cannot be invoked, the distinct pharmacology acquired by CRLR reflects either a direct participation of the RAMPs to the selective binding pockets of the peptides or an indirect conformational effect on CRLR (5Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 184-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The observation that the three RAMPs could be cross-linked to either AM or CGRP indicates that the accessory proteins lie close to the binding site. Although not proving it, this would be consistent with a direct contribution of RAMPs to ligand binding. An indirect conformational effect, however, cannot be excluded. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that the different CRLR-RAMP complexes adopt distinct conformation. For instance, whereas the CRLR-RAMP1 complex is sensitive to the action of PNGase F, both RAMP2- and RAMP3-CRLR heterodimers were resistant to the enzyme. Also, only the RAMP2-CRLR complex could be detected without cross-linking agent (Fig. 1), indicating a relative resistance of this complex to SDS-denaturation. Interestingly, RAMP2 and -3 but not RAMP1 were found to be glycosylated, and thus the presence of these carbohydrate may play a role in imposing different conformation to the complexes. Determining the precise nature of the interactions between CRLR and RAMPs that lead to distinct ligand binding selectivity will require additional structural studies aimed at describing the three-dimensional structure of the heterodimers.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). So far, at least 10 MAP kinase family members have been identified in mammalian cells (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). According to a tripeptide signature motif (Tyr-Xaa-Thr) in their kinase subdomain VIII, these protein kinases can be classified into three subfamilies including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

ERK1 and ERK2 are the archetypes of the ERK subfamily which are highly activated by growth factors. In contrast, the JNK and p38 subfamilies are activated preferentially by stress including ultraviolet light, heat shock, and lipopolysaccharide (3Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), and therefore they are also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Once activated, MAP kinases can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, leading to the phosphorylation of a multitude of transcription factors and altered gene expression (4Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 5Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of various MAP kinase subfamilies have been studied extensively in a large number of systems. In general, ERK activation is closely associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and enhanced cell survival after cellular stress, although in certain situations, such as recently described for cisplatin treatment, ERK activation is required for the execution of apoptosis (6Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of JNK and p38 is usually associated with enhanced apoptosis and production of inflammatory cytokines (7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 8Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), although there are notable exceptions in which JNK/p38 activation is necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation (9Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 10Puri P.L. Wu Z.

Because MAP kinase pathways play an important role in regulating many critical cellular processes, the precise regulation of these signaling proteins is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The activities of all MAP kinases are regulated via reversible phosphorylation of the conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in their tripeptide signature motifs by specific MAP kinase kinases and protein phosphatases (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 11Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem.

In mammalian cells, inactivation of MAP kinases is accomplished primarily by a family of dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases that can act on both the phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues. So far, nine distinct mammalian MAP kinase phosphatase family members have been characterized. According to their subcellular localization and patterns of transcriptional regulation, these phosphatases can be roughly divided into two groups (13Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The first group includes MKP-3/Pyst-1, Pyst-2, MKP-4, MKP-5, and M3/6, which are localized predominantly in the cytosol and are therefore thought to control mainly the MAP kinase-regulated events that occur in the cytosol. The second group of enzymes includes MKP-1 (CL100/3CH134), MKP-2, PAC-1, and B23, which are localized primarily in the nuclear compartment. Encoded by immediate early genes, these nuclear MAP kinase phosphatases are induced rapidly by many of the same stimuli that also activate MAP kinases (14Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 15Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 16Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M.

Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For this reason, it has been suggested that these MAP kinase phosphatases play an important role in the feedback control of MAP kinase signaling in the nucleus (12Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 13Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that several cytosolic MAP kinase phosphatases can interact with their substrate MAP kinases, and such an interaction increases their catalytic activities substantially (19Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar,20Dowd S. Sneddon A.A. Keyse S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that catalytic activation of MAP kinase phosphatases mediated through substrate binding may play an important role in determining their substrate preferences. However, not all cytosolic MAP kinase phosphatases undergo catalytic activation upon interaction with their substrates. For example, although MKP-5 interacts with its substrate MAP kinases through a basic motif in its NH2-terminal domain, this interaction has little effect on its catalytic activity (21Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 22Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Even though the substrate specificities for many nuclear MAP kinase phosphatases have been studied extensively (23Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about their abilities to interact with their substrates. Even less is known about the mechanisms underlying the interactions or the effects that these interactions have on their biochemical and physiological functions. In this report, we have characterized the interactions between a nuclear MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-2 (25Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 26Guan K.L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and its substrate MAP kinases and the subsequent effects such interactions have on the catalytic activity of MKP-2. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the substrate specificity of MKP-2 and strongly suggest that catalytic activation of MKP-2 upon binding to its substrates is crucial for its function. HeLa and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE™6 transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis) according to the manufacturer's specifications. HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the induction of apoptosis, HeLa cells were plated in six-well plates and transfected with pSRα-based expression constructs for FLAG-tagged MKP-2 proteins 1 day prior to cisplatin treatment. To confirm the role of ERK MAP kinases in cisplatin-induced apoptosis, 30 min prior to the addition of cisplatin, MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 (CalBiochem) and U0126 (Promega) were added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 and 10 µm, respectively. To isolate proteins from the cells for biochemical analysis, cells were harvested in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 2 µm leupeptin, 2 µm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mammalian expression vector pSRα-FLAG-MKP-2 and bacterial expression vector pET41a-p38 (mouse p38α (28Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar)) have been described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). pEBG-MKP-2 was generated by cloning the human MKP-2 cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pEBG (29Sanchez I. Hughes R.T.

All vectors expressing mutant MKP-2 proteins were generated with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene). The human JNK1 cDNA (30Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T.

BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) for producing GST-JNK1 fusion protein. The construct expressing a JNK1 mutant (JNK1 E329N) equivalent to the ERK2 sevenmaker was generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange). All constructs generated in this study were confirmed by sequencing. pGEX-ERK1 for producing human ERK1 (32Butch E.R. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

The plasmid expressing His6-tagged ERK2 (His6-ERK2) was kindly provided by Melanie H. Cobb (34Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (35Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged proteins were detected using a monoclonal antibody against FLAG (M2) (BAbCo, Richmond, CA). Endogenous ERK1/2 was detected using an anti-pan ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Endogenous JNK1 and p38 were detected using polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The subcellular localization of MKP-2 was determined essentially as described previously (36Ben Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells seeded in six-well plates were transiently transfected with vectors expressing FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant MKP-2 proteins. 48 h after transfection, cells were first fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and then blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. After blocking, the cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the anti-FLAG antibody at a concentration of 20 µg/ml. The cells were washed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST) and once with TBS for 15 min, then incubated with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with TBST, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize the nuclei and examined under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York). Recombinant GST-MKP-2 protein and its derivatives were produced in 293T cells through transient transfections and isolated essentially as described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, four times with washing buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), three times with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT), and finally eluted into the reaction buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Typically, this procedure yielded about 1 mg of full-length GST-MKP-2 protein from 20 150-mm dishes of 293T cells with a purity of about 70%, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. Recombinant GST-MAP kinase fusion proteins were produced inEscherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose affinity beads as described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). His6-ERK2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified through batch binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To pull down MKP-2 with recombinant MAP kinases, HeLa cells were transfected with pSRα-based constructs expressing FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant MKP-2 proteins, and lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. Purified GST-MAP kinases (4 µg) that were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with these cell lysates for 16 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mm NaCl. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-FLAG antibody. To pull down endogenous MAP kinases using GST-MKP-2, 293T cells were transfected with pEBG-based constructs expressing GST-tagged wild type or mutant MKP-2 proteins. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The proteins pulled down with the beads were washed similarly and then subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies recognizing MAP kinases. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) hydrolysis by MKP-2 was carried out as described previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, a series of 200-µl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm DTT, 20 mm p-NPP, and the indicated amounts of wild type or mutant GST-MKP-2 proteins were added to 96-well plates. The reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and monitored at 405 nm over a 5-h period. To assess the effect of various MAP kinases on MKP-2 activity, the indicated amounts of GST-MAPK fusion proteins were included in the reactions. The protein phosphatase activity of MKP-2 toward ERK2 was examined indirectly through an in vitrophosphatase-coupled kinase assay. Briefly, 50 ng of activated recombinant rat ERK2 protein (Calbiochem) was incubated with the indicated amounts of purified recombinant GST-MKP-2 protein for 15 min at 30 °C in 50 µl of phosphatase reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm DTT. Then 10 µl of a mixture containing 6 mmNa3VO4, 60 µm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 6 µg of myelin basic protein (MBP) was added to the reaction to terminate the action of the phosphatase and to initiate the kinase reaction. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Phosphorylation of MBP was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To assess the phosphatase activity of MKP-2 in vivo, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated amounts of pSRα-based expression constructs for wild type or mutant MKP-2. 16 h after transfection, cells were first serum starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 20% fetal bovine serum for 5 min. Cells were harvested, and the activity of endogenous ERK2 was assessed by immunocomplex kinase assays as described previously (37Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To examine whether different MAP kinases can stimulate the catalytic activity of MKP-2, recombinant MKP-2 was expressed in 293T cells as a GST fusion protein, purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and eluted. A mutant MKP-2 protein carrying a Cys-280 → Ser substitution in its catalytic site (MKP-2 C280S) was prepared similarly. Coomassie staining of the samples separated on NuPAGE gel revealed a major band of 65 kDa, a minor band of 50 kDa (tentatively identified as human translation elongation factor-1γ by mass spectrometry), and two faint bands of 32 and 26 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis of the proteins did not detect any contamination from the endogenous MAP kinase proteins (data not shown). Because truncation of 58 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of MKP-2 reduced the size of GST-MKP-2 by about 6 kDa (data not shown), we concluded that this expression system had produced full-length MKP-2 proteins. Based on Coomassie staining of the gels, we estimated that the purity of the recombinant MKP-2 proteins was about 70%. The basal activity of the recombinant MKP-2 proteins was measured through the hydrolysis of p-NPP (Fig. 1 B). Recombinant MKP-2 exhibited low dose-dependent activity toward p-NPP, whereas MKP-2 C280S had no effect (Fig.1 B). The addition of ERK1 increased the catalytic activity of MKP-2 dramatically in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, JNK1 also substantially enhanced the activity of MKP-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C), but compared with ERK1, it was a less effective stimulator of MKP-2. A plateau for MKP-2 activation by JNK1 was not achieved within the amount of JNK1 used. p38 only had a small effect on MKP-2 catalytic activity. The maximum activation of 3 µg of GST-MKP-2 achieved by p38 was less than 4-fold, and an activation plateau was reached with a relatively small amount of p38 (Fig. 1 C). Because GST can form homodimers (38Walker J. Crowley P. Moreman A.D. Barrett J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), interaction between the GST moieties of MKP-2 and MAP kinase fusion proteins may potentially complicate the interpretation of the p-NPP hydrolysis assays. To exclude such a possibility, we examined the effects of GST, GST-ERK2, and His6-ERK2 on the catalytic activity of MKP-2 (Fig. 1 D). Both His6-ERK2 and GST-ERK2 stimulated the catalytic activity of MKP-2 dramatically, whereas GST had no effect. These results indicate that the stimulatory effects of the different MAP kinase fusion proteins on MKP-2 were truly the result of an interaction between the MAP kinase and the phosphatase moieties. To examine the ability of MKP-2 to bind to various MAP kinases, a GST pull-down assay was performed. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct for FLAG-tagged MKP-2 (pSRα-FLAG-MKP-2) and harvested 48 h after transfection. The lysate was incubated with immobilized GST-ERK1, GST-JNK1, GST-p38, or GST. An anti-FLAG antibody was used to detect the pulled-down FLAG-MKP-2 (Fig.2 A). Whereas MKP-2 was not brought down by GST, it was effectively pulled down by both GST-ERK1 and GST-p38, indicating that MKP-2 interacts specifically with both ERK1 and p38. Surprisingly, very little FLAG-MKP-2 was brought down by GST-JNK1 protein (Fig. 2 A). To test whether this was caused by potential misfolding of the GST-JNK1 protein used in this assay, we performed GST pull-down assays with FLAG-tagged MKP-1 (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As was reported previously (27Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 39Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2 B, MKP-1 was effectively pulled down by GST-ERK1, GST-p38, and GST-JNK1. This result, together with the fact that GST-JNK1 triggered a substantial catalytic activation of MKP-2 (Fig. 1 C), argues that GST-JNK1 was properly folded and suggests that the affinity between JNK1 and MKP-2 is weak. It has been proposed that the interaction between a MAP kinase phosphatase and a MAP kinase is mediated through a basic motif of the phosphatase and an acidic motif of the kinase (21Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Because MKP-2 has a basic motif in its NH2 terminus which consists of three arginine residues (Arg-74, Arg-75, and Arg-76), we tested whether this basic motif of MKP-2 is important for its interaction with different MAP kinases. A series of mutations in the MKP-2 basic motif was generated which either changed a single arginine residue or changed all three arginine residues to alanine(s). The mutant proteins were expressed to comparable levels in HeLa cells as FLAG-tagged proteins (Fig.3 A, top panel). The effects of these mutations on the binding of MKP-2 to various MAP kinases were analyzed by GST pull-down assays. Similar to what was observed in Fig. 2, wild type MKP-2 was brought down effectively by ERK1 (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). Compared with wild type MKP-2, significantly less MKP-2 R74A mutant protein was pulled down by ERK1, indicating that such a mutation reduces the interaction between MKP-2 and ERK1 considerably. Moreover, mutation of either Arg-75 or Arg-76 alone almost completely eliminated the interaction between MKP-2 and ERK1, suggesting more prominent roles for these two residues in mediating the interaction with this kinase. When all three arginines were changed to alanines, the interaction between ERK1 and MKP-2 was virtually abolished (Fig. 3 A,middle panel). Likewise, mutation of Arg-74, Arg-75, or Arg-76 alone, or all three residues together, almost completely eliminated the interaction between MKP-2 and p38 (Fig.3 A, bottom panel). The lack of difference among these mutant MKP-2 proteins in their abilities to bind to p38 is likely due to the weaker affinity of MKP-2 for p38 than for ERK1 (Fig.2 A). To verify that the basic motif of MKP-2 mediates its interaction with endogenous ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases, wild type and mutant MKP-2 proteins were expressed in 293T cells as GST fusion proteins. These GST fusion proteins were enriched through glutathione-Sepharose beads (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed by immunoblotting for co-purification of various endogenous MAP kinases (Fig. 3 B). Although Coomassie staining of the enriched proteins indicated that similar amounts of wild type and mutant MKP-2 proteins were expressed and purified, only wild type MKP-2 brought down endogenous ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases (Fig. 3 B, middle and bottom panel). Consistent with the notion that the affinity of MKP-2 for JNK1 was lower than that for either ERK or p38, the amount of JNK1 co-precipitated with GST-MKP-2 was barely detectable (data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the basic motif in the NH2-terminal domain of MKP-2 is responsible for its interaction with ERK1/2 and p38. The role of the basic motif in its catalytic activation by ERK1 was examined through p-NPP hydrolysis assays. Wild type and mutant proteins were produced as GST fusion proteins and purified under stringent conditions. The basal phosphatase activities of the single-residue substitution mutants of MKP-2 (R74A, R75A, or R76A) did not differ significantly from that of the wild type protein (Fig.4 A), although the MKP-2 R74A/R75A/R76A mutant consistently displayed a slight increase (about 2-fold) in basal phosphatase activity (Fig. 4 A). Wild type MKP-2 underwent a very steep catalytic activation by ERK1, reaching a maximum level of about 25-fold above its basal activity (Fig.4 B). Similarly, upon incubation with ERK1, the R74A mutant also underwent substantial activation, although the magnitude of the increase"

However, no obvious orthologs of the bacterial and eucaryal Class I and II FBP aldolases have yet been identified in sequenced archaeal genomes. Based on a recently described novel type of bacterial aldolase, we report on the identification and molecular characterization of the first archaeal FBP aldolases. We have analyzed the FBP aldolases of two hyperthermophilic Archaea, the facultatively heterotrophic CrenarchaeonThermoproteus tenax and the obligately heterotrophic Euryarchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. For enzymatic studies thefba genes of T. tenax and P. furiosus were expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant FBP aldolases show preferred substrate specificity for FBP in the catabolic direction and exhibit metal-independent Class I FBP aldolase activity via a Schiff-base mechanism. Transcript analyses reveal that the expression of both archaeal genes is induced during sugar fermentation. Remarkably, the fbp gene of T. tenax is co-transcribed with the pfp gene that codes for the reversible PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase. As revealed by phylogenetic analyses, orthologs of the T. tenax and P. furiosus enzyme appear to be present in almost all sequenced archaeal genomes, as well as in some bacterial genomes, strongly suggesting that this new enzyme family represents the typical archaeal FBP aldolase. Because this new family shows no significant sequence similarity to classical Class I and II enzymes, a new name is proposed, archaeal type Class I FBP aldolases (FBP aldolase Class IA)."
https://openalex.org/W2020258553,"After stimulation with agonist, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate G proteins and become phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and most of them translocate cytosolic arrestin proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane. Agonist-activated GPCRs are specifically phosphorylated by GRKs and are targeted for endocytosis by arrestin proteins, suggesting a connection between GPCR conformational changes and interaction with GRKs and arrestins. Previously, we showed that by substitution of histidine for residues at the cytoplasmic side of helix 3 (H3) and helix 6 (H6) of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor (PTHR), a zinc metal ion-binding site is engineered that prevents PTH-stimulated Gs activation (Sheikh, S. P., Vilardaga, J.-P., Baranski, T. J., Lichtarge, O., Iiri, T., Meng, E. C., Nissenson, R. A., and Bourne, H. R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17033–17041). These data suggest that relative movements between H3 and H6 are critical for Gs activation. Does this molecular event play a similar role in activation of GRK and arrestin and in PTHR-mediated Gq activation? To answer this question, we utilized the two previously described mutant forms of PTHR, H401 and H402, which contain a naturally present histidine residue at position 301 in H3 and a second substituted histidine residue at positions 401 and 402 in H6, respectively. Both mutant receptors showed inhibition of PTH-stimulated inositol phosphate and cAMP generation in the presence of increasing concentrations of Zn(II). However, the mutants showed no Zn(II)-dependent impairment of phosphorylation by GRK-2. Likewise, the mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type PTHR in the ability to translocate β-arrestins/green fluorescent protein to the cell membrane and were also not affected by sensitivity to Zn(II). These results suggest that agonist-mediated phosphorylation and internalization of PTHR require conformational switches of the receptor distinct from the cAMP and inositol phosphate signaling state. Furthermore, PTHR sequestration does not appear to require G protein activation.

Farvel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This event promotes activation of effector enzymes and ion channels by the activated Gα·GTP as well as the Gβγ complex (3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Signaling by most agonist-activated GPCRs is regulated by a two-step process (also referred to as the rapid form of GPCR desensitization) in which the activated receptors become a target for phosphorylation by GRKs and then interact with cytosolic arrestin proteins (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Binding of arrestin to the agonist-activated receptor has at least two consequences: uncoupling of receptors from G proteins, resulting in termination of agonist-mediated signaling, and facilitation of receptor internalization (5Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 6Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). A common feature of G proteins, GRKs, and arrestins is their specific binding of and activation by agonist-occupied receptors. This suggests a link between the receptor conformational changes and the binding of these proteins by the receptor. Is the receptor conformational switch the same for activation of G proteins, GRKs, and arrestins? Studies based on constitutively active α2- and β2-adrenergic receptors (7Ren Q. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16483-16487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M.J. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have shown that these receptors are also constitutively phosphorylated and desensitized. This supports the model that the active state of the receptor is identical to the conformation required for phosphorylation and internalization. In other words, agonist binding to GPCR induces an intramolecular rearrangement of the receptor domains (transmembrane helices and intracellular loops), resulting in a generalized receptor conformation able to promote activation of G proteins, phosphorylation by GRKs, and binding of arrestins. In contrast, two recent studies (9Thomas W.G. Qian H. Chang C.-S. Karnick S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2893-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barack L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) demonstrated that constitutively active angiotensin type 1 and α1B-adrenergic receptors resulting in agonist-independent signaling did not show an increase in basal phosphorylation. Thus, constitutively active receptors may have contrary effects on coupling to G proteins and GRKs. These studies leave open the question concerning the existence of one or multiple states of the activated receptor to promote activation of G proteins and to bind regulatory proteins. Recently, nitroxide spin-spin interaction experiments demonstrated that the molecular nature of the conformational change in rhodopsin associated with light-induced transducin (Gt) activation is linked to a relative movement and rotation of the cytoplasmic part of helix 3 away from the cytoplasmic part of helix 6 (11Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbel W.L. Khorona H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). In support of this model, it was demonstrated that by engineering an interhelical zinc ion bridge to constrain the movements between helices 3 and 6 in rhodopsin, Gt activation is inhibited (12Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Using a similar zinc ion site engineering strategy, we have shown the importance of the relative movement between helices 3 and 6 for Gs activation in the β2-adrenergic receptor and the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR) (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies indicate that the relative motion between helices 3 and 6 is a common switch mechanism in GPCRs of class I (rhodopsin-like) and class II (PTHR-like) to activate G proteins. A central question remains of whether the agonist-induced movement of helices 3 and 6 also acts as a molecular switch to control activation of different G protein subtypes coupled to the same receptor and of other agonist-activated GPCR regulatory proteins such as GRKs and arrestins. After stimulation by PTH, PTHR assumes an active state that activates Gs and Gq proteins to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, respectively (14Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced activation of PTHR results in its phosphorylation by GRK-2 (15Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 1846-1856Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in the rapid internalization of the PTH-receptor complex via an arrestin-dependent pathway (17Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Is the same Gsprotein-receptor active state required for PTH-stimulated activation of Gq, GRK, and arrestin? To test this hypothesis, we employed two mutants of PTHR that we have previously described, H401 and H402 (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These mutants carry a naturally present His residue at position 301 in helix 3 (near the junction of the second intracellular loop) and a His residue substituted for Leu401 (mutant receptor H401) or Lys402 (mutant receptor H402) in helix 6 (near the junction of the third intracellular loop). We demonstrated previously that in the presence of Zn(II), receptors H401 and H402 were able to form an artificial Zn(II) bridge between helices 3 and 6 of the receptor that inhibits PTH-mediated activation of Gs (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our present data indicate that the conformational change leading to relative movement of helices 3 and 6 is also required for Gq activation, but is not involved in the activation process of the regulatory proteins GRK-2 and arrestin. This implies that there are different conformational requirements for G protein activation and for coupling to GRKs and arrestins and that free movement of helices 3 and 6 is specifically necessary for G protein activation. Taking advantage of the fact that in the presence of Zn(II), H401 and H402 signaling is blocked, we have directly examined the role of G protein activation in PTHR internalization. PTH-(1–34) was obtained from Bachem, and ZnCl2 was from Sigma. The generation of PTHR mutants H401 and H402 has been described previously (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin-1 was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) as described (18Groarke D.A. Wilson S. Krasel C. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23263-23269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cDNA for β-arrestin-2 was a generous gift from Dr. S. Cotecchia (Institut de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie, Université de Lausanne). The stop codon of this cDNA was replaced with an XbaI restriction site and fused to the cDNA of GFP (pGreenLantern I, Life Technologies, Inc.). Radiolabeled PTH-(1–34) (2200 Ci/mmol) was kindly provided by Dr. Eberhard Blind (Department of Endocrinology, University of Würzburg). The anti-β-arrestin antibody has been described previously (19Söhlemann P. Hekman M. Puzicka M. Buchen C. Lohse M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). During this study, it was shown that this antibody recognizes β-arrestin-1 only, but not β-arrestin-2. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) served as the expression system for the wild-type and mutant receptors. Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere with 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfections were performed using a protocol based on the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). For confocal scanning microscopy, HEK-293 cells were used; cells were grown on coverslips previously coated with poly-l-lysine and transfected by the phosphate precipitation method (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1997Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml Pefabloc), and homogenized. After centrifugation for 20 min at 40,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A with 20% sucrose and layered onto 40% sucrose in buffer A. After centrifugation at 125,000 ×g for 1 h, the 20/40% interface was recovered, diluted 1 + 1 with buffer A, and centrifuged for 15 min at 125,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 5 m urea, incubated for 10 min at 20 °C, and centrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 15 min. After two washing steps in buffer A, the final pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and stored at −80 °C. GRK-2 was purified from Sf9 insect cells as described previously (21Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dodecyl maltoside at 4 °C. GRK-2-specific activity (0.98 ± 0.30 mol of Pi/min/mol of kinase) was determined with rhodopsin as the substrate and 10 nm kinase, 2.4 μm rhodopsin, and 100 μm ATP. In the following assays (e.g. phosphorylation, ligand binding, cAMP, inositol phosphate, internalization, and arrestin translocation), to allow zinc ion to form a complex with the H401 or H402 receptor, intact cells or membrane preparations containing receptors were preincubated with or without different concentrations of ZnCl2 in the indicated buffer for 10–15 min before the start of the assay. Receptor-containing cell membranes (10 μg of total proteins) were incubated with purified GRK-2 (100 nm) in 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, and 8 mm MgCl2 containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1–2 cpm/fmol) and the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2 in a final volume of 25 μl. PTH-(1–34) (10–1000 nm) was added as indicated, and the incubations were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer, followed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 32P-Labeled proteins were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h in six-well dishes. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 ml of DHB buffer (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm Hepes and 1% bovine serum albumin), the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with 1 ml of DHB buffer containing125I-PTH-(1–34) (100,000 cpm) and the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2. Incubations were stopped by placing the cells on ice and rapidly washing them with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated for 2 × 5 min in 0.5 ml of acid wash solution (150 mm glycine and 50 mm acetic acid, pH 3) to remove the surface-bound radioligand. The supernatants containing the acid-released radioactivity were collected, and the cells were treated with 1 ml of 0.8 n NaOH to solubilize the acid-resistant radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was measured in parallel experiments using 10−6m PTH-(1–34). Radioactivity was quantified in a γ-counter. The percent internalization was calculated after deduction of the respective nonspecific value: % internalization = ((cpm acid-resistant)/(cpm acid-resistant + cpm acid-released)) × 100. The data were fitted to single-phase exponential curves. The endocytic rate constant (ke) was determined from the slope of the line obtained by plotting the amount of internalized radioligand against the integral of the surface-bound radioligand (22Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding, cAMP, and inositol phosphate assays were carried out following previously published procedures (15Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 1846-1856Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, for binding studies in intact cells, transfected cells were incubated in DHB buffer for 2 h at 0 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation with the same buffer containing125I-PTH-(1–34) (100,000 cpm) with or without unlabeled PTH-(1–34). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 0.8 n NaOH, and cell-associated 125I-PTH-(1–34) was counted. Competition curves were fitted to a one-site competitive binding curve.125I-PTH-(1–34) binding experiments with membranes (50 μg) were done in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg of bacitracin. After incubation for 90 min at 22 °C in the absence or presence of GTPγS and/or ZnCl2, bound radioactivity was separated from free radioactivity by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer and counted. Nonspecific binding was defined using 1 μmPTH-(1–34). For inositol phosphate assays, transfected cells in six-well plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without inositol. After labeling, cells were washed twice with Hepes buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) and incubated in 900 μl/well of the same buffer with 10 mm LiCl for 10 min. Total inositol phosphate accumulation was measured after 1 h of stimulation at 37 °C by 1 μm PTH-(1–34) with or without the indicated concentrations of ZnCl2. Extraction and determination of total inositol phosphates were done as described (15Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate responses were expressed as percent of the control response at 10−6m PTH-(1–34) after subtracting the respective basal levels present in unstimulated cells. For cAMP assays, cells were washed twice with Hepes buffer and incubated with isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mm) in the same buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm PTH-(1–34) in the absence or presence of different concentrations of ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 10 min. Cellular cAMP was extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay (Immunotech). β-Arrestin translocation was monitored by two assays: confocal scanning microscopy visualization in intact cells and immunoblot analysis. HEK-293 cells cotransfected with β-arrestin-2 fused to GFP and PTHR cDNAs were incubated with 100 nm PTH-(1–34) for different times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were observed under an oil immersion objective (×40) using a Leica TCS confocal laser microscope. Representative optical sections corresponding to the middle of the cells are presented. For immunodetection, solubilized membrane proteins and soluble protein fractions of transfected cells coexpressing PTHR and β-arrestin-1/GFP were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were reacted with anti-β-arrestin-1 antibody (1:3000), and immunoreactive bands were visualized by anti-rabbit Ig (1:20000) coupled to peroxidase and chemiluminescence (Pierce). Concentration-response, competition, and internalization kinetics curves were analyzed by computer-assisted nonlinear regression (GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). If not otherwise indicated, all experiments were replicated at least three times in independent experiments, and the results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Competition of PTH for 125I-PTH binding on intact cells gave similar Ki values for wild-type and mutant receptors (Fig. 1,A and B): PTHR, Ki = 4.5 ± 0.4 nm (n = 10); H401,Ki = 9.5 ± 1.0 nm(n = 4; data not shown); and H402,Ki = 10.1 ± 0.9 nm(n = 4). In the presence of Zn(II) (100 μm), a small increase in PTH binding affinity was observed for H401 (Ki = 5.3 ± 0.6 nm, n = 4) and H402 (Ki = 7.1 ± 0.9 nm, n = 4). The absence of a decrease in PTH binding affinity suggests that Zn(II) did not affect G protein coupling to the receptors. On cell membrane preparations, the presence of 20 μm GTPγS reduced the125I-PTH-specific binding by ≈42% for PTHR and by ≈40% for H402 (Fig. 1 C). 100 μm Zn(II) failed to reduce the specific tracer binding on both receptors, and addition of GTPγS caused a similar decrease in tracer binding of both receptors (experiments not done for H401). The failure of Zn(II) to reproduce the effect of GTPγS on tracer binding confirms that Zn(II) did not affect the G protein coupling to both receptors. Fig.1 D summarizes PTH-induced PTHR and H402 signaling on intact cells (cAMP and inositol phosphate turnover) and phosphorylation by GRK-2 in membrane preparations. The concentrations required for 50% of the maximal effect were moderately but significantly increased for the H401 and H402 mutants: for cAMP, PTHR = 1.2 ± 0.4 nm (n = 7), H401 = 5.2 ± 0.8 nm (n = 3), and H402 = 8.6 ± 0.7 nm (n = 3); for inositol phosphate turnover, PTHR = 100 ± 9 nm (n = 5), H401 = 210 ± 12 nm (n = 3), and H402 = 225 ± 35 nm (n = 3); and for phosphorylation, PTHR = 9.1 ± 0.8 nm(n = 5) and H402 = 7.5 ± 1.5 nm(n = 3) (experiments not done for H401). To assess activation of Gq by wild-type and mutant PTHRs, we measured PTH-mediated inositol phosphate (IP) turnover in intact cells. Wild-type PTHR and mutants H401 and H402 did not show increased basal IP signaling activity in the presence of 1–1000 μmZn(II). As shown in Fig. 2 A, a high concentration of Zn(II) inhibited the ability of activated wild-type PTHR to stimulate IP synthesis (IC50 = 78.5 ± 5.5 μm, n = 5). The sensitivity of PTH-stimulated IP synthesis to Zn(II) was significantly increased in cells expressing H401 (IC50 = 14.9 ± 1.8 μm, n = 4) or H402 (IC50 = 3.3 ± 0.5 μm, n = 3). In our previous study (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), similar curve shifts were observed for PTH-stimulated GTPγS binding to Gαs in membrane preparations (Fig. 2 B). Altogether, these data indicate that zinc ion occupancy of the engineered site within H401 and H402 blocks Gs activation as well as the Gq-mediated IP signal in response to PTH. A relative movement of the two helices is the conformational change that best accounts for the inhibitory effect of Zn(II) on H401 and H402 signaling. Thus, a relative movement between helices 3 and 6 in PTHR is required for activation of Gq-mediated IP synthesis. The occurrence of a nonspecific increase in basal cAMP in cells or of basal activity of adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations and inhibition (≈40%) of forskolin-mediated adenylyl cyclase stimulation by ZnCl2 (10–1000 μm) made it difficult to quantify the effect of Zn(II) on the PTH-mediated cAMP response of wild-type and mutant receptors (data not shown). Despite these impediments, Fig. 2 C highlights a differential effect of Zn(II) between PTHR and H402 on cAMP accumulation. Indeed, the Zn(II) capability to inhibit 1 μm PTH-stimulated cAMP synthesis was higher for H402 than for PTHR (IC50 = 256 ± 35versus 1300 ± 150 μm, n= 3). However, the Zn(II) effect on cAMP was smaller than on IP turnover (IC50 decrease of ≈24-fold for IPversus ≈5-fold for cAMP). In fact, Zn(II) sensitivity was more effective at 10 nm PTH-mediated cAMP synthesis (IC50 = 7.5 ± 1.2 μm (n= 2) for H402 versus IC50 = 193 ± 20 μm (n = 2) for PTHR). A possible explanation for such differences in the Zn(II) effect on PTH-mediated cAMP and IP turnover might be due to the more efficient coupling of PTHR to the adenylyl cyclase machinery (see “Discussion”). High doses of PTH (1 μm) were required for maximal stimulation of IP turnover, whereas ≈100-fold less PTH was necessary for maximal cAMP stimulation (Fig. 1, D andE). We previously demonstrated that PTHR is efficiently phosphorylated by GRK-2 both in cell membrane preparations and in intact cells (15Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 1846-1856Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GRK-2-mediated receptor phosphorylation was measured in cell membrane preparations containing wild-type or H402 mutant PTHR. Fig.3 shows that the H402 receptor was recognized by the kinase GRK-2, resulting in substantial PTH-dependent phosphorylation similar to that observed for wild-type PTHR. Wild-type and H402 receptors displayed a basal level of phosphorylation that was efficiently stimulated by PTH (≈3-fold increase over the basal level). The presence of ZnCl2(1–1000 μm) did not influence the basal level of receptor phosphorylation (data not shown). 10 μmPTH-mediated phosphorylation of both PTHR and the H402 receptor was not modified by 1–100 μm Zn(II) (Fig. 3 A). High concentrations of ZnCl2 (1 mm) have previously been shown to inhibit GRK-2 (23Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indeed inhibited by 50% the ability of GRK-2 to phosphorylate both receptors in response to PTH (Fig. 3 A). The presence of 100 μmZn(II) (a concentration that blocks activated H402-mediated cAMP and IP synthesis in intact cells (Fig. 2, A andC) as well as Gs activation in membrane preparations (13Sheikh S.P. Vilardaga J.-P. Baranski T.J. Lichtarge O. Iiri T. Meng E.C. Nissenson R.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17033-17041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) did not modify the capability of lower concentrations of GRK-2 to phosphorylate PTHR (data not shown) or H402 (Fig. 3 B). The above data indicate that Zn(II) complexed to the H402 receptor is able to form a conformation in response to PTH that results in GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation (but not activation) of Gs and Gq proteins. These data demonstrate that the signaling state of the receptor can be differentiated from the phosphorylatable state by blocking a motion between helices 3 and 6 of the receptor. Although agonist-induced phosphorylation of GPCRs is an important determinant for arrestin interaction with the receptors, we recently found that the GRK phosphorylation site in PTHR is not critical for β-arrestin interaction with the receptor. 2J.-P. Vilardaga, C. Krasel, S. Chauvin, T. Bambino, R. A. Nissenson, and M. J. Lohse, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the receptor conformational changes appear to be crucial for arrestin interaction. We next considered whether β-arrestin-mediated internalization of the receptor is dependent on the relative movement between helices 3 and 6. The ability of PTH to sti"
https://openalex.org/W1621649724,"NF-κB is a transcription factor whose nuclear residence is controlled by IκB family members. In the NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory loop, activated (nuclear) Rel A·NF-κB1 induces the resynthesis of IκBα recapturing nuclear Rel A back into the cytoplasm within 1 h of stimulation. In contrast, NF-κB1 subunits redistribute more slowly into the cytoplasm (from 6 to 12 h). Here we examine the role of inducible cytoplasmic BCL-3 expression in terminating nuclear NF-κB1. Although BCL-3 is a nuclear protein in B lymphocytes, surprisingly, BCL-3 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein in HepG2 cells. Cytoplasmic BCL-3 abundance is induced 6–12 h after tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation where it complexes with NF-κB1 homodimers. Moreover, BCL-3 mRNA and protein expression are induced by NF-κB-activating agents. Two observations are interpreted to indicate that bcl-3 is transactivated by NF-κB/Rel A: 1) expression of a dominant negative NF-κB inhibitor blocks tumor necrosis factor-α-induced BCL-3 expression and 2) expression of constitutively active Rel A is sufficient to induce BCL-3 expression. In gene transfer studies, we identify two high affinity NF-κB-binding sites, κB1 (located at −872 to −861 nucleotides) and κB2 (−106 to −96 nucleotides), and although both bind with high affinity to Rel A, only κB2 is required for NF-κB-dependent induction of the native BCL-3 promoter. Down-regulation of BCL-3 induction results in prolonged, enhanced NF-κB1 binding and increased NF-κB-dependent transcription. Together, these data suggest the presence of an NF-κB-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop important in terminating NF-κB1 action and that individual NF-κB isoforms are actively terminated through coordinate induction of inhibitory IκB molecules to restore cellular homeostasis. NF-κB is a transcription factor whose nuclear residence is controlled by IκB family members. In the NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory loop, activated (nuclear) Rel A·NF-κB1 induces the resynthesis of IκBα recapturing nuclear Rel A back into the cytoplasm within 1 h of stimulation. In contrast, NF-κB1 subunits redistribute more slowly into the cytoplasm (from 6 to 12 h). Here we examine the role of inducible cytoplasmic BCL-3 expression in terminating nuclear NF-κB1. Although BCL-3 is a nuclear protein in B lymphocytes, surprisingly, BCL-3 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein in HepG2 cells. Cytoplasmic BCL-3 abundance is induced 6–12 h after tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation where it complexes with NF-κB1 homodimers. Moreover, BCL-3 mRNA and protein expression are induced by NF-κB-activating agents. Two observations are interpreted to indicate that bcl-3 is transactivated by NF-κB/Rel A: 1) expression of a dominant negative NF-κB inhibitor blocks tumor necrosis factor-α-induced BCL-3 expression and 2) expression of constitutively active Rel A is sufficient to induce BCL-3 expression.

Down-regulation of BCL-3 induction results in prolonged, enhanced NF-κB1 binding and increased NF-κB-dependent transcription. Together, these data suggest the presence of an NF-κB-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop important in terminating NF-κB1 action and that individual NF-κB isoforms are actively terminated through coordinate induction of inhibitory IκB molecules to restore cellular homeostasis. tumor necrosis factor α interleukin phorbol 13-myristate 17-acetate IκB kinase nucleotide polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR enhanced green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline base pair bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride glutathione S-transferase immunoprecipitation-electrophoretic mobility shift assay wild type fluorescein isothiocyanate 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride acute phase response element Originally characterized as a nuclear transactivator of the immunoglobulin κ-light chain enhancer (the κB enhancer), NF-κB is now known to be a cytokine-inducible transcription factor controlling expression of genetic networks important in inflammation and cellular survival (1Beg A.A.

The prototypical NF-κB complex, composed of 50-kDa NF-κB1·65-kDa Rel A heterodimers, is regulated by its association with cytoplasmic IκB, a protein family whose members specifically inactivate Rel A by masking its the nuclear localization sequence and preventing it from entering the nucleus (see Refs. 5Han Y.

One mechanism for NF-κB activation, characteristic of the cytokines, TNFα1/IL-1α and phorbol ester PMA, is to induce the activity of a large 700–900-kDa multiprotein cytoplasmic IκB kinase (IKK, reviewed in Ref. 3Karin M.

IKK phosphorylates IκB on an NH2-regulatory domain that initiates its proteolysis through the proteasome (3Karin M. J. Biol.

After its nuclear translocation, NF-κB only transiently resides in the nuclear compartment. Current evidence suggests that termination of NF-κB is an active process, dependent on new protein synthesis, mediated in part through the NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9823-9830Google Scholar, 10Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar,11Klement J.F.

Newly synthesized IκBα captures Rel A and redistributes it back into the cytoplasm through an active CRM1-dependent export mechanism to restore cellular homeostasis (14Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown the presence of a robust NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory feedback loop in cytokine- and PMA-stimulated HepG2 cells (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9823-9830Google Scholar, 15Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One hour after NF-κB activation, cytoplasmic IκBα is resynthesized at levels 2-fold greater than that of control. The newly synthesized IκBα reassociates with Rel A and completely inactivates its binding by redistributing it back into the cytoplasm. The role of IκBα in terminating NF-κB action appears unique to IκBα, as IκBβ, for example, is important in prolonged NF-κB activation (16Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref Google Scholar).The NF-κB family is divided into two functionally distinct groups. The first group consists of members translated as mature proteins that contain potent COOH-terminal transcriptional activation domains, such as Rel A and c-Rel, and are targets for inactivation by the prototypical IκB-α, -β, and -ε (7Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 17Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The second group consists of members encoded by large precursor proteins that are proteolytically processed into smaller (∼50 kDa) DNA-binding subunits with weak transcriptional activation potential, such as p105/NF-κB1 and p110/NF-κB2. The proteolytically processed NF-κB groups are targets for inactivation by distinct IκB-like molecules, including p105 itself (20Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), the alternatively spliced p105 COOH terminus termed IκBγ (21Inoue J. Kerr L.D. Kakizuka A. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and BCL-3. BCL-3 is a putative proto-oncogene identified in a t(14;19) translocation in a subgroup of B cell lymphocytic leukemias where the IgHα promoter is translocated adjacent to the BCL-3-coding sequences (22Ohno H. Takimoto G. McKeithan T.W. Cell. 1990; 60: 991-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In B cells containing the t(14;19) translocation, BCL-3 is expressed at 3–4-fold higher levels. In B and T cells where it has been studied, BCL-3 is a nuclear protein that contains 7 repeats of the 33–37-amino acid sequence found in the cdc10/SWI 6/erythrocyte ankyrin (the ankyrin repeat) that binds to the Rel homology domain. Although its function is enigmatic, BCL-3 has been reported to inhibit NF-κB1 binding in vitro (23Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), disrupt NF-κB1 p105-p50 subunit interactions (24Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and function as a transcriptional activator by forming ternary complexes with DNA bound NF-κB2, allowing recruitment of coactivators and histone acetylases (25Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 26Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).In this work, we examine the role played by inducible BCL-3 synthesis as a means for terminating nuclear NF-κB1 residence. Despite a robust NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory loop that transiently inactivates NF-κB1·Rel A binding 1 h after stimulation (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9823-9830Google Scholar, 15Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), NF-κB redistributes back into the nucleus, where it declines over the ensuing 6–12 h. These data suggest that the NF-κB-IκBα autoregulatory loop is not the only mechanism controlling NF-κB abundance. We surprisingly find the inducible expression of cytoplasmic BCL-3 with similar kinetics to the disappearance of nuclear NF-κB1. By using immunoprecipitation-EMSA, BCL-3 associates primarily with NF-κB1 homodimers, whereas IκBα associates with Rel A and c-Rel subunits. We further show that BCL-3 expression is activated by TNFα/IL-1α/and PMA in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Promoter analysis of BCL-3 identified two high affinity NF-κB-binding sites, κB1 located at −872 to −861 nt and κB2 site located −106 to −96 nt. Both BCL-3 κB1 and κB2 bind with high affinity to Rel A and are targets for Rel A-mediated transactivation, yet only κB2 is required for NF-κB-dependent induction of the nativeBCL-3 promoter. Down-regulation of BCL-3 induction results in prolonged, enhanced NF-κB1 binding and increased NF-κB-dependent transcription. Together, these data indicate the existence of an NF-κB-BCL-3 feedback loop that functions in parallel with the NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory loop in terminating nuclear NF-κB action.DISCUSSIONActivated by a diverse spectrum of stimuli, the NF-κB family of proteins plays an important role in activating genetic networks controlling cell survival and inducible gene expression (2Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar, 4Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for NF-κB activation by the prototypical inflammatory cytokines and phorbol esters is through inducible IKK activity. The IKK is a signal integrator responsible for phosphorylation and inactivation of IκB, a rate-limiting step in NF-κB activation (3Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB translocation initiates protective inflammatory and acute phase responses, uncontrolled NF-κB activity is apparently deleterious, and a number of mechanisms have been identified that serve to terminate its activity. Understanding these pathways identifies targets that can be modified to control NF-κB activity in disease.In this paper we focus on inducible expression of bcl-3, a putative proto-oncogene implicated in a subset of B cell lymphocytic leukemias (22Ohno H. Takimoto G. McKeithan T.W. Cell. 1990; 60: 991-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). BCL-3 is a multifunctional protein with a central ankyrin repeat-containing domain highly homologous to members of the IκB family. In a variety of studies, BCL-3 has been reported to be a nuclear protein that associates with the precursor and processed NF-κB subunits, p105/p50 NF-κB1 and p110/p50B NF-κB2 (24Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U.

Although recombinant BCL-3 associates and inhibits NF-κB1 binding in vitro (23Wulczyn F.G. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. Nature. 1992; 358: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the function of BCL-3 is extensively modified by phosphorylation (36Bundy D.L. McKeithan T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33132-33139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Nolan G.P. Fujita T. Bhatia K. Huppi C. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In its native state, BCL-3 physically interacts with NF-κB1 (33Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and NF-κB2 in the nucleus (25Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), where it potentiates transcription through ternary complex formation with nuclear coactivators (Jab1, Pirin, Bard1) and/or histone acetylases such as Tip60 (26Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although unstimulated HepG2 cells express nuclear BCL-3 in unstimulated condition, surprisingly, after cytokine stimulation, BCL-3 accumulates in the cytoplasm where it plays a role in terminating NF-κB activity. We suggest the existence of an NF-κB-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop based on the following observations: 1) inducible BCL-3 accumulates in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells; 2) cytoplasmic BCL-3 specifically associates with NF-κB1 isoforms; 3) inducible BCL-3 expression is activated by TNFα/IL-1α and PMA in an NF-κB-dependent manner; and 4) down-regulation of BCL-3 expression results in prolonged, enhanced NF-κB binding and increased NF-κB-dependent transcription. Schematically diagrammed in Fig. 9, the NF-κB-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop functions in parallel to NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory loop and down-regulates the nuclear action of NF-κB1 isoforms with distinctly slower kinetics.Mechanisms for Termination of Cytokine SignalingThe pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα/IL-1α have potent effects on cellular survival, differentiation, and target gene expression. The NF-κB-IκB autoregulatory feedback loop is just one of several mechanisms to limit the duration of cytokine signaling in target cells. Other mechanisms are likely to play a role, including signal termination and upstream kinase inactivation. An example of signal termination has been identified for TNFα-induced signaling. TNFα binds to a specific 55-kDa type I transmembrane receptor that initiates intracellular signaling through a “protein recruitment” model (44Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Lacking intrinsic kinase activity, TNFR1 activates intracellular signals through receptor oligomerization, recruiting adapter proteins, such as TRADD and TRAF2/RIP, to bind the cytoplasmic receptor tail through protein-protein interactions mediated by the “death domain” motif (see Refs. 45Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar and 46Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar and references therein). Concurrently, the NF-κB-inducing kinase, MEKK1, and the IKK kinase component, IKKγ/NEMO (46Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), also appear to be recruited into the activated TNFR1 complex, ultimately control activation of the IKK signalsome, the kinase complex directly responsible for IκBα phosphorylation and marking it for proteolysis. Recently it has been shown that the highly IL-1- and TNF-inducible zinc finger protein, A20, bind to RIP and inactivate its association with NEMO and TRAF2, disrupting the TNFR1 signaling complex (46Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 47Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Like the NF-κB-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop, this signal termination pathway involves active resynthesis of an inhibitory protein. In upstream kinase inactivation, the protein kinase responsible for IκBα phosphorylation, IKKβ, is rapidly activated 2–30 min after cytokine stimulation by MEKK1/NF-κB-inducing kinase-dependent serine phosphorylation on on its “activation” loop (48Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). IKKβ is then inactivated through self-phosphorylation of a polyserine cluster in its COOH terminus (48Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Together, the signal termination and kinase inactivation mechanisms ensure transient generation of intracellular signaling, but these mechanisms do not allow for termination of previously translocated NF-κB acting in the nuclear compartment.Inducible IκBα Synthesis Controls Nuclear Rel A ActionsIn the NF-κB-IκBα feedback loop, NF-κB liberated from IκB inhibitor as a consequence of its proteolysis enters the nucleus and stimulates transcription of target genes, including IκBα itself. Newly synthesized IκBα then captures NF-κB, directing it back into the cytoplasm. The importance of the NF-κB-IκBα feedback loop was demonstrated by prolonged NF-κB activation after cytokine stimulation iniκbα−/−-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (11Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt H. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although constitutive levels of nuclear Rel A was not different in knockouts versus control fibroblasts (indicating other IκB proteins can compensate for IκBα deficiency), theiκbα−/−-deficient cells maintained high levels of Rel A DNA binding for up to 2 h after stimulation, a time when Rel A binding was undetectable in controls (11Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt H. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of the NF-κB-IκBα feedback loop is influenced by cell type-dependent influences. For example, IκBα resynthesis mediates NF-κB termination 2–8 h after stimulation in Jurkat lymphocytes (38Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and A549 airway epithelial cells (28Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and it inhibits Rel A binding within 30 min in fibroblasts (11Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt H. Chen C.-H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells (5Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9823-9830Google Scholar, 15Han Y. Meng T. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our studies in HepG2 cells have shown that the NF-κB-IκBα feedback loop is responsible only for transient termination of NF-κB binding. After a transient overshoot of resynthesis, IκBα returns to control levels, and Rel A redistributes back into the nucleus. We speculate that IκBα reaccumulates to control values even in the continued presence of TNFα/IL-1α because of the transient nature of the cytokine stimulation and rapid inactivation of IKKβ activity. In HepG2 cells, BCL-3 appears to play an important role in terminating nuclear NF-κB1 activity. The contribution of the NF-κB-BCL-3 feedback in other cell types, if any, has not been systematically investigated.Inducible BCL-3 Expression by TNFα Is NF-κB-dependentBCL-3 expression is mitogen-inducible mediated by PMA/phytohemagglutinin stimulation in B cells (22Ohno H.

In this report, we identify and characterize two high affinity NF-κB-binding sites termed BCL3 κB1 and κB2, located −872 to −861 nt and −106 to −96 nt, respectively. We note that the sequence and spacing (relative to the transcription start sites) of κB2 are exactly conserved in both the human and in the murine promoters (the murine promoter has a second κB-like site 5′-GGATTTGGGG-3′ 800 nt upstream of κB2) probably indicating the NF-κB dependence of BCL-3 expression will be seen in rodents as well. Although the upstream κB1 site in the human promoter does not detectably contribute to BCL-3 activation, it nevertheless binds Rel A with high affinity and has latent Rel A enhancer activity. Its lack of apparent contribution may be due to relative distance constraints of NF-κB action. Finally, in side by side comparisons, IκBα gene is more strongly inducible than is BCL-3 (Fig. 7). In contrast to the BCL-3 promoter, IκBα contains at least three independent κB motifs that mediate its highly inducible expression (13Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Our analysis of NF-κB isoforms associated with BCL-3 confirms these studies as cytoplasmic BCL-3 is primarily complexed with NF-κB1 in IP-EMSA (Fig.4). Although a small amount of the NF-κB1-Rel A heterodimer binding can be detected, this is clearly a distinct pattern from the complexes associated with IκBα. We think that Rel A binding detected in this assay is an indirect effect, mediated through its association with BCL-3-complexed NF-κB1. Finally, we speculate that BCL-3 may also play a role in NF-κB2 termination, but the low level of NF-κB2 expression in hepatocytes does not allow us to examine this prediction directly (5Han Y.

During apoptosis, cytochromec and dATP can relieve the inhibitory action of the WD-40 repeats and thus enable the oligomerization of Apaf-1 and the subsequent recruitment and activation of procaspase-9. Here, we report that different apoptotic stimuli induced the caspase-mediated cleavage of Apaf-1 into an 84-kDa fragment. The same Apaf-1 fragment was obtained in vitro by incubation of cell lysates with either cytochrome c/dATP or caspase-3 but not with caspase-6 or caspase-8. Apaf-1 was cleaved at the N terminus, leading to the removal of its CARD H1 helix. An additional cleavage site was located within the WD-40 repeats and enabled the oligomerization of p84 into a ∼440-kDa Apaf-1 multimer even in the absence of cytochromec. Due to the partial loss of its CARD, the p84 multimer was devoid of caspase-9 or other caspase activity. Thus, our data indicate that Apaf-1 cleavage causes the release of caspases from the apoptosome in the course of apoptosis.

In death receptor-mediated apoptosis, the adapter protein FADD plays a central role in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, in which FADD recruits procaspase-8 to the active trimeric death receptor. Procaspase-8 is then autocatalytically activated and in turn cleaves and activates the downstream cascade of effector caspases (1Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Likewise, the adapter protein Apaf-11 constitutes the central element in the intrinsic pathway that can be triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion (5Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J.

Conversely, antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, A1, and Mcl-1 block the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases and apoptosis (9Yang J.

In the cytosol, cytochrome ctogether with dATP binds to the mammalian CED-4 homologue Apaf-1, which subsequently recruits and activates procaspase-9 via a mutual interaction of their caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) (6Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 in turn activates downstream effector caspases. Thus, caspase-9 constitutes the central initiator caspase for the mitochondrial pathway as caspase-8 represents it for the death receptor pathway. In analogy, the adapter protein Apaf-1 plays a similar role for the activation of the mitochondrial pathway as FADD does it in the death receptor pathway. In addition, there is some evidence that pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may interfere with mechanisms other than the release of cytochrome c (15Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 16Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue Egl-1 antagonizes CED-9, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein that is directly bound to and inhibits the Apaf-1 homologue CED-4 (17Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 15: 419-529Google Scholar). Although in mammalian cells most Bcl-2 proteins do not directly bind to Apaf-1 (18Hausmann G. O'Reilly L.A. van Driel R. Beaumont J.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Huang D.C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), other CED-4 related proteins might exist, which in analogy to C. elegans do not require cytochrome c but are directly modulated by Bcl-2 members.Apaf-1 consists of three different domains: (i) the N-terminal protein interaction domain CARD, which can bind via a homophilic interaction to the CARD of procaspase-9; (ii) a nucleotide-binding domain that shares homology with the C. elegans homologue CED-4; and (iii) a C-terminal regulatory domain containing multiple repeats of tryptophan and aspartate residues, also known as WD-40 repeats (19Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). Recent studies support a model in which the WD-40 repeats mask the CED-4 homology region and CARD of Apaf-1 and thereby obstruct the binding of Apaf-1 to procaspase-9. It is thought that, following its release from mitochondria, binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1 removes the WD-40 repeat region, which together with dATP enables Apaf-1 oligomerization via a mutual interaction of the CED-4-like regions. Oligomerized Apaf-1 in turn is able to recruit procaspase-9 via a homophilic CARD/CARD interaction (20Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The model of induced proximity has been proposed to explain how the first proteolytic signal is produced after clustering of the inactive caspase-9 precursor. According to this model, multimolecular aggregation of Apaf-1 enforces a locally high concentration of procaspase-9. The close proximity of the caspase precursors then allows the immature proteases to self-activate due to their low intrinsic enzymatic activity (27Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that Apaf-1 might act as an allosteric activator for caspase-9 (28Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Therefore, caspase-9 remains associated with Apaf-1 in a high molecular weight complex of ∼700 kDa, called apoptosome, that might also contain executioner caspase-3 and -7 (24Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).In the present study, we report that Apaf-1, which constitutes a crucial element in the mitochondrial pathway, is itself a target of partial proteolysis during apoptosis. Stimulation of the mitochondrial pathway as well as CD95 triggering induced the caspase-3-mediated processing of the full-length form of Apaf-1 into an 84-kDa fragment. The caspase-mediated processing of Apaf-1 removed the N-terminal helix H1 within the CARD as well as part of the C-terminal WD-40 repeats. Cleavage at both sites was associated with two functional alterations. Most likely due to the partial loss of the inhibitory WD-40 repeats, Apaf-1 p84 could oligomerize into a ∼440-kDa complex in the absence of cytochrome c and dATP. Interestingly, the p84 multimer contained neither full-length Apaf-1, caspase-9, nor any caspase activity. The lack of caspase activity was presumably caused by the partial removal of the CARD that is required for binding to procaspase-9. Thus, the proteolytic processing of Apaf-1 during apoptosis apparently initiates the release of caspases from the apoptosome and may play a functional role for the intracellular propagation of the death signal.DISCUSSIONThe adapter protein Apaf-1 forms a central element in the mitochondrial death machinery and is responsible for the recruitment and activation of initiator caspase-9. Caspase-9 in turn activates executioner caspase-3 and -7, thus instigating the caspase cascade that after cleavage of several vital proteins finally leads to cell death (41Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that Apaf-1 itself is a target of caspases that is proteolytically processed from its 130-kDa full-length form into an 84-kDa fragment. In cells, Apaf-1 cleavage was observed after stimulation of the CD95 death receptor pathway as well as of the mitochondrial pathway by anticancer drugs and staurosporine.Activation of the mitochondrial pathway by staurosporine induced the sequential proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and subsequently Apaf-1. Apaf-1 was also cleaved in vitro, when the mitochondrial pathway was triggered directly by the addition of cytochrome c and dATP. The proteolytic processing of Apaf-1 in the mitochondrial pathway was dependent on caspase-9, since in HeLa cells stably expressing a dominant negative caspase-9 mutant Apaf-1 was not degraded. In order to identify the caspase responsible for the processing of Apaf-1, we incubated cellular extracts with purified caspases. Caspase-3 and -8 but not caspase-6 or -9 induced the proteolytic degradation of Apaf-1 from cellular extracts into its p84 fragment. In order to examine whether caspase-8-induced Apaf-1 cleavage was a direct effect or mediated by caspase-8-induced activation of downstream caspases, we performed experiments with lysates from cells deficient in single caspases. Stimulation of the cytochromec/Apaf-1 pathway by anticancer drugs or staurosporine induced the processing of Apaf-1 also in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells. Moreover, recombinant caspase-8 processed Apaf-1 in cellular lysates of caspase-3-transfected MCF7 cells, whereas in caspase-3-deficient MCF7 cells the only caspase capable of cleaving Apaf-1 was caspase-3. These data indicated that caspase-8-induced processing of Apaf-1 was mediated by caspase-3 and that caspase-8 itself was not responsible for the cleavage of Apaf-1.It was recently demonstrated that caspase-3 and -7 are part of the apoptosome (24Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, although caspase-9 might not be directly involved in Apaf-1 cleavage, it was possible that the processing of Apaf-1 was restricted to the apoptosome and mediated by executioner caspases associated within the holoenzyme complex. However, when the mitochondrial pathway was blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression, CD95 death receptor stimulation induced a weak but detectable processing of Apaf-1. The attenuated cleavage of Apaf-1 corresponded to the decreased processing of caspase-3 during CD95 stimulation in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (31Engels I.H. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Jänicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4563-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, in cells overexpressing Bcl-2, stimulation of CD95 can activate caspase-3 independently of the mitochondrial pathway, indicating that Apaf-1 can be processed outside of the apoptosome.Using antibodies directed against different regions of Apaf-1 and Apaf-1 mutants, we localized a putative caspase cleavage site to the motif LEKD19 at the N terminus of the CARD. Since cleavage at this site would reduce the molecular weight by only about 2 kDa, an additional caspase cleavage must be located within the WD-40 repeats in order to generate the p84 fragment. Due to the presence of several potential cleavage sites, the exact localization of the second C-terminal site would require direct sequence analysis. The location of the two caspase cleavage sites within the CARD and WD-40 repeats may have functional consequences for the activity of Apaf-1, since both regions play important regulatory roles. Previous studies demonstrated that an Apaf-1 mutant that lacked the WD-40 repeats was able to self-oligomerize and to activate procaspase-9 without the requirement of cytochrome c and dATP (20Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Consequently, the partial removal of the WD-40 repeats should enable Apaf-1 p84 to assemble in the absence of cytochrome c and dATP. One way to test this possibility was to process Apaf-1 from S100 extracts in vitro with purified caspase-3. Indeed, caspase-3-mediated cleavage enabled the oligomerization of p84 in the absence of cytochromec and dATP. The resulting ∼440-kDa complex of p84 was not associated with the full-length form p130. However, this does not exclude the possibility that at an early time point of apoptosome formation an intermediate p84-p130 complex might occur that is further processed to the ∼440-kDa p84 multimer. Thus, the 440-kDa multimer might result from the proteolytic cleavage of Apaf-1 p130 and the subsequent loss of caspase-9 from the ∼700-kDa apoptosome.In contrast to mutant Apaf-1 lacking the WD-40 repeats, which is able to recruit procaspase-9 (21Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 26Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), the ∼440-kDa multimer of p84 was not associated with caspase-9; nor did it contain any caspase activity. The inability of binding caspase-9 was presumably caused by the removal of the Apaf-1 N terminus within the CARD region. The CARD of Apaf-1 consists of six tightly packed amphipathic α-helices (42Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 43Zhou P. Chou J. Olea R.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cleavage sequence LEKD is located at the end of the α-helix H1 that is in fact composed of two smaller helices and therefore should be easily accessible for caspase cleavage. The CARD/CARD interaction site with procaspase-9 has been mapped to helices H2 and H3, which are opposite to H1 (42Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 43Zhou P. Chou J. Olea R.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that deletion of the H1 helix destroys the overall structure of Apaf-1 CARD and disables interaction with procaspase-9. This would in turn release caspase-9 from the apoptosome and leave a p84 multimer devoid of any caspase activity. It may be speculated that caspase-mediated degradation of Apaf-1 is a mechanism for the release of caspase-9 from the apoptosome. In a similar context, we observed the majority of the p35 and p37 form of caspase-9 in the monomeric fractions. However, a recent study suggested that caspase-9 is only highly active when bound in a complex with Apaf-1 serving as an allosteric activator (28Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, whether the DEVDase activity found in the low molecular weight fractions is attributable to caspase-9 or to executioner caspase-3, -6, and -7 is currently unclear.Besides the functional apoptosome, two other high molecular Apaf-1 complexes have been recently described, including an inactive 1.4-MDa complex as well as a so-called microaposome of ∼200–300 kDa (24Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,45Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The microaposome has been found to contain caspase-3 and caspase-7 but no Apaf-1 p130 and may be generated from the functional apoptosome by proteolytic degradation. It is plausible that the antibodies used in the above mentioned study failed to detect the p84 proteolytic fragment. Indeed, we noticed in the literature that several Apaf-1 antibodies have been generated against N-terminal peptides and may therefore not recognize the Apaf-1 proteolytic fragment. Nevertheless, we consider it unlikely that the 440-kDa multimer is identical to the microaposome, due to differences in the molecular weight of both complexes and the fact that the 440-kDa multimer contained neither caspase-3 nor DEVDase activity.Very recently, Bratton et al. demonstrated that caspase-3 can cleave Apaf-1 into an ∼30-kDa fragment (46Bratton S.B. Walker G. Roberts D.L. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the p30 cleavage product was preferentially found within the biologically inactive ∼1.4 MDa apoptosome, suggesting that this cleavage may selectively occur in misfolded Apaf-1 molecules. The cleavage site of p30 has been mapped within the CED-4-like region of Apaf-1. Since the p84 fragment described here should contain an intact CED-4-like domain, Apaf-1 obviously might be processed at more than two different cleavage sites. Interestingly, when Bratton et al. used purified Apaf-1 for cleavage with caspase-3 or -7 in vitro, besides the p30 product two additional higher molecular weight fragments of Apaf-1 became apparent. Unfortunately, the authors did not follow this observation in detail, and it remains unclear whether these cleavage products are related to our p84 fragment. Thus, future experiments will have to address the question of whether Apaf-1 is differentially cleaved within the active ∼700-kDa and the inactive ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complex.Another intriguing functional consequence of Apaf-1 cleavage concerns the role of effector caspases within the apoptosome. It has been suggested that the WD-40 repeats form propeller-like structures that may serve as interfaces for effector caspases (47Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Indeed, in some studies, caspase-3 and -7 have been found within the apoptosome (24Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,26Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that an Apaf-1 mutant lacking WD-40 repeats associated with and activated procaspase-9 but failed to recruit procaspase-3 and to induce apoptosis (26Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). These results indicate that WD-40 repeats may be involved in the recruitment of procaspase-3 to the apoptosome. Conversely, the partial removal of the WD-40 repeats during activation of the cytochromec/Apaf-1 pathway would facilitate the release of executioner caspases such as caspase-3 from the apoptosome.Alternatively, the degradation of Apaf-1 might serve as a negative feedback mechanism that allows the apoptotic process to be halted. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins including XIAP can inhibit individual caspases and other apoptotic events through distinct protein domains (48Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Especially in cells with low Apaf-1 and increased XIAP levels, Apaf-1 cleavage could thus even completely inhibit the propagation of a death signal. However, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the cleavage of Apaf-1 constitutes a negative feedback mechanism by generating a dominant-negative Apaf-1 inhibitor, we presume that Apaf-1 cleavage has rather an apoptosis-promoting effect. During apoptosis, caspase-3 and -7 have been localized in different cellular compartments, such as for instance the cell nucleus (49Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 50Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, Apaf-1 is mainly localized in the cytosol (18Hausmann G. O'Reilly L.A. van Driel R. Beaumont J.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. Huang D.C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although it remains unclear whether the apoptosome is tethered to particular intracellular structures. Therefore, it is conceivable that a cleavage at the WD-40 repeat region and the subsequent release of effector caspases would facilitate the subcellular redistribution of caspases and their access to substrates in different cellular compartments.In summary, we demonstrate that Apaf-1 is processed during apoptosis from its full-length p130 form into a p84 fragment that misses the CARD N-terminal helix H1 and part of the C-terminal WD-40 repeats. Cleavage at both sites is presumably responsible for the lack of caspase-9 and effector caspases in the resulting 440-kDa Apaf-1 multimer. We are aware that our data may not allow a clear interpretation of the consequences of this cleavage in vivo. On the basis of our findings, one could, however, envisage the following model (Fig.8). A proapoptotic stimulus induces the release of cytochrome c, resulting in the nucleotide-dependent formation of an Apaf-1 oligomer. The oligomerized but not the free Apaf-1 binds to procaspase-9 and increases its activity through allosteric interaction (28Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This activity is sufficient to carry out intramolecular processing resulting in fully active caspase-9. Caspase-9 then activates effector caspase-3 and -7, which are associated with Apaf-1. Caspase-3 in turn can cleave Apaf-1, which by the proteolytic deletion of CARD and WD-40 repeats results in the release and redistribution of caspase-9 and caspase-3 from the apoptosome. Our results favor the intriguing idea that this mechanism may play a functional role for the intracellular propagation of a death signal. There exist at least two major pathways leading to the apoptotic demise of the cell: the extrinsic death receptor pathway and the intrinsic cell death pathway. In death receptor-mediated apoptosis, the adapter protein FADD plays a central role in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, in which FADD recruits procaspase-8 to the active trimeric death receptor. Procaspase-8 is then autocatalytically activated and in turn cleaves and activates the downstream cascade of effector caspases (1Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Likewise, the adapter protein Apaf-11 constitutes the central element in the intrinsic pathway that can be triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion (5Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J.

Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 229-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aizawa S.I. Harwood C.S. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Sensory inputs are mediated by a family of transmembrane chemoreceptor proteins that interact with the histidine protein kinase CheA. The central region of CheA is a histidine kinase module composed of a four-helix bundle dimerization domain formed from the parallel association of two up-down helices, each linked to an ATP-binding catalytic domain that contains the kinase active site (4Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This structural arrangement seems to be a general feature of the over 500 different histidine protein kinases that have been identified in a wide range of different signal transduction systems in microorganisms and plants (5Dutta R. Qin L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb.

Evol. 2000; 17: 1956-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In most members of the histidine kinase superfamily, the histidine that is phosphorylated is located at a solvent-exposed position termed the H box located in the N-terminal helix of the dimerization domain (8Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In CheA proteins, however, the conserved H box histidine in the dimerization domain is replaced by glycine, and the site of histidine phosphorylation is displaced to a distinct N-terminal α-helical domain termed the P1 or H domain (9Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 10Zhou H. Lowry D.F. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13858-13870Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Histidine protein kinases generally function together with a second type of signal transduction module, the response regulators (11Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The phospho-histidine generated at a given histidine kinase H box is subsequently transferred to a highly conserved aspartate residue at the active site of a cognate response regulator (12Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21770-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation generally activates the response regulators to produce a response. Thus, the phospho-histidine group in the P1 domain of CheA is readily transferred to the chemotaxis response regulator, CheY, and phospho-CheY binds to proteins at the flagellar motor to control swimming behavior and effect chemotaxis responses. P1-like domains have been identified in a number of different phosphorelay signal transduction systems besides chemotaxis. They are monomeric domains with a conserved four-helix bundle that contains the phosphoaccepting histidine at a solvent-exposed position in the second helix. High resolution structures of the so-called histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) domains from the E. coli histidine kinase ArcB, ArcBC (13Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ypd1 (14Xu Q. West A.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 293: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicated some similarity to the low resolution NMR structure of the P1 domain of CheA (10Zhou H. Lowry D.F. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13858-13870Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the CheA-P1 domain at 2.1-Å resolution. As expected from the solution NMR structure, the domain is composed of 5 α-helices. The phosphoaccepting histidine is positioned near the middle of the B helix, with the imidazole side chain exposed to solvent. The topology of the four-helix bundle formed by the A, B, C, and D helices is essentially identical to the corresponding HPt motif of ArcBC (13Kato M. Mizuno T. Shimizu T. Hakoshima T. Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Ypd1 (14Xu Q. West A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Song H.K. Lee J.Y. Lee M.G. Moon J. Min K. Yang J.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike in CheA, the dimerization domain of the ArcB histidine kinase has an H box histidine that accepts phosphoryl groups from ATP. Moreover, ArcB also has a response regulator CheY-like domain between its dimerization domain and the C-terminal HPt domain, ArcBC. The phosphoryl group in ArcBC is subsequently transferred to separate response regulator proteins that function to regulate transcription, ArcA and OmpR (16Matsubara M. Kitaoka S.I. Takeda S.I. Mizuno T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar domain arrangements have been seen in numerous other regulatory systems, although frequently, as in yeast, the HPt domain is produced as a separate protein. The high degree of structural similarity between HPt domains suggests a common mechanism of action. A fragment of theSalmonella cheAgene that encodes CheA-(1–138) was cloned into a pQE12 vector (Qiagen) that adds two codons at the N terminus and eight codons including six His codons at the C terminus of the gene as described previously (17Levit M. Liu Y. Surette M. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32057-32063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Kinetics studies of the phosphotransfer activities of this protein indicate that the his6 tag has no significant effect on phosphorylation (17Levit M. Liu Y. Surette M. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32057-32063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure determination, there was no electron density corresponding to the his6 tag at the end of helix E. In the protein structure, this region is very distant from the active site on the opposite face of the bundle. M15/pREP4/pHD cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin. The selenium-substituted protein was similarly expressed in methionine auxotroph strain B834(DE3) using minimal medium supplemented with 17 amino acids, the bases for nucleic acids, various salts, sulfate, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and SeMet1 (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Cells from 1.0 liter of culture medium was harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 5500 rpm for 1 h, suspended in 60 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 3.5 mm EDTA) plus 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonication. The resulting extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove membranes and cell debris, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against buffer A and subjected to nickel affinity column chromatography on a 7.5-ml column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 0–0.50m imidazole in buffer A. Met CheA-P1 eluted between 100 and 300 mm imidazole. The SeMet protein was purified by the same procedure except all buffers were supplemented with 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purified P1 was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 3.5 mm EDTA), loaded on a 6.0-ml UnoQ6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted with an 18-ml linear gradient of 175–275 mm NaCl in buffer B. The purification profiles of both the Met and SeMet P1 proteins indicated a contaminant that migrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 17,000. Removal of the P1 fractions containing this contaminant was essential for obtaining good quality diffracting crystals. Pure P1 fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer B. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the purified SeMet CheA-P1 domain established that all its methionines were replaced by SeMet. To purify mutant P1 domains for biochemical analyses, fractions from nickel affinity columns were concentrated in an Ultrafree 5K centrifugal device (Millipore) and loaded onto a Sepharose S12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mmdithiothreitol. Fractions containing pure P1 domains were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and stored at −20 °C. Met and SeMet proteins were dialyzed against buffer B and concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml. In the case of the SeMet protein, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol were also added. Small platelike crystals were obtained initially for the Met protein using the Crystal Screen sparse matrix (19Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). The optimized crystallization medium using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 12 °C was 20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (w/v), 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.0–5.2, and 0.3–0.4 mammonium sulfate. Platelike crystals appeared after 3 weeks. The crystals were cryocooled in liquid nitrogen after a rapid transfer in 35% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (w/v) or in a drop of reservoir solution (0.5 µl) containing 20% (w/v) glycerol for the Met and the SeMet protein, respectively. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121with cell parameters of a = 55.3 Å, b = 88.8 Å, c = 116.3 Å (a = 54.9 Å, b = 88.7 Å, and c = 115.8 Å for the SeMet protein), with four molecules per asymmetric unit. A data set for the Met protein was collected at 100 K on the beam line ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was performed on a single crystal (600 × 200 × 80 µm3) of the SeMet protein. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the BW7A beam line of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). A fluorescence spectrum recorded from the cryocooled crystal was used to select the wavelengths at the selenium K-absorption edge (λ3 = 0.9805Å), at the peak (λ1 = 0.9802 Å), and at a remote wavelength on the high energy side (λ2 = 0.9300 Å). Complete and highly redundant data were collected to 2.1-Å resolution on a 30-cm MAR Research image plate with a frame size of 1.0° and ∼5-min exposure time. Intensities were processed using the program MOSFLM (20Leslie A.G.W. Helliwell J.R. Machin P.A. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the Daresbury Study Weekend.

Selenium atom positions were identified using Patterson map search procedures (22Terwilliger T.C. Kim S.-H. Eisenbeg D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 82-86Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Seventeen selenium sites were found out of the 24 expected in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the anomalous scatterers and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing were conducted with the program SHARP (25de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) using all data between 35.3 and 2.1 Å and the remote wavelength (λ2) data set as a reference (TableI). The native data set was also included in the phasing (26Boissy G. de La Fortelle E. Kahn R. Huet J.C. Bricogne G. Pernollet J.C. Brunie S.

These fragments clearly accounted for the four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The construction of one CheA-P1 molecule was then pursued manually, leading to a molecular model containing 126 of 142 residues and 114 side chains.

The final model comprises 125–129 of 142 residues in the recombinant protein, excluding the C-terminal His6 tag, one sulfate ion, and 215 water molecules.

Open table in a new tab Point mutations in cheA P1 were generated using the Quick ChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, a supercoiled doubled-stranded DNA vector containing the insert of interest was amplified using two complementary oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. After amplification, the parental DNA encoding a His-tagged CheA-P1 domain (17Levit M. Liu Y. Surette M. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32057-32063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was digested with DnpI to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. The final clones, pHDK51A and pHDE70A, were confirmed by sequencing. The primer sequences and their complements were CGCACTCCATTGCAGGCGGCGCGGG (K51A) and CCACGCATTTAATGGCAAACCTGCTGGATG (E70A). Phosphorylation assays were performed at 24 °C. Reactions contained 100 µm CheA-P1, 10 µmof CheA catalytic C domain (17Levit M. Liu Y. Surette M. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32057-32063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), 5.0 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP to a final concentration of 0.50 mm. At the indicated times, 10-µl aliquots were removed, added to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactivity co-migrating with P1 was measured using a PhosphorImager. CheY∼P was generated by incubating 2.0 µm CheY for 40 min at 24 °C in the presence of 40 mm [32P]acetylphosphate. Under these conditions, steady-state levels of CheY∼P were produced that did not increase with the addition of higher concentrations of acetylphosphate. P1 was then added such that the final reaction mixture contained 1.0 µm CheY∼P, 100 µm P1, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm acetylphosphate. At the indicated times, 10-µl aliquots were removed and analyzed for P1 phosphorylation as described above. The P1 domain of CheA forms a globular and rather compact all α structure, with 77.9% of its residues in helical conformation. The structure was analyzed using the program PROMOTIF (35Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The fold (Fig. 1) is composed of a short 310 helix at the N terminus followed by 5 α-helices (A, B, C, D, and E) 29–36 Å long. Helices A, B, C, and D form an antiparallel four α-helix bundle with an up-and-down topology and a left-handed twist, an arrangement shown to be favored by electrostatic and nonbonded interactions (36Chou K.C. Maggiora G.M. Nemethy G. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4295-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The average values of Ω0, the angle that describes the relative orientation of pairs of α-helices forming the bundle, are −156.2 ± 3.5° and 33.8 ± 2.7° for adjacent and diagonal neighbors, respectively. The average value for the closest distances between adjacent helices is 9.2 ± 0.9 Å. The C-terminal E helix runs parallel to C and antiparallel to D at an equal distance (10.3 Å) to both of them. Loop-helix interactions play a critical role in stabilizing this type of fold (37Chou K.C. Maggiora G.M. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7315-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the P1 domain, α-helices are connected by one γ turn and three short loop segments. On the top of the bundle (Fig. 1), the loop connecting helices A and B (residues 30–36) is formed from two consecutive β turns involving two proline residues that interact with the hydrophobic core. The connection between helices C and D (residues 78–84) is rather extended with an alternate pattern of exposed polar and buried hydrophobic residues. At the bottom of the bundle, the loop connecting helices B and C (residues 57–59) has a marked hydrophobic character. Two phenylalanines (Phe-57 and Phe-59) together with Tyr-9, Phe-12, Phe-13, and Tyr-105 form a cluster of stacked aromatic side chains (Fig. 1). This patch covers the cross-section of the bundle and is partly topped by polar and charged residues from the N-terminal 310 helix and from the loop connecting helices D and E (residues 107–112). The N termini of helices B, D, and E are capped by the side chains of Asp-36, Asn-84, and Asp-112, which provide hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen atoms of residues 39, 87, and 115, respectively. All five helices are amphipathic. Charged and polar groups are mostly exposed on the surface whereas most hydrophobic side chains either participate in lateral inter-helix interactions or are buried inside the hydrophobic core of the helical bundle. A cluster of methionine side chains from residues 23, 69, and 98 occupies the exact center of the core. The only polar inter-helix interactions were found between helices A and D and between helices B and C. On the face of the bundle formed by the A and D helices, the A helix Glu-24 γ-carboxylate is at 3.1 Å from the D-helix Lys-95, and the A helix Asp-17 β-carboxylate is engaged in a network of salt bridges and hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the Lys-106 ε-amino group at a 2.8-Å distance and the side chains of Gln-99 and Asp-103 all from helix D (Fig. 1). On the opposite side of the helical bundle, the side chains of His-48 (the site of phosphorylation) and Lys-51 from helix B interact with the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Glu-70 from helix C, and a hydrogen bond is formed between the side chains of Asn-41 from helix B and Arg-77 from helix C (Fig. 1). The two-component paradigm was thought initially to involve only two conserved modules, histidine kinases and response regulators (11Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In recent years it has become clear that many systems have a third conserved module, the histidine phosphotransfer or HPt domain. The structures of HPt domains from S. cerevisiae, Ypd1, and E. coli, ArcBC, are remarkably similar to one another despite a low level of sequence identity (14Xu Q. West A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Song H.K. Lee J.Y. Lee M.G. Moon J. Min K. Yang J.K. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CheA-P1 clearly establishes that this domain is a member of the HPt family. In the structure reported here, the four-helix bundle formed by αA, αB, αC, and αD is very similar to the corresponding four-helix bundle in the crystal structures of ArcBC and Ypd1 (root mean square difference values of 1.5 and 1.2 Å, respectively for 73 common C-α atoms) (Fig. 2). Whereas all three proteins differ significantly in loops between helices and in their N- and C-terminal flanking regions, the central four-helix bundle is completely conserved. Different HPt domains share very little sequence identity (<10%). There are a few conserved residues, however, and these are found in P1 as well as in other HPt proteins (Fig. 3). These amino acids appear to define critical features of the active site. The site of phosphorylation is invariably located at the position corresponding to that of His-48 in the B helix of CheA-P1. In the P1 structure, the electron density of His-48 is well defined in all four molecules of the asymmetric unit, and the imidazole side chain atoms have lower B factors than the average value (∼18 versus 24.9 Å2). In three of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit, His-48 is part of a hydrogen-bond network involving Lys-51 in helix B and Glu-70 in helix C (Fig. 4). One Glu-70 γ-carboxylate oxygen is within 2.8 Å of the ND1 atom of the His-48 imidazole, and the other is within 3.2 Å of the ε-amino of Lys-51. This geometry is in line with an ND1H tautomeric neutral form suggested from the NMR studies of the P1 domain of CheA fromE. coli (38Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and increases the nucleophilicity of the NE2 atom for a more efficient phosphotransfer chemistry. A Lys and a Glu or Gln occupy the corresponding positions in other HPt proteins. Another feature of the active site histidine is its exposure to solvent, especially in the distal region along the B helix, where three consecutiv"

The present study highlights a distinctive strategy of cap targeting in fission yeast whereby the triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) enzymes of the capping apparatus do not interact physically with each other (as they do in budding yeast and metazoans), but instead bind independently to the phosphorylated CTD.

Pct1 and Pce1 bind in vitro to synthetic CTD peptides containing phosphoserine uniquely at position 5 or doubly at positions 2 and 5 of each of four tandem YSPTSPS repeats, but they bind weakly (Pce1) or not at all (Pct1) to a peptide containing phosphoserine at position 2.

Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Specific targeting of cap formation to transcripts made by RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 is achieved, at least in part, through physical interactions of one or more components of the capping apparatus with the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II (2McCracken S.

The mammalian pol II large subunit has 52 heptad repeats, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe subunit has 29 repeats, and the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae subunit has 27 copies (6Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The CTD undergoes a cycle of extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser-5 and Ser-2, which is coordinated with the transcription cycle. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the guanylyltransferase (Ceg1) and methyltransferase (Abd1) components of the capping apparatus bind independently in vitro and in vivo to the phosphorylated CTD, but not to unphosphorylated CTD (2McCracken S.

The mammalian capping enzyme Mce1 is a bifunctional polypeptide composed of an NH2-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain linked to a COOH-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. Mce1 binds to the pol II CTD and this interaction also requires CTD phosphorylation (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L.

The guanylyltransferase domain Mce1(211–597) per se binds to CTD-PO4, but the NH2-terminal triphosphatase domain Mce1(1–210) does not (3Ho C.K. Sriskanda V. McCracken S. Bentley D. Schwer B.

Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Apparently, the covalent connection between the mammalian guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase domains allows the guanylyltransferase to deliver the triphosphatase to the transcription elongation complex. The mammalian guanylyltransferase can even deliver heterologous viral or fungal RNA triphosphatasesin vivo when they are fused to create chimeric capping enzymes (13Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the CTD and CTD phosphorylation play more than mere architectural roles in coordinating mRNA synthesis and processing (reviewed in Ref. 14Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the phosphorylated CTD directly stimulates the catalytic activity of the mammalian RNA guanylyltransferase (12Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Wen Y. Shatkin A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The remarkable feature of the activation of mammalian guanylyltransferase by the CTD is the requirement for phosphoserine at position 5. The guanylyltransferase also binds to CTD phosphorylated on Ser-2, but this interaction has no effect on enzyme activity (12Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses of the pol II large subunit have shown that the growth of fungal and metazoan cells is contingent on a minimal CTD length. Mammalian cells cannot grow with 25 or fewer CTD heptad repeats, but are fully viable with 36 repeats (16Bartolomei M.S. Halden N.F. Cullen C.R. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). West and Corden (17West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that truncating the S. cerevisiae CTD to 7 heptad repeats was lethal, whereas deletions leaving 8 or 9 heptads elicited cold-sensitive (cs) and temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defects, and normal cell growth required at least 10 integral copies of the heptad. A slightly higher threshold for yeast CTD length was reported by Nonet et al. (18Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), whereby less than 10 heptad repeat was lethal, 10 to 12 repeats resulted in conditional phenotypes, and 13 or more repeats sustained normal growth. Mutations that eliminate the hydroxyl moieties (potential phosphate acceptors) on Tyr-1, Ser-2, or Ser-5 of the heptad sequence are lethal to S. cerevisiae (17West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not clear if the loss of CTD function in vivo is a direct consequence of a perturbation of CTD structure (e.g. intra- or intermolecular loss of hydrogen bonding interactions) or a secondary effect on CTD phosphorylation state. There is relatively little known about the fine structure of the CTD and how such parameters as CTD length, amino acid sequence, and phosphorylation arrays influence various CTD-PO4 effector functions. The interaction of the capping apparatus with the phosphorylated CTD provides an attractive model system to address these issues. Here we present an analysis of the interactions of the capping enzymes of the fission yeast S. pombe with the CTD of the largest subunit of S. pombe pol II that highlights a new strategy for independent recruitment of separately encoded triphosphatase (Pct1) and guanylyltransferase (Pce1) components to the pol II elongation complex. Analysis of the interaction of S. pombe and mammalian capping enzymes with mutated synthetic CTD phosphopeptides illuminates for the first time the contributions of conserved CTD side chains to CTD function independent of any effects on CTD phosphorylation. This approach should be applicable to the study of CTD-PO4 effector roles in other co-transcriptional RNA transactions such as pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, and transcription termination. The screen was performed using the Matchmaker system from CLONTECH with protocols specified by the vendor. The full-length PCT1 andPCE1 genes were inserted into pAS2-1 (2µ TRP1) so as to fuse them in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD). The BD-PCT1 and BD-PCE1 plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain Y190. Trp+isolates were selected and grown in 1-liter cultures SD(−Trp) medium. The cells were harvested and transformed by the LiCl method with anS. pombe cDNA library in a GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion plasmid (2µ LEU2) (19Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The transformant pool was selected directly for HIS3 reporter expression by plating on SD(-Trp, -Leu, -His) agar containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The total number of transformants screened was estimated by plating an aliquot of the pool on SD(-Trp, -Leu) agar. The His+ colonies were selected after incubation for 3 to 7 days at 30 °C, then patched and restreaked on SD(-Trp, -Leu, -His, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) agar. Single colonies that retested for His+ were patched and tested forlacZ reporter expression using the β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay. DNA recovered from the strains that tested positive for both HIS3 and lacZ expression was used as the template for PCR amplification of the S. pombeDNA insert with flanking primers specific for the AD-fusion plasmid. The PCR products were gel-purified and then sequenced. The AD plasmid clones were recovered after transformation into Escherichia coli DH5α. Gene fragments encoding serially truncated versions of S. pombe Rpb1 were generated by PCR amplification using antisense primers that introduced stop codons in lieu of the codons for amino acids 1687, 1669, 1648, 1634, 1592, or 1585 and a XhoI site immediately 3′ of the stop codon. The sense primer introduced a BamHI site at the codon for amino acid 1516. The PCR products were digested with BamHI andXhoI and then inserted into the two-hybrid AD fusion vector pGAD-GH. Sequencing of the inserts in the resulting series of AD-Rbp1 plasmids verified that the truncated RPB1 genes were fused in-frame to AD and that no unwanted coding changes had been introduced during amplification and cloning. S. pombe RNA triphosphatase Pct1 and mouse guanylyltransferase Mce1(211–597) were produced in E. coli as N-terminal His-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose chromatography as described previously (3Ho C.K.

Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Mce1(211–597)-[32P]GMP intermediate was prepared by reaction of 20 µg of Mce1(211–597) with 5 µm [α-32P]GTP and 2.5 mmMgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was adjusted to 25 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol and the native enzyme-GMP intermediate resolved from free [32P]GTP by gel filtration through a 1-ml column of Sephadex G-50. S. pombe RNA guanylyltransferase Pce1 was produced inE. coli as a His-tagged fusion as follows. The pET-PCE1 plasmid (21Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was modified by insertion of a DNA fragment encoding an NH2-terminal 21-amino acid peptide (MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRP) in-frame with the open reading frame encoding the 402-amino acid Pce1 polypeptide. The pETHis-PCE1 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A 250-ml culture was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until theA 600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol and incubation was continued for 20 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 300 µmand 100 µg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and the lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was mixed for 30 min with 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 25 mm imidazole. The slurry was poured into a column and the resin was washed with 10 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 mmimidazole. Pce1 was then step-eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The enzyme preparation (7 mg of protein) was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding method with bovine serum albumin as the standard. NH2-terminal biotinylated CTD phosphopeptides composed of 4 tandem YSPTSPS repeats containing phosphoserine at position 2, position 5, or positions 2 plus 5 of each repeat were synthesized and purified as described previously (12Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Schwer B. Lehman K. Saha N. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1857-1864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutant Ser-5 phosphopeptides Y1A (ASPTSPS)4, P3A (YSATSPS)4, T4A (YSPASPS)4, and P6A (YSPSTAS)4 were synthesized and purified using the same methods. The molecular weights of the mutant phosphopeptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The measured masses were in agreement with the calculated theoretical masses within the limits of calibration of the instrument. The peptides were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C. The biotinylated CTD peptides were absorbed to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280 streptavidin; Dynal) in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100) containing 50 mm NaCl as described previously (12Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The amount of biotinylated CTD peptide was sufficient to saturate the bead-bound streptavidin. After peptide adsorption, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer to remove any unbound peptide. Affinity chromatography was performed by mixing 14 µg (280 pmol) of Pce1, 9 µg (240 pmol) of Pct1, or 4 µg (85 pmol) of Mce1(211–597) with 0.6 mg of CTD peptide beads (estimated to contain 390 pmol of peptide) in 50 µl of binding buffer with 50 mm NaCl. After incubation for 30 min on ice, the beads were concentrated by microcentrifugation for 15 s and then held in place with a magnet as the supernatant was withdrawn. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer and subjected to two cycles of concentration and washing. After the third wash, the beads were resuspended in 50 µl of binding buffer. Aliquots (20 µl) of the bead bound fraction were mixed with 4 µl of SDS sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 140 nmβ-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol), heated at 90 °C for 3–5 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of fungal capping systems have conserved catalytic domains (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar), but the enzymes are not always functionally interchangeablein vivo. S. pombe and Candida albicansguanylyltransferases can function in S. cerevisiae with the endogenous Cet1 triphosphatase (21Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the ability of heterologous triphosphatases to function with the S. cerevisiae guanylyltransferase is variable and correlates with the presence or absence of a conserved guanylyltransferase-binding domain on the surface of the heterologous RNA triphosphatase (11Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).S. pombe triphosphatase Pct1 (a 303-amino acid polypeptide), which lacks the surface domain and does not function on its own inS. cerevisiae, can support cell growth when S. pombe guanylyltransferase Pce1 (a 402-amino acid polypeptide) is provided in trans (20Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the fission yeast capping components display a species-specific genetic interaction. Given that the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the capping apparatus are physically associated in budding yeast and metazoans (with the interaction being noncovalent in S. cerevisiae and covalent in metazoans), the simplest model to account for the genetic interaction would be that S. pombetriphosphatase Pct1 forms a complex with S. pombeguanylyltransferase Pce1 and that Pce1, which binds in vitroto CTD-PO4 (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), in turn chaperones the triphosphatase to the transcription complex. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether a mixture of recombinant Pct1 (a homodimer) and recombinant Pce1 (a monomeric protein) resulted in the formation of a stable heteromeric complex that could be isolated by velocity sedimentation using the methods that readily detect formation of a complex between S. cerevisiae Cet1 and Ceg1 (10Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect any complex formation between the S. pombe Pct1 and Pce1 (not shown). Next, we conducted a two-hybrid screen of a S. pombecDNA library linked to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) using as “bait” either Pce1 or Pct1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-BD. Although the screens yielded multiple interacting clones in each case (see below), we did not isolate Pce1 or a fragment thereof using Pct1 as bait. Nor did we isolate Pct1 or a fragment thereof using Pce1 as bait. To exclude the possibility of a false negative caused by absence of the Pce1 or Pct1 genes from the S. pombe plasmid library, we performed a directed two-hybrid interaction assay using an explicitly engineered pair of BD-Pce1 and AD-Pct1 vectors. Here again, we saw no evidence of interaction between the S. pombe triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase (not shown). Note that the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components display two-hybrid interactions with one another (25Yamada-Okabe T. Mio T. Matsui M. Kashima Y. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A two-hybrid screen of ∼100,000 transformants for triphosphatase-interacting proteins using BD-Pct1 as bait yielded 16 His+ isolates, of which 8 contained plasmids encoding AD fused in-frame to a COOH-terminal fragment of Rpb1, the largest subunit of S. pombe pol II (26Azuma Y. Yamagashi M. Ueshima R. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Three different AD-Rpb1 fusion clones were isolated: AD-Rpb1(1305–1752) was recovered twice; AD-Rpb1(1324–1752) was recovered 5 times; and AD-Rpb1(1478–1752) was isolated once (Fig. 1). Control experiments showed that the His+ andlacZ + phenotypes required co-transformation with BD-Pct1 and AD-Rpb1(1305–1752) plasmids and that neither fusion plasmid was able to drive expression of the HIS3 orlacZ reporter genes when co-transformed with the BD or AD vectors (Fig. 2).Figure 2Specificity of the Pct1-CTD two-hybrid interaction. The BD-Pct1 and AD-Rpb1(1305–1752) fusion plasmids and the BD and AD vectors without inserts were transformed pairwise into S. cerevisiae Y190. Panel A, single Trp+ Leu+ isolates containing the indicated plasmid pairs were selected and streaked on SD(-Trp, -Leu, -His, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) agar medium. The plate was photographed after incubation for 5 days at 30 °C. Panel B, Trp+Leu+ isolates containing the indicated plasmid pairs were patched on SD(-Trp, -Leu) agar medium. The cell patches were photographed after incubation for 1 day at 30 °C (Growth). The cell patches were then tested for β-galactosidase activity using the colony-lift filter assay. A photograph of the filter is shown (lacZ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A two-hybrid screen of ∼200,000 transformants for guanylyltransferase-interacting proteins using BD-Pce1 as bait yielded 11 His+ isolates. Sequencing of the AD plasmids from these strains showed that 8 of the isolates encoded AD fused in-frame to a COOH-terminal fragment of Rpb1 from residues 1324 to 1752 (Fig. 1). Control transformations confirmed that HIS3 andlacZ expression required co-transformation with the BD-Pce1 and AD-Rpb1(1324–1752) plasmids (not shown). The AD-Rpb1 fusions that interacted in vivo with Pce1 or Pct1 contained all 29 tandem copies of the heptad repeat plus a variable segment of the pol II subunit upstream of the start of the CTD at position 1551 (26Azuma Y. Yamagashi M. Ueshima R. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To gauge the role of the non-reiterated protein segment, we constructed an AD-Rpb1(1516–1752) fusion clone and tested it in a directed two-hybrid assay paired with BD-Pce1 and BD-Pct1. We found that the Rpb1 interaction with both capping enzymes persisted when the AD fusion contained little more than the CTD repeats per se. Thus, subsequent COOH-terminal truncations of the CTD were performed with the NH2-terminal position of Rpb1 fixed at 1516 (Fig. 1). The salient findings were that the CTD interaction with Pct1 persisted with undiminished strength (as gauged by colony size during selection for His+) with 19, 17, or 14 heptad repeats, with diminished strength after truncation to 12 heptad repeats, and was eliminated with 6 or fewer heptads (Fig. 1). The two-hybrid CTD interaction with Pce1 displayed a more stringent requirement for CTD length; the interaction was of diminished strength at between 19 and 14 heptad repeats and was abolished at 12 or fewer repeats (Fig. 1). Previous CTD-binding studies in vitroinvolving S. pombe guanylyltransferase employed an immobilized ligand composed of recombinant GST-CTD that was enzymatically phosphorylated in vitro using HeLa cell extract as the source of CTD kinase. The fusion protein contained 15 copies of the YSPTSPS heptad sequence and an average of 3 serine-phosphates per GST-CTD polypeptide (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We have since developed synthetic CTD phosphopeptide ligands, in which the numbers and positions of the phosphates are known and subject to manipulation, to delineate the requirements for the interaction of capping enzymes with the CTD (12Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Here we employed 28-mer CTD peptide ligands composed of four tandem repeats of the YSPTSPS heptad that contained phosphoserine at either position 2 or 5 of each heptad or phosphoserine atboth positions 2 and 5 of each heptad. An NH2-terminal biotin moiety was added during chemical synthesis so that the peptides could be linked to streptavidin-coated beads for affinity chromatography purposes. The CTD phosphopeptide-containing beads, or control beads containing an unphosphorylated 28-mer CTD peptide, were incubated with purified recombinant Pce1. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer. The bead-bound material was eluted with 1% SDS. The input guanylyltransferase protein (L) and the bead-bound fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The key findings were that the S. pombe guanylyltransferase bound equally well to the CTD Ser5-PO4 peptide and the Ser2-PO4/Ser5-PO4 peptide. Slightly less than one-fifth of the input protein was retained on the beads in both cases. Pce1 bound less avidly to the CTD Ser2-PO4 peptide. The binding was specific for CTD-PO4, because Pce1 did not bind at all to the beads containing the unphosphorylated CTD peptide (Fig.3A). Potential effects of the CTD Ser2-PO4/Ser5-PO4 peptide on Pce1 activity were gauged by preincubating recombinant Pce1 with increasing amounts of the peptide (up to 120-fold molar excess of peptide over Pce1) and then assaying the mixtures for enzyme-GMP complex formation during a reaction in vitro with [α-32P]GTP. The phosphopeptide had no significant stimulatory or inhibitory effect on Pce1 activity (not shown). The novel finding was that the recombinant S. pombe RNA triphosphata"

E. coli Ras-like protein double-Era-like domains polymerase chain reaction base pairs Luria-Bertani dithiothreitol A number of GTPase proteins are known to play crucial roles for various cellular functions such as proliferation, protein translation, signal transduction, cell growth, and protein targeting (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). To regulate these cellular functions, GTPase proteins undergo three different conformational states. The binding of GTP to a GTPase protein (active state) induces the conformational change leading to interaction with its effector molecule, and then bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP (inactive state). The resultant GDP is then released from the guanine nucleotide-binding site (empty state) (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The ratio of the active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state of a GTPase protein is crucial for regulating the cellular events mentioned above. This ratio is governed by two classes of regulatory proteins: the guanine nucleotide release proteins (GNRPs), which help the release of bound GDP promoting its replacement by GTP, and the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which enhance GTP hydrolysis. All of the GTPases or GTP-binding proteins contain the well conserved motifs, G1, G3, and G4. These motifs are critical for GDP/GTP exchange, GTP-induced conformational change, and GTP hydrolysis (2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The G2 motif, the effector region that is highly conserved within each GTPase family but not among different families, is involved in interaction with an effector molecule (1Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

The G2 motif is not involved in GTP binding. Escherichia coli contains a number of GTPase proteins. Among them, EF-Tu and EF-G are known to be involved in protein synthesis (4Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and TrmE is involved in tRNA modification (5Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martı́nez-Vicente M.

In addition, E. coli contains another GTP-binding protein called Era1 (E. coliRas-like protein), which has been shown to be essential for cell growth (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). Although its cellular function has not yet been elucidated, the x-ray structure has been recently determined. It consists of a Ras-like GTPase/GTP-binding conserved domain and a KH domain (8Ahnn J. March P.E. Takiff H.E. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Theera gene is highly conserved in prokaryotic genomes, indicating its fundamental role in cellular function. The genomic analysis of eubacterial genomes so far determined shows another ubiquitous gene encoding an Era-like GTPase (10Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H.

Peculiarly, however, the putative gene product contains two highly homologous Era-like GTP-binding domains connected by a short linker peptide (22–46 amino acids). After the tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains, the protein contains another domain of ∼90–122 amino acid residues. This protein is termed Der for a protein withdouble-Era-like domains. In the present study, we purified and biochemically characterized Der from Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium. We have also demonstrated that the der gene is essential for cell growth in E. coli by analysis of a der deletion strain. All nucleotides were purchased fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-35S]dATP (1,250 Ci/mmol) were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Life Technologies, Inc., and New England Biolabs. To clone the Tm der gene from T. maritima, the genomic DNA of T. maritimawas used as a template for PCR.

This PCR fragment was cloned into the TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), then digested with EcoRI, and finally cloned into the EcoRI site of pIE(ts) plasmid, yielding pIEEcttg.

The 794-bp fragment encompassing the region upstream of der was amplified by PCR with primers 906029 and 906030 and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19. The 799-bp fragment encompassing the region downstream of der was also amplified in the same way with the primers 906031 and 906032. Then the 799-bp fragment digested with BamHI-HindIII was inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site of the plasmid harboring 794-bp upstream fragment. The kanamycin gene fragment with BamHI cohesive ends (11Messing J. Vieira J.

Cells from a culture were fixed by adding 1.7% formaldehyde, collected by centrifugation, and washed with saline (0.8% sterilized NaCl solution). The washed cells were suspended with an appropriate volume of saline. 10 µl of the sample in saline was spread on a glass slide and dried at room temperature. Methanol was applied in drops onto a dried sample, and the sample was dried at room temperature. After methanol fixation, the slide was washed 10 times with tap water and dried at room temperature, and 10 µl of poly-l-lysine (5 µg/ml of distilled water) was spread over the sample. The slide was dried again at room temperature. DAPI solution (4′,6′-diamino-2-phenyl-indole) (10 µl of 0.1 µg/ml of saline) was applied to the sample, and the oil immersion method was used to observe the sample (14Hiraga S. Niki H. Ogura T. Ichinose C. Mori H. Ezaki B. Jaffé A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pETTmDer was introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3)ndk::Cmrstrain (15Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This ndk disruption strain was used to prevent the contamination of GTPase from nucleoside diphosphate kinase in theT. maritima Der preparation. Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase in 3 liters of M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% Casamino acids and 50 µg of ampicillin per ml. The expression of Tm-Der was induced for 4 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Tm-Der was expressed at the level of ∼40% of total cellular protein. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 10 mM bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.0), and resuspended in 30 ml of the same buffer. The cells were lysed by two passes through a French press at 9,000 lb/in2followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and unbroken cells, and by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h to remove membrane and insoluble fractions. The soluble fraction was treated at 70 °C for 10 min to denature E. coli proteins and was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove denatured proteins. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the resulting soluble fraction to 80% saturation. The solution was kept on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to obtain precipitates. The ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction was solublized in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 25 mm NaCl and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A), and the resulting solution was then dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer A. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.5 × 14 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer A. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer A using a gradient of 0.025–1 m NaCl. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was then solublized in 10 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 400 mm NaCl and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (buffer B), and the solution was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer B. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) (2.5 × 5 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer B. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer B using a gradient of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The precipitate was solublized in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (buffer C), and the solution was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer C. The dialyzed sample was then loaded onto a Blue column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.0 × 30 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer C. Tm-Der was eluted with buffer C using a gradient of 0.05–3m NaCl. Fractions containing Tm-Der were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The precipitate was solublized in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing buffer C, and the solution was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of buffer C. The final yield was 5 mg/liter of culture. CD measurements were performed on an automated AVIV60DS spectrophotometer maintained at 4 °C. The spectra were taken from 260–190 nm. The protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml, and a path length of 0.1 cm was used. To identify the hydrolyzed products of GTP, [α-32P]GTP was used for the GTPase reaction instead of [γ-32P]GTP. The reaction was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm[α-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of purified Tm-Der protein at 70 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer of 5-µl samples to 10 µl of ice-cold 20 mm EDTA. Portions of the terminated reaction mixture were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in 0.75 KH2PO4 (pH 3.65). The plate was autoradiographed to identify products from GTP. Spots corresponding to GTP and GDP were identified by UV-shadowing (6Yamanaka K. Hwang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7078-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out under different conditions, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 µl of 6% active charcoal. The mixture was incubated for 2 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. 70 µl of the supernatant was used for measurement of the free inorganic phosphate with a liquid scintillation counter. Genome analysis of a number of eubacterial species reveals that these, but not archaeal or eukaryotic cells, share a highly conserved putative GTPase that has tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains at the N-terminal end as shown in Fig. 1 A (10Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The GTP-binding domains consist of ∼159–170 amino acid residues and show sequence homology to the GTP-binding domain of Era, another GTPase (Fig.1 B). The putative GTPase is thus termed Der, because it has double Era-like GTP-binding domains. Sequence alignments of Der proteins from E. coli, Vibrio cholerae,Hemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacillus subtilis, and T. maritima shown in Fig. 1 Bdemonstrate that sequence similarities in Der in these Eubacteria are present from the N- to the C-terminal ends. It should be noted that they all contain an unique C-terminal domain of ∼90–122 amino acid residues. A BLAST search did not reveal any sequence similarity to known proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, however, the C-terminal domains of the Der proteins have a high pI value; 10.66 forEc (residues 385–503), 10.58 for Vc (residues 375–494), 10.62 for Hi (residues 385–504), 10.74 forNg (residues 435–485), 9.52 for Bs (residues 337–436), and 10.50 for Tm (residues 343–439). Furthermore, the C-terminal short segments are highly basic regardless of the total lengths of the proteins; for example, there are 6 Lys and 3 Arg residues in the 14-residue sequence in Ec-Der and 2 Lys and 2 Arg residues in the 6-residue sequence of theTm-Der. The structural prediction of the C-terminal domains reveals that they consist mostly of α-helices. In contrast to the C-terminal domains, the linker sequences connecting the N-terminal GTP-binding domain (GB-N) and the C-terminal GTP-binding domain (GB-C) are highly acidic, particularly when Der proteins have a long linker. For example in the 38-residue E. coli linker (from Pro-174 to Pro-211) there are 13 Glu and 6 Asp residues but no basic residues. In the case of Der proteins fromN. gonorrhoeae, B. subtilis, and T. maritima, they contain a short linker sequence of ∼20 residues, which are still acidic. Fig. 1 B shows the alignments of the individual putative GTP-binding domains of E. coli and T. maritimaDer proteins with the GTP-binding domain of the E. coli Era protein, which reveals 46–55% homology. Within the 151-residue GTP-binding domain of Era, there are a total of 23 identical residues throughout the sequences (marked by solid circles) and notably an identical 12-residue sequence in the G1 motif is shared in all five GTP-binding domains. There are 40 residues in Era that show similarities to at least three of the four GTP-binding domains (marked by open circles). It is interesting to note that the G2 motifs are very well conserved within the Der proteins and even between the N-terminal GTP-binding domains (GB-N) and the C-terminal GTP-binding domains (GB-C). However, there is a significantly lower sequence similarity between the Era G2 motif and the Der GB-N and GB-C domains. These facts suggest that both GB-N and GB-C may have the same effector function by interacting with the same effector molecule(s) in the cell, different from an effector molecule interacting with Era. As seen in Fig. 1 A, the G2 motif is highly conserved not only between E. coli and T. maritima but also among all Eubacteria species, indicating that a molecule interacting with the G2 motif sequence has been highly conserved through the evolution of Eubacteria and thus may be an essential housekeeping component shared by all Eubacteria. To determine whether Der is essential for cell growth, the same genetic strategy was used as for Era (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). A helper plasmid carrying the E. coli der gene was constructed. The der gene was cloned by PCR fromE. coli chromosomal DNA and inserted into plasmid pIE(ts), a derivative of pEL3 containing a temperature sensitive origin and an ampicillin-resistant gene (16Armstrong K.A. Acosta R. Lender E. Machida Y. Pancotto M. McCormick M. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This helper plasmid, pIEEcttg, was transformed into E. coli strain FS1576 (recD1009thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 lacY1tonA21supE44) (12Stahl F.W. Kobayashi I. Thaler D. Stahl M.M. Genetics. 1986; 113: 215-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also constructed a plasmid pUCDerK carrying a der deletion mutation. In theder deletion mutation, the entire deropen-reading frame was replaced with a kanamycin-resistant gene, leaving the 794-bp 5′-upstream sequence (from base −789 to +5; A of the initiation codon, ATG is set as +1) and the 799-bp 3′-downstream sequence (from base +1461 to +2259), yielding plasmid pUCDerK. Subsequently, the strain FS1576 carrying plasmid pIEEcttg was subjected to linear DNA transformation using a linearized DNA fragment from pUCDerK digested by HindIII (13Jasin M. Schimmel P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of transformants on LB plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 35 µg/ml kanamycin were isolated at 30 °C. Replacement of the chromosomal der gene with kanamycin was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown). All der deletion strains (total of 16 strains) thus isolated showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype on agar plate, as colony formation was not observed at 42 °C (Fig.2 A). This indicates that Der is required for cell growth. In a liquid culture, the cell growth of FK76 strains continued for 4 h upon a temperature increase from 30 °C to 42 °C (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, in this FK76 strain, cells in a liquid culture at 42 °C were elongated forming long filaments (Fig. 2 C), in which chromosome segregations were also defective as judged by DAPI staining (Fig. 2 C). We also constructed a plasmid carrying the wild-type der gene on pIN(lpp)p-5IIICm vector yielding pINEcDer. When the Δder FK76 harboring pIEEcttg was transformed with theE. coli der-containing plasmid pINEcDer, the transformants (AmprKanr Cmr) obtained at 30 °C were able to form colonies even at 42 °C (data not shown). The colonies obtained at 42 °C were confirmed to be Amps but not Kanr Cmr indicating that the dergene is able to complement the E. coli der deletion strain, and der is required for cell growth. To further characterize Der, we cloned Tm der and purified Tm-Der from E. coli. The Tm der gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into a T7 expression vector. In order to avoid the contamination of GTPase activity from E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase,E. coli BL21 (DE3) ndk::Cmrstrain (15Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used as a host. Tm-Der was highly expressed in the presence of isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at a level of 40% total cellular protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The cell lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min to remove as much as possible of the E. coli protein and thus Tm-Der was recovered in the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Tm-Der was subsequently purified by column chromatography with Q-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Blue column. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of the final product is shown in lane 4 of Fig. 3 A. The yield was approximately 5 mg/liter. The purified Tm-Der shows a CD spectrum of a typical α-helix and β-sheet protein (Fig. 3 B). Using purified Tm-Der, high quality crystals giving a 2.2 Å resolution have been obtained, and its structure studied. 2V. Robinson, and A. Stock, personal communication. Using purified Tm-Der, the GTPase assay was carried out at 70 °C with [α-32P]GTP using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig.4 A, (lanes 1–8), GTP was almost completely converted to GDP after a 60-min incubation. Under the same condition in the absence of Tm-Der, GTP to GDP conversion was not observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 11 and12). As observed from the phosphorimager analysis of the TLC, the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP occurred linearly for up to 10 min (data not shown). GTPase activity can also be assayed with [γ-32P]GTP by measuring the amount of32Pi released as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To obtain optimal GTPase assay conditions for Tm-Der, temperature dependence (Fig.5 A), pH dependence (Fig.5 B), salt effect (Fig. 5 C), and the effect of Mg2+ were tested. The temperature dependence experiment (Fig. 5 A) was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm[γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg Tm-Der. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Tm-Der and stopped by the addition of activated charcoal. The amount of 32Pi released in the supernatant was measured to calculate the amount of GTP hydrolysis. At 70 °C, GTP hydrolysis was linear during a 20-min incubation and linearly dependent on the amount of Tm-Der used up to 10 µg in the reaction mixture (data not shown). Interestingly, the GTPase of Tm-Der was activated by KCl but not by NaCl (Fig.5 C), and required Mg2+ (data not shown). The addition of EDTA quite effectively blocked the GTPase activity (data not shown). From these experiments, kinetic characterization of Tm-Der was carried out under the following condition; for 10 min at 70 °C in a 50-µl reaction mixture in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg Tm-Der. Using these conditions, competition experiments were carried out with a number of nucleotides (Fig. 4 B). In the presence of 3 mm competitors (300-fold excess), GTP, GDP, and dGTP were strong competitors, whereas GMP as well as ATP, ADP, and AMP were not inhibitory. An excess of CTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP inhibited the reaction to some extent; however, the reason for this competition is not known at present.Figure 5Effects of reaction temperature, pH, and salt on the GTPase activity of Tm-Der. A, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of Tm-Der for 10 min at different temperatures. The GTPase assay was stopped by adding activated charcoal powders followed by centrifugation, and 32Pi released into the supernatant was counted with a liquid scintillation counter.B, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture between pH 6.5 and 9.0 (50 mm Tris-HCl) and at pH 9.5 and 10.0 (50 mm3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid). Both buffers contained 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, and 10 µg of Tm-Der. The assay was carried out at 70 °C for 10 min. C, the GTPase assay was carried out in a 50-µl reaction mixture: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 10 µm [γ-32P]GTP, 10 µg of TM-Der, and different concentrations (0–1 m) of KCl or NaCl for 10 min at 70 °C. Open circle, KCl; solid circle,NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When [γ-32P]ATP was substituted, under the same conditions, for [γ-32P]GTP, no32Pi release was detected (data not shown), indicating that Tm-Der has no ATPase activity. An enzymatic kinetic experiment was carried out using GTP concentrations of 0.1–2 mm under the optimal conditions described above. The Lineweaver-Burk plot thus obtained is shown in Fig.6, from which Kmand V max values were estimated to be 110 µm and 3.5 µm/min, respectively. Thek cat value was thus calculated to be 0.87 min−1. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Tm-Der is indeed a GTPase whose Km and V maxvalues are 110 and 3.46 µm/min, respectively. Thek cat value was estimated to be 0.87 min−1 (Fig. 6). GTP, GDP, and dGTP were able to compete for binding to Tm-Der (Fig. 4 B). The same results were observed in the competition assay for the E. coli Der. Some inhibitory effects by dATP, dTTP, dCTP, UTP, and CTP were also observed (data not shown). der is exclusively conserved in all eubacterial genomes sequenced as yet (Fig. 1); however, it is not known why deris not conserved in eukaryotic or archaeal genomes. It has been suggested that for one of the Eubacteria, N. gonorrhoeae, an ortholog of Der, EngA (essential neisserialGTP-binding protein A) is essential for cell growth similar to E. coli der (17Mehr I.J. Long C.D. Serkin C.D. Seifert H.S. Genetics. 2000; 154: 523-532PubMed Google Scholar). A BLAST search against Der protein sequences showed all the ortholog sequences from different Eubacteria (data not shown). Der from Streptococcus mutanswas assigned as d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, SerA (18Kawabata S. Terao Y. Hamada S. Oral. Microbial. Immunol. 2000; 15: 58-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this gene is unlikely to be SerA because no significant amino acid sequence similarity between SerA and Der in E. coli and B. subtilis was observed, and SerA has no GTP-binding motifs: G1, G3, and G4 (18Kawabata S. Terao Y. Hamada S. Oral. Microbial. Immunol. 2000; 15: 58-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that at non-permissive temperature, the derdeletion strain (FK76) stops growing after around a 4-h temperature increase (Fig. 2 B), and the antibiotic-independent temperature sensitivity (Fig. 2 A) of theder::kan mutant strains bearing the temperature-sensitive helper plasmid pIEEcttg proves that the presence of Der on helper plasmid is essentially required for cell viability (7March P.E. Lerner C.G. Ahnn J. Cui X. Inouye M. Oncogene. 1988; 6: 539-544Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, der deletion strain cells became elongated under non-permissive conditions, and the chromosome segregations were defective, implying that Der perhaps plays a role in cell division and/or the chromosome segregation process. Peculiarly, the transparent vacuole-like structure (indicated by anarrowhead) was observed, which is a quite uncommon morphological feature. The number and localization of this transparent object varies randomly in the cell, and it is not known yet why inder deletion strains this object appears. As a molecular switch, GTP-binding proteins of eukaryotes or prokaryotes are tightly regulated inside the cell by GAPs and GNRPs. GTP hydrolysis and GTP-GDP exchanges are crucial for cellular events such as signal transduction (e.g. small G proteins), protein translation (e.g. EF-Tu), cell growth (e.g. Ras), vesicular transport (e.g. RAB), and protein translocation across membranes (e.g. SRP), etc. (1Bourene H.R.

Acta. 1998; 1385: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Der has an interesting primary amino acid sequence with two tandemly repeated GTP-binding domain sequences followed by a C-terminal domain. This suggests that probably, Der has a novel GTPase activity where the G2 motif interacts with an effector(s) molecule that may be involved in cell division and/or chromosome segregation. The G2 motif has been known to interact with an effector molecule such as GAP, which regulates the hydrolysis of GTP bound to GTPases. Because of highly similar primary sequences between its tandemly repeated GTP-binding domains within a single molecule, their three dimensional structures are expected to be very similar because the structures of the bacterial EF-Tu and p21ras GTP-binding domain even from different organisms are very superimposable (2Bourene H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). It is probable that each GTP-binding domain may interact with a different effector molecule, resulting in a sequential GTP-GDP cycle or in a synchronized GTP-GDP cycle. 3P. Yoong, C. E. Caldon, and P. E. March (2000), unpublished data. A single effector molecule, also, may interact with G2 motifs of two GTP-binding domains so that this interaction may give rise to a similar GTP-GDP cycle, because G2 motif sequences between N- and C-terminal GTP-binding domains are highly similar to each other. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that only one of the two GTP-binding domains in Der is a truly functional GTP-binding domain. The identification of the effector molecule is important for our understanding of Der function. We now have high quality resolution data at 2.2 Å from Tm-Der crystals.2 The structural determination of Der will provide an insight into the role of the two GTP-binding domains and the function of Der.

https://openalex.org/W2077829227,"Microglia are important in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed previously that macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), encoded by the c-fms protooncogene, is overexpressed on microglia surrounding amyloid β (Aβ) deposits in the APPV717F mouse model for AD. The M-CSFR is also increased on microglia after experimental brain injury and in AD. To determine the relevance of these findings, we transiently expressed M-CSFR on murine BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglial cell lines using an SV40-promoted c-fms construct. M-CSFR overexpression resulted in microglial proliferation and increased expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and interleukin-6 and of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) itself. Antibody neutralization of M-CSF showed that the M-CSFR-induced proinflammatory response was dependent on M-CSF in the culture media. By using a co-culture of c-fms-transfected murine microglia and rat organotypic hippocampal slices and a species-specific real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we showed that M-CSFR overexpression on exogenous microglia induced expression of interleukin-1α by the organotypic culture. These results show that increased M-CSFR expression induces microglial proliferation, cytokine expression, and a paracrine inflammatory response, suggesting that in APPV717F mice increased M-CSFR on microglia could be an important factor in Aβ-induced inflammatory response.

Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 77: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cytokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species released by microglia are thought to be toxic to neurons, as well as important in sustaining the inflammatory response through autocrine and paracrine effects. Anti-inflammatory medications reduce the risk for AD in humans and slow the progression of AD-like pathology in transgenic mice modeling AD (7Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T.

Identification of molecular targets involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation may lead to new therapeutic options for AD. M-CSFR, expressed on cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, belongs to the tyrosine kinase type III family of receptors (10Rothwell V.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 311-324PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bourette R.P. Rohrschneider L.R.

We recently showed that microglia surrounding Aβ plaques in the APPV717F transgenic mouse model of AD show increased immunoreactivity for M-CSFR (13Murphy Jr., G.M. Zhao F. Yang L. Cordell B. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Increased M-CSFR expression by microglia has been reported on activated microglia after ischemic and mechanical brain injury in mice (14Wang Y. Berezovska O. Fedoroff S. J. Neurosci.

Furthermore, the M-CSFR is increased on microglia in AD brain, suggesting that overexpression of this receptor is integral to AD pathophysiology (16Akiyama H. Nishimura T. Kondo H. Ikeda K.

Furthermore, treatment of cultured microglia with M-CSF results in a dramatic augmentation of Aβ-induced cytokine and nitric oxide production (29Murphy Jr., G.M. Yang L. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20967-20971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To examine biological relevance of increased M-CSFR abundance on microglia, we overexpressed M-CSFR gene, c-fms(10Rothwell V.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 311-324PubMed Google Scholar), in murine BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglial cell cultures. The effects of increased c-fms expression on microglial proliferation and expression of IL-1α, MIP-1α, iNOS, and IL-6 were determined with real time RT-PCR (30Livak K.J. Flood S.J. Marmaro J. Giusti W. Deetz K. PCR Methods Appl. 1995; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) and ELISA. We also used a co-culture system consisting of c-fms-transfected BV-2 cells integrated into organotypic hippocampal slices to determine the paracrine effects of c-fms overexpression on cytokine expression in an organotypic environment. Our results indicate that increased expression of c-fms on microglia has powerful proliferative and proinflammatory effects that may contribute to the microglial response in AD and other neurologic disorders. The c-fms expression plasmid pTK1 was a gift from Dr. Rao Tekmal, Emory University School of Medicine. The pTK1 construct contains an SV40-promoted wild-type mouse c-fmssequence that encodes the M-CSFR protein (31Keshava N. Gubba S. Tekmal R.R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1999; 6: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using mouse BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglial cell lines. The immortalized mouse BV-2 cell line has been characterized extensively (29Murphy Jr., G.M. Yang L. Cordell B. J. Biol.

To generate the SV-A3 line, mixed glial cultures were prepared from human fetal brain essentially according to McCarthy and DeVellis (36McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Microglia were shaken off the confluent astrocyte monolayer at day 14 post-plating, replated, and washed after 1 h, and then the cells were immortalized with SV40 T-antigen and adenovirus E1b. The cell line was developed by dilution cloning. The cells are CD68-positive and glial fibrillary acidic protein-negative. SV-A3 cells also express cell surface receptors CD16, CD32, and CD64. 2O. M. Mitrasinovic, G. V. Perez, F.-F. Zhao, Y.-L. Lee, C. Poon, and G. M. Murphy, Jr. unpublished observations. After 6 h of treatment with 1 unit/ml recombinant human IL-1α (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), SV-A3 cells show a 3-fold increase in IL-1α mRNA expression. Thus, SV-A3 cells have many phenotypic features of primary human microglia (37Lee S.C. Liu W. Dickson D.W. Brosnan C.F. Berman J.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2659-2667PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ulvestad E. Williams K. Mork S. Antel J. Nyland H. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Neurol. 1992; 51: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The transient transfections were performed with the LipofectAMINE PLUS® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mouse BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglia were grown to 60% confluency in 6-well tissue culture dishes. BV-2 cells were grown as described previously (34Bitting L. Naidu A. Cordell B. Murphy Jr., G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SV-A3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). Approximately 0.2 µg of the SV40-promoted c-fms expression construct pTK1 was used per 5 × 105 microglial cells for transfection reaction. LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent alone was used as a control treatment. The pZeoSV plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (31Keshava N. Gubba S. Tekmal R.R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1999; 6: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) used to develop the pTK1 expression construct was included as a second control. BV-2 cells were transfected with 0.2 µg of the pZeoSV vector per 5 × 105 cells using an identical procedure as described above for pTK1. Cells were harvested after 24 h in all experiments except for the c-fms expression kinetics study when additional 12- and 44-h incubation time points were included. At the end of the incubation, cells were either harvested for RNA isolation or fixed, as described below for immunohistochemistry. Because serum contains M-CSF (40Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W. Bartocci A. Ferrante A.W. Ahmed-Ansari A. Sell K.W. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4828-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), the same serum lot was used for all experiments to minimize variation in the amount of ligand available to transfected cells. After 24 h of transfection, cell growth medium was removed, and cells were washed 4 times with 1× PBS buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with a blocking 10% normal goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and then washed 3 times for 5 min each in 0.5 m Tris buffer, pH 7.6. Then a rabbit anti-mouse M-CSFR antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added at a dilution of 1:1000 and reacted during overnight incubation at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed 3 times for 10 min each with 0.5 m Tris buffer, pH 7.6, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of Cy3-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). In the final step, cells were washed 4 times for 10 min each with 0.5m Tris buffer, pH 7.6, and once with equilibration buffer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) before mounting on a glass slide using antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Sections were examined with confocal microscopy as described previously (13Murphy Jr., G.M. Zhao F. Yang L. Cordell B. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 BV-2 cells pTK1 transfected for 24 h were pelleted and then resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm mannitol, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and the enzyme inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepsin A. The cell lysate was passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle, after which CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Cell homogenate was centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 430,000 ×g for 6 min. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. All protein extractions were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold reagents. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) before electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide 5% stacking and 8% resolving gel using 50 µg of protein per lane. After protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunodetection was performed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with a polyclonal reagent to the extracellular domain of mouse M-CSFR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; dilution 1:1000) or a polyclonal reagent to the intracellular domain of M-CSFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; dilution 1:200). Blots were then treated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary serum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. BV-2 cells were grown to 40% confluency in a 6-well tissue culture dish and were subsequently transfected with c-fms expression plasmid pTK1 as described above. After 12, 24, and 44 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1× PBS. The relative cell number was measured using a Coulter particle characterization counter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). The counter was gated for cell size so as to exclude dead cells. Average values were obtained from five independent c-fms transfections, each measured in triplicate, and were compared with the values obtained for control cells (LipofectAMINE PLUS treatment only) that were grown in parallel. The CytoTox 96 kit was used to measure c-fms-induced cytotoxicity in microglia (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). This assay is based on colorimetric measurement of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that is released into culture media after cell injury. BV-2 and SV-A3 microglia were grown to 60% confluency and transfected with pTK1 plasmid as described above. After 24 h, 50 µl of the cell growth media was removed from each sample and assayed for LDH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colorimetric measurements were performed on a THERMOmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). The number of lysed cells present in culture was determined by use of a standard curve for LDH and cell numbers. Cytotoxicity experiments were performed three times, and each sample was subsequently assayed in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). This yielded 10–12 µg of total RNA from 5 × 105 microglial cells. RNA samples were diluted to a final concentration of 1 µg/µl in RNase-free water and stored at −80 °C until use. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 1 µg of total RNA. The 20-µl reverse transcription reaction consisted of 5× first strand buffer, 0.5 mm dNTP, 50 nmrandom primers, and 20U Superscript reverse transcriptase (all reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA and primers were mixed and denatured by heating at 70 °C for 10 min, and then the reverse transcription reaction was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by 50 min at 42 °C and then for 15 min at 70 °C. For the quantitative SYBR Green real time PCR, 250 ng of cDNA was used per reaction. Each 25-µl SYBR Green reaction consisted of 5 µl of cDNA (50 ng/µl), 12.5 µl of 2× Universal SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 3.75 µl of 50 nmforward and reverse primers. Optimization was performed for each gene-specific primer prior to the experiment to confirm that 50 nm primer concentrations did not produce nonspecific primer-dimer amplification signal in no-template control tubes. Primer sequences were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and are presented in Table I. Quantitative PCR was performed on ABI 5700 PCR Instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by using 3-stage program parameters provided by the manufacturer as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. Specificity of the produced amplification product was confirmed by examination of dissociation reaction plots. A distinct single peak indicated that single DNA sequence was amplified during PCR. In addition, end reaction products were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.4% agarose gels. Appearance of a single band of the correct molecular size confirmed specificity of the PCR. Each sample was tested in triplicate with quantitative PCR, and samples obtained from at least three independent experiments were used to calculate the means and S.D.Table IReal time RT-PCR primersGene nameGenBank™ accession numberPrimer orientationNucleotide sequence (from 5′ to 3′)Starting sequence positionSize of the PCR ampliconbpM GAPDHM32599ForwardTGAAGCAGGCATCTGAGGG825102ReverseCGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGGGAG926Mc-fmsX06368ForwardTCCACCGGGACGTAGCA239375ReverseCCAGTCCAAAGTCCCCAATCT2467M IL-1αNM_010554ForwardCACAACTGTTCGTGAGCGCT26969ReverseTTGGTGTTTCTGGCAACTCCT337M MIP-1αX12531ForwardCGTTCCTCAACCCCCATC60591ReverseTGTCAGTTCATGACTTTGTCATCAT695M M-CSFX05010ForwardCCCATATTGCGACACCGAA138068ReverseAAGCAGTAACTGAGCAACGGG1447M iNOSNM_010927ForwardGGCAGCCTGTGAGACCTTTG220072ReverseGCATTGGAAGTGAAGCGTTTC2271M IL-6X54542ForwardCTGCAAGAGACTTCCATCCAGTT4570ReverseGAAGTAGGGAAGGCCGTGG114R IL-1αD00403ForwardACATCCGTGGAGCTCTCTTTACA162587ReverseTTAAATGAACGAAGTGAACAGTACAGATT1711R-GAPDHAF106860ForwardAAGAGAGAGGCCCTCAGTTGCT189273ReverseTTGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTGT1964H IL-1αX02531ForwardCAGTTGCCCATCCAAACTTGT70776ReverseATAGAGGGTGGCCCCCC782H iNOSL09210ForwardGAGATCAACATTGCTGTGATCCATAG1455115ReverseCACGGGACCGGTATTCATTC1569H 18 S rRNAM10098ForwardCGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA551187ReverseGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT737The abbreviations used are: M, mouse; H, human; R, rat.

M-CSF in serum containing culture media was neutralized by the addition of 1 µg of M-CSF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) per 1 ml of media. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, M-CSF neutralized media were used to culture c-fms-transfected and non-transfected BV-2 cells. Total RNA was harvested, and gene expression was quantified using quantitative RT-PCR as described above. Hippocampal organotypic cultures were prepared from 7-day-old rats using the protocol of Stoppini et al. (41Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar) and were 15 days in vitro at the time of assembly of the co-culture with microglia. At 15 daysin vitro, inflammatory cells in organotypic culture are in a resting state (42Czapiga M. Colton C.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Coltman B.W. Ide C.F. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 14: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BV-2 cells were grown to 60% confluency in a 6-well tissue culture dish and were subsequently transfected with c-fms expression plasmid pTK1 as described above 24 h prior to the addition to the co-culture. For the co-culture assembly, BV-2 cells were detached by gentle pipetting and then overlaid on the organotypic hippocampal slice so that final cell density was 250–400 cells/mm2. This density was chosen to simulate the density of activated microglia in AD (44Carpenter A.F. Carpenter P.W. Markesbery W.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The co-culture was maintained in hippocampal medium containing 50% minimal essential medium, 25% Hanks' balanced salt solution (both from Life Technologies, Inc.), 25% Defined Equine serum (HyClone), 0.5% glucose (Sigma), 0.5%l-glutamine (Applied Scientific, South San Francisco, CA), 0.5% each of penicillin and streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C. To visualize integration of microglia into the organotypic slice, BV-2 cells were labeled by the addition of 20 µg/ml Mini Ruby (Molecular Probes) 24 h prior to co-culturing. To visualize neurons, 24- and 48-h-old co-cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then immunostained as described above using a neurofilament primary antibody (Sternberger Monoclonals, Baltimore, MD), and a Cy5-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To confirm viability of neurons in the BV-2 hippocampal co-culture, cresyl violet staining was utilized on 24- and 48-h co-cultures. Co-cultures were fixed with 1% buffered formalin acetate for 2.5 h at room temperature, stained with cresyl violet acetate (Acros Organics, Fisher Scientific, NJ), differentiated with 95% ethanol, and mounted with aqua-mount (Lerner Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA) on microslides. Total RNA was isolated from the organotypic co-culture after 24 h of incubation using the TRIzol reagent and was used to prepare cDNA by reverse transcription as described above. Co-culture samples assembled with BV-2 cells overexpressing c-fms were compared using a rat IL-1α specific quantitative PCR assay to control samples containing either non-transfected or transfection media only transfected BV-2 cells. Rat IL-1α-specific primer sequences were designed from a unique sequence segment in rat IL-1α gene (D00403, sequence position 1625–1771) that does not produce alignment in a BLAST search with the mouse version of the IL-1α gene (Table I). SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay was performed as described above. Amplification of cDNA derived from mouse c-fms-transfected BV-2 cells yielded no signal for IL-1α when real time PCR was performed, demonstrating species specificity. IL-1α protein was measured in conditioned media from co-cultures of mouse BV-2 cells and rat hippocampal slices using a rat-specific IL-1α ELISA kit (Endogen, Woburn, MA). Culture supernatant was collected after incubation for 48 h from co-cultures assembled with BV-2 microglia overexpressing c-fms and from co-cultures containing non-transfected BV-2 cells. Media samples were first cleared at 2000 rpm for 5 min and then assayed for rat IL-1α according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of IL-1α are presented as fold change relative to levels measured in control samples. The experiment was performed five times, and each sample was assayed in triplicate. Fig.1 A shows real time RT-PCR quantification of c-fms expression in mouse microglial BV-2 cells after transient transfection with pTK1 plasmid, whereas Fig.1 B shows expression of endogenous c-fms mRNA in nontransfected cells. Increased expression of c-fms in transfected cells occurred rapidly. Twelve hours from the start of transfection, c-fms mRNA levels increased on average 40-fold and continued to increase to 115-fold higher than base line at 44 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 1 B, over the same interval endogenous c-fms mRNA in BV-2 cells did not increase more than 2-fold. We also demonstrated increased expression of the M-CSFR after transfection using immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1 C, a strong increase in the intensity of the M-CSFR immunolabeling was observed in pTK1-transfected BV-2 cells in comparison to control cells. Finally, we confirmed overexpression of M-CSFR protein by Western blot. Fig. 1, D and E,demonstrates expression of the ∼165-kDa M-CSFR after transfection as detected by two different M-CSFR antibodies. Non-transfected BV-2 cells divide as long as sufficient nutrients are available. However, proliferation of BV-2 microglia was increased after pTK1 transfection. As shown in Fig.2, BV-2 proliferation rate increased between 2- and 3-fold after overexpression of c-fms. Fig. 3 Ademonstrates that after 24 h of c-fms transfection there was no major change in toxicity as measured by LDH despite an increase in c-fms mRNA levels of over 80-fold in BV-2 cells. The 2-fold increase in number of dead cells after 24 h was most likely due to the rapid increase in BV-2 cell density that occurred after c-fms transfection. No increase in toxicity was seen after c-fms transfection in human SV-A3 cells. Overexpression of c-fms strongly induced expression of IL-1α mRNA. At 24 h post-transfection with pTK1, the expression of IL-1α mRNA increased 25-fold on average in mouse BV-2 cells (Fig.4 A) and ∼17-fold in SV-A3 human microglia (Fig. 4 B). It should be noted that in SV-A3 cells the transfection medium itself decreased expression of IL-1α, which may have inhibited the level of IL-1α expression after c-fms transfection. Overexpression of c-fms also increased expression of the chemokine MIP-1α (Fig.5 A) and of iNOS, the enzyme responsible for production of nitric oxide by microglia (Fig. 5,C and D). There was a smaller increase of 1.9-fold in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (Fig.5 B). Because transfection of macrophages with plasmid DNA can induce a proinflammatory response (45Stacey K.J. Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2116-2122PubMed Google Scholar), we performed control experiments using pZeoSV vector that was originally used to make pTK1 plasmid (31Keshava N. Gubba S. Tekmal R.R. J. Soc.

We infected a TGF-β-responsive cell line (MvLu1) with a retroviral cDNA library, selecting by fluorescence-activated cell sorter single cells displaying low PAI promoter activity in response to TGF-β. Using this strategy we cloned the proto-oncogene brain factor-1 (BF-1). BF-1 represses the PAI promoter in part by associating with both unphosphorylated Smad3 (in the cytoplasm) and phosphorylated Smad3 (in the nucleus), thus preventing its binding to DNA. BF-1 also associates with Smad1, -2, and -4; the Smad MH2 domain binds to BF-1, and the C-terminal segment of BF-1 is uniquely and solely required for binding to Smads. Further, BF-1 represses another TGF-β-induced promoter (p15), it up-regulates a TGF-β-repressed promoter (Cyclin A), and it reverses the growth arrest caused by TGF-β. Our results suggest that BF-1 is a general inhibitor of TGF-β signaling and as such may play a key role during brain development.

The importance of TGF-β in tumorigenesis is underscored by the finding in a variety of cancers of inactivating mutations and a loss of heterozygosity affecting genes involved in the TGF-β signaling cascade (13Riggins G.J.

Here we report the use of a novel retroviral functional cloning system to clone the brain factor 1 (BF-1) cDNA as a functional antagonist of TGF-β signaling. Recently, Dou et al. (23Dou C. Lee J. Liu B. Liu F. Massague J. Xuan S. Lai E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6201-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) also showed that BF-1 expression inhibits TGF-β signaling. Although several of their results are similar to ours (BF-1 expression causes resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition and reverses TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation), we differ on one crucial point. Dou et al.could not detect interactions between any Smad proteins and BF-1, and they claim that BF-1 exerts its inhibitory effects by binding with the transcriptional coactivator FAST-2. In contrast, we show that BF-1 inhibits TGF-β-induced gene activation in part by associating with unphosphorylated Smad3 in the cytoplasm. BF-1 does not affect Smad phosphorylation induced by TGF-β binding to its receptor, but it does prevent Smad binding to DNA by associating with phosphorylated Smad3 in the nucleus. We also show that BF-1 associates with Smad1, Smad2, and Smad4 and define the segments of the Smad and BF-1 proteins required for their mutual interaction. To build the reporter cell line used in this study, MvLu1 epithelial cells were transfected with a construct containing the mouse CD2 cDNA under the control of the artificial 3TP TGF-β-inducible promoter (24Carcamo J. Weis F. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the PGL2 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). A stable transfectant was selected (called PC1.2-hyg) and retransfected with the mouse ecotropic receptor in a hygromycin resistance vector to obtain the PC1.2-hygE cell line. These cells were infected with a retroviral cDNA library prepared from mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Yang Y. Guo L. Xu S. Holland C. Kitamura T. Hunter K. Cunningham J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two days after infection the cells were treated with recombinant TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 48 h and then stained with PE-anti-CD2 antibodies (PharMingen). After washing extensively the cells were submitted to FACS analysis, and the bottom 10% of fluorescent cells were sorted (see Fig. 1 A). After two more rounds of similar sorting, the cells displaying a lowCD2 expression after TGF-β stimulation were selected. Single cells within this population were cloned in 96-well plates as described (27Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 103 hygromycin-sensitive MvLu1 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates. These “feeder” plates were used to clone single cells sorted by FACS from PC1.2-hyg cells (hygromycin-resistant) infected with the retroviral library. The mixed population was grown in hygromycin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum for 4 days. Hygromycin (50 µg/ml) was then added to kill the MvLu1 feeder while allowing single PC1.2-hyg cell clones to grow. Each individual clone from the FACS selection was trypsinized and expanded. Total RNA from 106cells of each clone was reverse transcribed by priming pBabe with oligo MX3 (5′-CCCCTTTTTCTGGAGACTAAAT-3′), which anneals 3′ to its multiple cloning site (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The product was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Ex-Taq polymerase (Panvera Corp.) in 10% Me2SO with primers flanking the multicloning site of pBabe, MX3, and MX5 (5′-CCACCGCCCTCAAAGTAGACG-3′). mBF-1, C-terminal Myc-tagged mBF-1, hSmad3, and hSmad4 cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The GST-Smad4, GST-Smad3, GST-Smad2, and GST-Smad1 fusion protein constructs as well as GST fusions of the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 were reported previously (3Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of BF-1 were as follows: 78ΤΔ1 (contains BF-1 amino acids 158–480), 78ΤΔ2 (contains BF-1 amino acids 276–480), CΤΔ1 (contains BF-1 amino acids 1–160), and CΤΔ2 (contains BF-1 amino acids 1–277). The mutants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotides: mbf1–5E (5′-GCGGAATTCGGGTGATGCTGGACATGG-3′) for CΤΔ1 and CΤΔ2; mbf1–3MX (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTCTGTTCATGTATTAAAGGGTTGGA-3′) for 5E 78ΤΔ1 and 78ΤΔ2; mbf1 78ΤΔ1–5E (5′-GCGGAATTCGCCACCATGGGCGACAAGAAGAACGGC-3′); mbf1 78ΤΔ2–5E (5′-GCGGAATTCGCCACCATGAAGCTGGCCTTTAAGCGCGG-3′); mbf1 CΤΔ1–3X (5′-GCGCTCGAGCTACTCCTTGCCCCCCTCCCC-3′); and mbf1 CΤΔ2–3X (5′-GCGCTCGAGCTAGGCCCGAGACGTGGTGGA-3′). 3 × 104 cells/well were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and plated in a 24-well plate. They were transfected with different combinations of cDNAs plus the luciferase reporter constructs detailed in the individual figure legends. All the constructs were co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase construct as a control. The transfection was carried out using the FuGene transfection kit as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before incubation with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h. All the reactions were performed in triplicate. After the last incubation the cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase or β-galactosidase activity was assayed using the appropriate substrate (Promega andCLONTECH, respectively), and luciferase activity was expressed in arbitrary units after adjusting for β-galactosidase expression (28Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For the thymidine incorporation assay, cells were incubated in the presence of [3H]thymidine (0.5 µCi/ml), and after extensive washing the incorporated [3H]thymidine was counted as described previously (3Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Gel mobility assays were performed as described previously (29Bergelson S. Klingmuller U. Socolovsky M. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2396-2401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, BOSC cells (106 cells in 6-cm wells) were transfected using FuGene with increasing amounts of pCDNA3.1-BF-1 cDNA alone or together with a combination of cDNAs encoding a constitutively active type I TGF-β receptor (Tβ-RI-T204D) (30Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), Smad3, and Smad4 to mimic TGF-β stimulation (31Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). After transfection (48 h), the cells were lysed and used in a gel shift assay as described (29Bergelson S. Klingmuller U. Socolovsky M. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2396-2401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS buffer, and then centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 rpm. The cell pellets were resuspended in 400 µl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C. Cells were allowed to swell at 4 °C for 15 min, vortexed after adding 25 µl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged again for 1 min. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, vigorously rocked at 4 °C, and clarified in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min to obtain a nuclear extract. The extract (30 µg) was incubated with the oligonucleotide probe PE1.2 (28Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Twenty µl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated with either GST or GST fusion protein were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]BF-1 (Figs. 4 B and 5 B) or [35S]78ΤΔ1, [35S]78ΤΔ2, [35S]CΤΔ1, and [35S]CΤΔ2 (Fig.5 A) at 4 °C for 2 h in 400 µl of buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol 7.5 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The beads were then washed three times with buffer A before separation in an SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager plate and scanned in a PhosphorImager (Fuji).Figure 5Domain analysis of the Smad/BF-1 interaction. A, GST-Smad2 beads were incubated within vitro translated and 35S-labeled wild-type BF-1 or the following BF-1 mutants: 78ΤΔ1, 78ΤΔ2, CΤΔ1, and CΤΔ2 (lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively), and processed as in Fig.4 B. B, GST fusions of the MH1 (lanes 2and 4) or MH2 (lanes 3 and 5) domains of either Smad2 (lanes 2 and 3) or Smad4 (lanes 4 and 5) were incubated with in vitro translated and 35S-labeled wild-type BF-1 and processed as described for A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The technique was essentially the same as that described elsewhere (32Huang L. Wang L. Ma Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Taylor S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). COS cells grown on coverslips (1.7 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with either Smad3, Myc-tagged BF-1 cDNA, or both cDNAs together with or without Tβ-RI-T204D cDNA. After 36 h, the cells were fixed in methanol/acetone, stained with both a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a monoclonal c-myc antibody, then incubated with Cy-goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse Fc secondary antibodies as described previously (33Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and observed under a fluorescent microscope. We used the TGF-β-responsive promoter 3TP (PAI) (34Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to express a reporter gene (mouse CD2). This promoter contains one TGF-β response element (TβRE) adjacent to three tandem tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate response elements (34Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cell line derived from Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (PC2.1-hyg) stably expressing this construct responds to TGF-β stimulation with a 10–20-fold increase in cell surface CD2 expression (Fig.1 A). PC2.1-Hyg cells were infected with a retroviral cDNA library from NIH 3T3 cells (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 35Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently analyzed by FACS. After three rounds of sorting, a cell population that was hyporesponsive to TGF-β was selected (Fig.1 B). Single cells were then cloned from the lowest 20% of this population (27Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After clonal expansion, a cDNA encoding BF-1 was recovered by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from one of these cell lines (25Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). BF-1 activity on TGF-β signaling was first tested in a reporter gene assay. Transfection of BF-1 totally abrogates the transcriptional activity, with or without TGF-β, of an 800-base pair PAI promoter, a shorter fragment (PF1-lux) that includes two TβREs, and a minimal TβRE (PE2.1) (31Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). We also tested the activity of BF-1 on cell cycle promoters normally regulated by TGF-β. TGF-β stimulation up-regulates the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15 promoter (36Li J. Nichols M. Chandrasekharan S. Xiong Y. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26750-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and down-regulates Cyclin A promoter activity (37Feng X. Filvaroff E. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both effects are believed to mediate, at least in part, TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest (38Massague J. Polyak K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When BF-1 was co-expressed with these promoters there was a reversal of the TGF-β effect. Overexpression of BF-1 abrogates the activity of the p15 promoter, but it enhances Cyclin A promoter activity in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 B). The latter, together with the fact that BF-1 overexpression does not alter the expression of β-galactosidase from either a cytomegalovirus or a murine stem cell virus promoter (data not shown), indicates that these effects are promoter-specific. Consistent with the effects of BF-1 on the activity of cell cycle-related promoters, a cell line stably expressing BF-1 is resistant to TGF-β-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2 C). Together, these results define BF-1 as abona fide TGF-β transcriptional antagonist. To establish BF-1 biochemically as a transcriptional antagonist of TGF-β, an oligonucleotide encompassing a TβRE in the PAI promoter (−586 to 551) was used in a gel shift assay. Previous experiments have shown that co-transfection of a constitutively active type I TGF-β receptor (Tβ-RI-T204D) (30Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) together with Smad3 and Smad4 generates a Smad-containing complex visualized in a gel-shift assay. This complex can be supershifted with either Smad3 or Smad4 antibodies (31Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BF-1 under these conditions prevented the formation of the Smad-containing complex (Fig.3, lanes 2–4), whereas BF-1 by itself did not form a complex with this DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). These data, together with the fact that BF-1 overexpression does not alter Smad3 or Smad4 protein expression levels (data not shown), strongly indicate a direct inhibitory role of BF-1 on Smad-directed transcription. To further understand the molecular mechanism involved in the PAI promoter repression by BF-1, we investigated the functional interaction between BF-1 and Smad3 and/or Smad4. Overexpression of Smad4 in the presence of BF-1 was unable to restore TGF-β inducibility to the PAI promoter (data not shown). Overexpression of Smad3, however, titrated out the promoter repression by BF-1 (Fig.4 A), suggesting an inhibitory interaction between the two proteins. This interaction was first verified in vitro using a GST pull-down assay. Fig.4 B shows that 35S-labeled BF-1 (∼10% of the input protein) binds to GST-Smad3, GST-Smad4, and GST-Smad1 but not to the control GST protein. Additional evidence for an interaction of BF-1 with the Smad3 proteinin vivo is shown in Fig. 4 C. When expressed separately in COS cells and in the absence of TGF-β, both BF-1 and Smad3 display nonoverlapping intracellular localizations. Smad3 is cytoplasmic (6Attisano L. Wrana J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) as described previously (39Li J. Chang H. Lai E. Parker E. Vogt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar), whereas BF-1 is exclusively nuclear (Fig. 4 C, 1 and 2, respectively). When expressed together and in the absence of TGF-β, however, both proteins co-localize in the cytoplasmic compartment, suggesting cytoplasmic retention of BF-1 by unphosphorylated Smad3 (Fig. 4 C, 3, 4, and 5). Moreover, activation of the TGF-β pathway by co-expressing the constitutively active Tβ-RI-T204D type I receptor triggers nuclear translocation of both BF-1 and Smad3 (Fig. 4 C, 6,7, and 8). A similar interaction was observed when Smad1 and BF-1 were co-expressed (data not shown). Importantly, expression of BF-1 did not affect the level of expression of Smad1 or Smad3, and vice versa (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that BF-1 interacts with both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Smad3. BF-1 also binds to Smad2 and Smad4 via its C-terminal domain as shown in the experiments depicted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 A shows that in vitro translated and35S-labeled full-length mBF-1 binds to GST-Smad2 (lane 1). Further, deletion mutants of BF-1 lacking the N-terminal domain or the N-terminal domain and the wing-helix domain (amino acids 1–273) still retain the ability to bind GST-Smad2. However, deletion mutants lacking the C-terminal domain were not retained on a GST-Smad2 column. Together, these results indicate that the C-terminal domain of BF-1 is uniquely responsible for the interaction of BF-1 with Smad2. All Smad proteins contain two functionally different domains. The MH1 domain in Smad1, -3, -4, and -5 (but not Smad2) is involved in DNA binding, whereas the C-terminal MH2 domain participates in homotypic or heterotypic interactions with other proteins. To assess which domain of the Smad proteins is involved in the interaction with BF-1, we used GST fusion proteins of the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad2 and Smad4. Fig.5 B shows that the MH2 domains but not the MH1 domains of both Smad2 and Smad4 associate with in vitro translated and35S-labeled full-length mBF-1. Thus the MH2 domain accounts for the interaction of Smad proteins with BF-1. The recent discovery of various proteins that inhibit Smad3 activity has revealed new aspects of the negative regulation of the TGF-β pathway (19Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F.

Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Some of these negative regulators take advantage of classical mechanisms of transcriptional repression in mammalian cells such as attraction of histone deacetylase to the basic transcriptional machinery or interference with the interaction of the Smad complex with the basic transcriptional machinery (6Attisano L. Wrana J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The discovery of the c-ski proto-oncogene as an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling provides an example of a protein that binds to phosphorylated Smad3 and inhibits Smad3-driven transcription without disrupting Smad3 DNA binding (19Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The BF-1 inhibitory mechanism, however, differs in that it abrogates the ability of Smad3 to bind to DNA. A similar mechanism has been reported for the Evi-1 oncoprotein, a zinc finger transcription factor originally described in several chromosomal translocations causing leukemia (18Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Much like BF-1, Evi-1 interacts with phosphorylated Smad3, thus preventing its binding to its consensus DNA binding sequence. However, unlike BF-1, Evi-1 does not interact with cytoplasmic Smad3. Dou et al. (23Dou C. Lee J. Liu B. Liu F. Massague J. Xuan S. Lai E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6201-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) recently reported that BF-1 is a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β signaling but maintain that the mechanism of inhibition is different from the one we describe here. They demonstrated an interaction between BF-1 and the forkhead transcriptional coactivator FAST-2 and argued that this interaction underlies transcriptional inhibition by BF-1 on TGF-β/Smad activation of the PAI promoter. They could not demonstrate an interaction between BF-1 and any of the Smad proteins but did show that the BF-1 wing-helix domain, which is normally involved in productive protein-protein interactions as well as in DNA binding (39Li J. Chang H. Lai E. Parker E. Vogt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tao W. Lai E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), is responsible for the interaction with FAST-2. However, this paper did not contain direct evidence showing that the BF-1/FAST-2 interaction mediates transcriptional repression. In our work we could demonstrate a specific and direct molecular association between BF-1 and several Smad proteins and show that this association involves the Smad MH2 domains and the BF-1 C-terminal domain. These domains are normally responsible for the transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression activities of these proteins, respectively. In addition, our results show that increasing amounts of Smad3 cDNA can efficiently titrate the transcriptional repression by BF-1 (Fig. 4 A). Thus, our results strongly support the notion that specific silencing of the PAI promoter is caused by the inhibition of Smad transcriptional activity by binding to the C-terminal domain of BF-1. However, our studies do not exclude a possible role for an interaction of BF-1 with FAST-2 in transcriptional repression. BF-1 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a so-called forkhead domain. BF-1 mRNA is almost exclusively expressed in the developing brain hemispheres (40Tao W. Lai E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, its role in forebrain formation has been well established, because a BF-1 knockout mouse shows a near complete absence of frontal hemispheres (41Xuan S. Baptista C.A. Balas G. Tao W. Soares V.C. Lai E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1141-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Our results open the intriguing possibility that BF-1 is a repressor of TGF-β signaling during embryonic brain development. Interestingly, neuralization is thought to result from the inhibition of BMP4, a member of the TGF-β superfamily. BMP4 is an epidermal inducer that, in an animal cap assay, inhibits the expression of brain markers. Moreover, the local expression of proteins that inhibit the binding of BMP4 to its receptors is essential for neuralization (42Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Melton D. Cell. 1997; 88: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). BMP4 receptors use Smad1 as an intracellular signaling intermediate (43Piek E. Heldin C. Ten D.P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Thus, considering our data showing interaction between BF-1 and Smad1, it would not be surprising if repression of signaling by BMP4 (or that of another TGF-β homologue) could also occur in vivo during embryonic brain development. The latter would represent an additional and novel mechanism modulating TGF-β signaling during brain development. Further evidence supporting a general role for members of the forkhead family in TGF-β signaling comes from early studies on FAST-1, a forkhead transcription factor homologous to BF-1. During earlyXenopus embryo development, FAST-1 cooperates with the Smad2-Smad4 complex in the transcriptional activation of activin-responsive promoters (44Chen X. Rubock M. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and interacts with Smad2 in vitro and in vivo (45Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesize that either abortive (BF-1-Smad3/BF-1-Smad1) or productive (FAST-1-Smad2) interactions of members of the forkhead family of transcription factors with different Smad proteins could represent a general regulatory mechanism of TGF-β signaling during embryonic development. The viral oncogene v-qin is an N-terminal deletion mutant of the avian BF-1 gene (46Li J. Chang H.W. Lai E. Parker E.J. Vogt P.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar). Much likev-qin, BF-1 is able to induce fibroblast transformation. Both proteins are transcriptional repressors, and this activity is required for cell transformation (47Li J. Thurm H. Chang H.W. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10885-10888Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,48Chang H.W. Li J. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 441-444PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which BF-1 represses transcription of certain promoters is fairly well understood. The presence of a specific BF-1 DNA binding sequence in target promoters (BF-1 response element) as well as an intact C-terminal region in the BF-1 protein are required for BF-1 to repress transcription (46Li J. Chang H.W. Lai E. Parker E.J. Vogt P.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the finding that a chimeric protein containing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the transcriptional repressor domain of BF-1 blocks transcription from a minimal promoter containing a Gal4 binding site (46Li J. Chang H.W. Lai E. Parker E.J. Vogt P.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5540-5544PubMed Google Scholar). Also in support or our results, deletion of 48 amino acids from the C terminus of the v-Qin protein (347), a stretch included in the region involved in binding to Smads, completely abolishes transforming activity (48Chang H.W. Li J. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 441-444PubMed Google Scholar). However, for two reasons we believe that in the case of the PAI promoter as well as in the p15 and Cyclin A cell cycle promoters used in this study, repression by BF-1 does not involve direct binding to DNA: 1) sequence analysis of these promoters did not reveal BF-1 response elements or BF-1 response element-like sequences that would allow BF-1 binding to those promoters, and 2) neither overexpressed (Fig. 3) nor in vitro translated BF-1 (data not shown) binds a short TβRE despite its ability to repress transcription driven by the same element (Fig. 2 A). Whether or not the BF-1 C-terminal repression domain is also involved in interacting with Smad3, our results suggest that transcriptional repression of Smad3 by BF-1 is likely mediated by a protein-protein sequestration mechanism. BF-1 overexpression also represses the transcription of cell cycle genes that do not usually respond to TGF-β, like the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (data not shown). In this context, repression of Smad3-driven transcription might contribute to the overall oncogenic effect of the BF-1 protein. In addition to promoting unrestricted G1-S transition, repression of TGF-β-stimulated transcription might also play a specific developmental role in brain induction by BF-1. In summary, using a functional expression cloning system, we have identified a specific interaction between two unrelated classes of transcription factors, the proto-oncogene BF-1 and the Smad proteins, specifically Smad1, -2, -3, and -4. We have shown that overexpression of BF-1 can suppress Smad3 binding to DNA and, consequently, its transactivating activity. Suppression of TGF-β signaling provides a molecular mechanism for BF-1 oncogenic potential and suggests a role for TGF-β or BMP inhibition in brain development.

Conversely, microglial cells have been shown to withstand this cytotoxic action of free radicals. Here we revealed an intracellular mechanism that apparently enables microglial cells to cope with such oxidative challenges.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Enhanced protein degradation in activated BV-2 microglial cellsIn a first set of experiments, the intracellular degradation of metabolically radiolabeled endogenous proteins was measured in cellular or nuclear lysates of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) -treated vs. resting BV-2 microglial cells in a period of up to 24 h. TNF-α release in the course of neuroinflammation is known to induce an activated/amoeboid state of BV-2 microglial cells.

Although these data provide strong evidence to support a direct role of Bcr-Abl in leukemogenesis, it remains unclear how the oncogenic activation of a single proto-oncogene induces malignancy in vivo with comprehensive changes in hematopoietic cell growth, differentiation, and homing.

Bcr-Abl proteins contain multiple domains important in interactions with other cellular proteins involved in the regulation of mitogenic and apoptotic pathways (2Gotoh A. Broxmeyer H.E. Curr. Opin.

They also contain domains and motifs capable of binding to cytoskeleton proteins as well as the proteins involved in regulation of cell adhesion and migration (13McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.

Previously we and others identified Abl interactor (Abi) proteins that bind to both the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and the C-terminal proline-rich regions of Abl kinase through dual SH3-PXXP interactions (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Two highly related genes, abi-1 and abi-2, were cloned. The corresponding protein products share overall 69% identity with the greatest homology observed in the N-terminal homeobox-like domain, proline-rich sequences, and the C-terminal SH3 domain (17Dai Z.

In addition to the interaction with Abl kinase, Abi proteins also interact with other signaling molecules such as the Abl-related gene product Arg (19Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Krainc D. Jensen R.A. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1921-1929PubMed Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor substrate Eps8 (20Biesova Z. Piccoli C. Wong W.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the cytoskeleton protein spectrin (21Ziemnicka-Kotula D. Xu J. Gu H. Potempska A. Kim K.S. Jenkins E.C. Trenkner E. Kotula L.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7591-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the function of Abi, recent studies suggested a role of Abi in the regulation of signal transduction mediated by small GTP-binding proteins. Abi-1 (also known as e3b1) forms a tricomplex with Eps8 and Sos-1 in vivo and regulates Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor activities in vitro (22Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that Abi-1 is an important player in the transduction of signals from Ras to Rac, a pathway important in the regulation of cytoskeletal function. Consistent with this proposal, microinjection of fibroblasts with anti-Abi-1 antibodies resulted in abrogation of Rac-dependent membrane ruffling in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation (22Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The involvement of Abi proteins in signaling mediated by the wild type and oncogenic forms of Abl kinases is suggested by several lines of evidence. Abi proteins bind to c-Abl and are substrates of the Abl kinases (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Abi-1 potently suppresses the transforming activity of viral Abl (v-Abl) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts by inhibiting the v-Abl-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (18Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Fan P.D. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7591-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More recently we reported that Bcr-Abl elicits the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Abi-2 (24Dai Z. Quackenbush R.C. Courtney K.D. Grove M.G. Cortez D. Reuther G.W. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Significantly, the expression of Abi-2 is lost in cell lines and bone marrow cells isolated from patients with aggressive Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia (24Dai Z. Quackenbush R.C. Courtney K.D. Grove M.G. Cortez D. Reuther G.W. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a hypothesis that the loss of Abi-2 may play a role in the progression of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias. To test this hypothesis, we mapped the sequences in Bcr-Abl that are required for its interaction with Abi-2. This enabled the generation of mutant forms of Bcr-Abl defective in binding to Abi-2 and therefore allowed the evaluation of the effects of the mutations on Bcr-Abl-induced cellular transformation and leukemogenesis. In this report we show that the deletion of the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences in Bcr-Abl not only abrogates its interaction with Abi-2 but also prevents Abi-2 degradation, prevents spontaneous cell migration on a fibronectin-coated surface, and impairs leukemogenesis.

To generate retroviral vectors expressing p185ΔC and p185ΔSH3ΔC, pGEMp185Bcr-Abl and pGEMp185Δ414–519 were digested with AatII, which released 5′ cDNA sequences encoding amino acids 1–819 of p185Bcr-Abl or amino acids 1–714 of p185Δ414–519, respectively. The purified cDNA fragments were ligated to pGEMAblΔSH3Δ544–637 (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) at theAatII site to replace 5′ sequences of Abl. The resulting plasmids, designated pGEMp185ΔC and pGEMp185ΔSH3ΔC, respectively, were digested withEcoRI, which released the cDNA fragments encoding p185ΔC and p185ΔSH3ΔC. The released cDNA fragments were purified and ligated to MIGR1 and MSCV at theEcoRI site. The retroviral packaging cell lines GP+E-86 and Bosc 23, kindly provided by Drs. A. Bank (Columbia University, New York, NY) and W. S. Pear (University of Pennsylvania), respectively, were used to generate retroviral stocks as described previously (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). The retroviral stocks were stored at −80 °C until use. To determine the titers of retroviral supernatants, a serial dilution was made and used to transduce NIH3T3 cells as described previously (27Yan X.Q. Lacey D. Fletcher F. Hartley C. McElroy P. Sun Y. Xia M. Mu S. Saris C. Hill D. Hawley R.G. McNiece I.K. Blood. 1995; 86: 4025-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 days of selection with G418, the stable transfectants were counted, and titers were calculated. Stable mass populations of BaF3 cells expressing wild type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl were generated by retroviral transduction as described previously (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Retroviral transduction of mouse bone marrow cells was performed as described previously (27Yan X.Q. Lacey D. Fletcher F. Hartley C. McElroy P. Sun Y. Xia M. Mu S. Saris C. Hill D. Hawley R.G. McNiece I.K. Blood. 1995; 86: 4025-4033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 8–12-week-old male (C57BL/6J × DBA/2J) F1 (BDF1) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were treated with 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg of body weight) 4 days prior to marrow harvest. Marrow cells were incubated with retroviral supernatants (6 × 105 cells/ml) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 6 µg/ml Polybrene, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 ng/ml IL-3 (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), 100 ng/ml IL-6, 100 ng/ml IL-11, and 100 ng/ml recombinant rat stem cell factor at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 days. The retroviral supernatants were replaced daily with fresh supernatants. The transduced BM cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were injected into lethally irradiated (9.5 grays) syngeneic female mice (6–8 weeks old) through the tail vein at 4 × 105 cells/mouse. Double layer agar cultures in 35-mm dishes were established as described previously (28Bradley T. Hodgson G. Rosendaal M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 517-522Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The minimum essential medium α medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum was used for all cultures. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 14 days after which colonies containing greater than 50 cells were scored using a dissecting microscope. Two weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice were monitored for disease development. Mouse peripheral blood samples were obtained under anesthesia by retro-orbital puncture. A differential count of white blood cells (WBCs) was performed using the Advia 120 Hematology System (Bayer Inc., Tarrytown, NY) with veterinary software for analysis of mouse blood. Disease development was judged by elevated WBCs as well as symptoms such as abnormal gait and labored breathing. Moribund animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and were examined for tumors or other visible abnormalities. Collection of spleens, livers, and bone marrow cells was performed immediately after sacrifice. All protocols used were approved by institutional review committees at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. As described previously (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), anti-Abi-2 antibody was raised to a recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Abi-2Δ1–100 fusion protein. The antibody was affinity-purified by a standard technique (29Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 74-76Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as described previously (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) using anti-Abi-2 antibody, 8E9 anti-abl monoclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and mixtures of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), PY69 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA) as indicated in the text. Bosc 23 cells were transiently transfected with MSCV, MSCVp185wt, MSCVp185ΔSH3, MSCVp185ΔC, and MSCVp185ΔSH3ΔC. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed and incubated with GST or GST-Abi-2 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-Abl antibody, and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The spontaneous cell migration assay was performed as described previously (30Uemura N. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37525-37532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The inserts of Transwell plates (0.33-cm2 growth area, 8-µm pores; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were coated with human fibronectin (Sigma Chemical Co.). The bottom chambers of the Transwell plates contained 600 µl of RPMI medium plus 1% bovine serum albumin. The BaF3 cells transduced with MIGR1 vector or MIGR1 containing cDNAs for wild type and mutant forms of Bcr-Abl were starved in RPMI medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 6 h. The cells were resuspended in RPMI medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One hundred microliters of cells were added into the inserts and allowed to migrate into the bottom chambers for 6–8 h. c-Abl binds to Abi proteins through dual SH3-PXXP interactions (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine whether the direct interaction is required for Bcr-Abl to induce Abi-2 degradation, retroviral vectors containing cDNAs for wild type (p185wt) and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl with deletions in the SH3 domain (p185ΔSH3), C-terminal proline-rich sequences (p185ΔC), or both SH3 and C-terminal proline-rich regions (p185ΔSH3ΔC) were generated (Fig.1 A). The abilities of these wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl to bind to Abi-2 were tested by an in vitro binding assay. The p185wt bound to Abi-2 because it was detected in GST-Abi-2 precipitates by anti-Abl Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B,lane 6). In addition to full-length p185wt, proteins with faster mobility were also detected by the anti-Abl antibody in GST-Abi-2 precipitates. These are likely the truncated forms of Bcr-Abl that underwent degradation during incubation because they were also detectable in immunoprecipitates by anti-Abl antibody (data not shown). The deletion of the SH3 domain did not affect binding of p185ΔSH3 to Abi-2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 9). The deletion of the C-terminal proline-rich sequences reduced, but did not abrogate, binding of p185ΔC to Abi-2 (Fig.1 B, lane 12). In contrast, deletion of both the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences completely abolished the interaction between p185ΔSH3ΔC and Abi-2 (Fig.1 B, lane 15). These wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Ablwere then introduced into the murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 by retroviral transduction and tested for their abilities to induce Abi-2 degradation. BaF3 cells express Abi-2 that migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a major doublet and minor bands with apparent molecular masses of 60, 65, and 70 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 C, lane 1). The two bands with slower mobility are a reflection of the phosphorylation (31Courtney K.D. Grove M. Vandongen H. Vandongen A. LaMantia A.S. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As reported previously (24Dai Z. Quackenbush R.C. Courtney K.D. Grove M.G. Cortez D. Reuther G.W. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), expression of p185wt in BaF3 cells induced degradation of Abi-2 (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). In correlation with their binding capacities, p185ΔCexhibited reduced ability to induce Abi-2 degradation (Fig.1 C, lane 4), whereas p18ΔSH3ΔCwas completely deficient in inducing Abi-2 degradation (Fig.2 C, lane 5). Similar results were observed in another murine hematopoietic cell line 32D (data not shown). The deletion of the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences does not affect the tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant forms of Bcr-Abl. This was demonstrated by the assessment of the protein tyrosine phosphorylation in BaF3 cells expressing the wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl. As would be expected, the wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl were all tyrosine-phosphorylated and were able to stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in BaF3 cells (Fig. 2 A). The C-terminal proline-rich sequences deleted in p185ΔCand p185ΔSH3ΔC also contain a binding site for the adapter proteins Crk and Crkl (16Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In particular, Crkl is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Bcr-Abl transformation and is believed to link Bcr-Abl to multiple downstream molecules (16Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One of the molecules that associates with Crkl and Bcr-Abl is c-Cbl, a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells (15Bhat A. Kolibaba K. Oda T. Ohno-Jones S. Heaney C. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16170-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Sattler M. Salgia R. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the deletion of the C-terminal proline-rich sequences in Bcr-Abl affects the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl and c-Cbl. Crkl and c-Cbl were not tyrosine-phosphorylated in control BaF3 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl and c-Cbl was readily detected in BaF3 cells transformed by wild type as well as mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–5). To determine whether the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences are required for Bcr-Abl to stimulate cell proliferation and survival, the mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl were tested for their abilities to transform BaF3 cells. Normal BaF3 cells require IL-3 for their proliferation and survival (17Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Cortez D. Stoica G. Pierce J.H. Pendergast A.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2589-2594PubMed Google Scholar), whereas cells expressing p185wt were transformed and were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 3 A). The deletions of the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich sequences in p185Bcr-Abl did not affect its ability to stimulate cell proliferation and survival because all three mutants, p185ΔSH3, p185ΔC, and p185ΔSH3ΔC, were capable of transforming BaF3 cells to IL-3 independence (Fig. 3 A). Because hematopoietic stem cells are thought to be primary natural targets of Bcr-Abl, we tested if the deletions of the SH3 domain and proline-rich regions in Bcr-Abl affect its ability to transform mouse BM cells enriched for hematopoietic stem cells by 5-fluorouracil treatment. An in vitro soft agar assay (28Bradley T. Hodgson G. Rosendaal M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 517-522Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was performed to evaluate the colony-forming ability of the BM cells transduced with control retrovirus or retroviruses expressing the wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl. In vitro growth of BM cells requires a mixture of growth factors for optimal colony formation. Normal BM cells and the BM cells transduced with control retrovirus did not form colonies in agar culture in the absence of growth factors. In contrast, the BM cells transduced with wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl formed colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3 B). It appeared that the p185ΔC and p185ΔSH3ΔC were more potent in transforming BM cells because their expression in BM cells induced 3- and 2-fold increases, respectively, in colony formation compared with p185wt and p185ΔSH3. It was reported that the expression of Bcr-Abl in BaF3 cells stimulated spontaneous cell migration on fibronectin-coated surface (11Salgia R. Li J.L. Ewaniuk D.S. Pear W. Pisick E. Burky S.A. Ernst T. Sattler M. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SH3 domain and C-terminal proline-rich regions of Bcr-Abl are required for this signaling pathway, we performed the Transwell cell migration assay (28Bradley T. Hodgson G. Rosendaal M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 517-522Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The spontaneous migration on fibronectin-coated membranes was examined in BaF3 cells expressing wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl. Consistent with the previous report (11Salgia R. Li J.L. Ewaniuk D.S. Pear W. Pisick E. Burky S.A. Ernst T. Sattler M. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a 3.6-fold increase in spontaneous migration on fibronectin-coated membrane was observed in cells expressing p185wt compared with that in control cells (Fig.4). The expression of p185ΔSH3 and p185ΔC also stimulated spontaneous migration but to a lesser extent compared with control cells. In contrast, no significant increase of spontaneous migration was observed in BaF3 cells expressing p185ΔSH3ΔC (Fig.4) compared with control cells. The findings that p185ΔSH3ΔC is defective in inducing Abi-2 degradation and stimulating spontaneous cell migration prompted us to ask if these defects affect its leukemogenic activity in vivo. This was tested by performing bone marrow transplantation studies in mice. BM cells from 5-fluorouracil-treated donor mice were transduced with either control retrovirus or retroviruses containing cDNAs for wild type and mutant forms of p185Bcr-Abl. To ensure that comparable transduction efficiencies were achieved with the different retroviruses, retroviral supernatants with approximately equivalent titers were used. The levels of wild type and mutant p185Bcr-Abl proteins expressed in transduced BM cells were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–5). The transduced BM cells were then transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice. Consistent with previous reports (6Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C.

The CLK-1 protein is mitochondrial and is required for ubiquinone biosynthesis in yeast and in worms, but its biochemical function remains unclear. We have studied the expression of murinemclk1 in a variety of tissues, and we find that the pattern of mclk1 mRNA accumulation closely resembles that of mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The pattern of protein accumulation, however, is sharply distinct in some tissues; mCLK1 appears relatively enriched in the gut and depleted in the nervous tissue. We also show that mCLK1 is synthesized as a preprotein that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where a leader sequence is cleaved off and the protein becomes loosely associated with the inner membrane. However, in contrast to all known mitochondrial proteins that contain a cleavable pre-sequence, the import of mCLK1 does not require a mitochondrial membrane potential. clk-1 has been identified and characterized in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a gene that affects the rates, regularity, and synchrony of physiological processes.

Cell Differ. 2000; 29: 81-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As the normal action of genes that have been identified in this organism limits life span in the wild type, studying these genes may help to understand the mechanisms that determine aging. Mutations in the clk genes result in the complex deregulation of the timing of a number of physiological features (3Hekimi S. Boutis P. Lakowski B. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1351-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In clk-1 mutants, the affected features include the cell cycle, embryonic and post-embryonic development, rhythmic behaviors, reproduction, and life span, all of which are lengthened or slowed down on average (5Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these features, however, including those measured in adults such as behavior and life span, appear phenotypically wild type when a homozygous mutant animal is derived from a mother carrying a wild type allele. This maternal rescue is surprising given that adults are up to 1000 times larger than the egg, and it has been suggested that the clk genes could induce an epigenetic state during early development that is maintained throughout the life of the animal (6Branicky R. Benard C. Hekimi S. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). C. elegans clk-1 encodes a protein of 187 residues that is highly conserved among eukaryotes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and vertebrates (7Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, a highly similar protein is also found in α-proteobacteria and related forms, which are believed to be the closest living relatives of mitochondria (2Hekimi S. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 29: 81-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A. Andersson J.O. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Alsmark U.C. Podowski R.M. Naslund A.K. Eriksson A.S.

Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and coq7 (10Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TheCAT5/COQ7 gene is required for the synthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), a lipid molecule that transports electrons in the respiratory chain of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (11Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutations in this gene also affect catabolite repression and de-repression, the complex genetic system that regulates the utilization of sugars, most of metabolism, as well as mitochondrial and peroxisomal biogenesis (12Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of coq7 on catabolite regulation has, however, been interpreted as resulting indirectly from the absence of ubiquinone (11Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As coq7 mutants do not respire, they cannot grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. This phenotype in yeast can be complemented by both the rat (13Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Kim L. Chin A. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and worm (7Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) genes, indicating that, although the exact biochemical activity of CLK-1/Coq7p remains elusive, the function of these proteins is evolutionarily conserved. Ubiquinone biosynthesis is also affected in clk-1 mutant worms (14Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We found a complete absence of ubiquinone in the mitochondria of all clk-1 mutants. Instead, these animals accumulate a biosynthetic intermediate of ubiquinone biosynthesis, demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ).1Furthermore, we found that DMQ is capable of functionally replacing ubiquinone as a mobile electron carrier in the respiratory chain. These findings explain previous observations that the maximal activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes assayed in intact mitochondria isolated from clk-1 mutants are not significantly affected and that ATP levels are normal (16Felkai S. Ewbank J.J. Lemieux J. Labbe J.C. Brown G.G. Hekimi S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. De Vreese A. Vanfleteren J.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 493-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are no differences between the three clk-1 alleles (e2519, qm30, and qm51) in terms of their ubiquinone phenotype; no ubiquinone is detected, and they accumulated similar levels of DMQ (14Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7713-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the physiological phenotypes associated with e2519 in living worms are much milder than those of the two null alleles, qm30 andqm51 (5Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the absence of ubiquinone is not the primary cause of the phenotypes observed in living worms. The exact biochemical activity of CLK-1 and the mechanisms by which it affects ubiquinone biosynthesis and physiological rates in worms remain unknown. Here we have studied the expression of the mouse homologue ofclk-1 (mclk1) in mouse tissues and in cultured cells. We find that the mCLK1 protein is mitochondrial in mammals but that the pattern of expression of mclk1 is unusual for a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein, as there appears to be a decoupling of mRNA and protein accumulation in some tissues. We also find that mCLK1 is imported into the mitochondrial matrix as a preprotein with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. In contrast to Coq7p, which has been reported to be an integral membrane protein in yeast, we find that mature mCLK1 is only loosely associated with the inner membrane. Most surprisingly, we find that the import of mCLK1 into mitochondria does not require a membrane potential (ΔΨ). Furthermore, this property is conferred by sequences that are retained in the mature protein, as heterologous pre-sequences from proteins that do require ΔΨ are sufficient for ΔΨ-independent import of mCLK1. To our knowledge, this is the only known case of presequence-dependent but ΔΨ-independent import. We discuss the possible implication of these unusual features for the biological function of mclk1. COS7 cells from ATCC were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to construct plasmids expressing mCLK1 starting either from the first or second ATG (pmclk1, Δ-pmclk1). Specific primer pairs were used in each PCR as follows: SHP1504/1507 for pmclk1 and SHP1509/1507 for Δ-pmclk1. Mega-primer PCR (18Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was used for construction of the plasmid (OCT:CLK-1) expressing the rat OCT leader sequence with the mature part of mouse mCLK1 using primers SHP1568,1570,1571,1507, and for plasmid (mCLK1:DHFR) expressing the mouse mCLK1 leader sequence with DHFR, using primers SHP 1504,1626,1625,1622. The plasmid pBluesript-CLK-1 or psp64-PODHFR (expressing the OCT leader and DHFR) was used as a template. PCR products were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5/TOPO or pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of primers is available upon request. COS7 cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture dishes containing a cover glass and transiently transfected with the plasmids pmclk1 and Δ-pmclk1 using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the coverslips were incubated for 30 min in growth medium containing Mitotracker (Red CMXRos) to stain mitochondria. To visualize mCLK1, the cells were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized in acetone for 3 min, and then incubated at room temperature with rabbit anti-mCLK1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000) for 1 h followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) for 1 h. Finally the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (10 µg/ml) for 30 min and viewed under a Leitz fluorescence microscope. Tissues were collected from 3-month-old and 21-day-old Balb/c mice. Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA (10 µg) was fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel prior to blotting on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length mouse mclk1cDNA was used as a probe. Probes for voltage-dependent anion channel isoform (mvdac6) and cytochrome coxidase subunit I were isolated from IMAGE Consortium cDNA clonesAI430965 and AI196228, respectively (Genome Systems, Inc). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 65 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS. Blots were then washed for 20 min each, twice with 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then twice with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. A 537-base pair fragment encoding a part of mCLK1 was generated by PCR (Mexp-1, GCGACCCTCGAGATGACCTTAGACAATATTAACCGGGC, and Mexp-2, CGCGGGATCCCTAAAACCTTTCTGATAAATATATGG). This fragment was cloned behind the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter in the BamHI-NdeI sites of the pET16b expression vector (Novagen). This creates an mCLK1 fusion protein with 10 histidine residues at its N terminus. The protein was overexpression in the E. coli BL12(DE3) strain and purified by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA- agarose and injected into New Zealand White rabbits with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Tissues collected from a 3-month-old Balb/c mouse were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and 1.5% lauryl maltoside. After 30 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,600 × g, and the supernatants were saved. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad), with reference to bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts (10 µg) of protein were separated on a 13% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted on a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with antibodies (anti-mCLK1 rabbit serum MG15, dilution 1:1000). Bands were visualized using a chemifluorescence kit (ECF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome oxidase subunit I (1D6-E1-A8, Molecular Probes) and human porin 31HL (Calbiochem) were used as controls. Mitochondria from mouse heart and liver were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (19Steenaart N.A. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) except that the tissues were homogenized using a motor-driven glass-Teflon mortar and pestle for 10 strokes at 1000 rpm (heart) or at 500 rpm for 2–4 stokes (liver). To separate inner and outer mitochondrial membranes we used either digitonin or hypotonic swelling. Fresh liver mitochondria were treated with digitonin (1.2%) as described (20Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver mitochondria suspended in isolation medium (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 2.0 mm HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) were mixed with an equal volume of digitonin buffer (1.2%) at 0 °C for 15 min. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 1900 × g, and the first fraction containing mitoplasts and mitochondria with unbroken outer membranes was recovered. Finally, the outer membrane-rich fraction was recovered after centrifugation of the above supernatant at 35,000 ×g for 20 min. The final supernatant contained the intermembrane space. The different fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis. To separate the mitochondrial membranes by osmotic disruption, the outer membrane of fresh heart mitochondria was partially broken by hypotonic swelling in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.02% bovine serum albumin at 0 °C for 20 min (21Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1966; 137: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The mitoplasts and unbroken outer membrane fraction was first pelleted by centrifugation at 1900 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was sedimented by spinning at 35,000 × g for 20 min to recover outer membranes. The different fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis. To investigate the association of mCLK1 with the mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondria (50 µg of protein, Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay) were treated with sodium carbonate (22Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) or Triton X-114 (23Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described. Proteins (12.5 µg of mitochondrial protein) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred for 60 min onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were first incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mCLK1, rabbit anti-human 70-kDa subunit of complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) (0.1 µg/ml, a kind gift of Dr. R. Capaldi, University of Oregon), mouse anti-porin or mouse anti-COX1, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature followed by another incubation with corresponding second antibody goat against rabbit IgG or mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature, and the specific bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precursor proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and the relevant construct in the presence of [35S]methionine. The mitochondrial import assay was performed as described (19Steenaart N.A. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) except that mitochondria for the import assay were isolated from mouse heart or liver. Each import reaction contained 25 µg of mitochondrial protein (1 µg/µl in cMRM, 0.25 sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm sodium succinate, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 10% (v/v) in vitrotranslation products and 20 µl of import buffer KMH (10 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgOAc) in a total volume of 50 µl. The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 1 µm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or 1 µmvalinomycin. In a series of control experiments not shown, concentrations of CCCP up to 50 µm were also used, with identical results. To test the protease resistance of the imported protein, part of post-import reaction mixture was incubated with different concentrations of proteinase K at 0 °C for 20 min followed by another incubation with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0 °C for 20 min. To confirm the processed mCLK1 protein was inside mitochondria following the import reaction and that the protein was protease-sensitive, mitochondria were disrupted with 1% Nonidet P-40 before digestion with proteinase K in some experiments. The mitochondrial fraction was isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and all samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The imported proteins were analyzed by fluorography, and the endogenous markers were analyzed by immunoblotting. To determine whether mCLK1 protein imported with or without a membrane potential behaved like endogenous mCLK1, and to rule out an effect of the import assay itself on the behavior of mCLK1, the sensitivity of mCLK1 to protease digestion was compared with that of COX1 and porin in mitochondria that had or had not been used in the in vitro import assay. To test whether imported mCLK1 was targeted to a peripheral position on the inner mitochondrial membrane, mitochondria re-isolated after in vitro import were extracted with 0.1 n sodium carbonate as above and analyzed by Western blot analysis. The mclk1cDNA has an open reading frame coding for a protein of 217 amino acids with calculated molecular mass of 24,044 Da (Fig.1 A). The starting methionine is followed by a sequence that resembles a classical N-terminal targeting sequence for mitochondrial import. The similarity between the mammalian protein and any of its homologues starts only after a second ATG, which is 39 amino acids downstream in the predicted protein (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, both possible mammalian proteins are predicted to be imported into the mitochondria by two different prediction programs (MitoProt, www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter, and Psort II, psort.nibb.ac.jp/). By using an antiserum raised against mCLK1 (see “Materials and Methods”), we find that mCLK1 co-fractionates with mitochondria from mouse liver (Fig. 1 B). We used Northern analysis to quantify the expression of mclk1, and we compared the pattern of expression to that of two genes coding for mitochondrial proteins as follows: mvdac6 that codes for porin, a protein of the outer membrane that provides a good measure of the abundance of mitochondria in a given tissue; and cox1, a subunit of the respiratory complex IV that is encoded by the mitochondrial genome and should give a good measure of the capacity for oxidative phosphorylation in a given tissue (Fig.2 A). mclk1 mRNA was detected in all tissues analyzed in adult mice as a single molecular species of ∼0.9 kilobase pairs. The highest levels were present in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and nervous system, whereas lower levels of mclk1 mRNA were found in liver and gut. mclk-1 mRNA was also detected in mouse ES cells and in embryos at E7, E11, E15, and E17 (data not shown). The pattern ofmclk1 in adult mouse tissues was most similar to that ofcox1. In contrast, Western blot analysis showed that the pattern of accumulation of mCLK1 protein in mitochondria was distinct from those of both porin and COX1 (Fig. 2 B). Relative to other tissues, mCLK1 appears substantially more abundant in the gut and much less abundant in the nervous system (cerebellum). This suggests that some of the differences in the abundance of mCLK1 between tissues is the result of post-transcriptional mechanisms. It furthermore suggests that the function of mCLK1 in a given tissue is not stoichiometrically linked to either the intensity of respiration or the abundance of mitochondria per se. To identify thebona fide initiator codon of mclk1, two plasmids (pmclk1 and Δ-pmclk1), capable of expressing proteins starting at the first or second ATG of the open reading frame (see “Materials and Methods”), were constructed and transiently expressed in COS7 cells. The transfected COS7 cells were also examined by immunocytochemistry. They were first labeled with Mitotracker Red CMXRos, a dye that is specifically taken up by mitochondria, and then immunostained with anti-mCLK1 antiserum. Punctate immunofluorescence in the cells expressing pmclk1 (Fig.3 a) completely overlaps with the Mitotracker fluorescence (Fig. 3, b and c). On the other hand, cells that express Δ-pmclk1 display specific fluorescence throughout the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3,d–f), not specifically located in mitochondria. These observations indicate that the first in-frame ATG is the predominant initiator codon in vivo. To determine the submitochondrial location of mCLK1, purified mitochondria were treated with the detergent Triton X-114 (Fig. 4 B) or alkaline Na2CO3 (Fig. 4 C). After phase separation in Triton X-114, amphiphilic proteins are partitioned into the detergent phase, and hydrophilic proteins are partitioned into the aqueous phase. mCLK1 appears to be an amphiphilic protein since it partitions into the detergent phase in a manner similar to porin, a known amphiphilic protein (Fig. 4 B). The behavior of mCLK1 is different from that of succinate dehydrogenase (70-kDa subunit), an enzyme known to be found in both the detergent and aqueous fractions (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, mCLK1 can be extracted by Na2CO3 and is only detected in the supernatant fraction after Na2CO3 treatment, indicating the mCLK1 is a peripheral membrane protein and not an integral membrane protein as are porin or COX1 (Fig. 4 C). mCLK1 behaves like succinate dehydrogenase in being easily separated from the membrane by Na2CO3. To localize mCLK1 further, purified mitochondria were treated with digitonin to partially break the outer membrane (Fig. 4 A). The mCLK1 is entirely absent in a fraction enriched in outer membrane but is present in a fraction containing mitoplasts. Although the mitoplast fraction is contaminated with some outer membrane (as it contains porin), the pattern of fractionation of mCLK1 is identical to that of COX1, an inner membrane protein. To determine whether mCLK1 is associated with the inner or the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, mitochondria were incubated with different concentrations of proteinase K (Fig.5, A and B). The accessibility of the intermembrane space to the protease was assessed by measuring the resistance to digestion of COX1 (an integral inner membrane protein with several transmembrane segments linked by loops facing the intermembrane space). COX1 was accessible to protease digestion, even at relatively low concentrations of proteinase K, whereas mCLK1 remained fully protease-resistant even at the highest concentration of protease. Similar protection was observed for porin, which is fully embedded in the outer membrane, and thus protected. From these results, we conclude that mCLK1 is a peripheral membrane protein, located on the matrix side of the inner membrane. To analyze further the targeting and proteolytic processing of mCLK1, we performed in vitro mitochondrial import assays (Figs. 5 and 6). In vitro transcription and translation of an mclk1 cDNA using a reticulocyte lysate preparation directed the synthesis of a protein of about 24 kDa (see also “Materials and Methods”). Incubation of the translation products with freshly prepared energized mitochondria resulted in the appearance of a second protein band (of ∼20 kDa) in addition to the band corresponding to the precursor protein (Fig. 5 and Fig.6 A). The size of the processed protein suggests that an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (35 amino acids for mCLK1 as predicted by MitoProt II) has been removed. That the 20-kDa protein had been imported into the mitochondria was confirmed by digestion with proteinase K (Fig. 6 A). Even high concentrations of proteinase could not digest imported mCLK1 (Fig.5 A). However, this was not due to some unexpected resistance to digestion by mCLK1, as both in vitro translated and native mCLK1 are fully digested when membranes are disrupted with a detergent (Fig. 5 A). Surprisingly, the import and proteolytic processing of mCLK1 protein could not be inhibited by either CCCP or valinomycin (Fig. 5,A—D, and Fig. 6 A), two common uncouplers used to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). Concentrations of CCCP up to 50 µm were used without effect on the import (data not shown). The import of mCLK1, however, requires ATP, as import was inhibited when ATP was removed from the mitochondrial preparation by treatment with apyrase (data not shown). We performed a number of control experiment to determine that mCLK1 imported in vitro (with or without a membrane potential) was indeed behaving in a way that reflects the properties of native mCLK1. We first determined that the accessibility to digestion of different compartments of the mitochondria was not altered by the experimental protocol for in vitro import (Fig. 5 B). Anin vitro import experiment was performed, and half of the mitochondria were analyzed by autoradiography and half by Western blotting. The results were identical to those shown in Fig.5 A, with COX1 and the mCLK1 precursor accessible to protease, but porin and processed mCLK1 protected from digestion. Furthermore, these properties were unchanged in the presence or absence of CCCP. These findings indicate that when mCLK1 is imported in vitro without a membrane potential it is either fully embedded in a membrane or is located inside the mitochondrial inner membrane. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we extracted radiolabeled mCLK1 with sodium carbonate after in vitroimport (Fig. 5 C), a method that does not extract integral membrane proteins from the insoluble fraction. In vitroimported mCLK1 was solubilized by sodium carbonate whether imported in the presence of a membrane potential or not. As before we examined whether the properties of the mitochondrial membranes were altered by the in vitro import experimental conditions, and we found that native mCLK1, porin, and COX1 behaved as expected, that is mCLK1 is solubilized by sodium carbonate but porin and COX1 remain with the membrane fraction (Fig. 5 D). Taken together, these findings indicate that mCLK1 can be imported into mitochondria without requiring a membrane potential. Strikingly, there is no other example of a protein with an N-terminal processed leader sequence that is imported in this way. To characterize the signals in the mCLK1 precursor protein that contribute to the ΔΨ-independent import, two chimeric reporter genes (mclk1:dhfr andoct:mclk1), encoding in one case the presequence or mature mCLK1 combined with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and in the other case the well characterized leader sequence of pre-ornithine carbamyltransferase (OCT) upstream of the mature mCLK1 protein, were constructed and used in import assays (Fig. 6). As expected, the OCT leader is capable of mediating mitochondrial import of DHFR (oct:dhfr) but requires a membrane potential (Fig.6 C). The chimeric protein in which the OCT leader (32 amino acids) is followed by mCLK1 (amino acids 36–187 of the open reading frame) was also efficiently imported but could not be blocked by addition of either CCCP or valinomycin (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the mCLK1 leader did not support strong"

The adaptation of yeast to these conditions requires the induction of glycerol synthesis to restore turgor pressure and the modification of the plasma membrane transport systems to exclude Na+ ions from the cytosol (2Haro R.

However, components regulating cytosolic Ca2+ ion level are not clear under high salt stress.To study the components associated with salt adaptation mechanisms under high salt stress, we isolated several salt-tolerant mutations by using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)1 treatment. One of the mutations was mapped in the PMR1 gene, which encodes a P-type Ca2+-ATPase mainly located to the Golgi apparatus (5Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J.

The highly maintained cytosolic Ca2+level in turn results in enhanced expression of PMR2 via calcineurin.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that pmr1 mutants displayed hypersensitivity to the growth toxicity of millimolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+ (21Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the hypersensitive phenotype of the pmr1 mutant to 0.2 mm MnCl2 was observed (Fig. 2 A). Elevated cytosolic Mn2+ ions are not pumped into the Golgi and are toxic to growth of the pmr1 mutant. It is indicated that delivery into the secretory pathway by Pmr1p and subsequent exocytosis must be a major route for the cellular detoxification of Mn2+.The pmr1 mutant was more tolerant to high salt stress than wild type, and the introduction of extragenic PMR1 into the mutant reduced the salt tolerant growth phenotype (Fig. 2 B). Because Pmr1p acts as a Ca2+-ATPase, it was predicted that the cytosolic Ca2+ ion level in the pmr1 mutant would be higher than wild type under high salt stress conditions. When the cytosolic Ca2+ level was measured, it was elevated and maintained under high salt stress in the pmr1 mutant (Fig.3). In agreement with our observation, additional Ca2+conferred salt tolerance in S. cerevisiae during high salt stress (14Danielsson A. Larsson C. Larsson K. Gustafsson L. Adler L. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From these observations it is suggested that the cytosolic Ca2+ level is elevated under high salt stress, and the increased Ca2+ ions participate in the salt-tolerant growth phenotype of the pmr1 mutant.However, the elevated Ca2+ under high salt stress does not affect the expression of GPD1 required for glycerol production, which means that the antiosmotic defense mechanism is driven normally in the pmr1 mutant. Another defense mechanism against salt stress is the calcineurin-dependent sodium extrusion pathway (10Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 2B, is required for PMR2expression. It is also required for T cell activation and proliferation in human and is the target of the T cell-specific immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 complexed with the intracellular-binding protein cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively (25Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 26Cardenas M.E. Zhu D. Heitman J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 427-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In yeast, calcineurin plays a central role in adaptive responses to cation stress. Calcineurin is required for yeast cells to survive exposure to high levels of Na+ or Li+ ions. Mutants lacking calcineurin have a decreased ability to export Na+ and Li+ ions, suggesting a defect in the Pmr2p (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S.-I. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). On the other hand, constitutive activation of calcineurin confers increased resistance to Na+ and Li+ ions (10Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is activated by a Ca2+/calmodulin complex (6Wieland J. Nietshe A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An elevated Ca2+ ion level in the pmr1mutant may induce constitutive activation of calcineurin under high salt stress. Therefore, to determine whether the calcineurin pathway is involved in the salt-tolerant phenotype of the pmr1 mutant, the pmr1 mutant was treated with FK506, a calcineurin-specific inhibitor, and salt-tolerant growth was tested. The growth of FK506-treated cells was inhibited under high salt stress (Fig. 4). Especially both wild-type and pmr1 mutant cells failed to grow when the cells were treated with 1 µg/ml FK506.An alternative way for S. cerevisiae to adapt to salt stress involves mechanisms that restrict the influx of sodium into the cell. The K+ transport system encoded by the TRK1 andTRK2 genes (28Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) also admits Na+ but increases its preference for K+ over Na+ at elevated concentrations of NaCl (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). If this pathway is responsible for the salt-tolerant growth of the pmr1 mutant, it could be predicted that FK506 treatment may not affect the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant. Because the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant completely disappeared with the treatment of FK506 (Fig. 4), this pathway did not play a crucial role in the salt-tolerant phenotype of the pmr1 mutant. Therefore, the calcineurin-dependent pathway presumably acts as a major high salt adaptation mechanism in the pmr1 mutant.If the calcineurin-dependent pathway is activated in thepmr1 mutant, the expression of PMR2 would be induced. Under salt stress, the expression of PMR2 in thepmr1 mutant was increased several -fold compared with the wild type (Fig. 5). Because pmr1 mutation highly induced the expression of PMR2 by constitutive activation of calcineurin, the pmr1 mutant could obtain the salt-tolerant phenotype. This is evidence that the expression of PMR2 is regulated by the activity of Pmr1p.It is important to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in normal or stressed conditions. Under high salt stress, increased cytosolic Ca2+ is helpful for salt tolerance. If, however, the increased cytosolic Ca2+ ion level does not drop to a normal level, Ca2+ homeostasis may be disturbed, which may have a harmful effect on the cell viability. In yeast, the Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by three different Ca2+ transports, Pmc1p, Vcx1p, and Pmr1p. Pmc1p is a P-type Ca2+-ATPase located in the vacuole, is ∼40% identical to plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases, and is much less similar to other P-type ion pumps (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pmc1 null mutants display a severe sensitivity to Ca2+ supplements in the growth medium (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vcx1p is a H+/Ca2+antiporter and functions completely dependent on the transmembrane pH gradient, which is normally produced by the Pma1p, V-type H+-ATPase on the vacuolar membrane (32Haro R Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Another Ca2+ transporter is Pmr1p, which is predominantly localized in the Golgi complex or related secretary compartments (5Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J. Moir D.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 133-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 17Antibi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Pmr1p is ∼30% identical to the members of the SERCA subfamily, which are Ca2+-ATPases found in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum of animal cells (22Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Pmr1p is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions in Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (24Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated recently that Pmr1p acts as a major Ca2+-ATPase under normal growth condition (24Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression of PMC1, a second Ca2+ pump in the vacuole, and the activity of one or more H+/Ca2+ exchangers are induced in the mutants lacking Pmr1p under normal growth condition (33Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under high salt stress, however, activated calcineurin inhibits the expression ofPMC1 (15Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 16Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and reduces the activity of Vcx1p (13Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+ ion level was highly maintained in thepmr1 mutant (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that Pmr1p might be a major component as a Ca2+-ATPase regulating Ca2+ homeostasis under high salt stress (Fig.6). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be utilized as a convenient model system in salt-stress studies (1Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Salt stress has two major harmful effects for cells: the loss of turgor pressure and the toxicity of Na+ ions to cellular metabolism. The adaptation of yeast to these conditions requires the induction of glycerol synthesis to restore turgor pressure and the modification of the plasma membrane transport systems to exclude Na+ ions from the cytosol (2Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 3Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Glycerol synthesis is mediated by a high osmolarity glycerol response-dependent pathway. The expression of GPD1, encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, is induced by activated a high osmolarity glycerol response-dependent pathway and is essential for growth under osmotic stress in S. cerevisiae(4Albertyn J. Hohman S. Thevelein T.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4125-4144Crossref Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Under high salt stress, yeast cells are subjected to salt toxicity stress as well as osmotic stress. S. cerevisiae actively extrudes sodium through the P-type Na+-ATPase encoded by the gene PMR2 (also called ENA1) (2Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 3Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).PMR2 is barely expressed under normal growth conditions, but its expression is sharply increased by osmotic and salt toxicity stress as well as by alkaline pH (3Garciadeblas B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking PMR2 are therefore highly sensitive to Na+ and Li+ions. Several components of the regulatory network that controlsPMR2 expression have been identified in the last few years. Calcineurin, the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2B, is required forPMR2 expression. Mutants lacking calcineurin have a decreased ability to export Li+ and Na+ ions, suggesting a defect in the Pmr2p (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and the constitutive activation of calcineurin confers increased resistance to Na+ and Li+ ions (10Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Under high salt stress, a lot of Na+ comes into cytosol, and the cytosolic Ca2+ ion level is elevated. Ca2+ ion-bound calmodulin activates calcineurin. Activated calcineurin induces the expression of several genes including PMR2 (5Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J. Moir D.T.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The intracellular Ca2+ ion level has been suggested to play an important role in the salt stress response. However, components regulating cytosolic Ca2+ ion level are not clear under high salt stress. To study the components associated with salt adaptation mechanisms under high salt stress, we isolated several salt-tolerant mutations by using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)1 treatment. One of the mutations was mapped in the PMR1 gene, which encodes a P-type Ca2+-ATPase mainly located to the Golgi apparatus (5Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J.

Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Under high NaCl stress conditions, the level of cytosolic Ca2+ ion in the pmr1 mutant was maintained higher than wild type. The highly maintained cytosolic Ca2+level in turn results in enhanced expression of PMR2 via calcineurin. Our results indicate that the pmr1 mutation confers salt tolerance through continuous activation of calcineurin and enhanced PMR2 expression. Taken together, it can be concluded that that the Pmr1p acts as a major Ca2+-ATPase under high salt stress. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we studied the salt-adaptation mechanism using thepmr1 mutant. The pmr1 mutant is one of the mutants generated by EMS random mutagenesis. Pmr1p is a Ca2+-ATPase localized in the Golgi apparatus (17Antibi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and plays an essential role in the secretory pathway as a Ca2+- and Mn2+-transporter, which supplies both ions to the Golgi (22Cunningham K.W.

It was reported previously that pmr1 mutants displayed hypersensitivity to the growth toxicity of millimolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+ (21Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the hypersensitive phenotype of the pmr1 mutant to 0.2 mm MnCl2 was observed (Fig. 2 A). Elevated cytosolic Mn2+ ions are not pumped into the Golgi and are toxic to growth of the pmr1 mutant. It is indicated that delivery into the secretory pathway by Pmr1p and subsequent exocytosis must be a major route for the cellular detoxification of Mn2+.The pmr1 mutant was more tolerant to high salt stress than wild type, and the introduction of extragenic PMR1 into the mutant reduced the salt tolerant growth phenotype (Fig. 2 B). Because Pmr1p acts as a Ca2+-ATPase, it was predicted that the cytosolic Ca2+ ion level in the pmr1 mutant would be higher than wild type under high salt stress conditions. When the cytosolic Ca2+ level was measured, it was elevated and maintained under high salt stress in the pmr1 mutant (Fig.3). In agreement with our observation, additional Ca2+conferred salt tolerance in S. cerevisiae during high salt stress (14Danielsson A. Larsson C. Larsson K. Gustafsson L. Adler L. Curr.

From these observations it is suggested that the cytosolic Ca2+ level is elevated under high salt stress, and the increased Ca2+ ions participate in the salt-tolerant growth phenotype of the pmr1 mutant.However, the elevated Ca2+ under high salt stress does not affect the expression of GPD1 required for glycerol production, which means that the antiosmotic defense mechanism is driven normally in the pmr1 mutant.

It is also required for T cell activation and proliferation in human and is the target of the T cell-specific immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 complexed with the intracellular-binding protein cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively (25Schreiber S.L.

Calcineurin is activated by a Ca2+/calmodulin complex (6Wieland J. Nietshe A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K.

Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). If this pathway is responsible for the salt-tolerant growth of the pmr1 mutant, it could be predicted that FK506 treatment may not affect the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant. Because the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant completely disappeared with the treatment of FK506 (Fig. 4), this pathway did not play a crucial role in the salt-tolerant phenotype of the pmr1 mutant. Therefore, the calcineurin-dependent pathway presumably acts as a major high salt adaptation mechanism in the pmr1 mutant.If the calcineurin-dependent pathway is activated in thepmr1 mutant, the expression of PMR2 would be induced.

Pmr1p is ∼30% identical to the members of the SERCA subfamily, which are Ca2+-ATPases found in the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum of animal cells (22Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Pmr1p is also located in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions in Ca2+ uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (24Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated recently that Pmr1p acts as a major Ca2+-ATPase under normal growth condition (24Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression of PMC1, a second Ca2+ pump in the vacuole, and the activity of one or more H+/Ca2+ exchangers are induced in the mutants lacking Pmr1p under normal growth condition (33Marchi V. Sorin A. Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under high salt stress, however, activated calcineurin inhibits the expression ofPMC1 (15Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 16Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and reduces the activity of Vcx1p (13Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+ ion level was highly maintained in thepmr1 mutant (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that Pmr1p might be a major component as a Ca2+-ATPase regulating Ca2+ homeostasis under high salt stress (Fig.6). In this study, we studied the salt-adaptation mechanism using thepmr1 mutant. The pmr1 mutant is one of the mutants generated by EMS random mutagenesis. Pmr1p is a Ca2+-ATPase localized in the Golgi apparatus (17Antibi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and plays an essential role in the secretory pathway as a Ca2+- and Mn2+-transporter, which supplies both ions to the Golgi (22Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that pmr1 mutants displayed hypersensitivity to the growth toxicity of millimolar concentrations of extracellular Mn2+ (21Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the hypersensitive phenotype of the pmr1 mutant to 0.2 mm MnCl2 was observed (Fig. 2 A). Elevated cytosolic Mn2+ ions are not pumped into the Golgi and are toxic to growth of the pmr1 mutant. It is indicated that delivery into the secretory pathway by Pmr1p and subsequent exocytosis must be a major route for the cellular detoxification of Mn2+. The pmr1 mutant was more tolerant to high salt stress than wild type, and the introduction of extragenic PMR1 into the mutant reduced the salt tolerant growth phenotype (Fig. 2 B). Because Pmr1p acts as a Ca2+-ATPase, it was predicted that the cytosolic Ca2+ ion level in the pmr1 mutant would be higher than wild type under high salt stress conditions. When the cytosolic Ca2+ level was measured, it was elevated and maintained under high salt stress in the pmr1 mutant (Fig.3). In agreement with our observation, additional Ca2+conferred salt tolerance in S. cerevisiae during high salt stress (14Danielsson A. Larsson C. Larsson K. Gustafsson L. Adler L. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From these observations it is suggested that the cytosolic Ca2+ level is elevated under high salt stress, and the increased Ca2+ ions participate in the salt-tolerant growth phenotype of the pmr1 mutant. However, the elevated Ca2+ under high salt stress does not affect the expression of GPD1 required for glycerol production, which means that the antiosmotic defense mechanism is driven normally in the pmr1 mutant. Another defense mechanism against salt stress is the calcineurin-dependent sodium extrusion pathway (10Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 2B, is required for PMR2expression. It is also required for T cell activation and proliferation in human and is the target of the T cell-specific immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 complexed with the intracellular-binding protein cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively (25Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 26Cardenas M.E. Zhu D. Heitman J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1995; 4: 427-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In yeast, calcineurin plays a central role in adaptive responses to cation stress. Calcineurin is required for yeast cells to survive exposure to high levels of Na+ or Li+ ions. Mutants lacking calcineurin have a decreased ability to export Na+ and Li+ ions, suggesting a defect in the Pmr2p (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S.-I. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). On the other hand, constitutive activation of calcineurin confers increased resistance to Na+ and Li+ ions (10Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is activated by a Ca2+/calmodulin complex (6Wieland J. Nietshe A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An elevated Ca2+ ion level in the pmr1mutant may induce constitutive activation of calcineurin under high salt stress. Therefore, to determine whether the calcineurin pathway is involved in the salt-tolerant phenotype of the pmr1 mutant, the pmr1 mutant was treated with FK506, a calcineurin-specific inhibitor, and salt-tolerant growth was tested. The growth of FK506-treated cells was inhibited under high salt stress (Fig. 4). Especially both wild-type and pmr1 mutant cells failed to grow when the cells were treated with 1 µg/ml FK506. An alternative way for S. cerevisiae to adapt to salt stress involves mechanisms that restrict the influx of sodium into the cell. The K+ transport system encoded by the TRK1 andTRK2 genes (28Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) also admits Na+ but increases its preference for K+ over Na+ at elevated concentrations of NaCl (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). If this pathway is responsible for the salt-tolerant growth of the pmr1 mutant, it could be predicted that FK506 treatment may not affect the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant. Because the salt tolerance of thepmr1 mutant completely disappeared with the treatment of FK506 (Fig. 4), this pathway did not play a crucial role in the salt-tolerant phenotype of the pmr1 mutant. Therefore, the calcineurin-dependent pathway presumably acts as a major high salt adaptation mechanism in the pmr1 mutant. If the calcineurin-dependent pathway is activated in thepmr1 mutant, the expression of PMR2 would be induced. Under salt stress, the expression of PMR2 in thepmr1 mutant was increased several -fold compared with the wild type (Fig. 5). Because pmr1 mutation highly induced the expression of PMR2 by constitutive activation of calcineurin, the pmr1 mutant could obtain the salt-tolerant phenotype. This is evidence that the expression of PMR2 is regulated by the activity of Pmr1p. It is important to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in normal or stressed conditions. Under high salt stress, increased cytosolic Ca2+ is helpful for salt tolerance. If, however, the increased cytosolic Ca2+ ion level does not drop to a normal level, Ca2+ homeostasis may be disturbed, which may have a harmful effect on the cell viability. In yeast, the Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by three different Ca2+ transports, Pmc1p, Vcx1p, and Pmr1p. Pmc1p is a P-type Ca2+-ATPase located in the vacuole, is ∼40% identical to plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases, and is much less similar to other P-type ion pumps (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pmc1 null mutants display a severe sensitivity to Ca2+ supplements in the growth medium (27Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 157-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vcx1p is a H+/Ca2+antiporter and functions completely dependent on the transmembrane pH gradient, which is normally produced by the Pma1p, V-type H+-ATPase on the vacuolar membrane (32Haro R Banuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Another Ca2+ transporter is Pmr1p, which is predominantly localized in the Golgi complex or related secretary compartments (5Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J.

One line of evidence for this interaction comes from two peptide binding and inhibition studies (16Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Lange C. Duda T. Beyermann M. Sharma R.K. Koch K.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the first study, Sokal and co-workers (16Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported a site of contact involving the RetGC1 sequence961GTFRMRHMPEVPVRIRIG978 within the intracellular catalytic domain. In the second study, Lange and co-workers (17Lange C. Duda T. Beyermann M. Sharma R.K. Koch K.W.

These sequences lie within the intracellular region between the membrane and the kinase homology domain of RetGC1. Both studies relied on peptide binding and inhibition analyses to identify contact surfaces. Their results, therefore, are valid only with the assumption that peptides behave in solution as they do in the context of the full-length folded protein. An additional caveat is that interpretation of peptide inhibition requires appropriate controls, for instance peptides of identical amino acid composition with scrambled sequence. These were absent from one of these studies (16Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Additional information about interactions between RetGCs and GCAPs comes from proteolysis of RetGC chimeras (22Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and stabilization of the kinase homology domain by GCAPs (23Tucker C.L. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11995-12000Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Those studies identified a region of RetGC1 that is stabilized and protected from proteolysis by GCAPs. The protected region was within residues 436–736 of the kinase homology domain of RetGC1. Stabilization and protection from proteolysis occurred independently of Ca2+ suggesting that GCAPs bind constitutively to RetGCs. In the study described in this report we investigated GCAP/RetGC interactions by developing a novel method for mapping sites of proximity of proteins in a complex. The first step in this method is to stabilize proximate regions of whole native proteins by cross-linking. The proteins are then digested by trypsin. The resulting cross-linked fragments are separated by reverse phase chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry.

We applied ms/ms analysis to the cross-linked peptides and developed software that determines the masses of all possible cross-linked tryptic fragments. The software also selects likely candidate peaks from a complex mass spectrum. Once these candidates are identified they are analyzed by ms-ms sequencing to confirm their identity. The software scores and evaluates candidate matches between predicted peptide conjugates and observed ms/ms spectra. This new method identifies residues of interacting proteins that are physically separated from each other by approximately the length of the cross-linker. Amino acid residues surrounding the cross-linked residues are considered candidates for contact surfaces that can be verified independently by biochemical methods. We applied the method (referred to as COSUMAS) to the RetGC1/GCAP-1 interaction and found two contact surfaces that had not been previously identified using other methods. The identity of these structures as contact regions was verified by peptide inhibition experiments. Cross-linking was performed on a mixture of washed bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membrane preparations (18Krylov D.M. Niemi G.A. Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10833-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GCAP-1 was metabolically labeled by including 5 mCi of 35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the growth medium 30 min prior to inducing expression. It was purified away from bacterial proteins by size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrepTM 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 high resolution column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Cross-linking was performed for 15–30 min in the following buffer: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 µm ATP. The volume of the reaction was 2.5 ml, rhodopsin concentration was 62 µm, and GCAP-1 concentration was 2 µm. The cross-linking agent bismaleimide hexane (bMH) (purchased from Pierce Chemical Co.) was used at 30 µm. The reaction was stopped by adding free cysteine to a 100 mm final concentration. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 80,000 rpm in an OptimaTM TLX ultracentrifuge using a TLA 100.1 rotor (Beckman), washed in 6 m deionized urea four times, and finally washed once in cross-linking buffer to remove soluble GCAP-1. Tryptic digestion was performed at a 1:100 enzyme to rhodopsin weight ratio for 2 h at room temperature. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap instrument with electrospray interface. Samples were analyzed by direct infusion at 10 µl/min with automatic gain control on. Typically mass spectra were collected in a 200–2000 m/z window for 1 min. The scans were averaged and visualized by the Qual Browser software from Thermo Quest. Ms/ms spectra on selected peaks were collected similarly with the following parameters: isolation width for the parental ion of 1.5–3m/z, activation amplitude 25–70%, activation coefficient, “Q” 0.250, activation time 30 ms. Data were analyzed with a UNIX-based software package. The programs were written in Perl and linked by CGI. Mass spectra were fed into the programs as simple text files, and the output was formatted as html. The program is accessible by contacting the corresponding author. All peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem automated peptide synthesizer Synergy 432A. Applied Biosystem amino acid cartridges and organic solvents were used. Peptides were washed and cleaved from the matrix, lyophilized, and dissolved in water or a Me2SO/H2O mixture. The presence of a correct molecular weight was verified by mass spectrometry. Ten milligrams of each peptide synthesis product were loaded onto a Waters 626 HPLC system with a Dynamax-300A C18 83-213-C5 column purchased from Rainin Instrument Co., Inc. A 45-min gradient of 10–80% acetonitrile was run in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow of 2.5 ml/min. Absorbance at 214 nm was monitored in select fractions that were infused directly into the mass spectrometer. Those that contained only the correct mass predicted for the given peptide were selected. These fractions were lyophilized for 24 h in a Speedvac, and the dry residue was dissolved in water. Residual trifluoroacetic acid effects on the pH in the inhibition assay were controlled by neutralization based on direct measurements of the pH. Peptide concentrations were measured by amino acid analysis (AAA Laboratory, Mercer Island, WA) and spectrophotometrically at 214 nm. Guanylyl cyclase was assayed as described previously (10Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A GCAP-1 concentration of 1 µm was determined to be subsaturating for stimulation of RetGC for this series of assays. That concentration of GCAP-1 was used in all guanylyl cyclase assays. A homobifunctional cross-linking agent, bMH, was selected to stabilize RetGC1·GCAP-1 complexes. bMH reacts specifically with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues (28Chen L.L. Rosa J.J. Turner S. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18237-18243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thomas T.C. Sladek T. Yi F. Smith T. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8626-8635Google Scholar, 30Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10295-10298Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It can cross-link two of them if the sulfhydryls are within the length that separates the reactive maleimide groups of bMH. Thus two cysteines belonging to different polypeptide chains can be covalently linked only if they are spatially proximate in the protein complex. A preparation of washed bovine ROS mixed with recombinant GCAP-1 was used for cross-linking. Cross-linked proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the ability of bMH to stabilize RetGC1·GCAP-1 complexes was assessed by Western blotting with anti-RetGC1 and -GCAP-1 antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 a band of 230-kDa apparent molecular mass was recognized by both anti-RetGC1 and anti-GCAP-1 antibodies. This cross-reacting band was absent without prior cross-linking. It was also not observed when ROS and GCAP-1 were cross-linked separately (data not shown). It was therefore considered to be a covalent complex of RetGC1 and GCAP-1. The intensity of the GCAP-1 signal in the band was found to be slightly stronger in the presence of >10 µm Ca2+ than in 1 mm EGTA (data not shown). All subsequent cross-linking was therefore carried out in the presence of >10 µmCa2+. No difference was observed in the cross-linking patterns under light versus dark conditions (data not shown), and all subsequent experiments were carried out in the light. To monitor how much GCAP-1 became associated with membranes after cross-linking we used 35S-labeled GCAP-1. Unlike RetGC1, GCAP-1 is not an integral membrane protein, but it can become tightly attached to the membrane if it is chemically cross-linked to a transmembrane protein. ROS membranes were incubated with35S-labeled GCAP-1 and bMH and then washed four times with 6 m urea. The amounts of radioactive label in four consecutive washes and in the final membranes were then measured. Labeled GCAP-1 that remained on the membranes after the washes amounted to 9% of the total GCAP-1 that had been added (TableI). In a control experiment bMH was not added, and only two urea washes were performed. In that case only 3% of the labeled GCAP-1 remained associated with the membranes after the washes (data not shown). We treated the washed cross-linked membranes with trypsin to release fragments of GCAP-1 and RetGC1 that had become cross-linked. Trypsin treatment released 57% of the bound label from the cross-linked membranes.Table IMonitoring 35S-labeled GCAP-1 after cross-linkingcpmTotal cpms in experiment5,911,071Urea washes of crosslinked ROSI5,116,200II376,350III78,050IV4,805V (low salt buffer)545Membranes after washes465,250Soluble fraction after trypsin268,640Washes I–IV were performed in 6 m urea, and wash V was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5.

Open table in a new tab Washes I–IV were performed in 6 m urea, and wash V was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Scintillation counting for total counts per minute in the experiment, membrane fraction, and soluble fraction after trypsin treatment was done on 1/10 volume, and total values were calculated appropriately. Following the trypsin treatment the soluble fraction was separated from the membranes, and the cross-linked tryptic fragments were resolved on a reverse phase C18 column. Scintillation counting of the HPLC fractions revealed that 19 of the 100 fractions contained significant amounts of radioactive label. Because only GCAP-1 was labeled in the experiment, HPLC fractions containing the label must contain GCAP-1 proteolytic fragments. The 19 fractions carrying significant amounts of radioactive label were analyzed on an electrospray mass spectrometer by direct infusion. This analysis produced spectra of varying complexity; the number of peaks that rose significantly above the background varied from dozens to hundreds per HPLC fraction (data not shown). A computer program was designed to enumerate all possible combinations of tryptic peptides from RetGC1 and GCAP-1 linked via a cysteine residue. The algorithm considers complete as well as partial digestion products. It predicts the masses of cross-linked peptides including the additional mass of the cross-linker. It considers all possible charge states for a given ion and compares the predicted masses with the peaks observed experimentally. An example is shown in Fig.2. Candidate peaks for cross-linked peptides were identified using this program, and each was subjected to an ms/ms experiment to obtain partial sequence data. They were further analyzed by another computer program that compares predicted and experimental ms/ms spectra for a given sequence and provides a way to score the match between the two. Candidate ions were confirmed only if 1) at least two charge states of the same candidate cross-linked peptide were found in the same HPLC fraction, and 2) all major peaks in the ms/ms experimental spectrum were accounted for by the computer prediction, and 3) the number of peaks that matched expected masses was significantly higher than that produced by matching the experimental spectrum to a prediction from a random sequence of the same length. In cases where all three of these criteria were not completely satisfied we used an additional criterion: fragmentation at three or more consecutive residues. An ms/ms spectrum and its match with a predicted spectrum for the parental ion of 858m/z is shown in Fig. 3. The same spectrum was matched with 10 other peptide sequences whose masses did not equal the parental mass of this ms/ms experiment (Fig.4). The number of ions matching predictions varied from 38 to 81 with the average of 52.8. A peptide with the correct parental mass produced 91 identified ions.Figure 3Assigning peaks in the ms/ms spectrum of the 858 parent ion. Only major peaks are labeled. The total number of peaks in the spectrum is 118. We identified 91 of them as Y, B, or A ions resulting from fragmentation of the sequenceAIRAINPCSDSTMTAEEFTDTVFSK-IRIGLHSGPCVAGVVGLTMPRlinked via cysteines by a cross-linker of 276 mass units (bismaleimide hexane).

To obtain a measure of reliability of the computer algorithm for matching ms/ms predicted and experimental spectra 10 cross-linked peptides whose parental masses did not match 858 were run against the same ms/ms spectrum of the 858 parental mass. The number listed next to each sequence is the number of ions in the predicted ms/ms spectrum matching them/z values in this experimental data set. Y, B, and A ions were considered with or without H2O or NH3 loss.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From an exhaustive analysis of all candidate peaks a set of cross-linked RetGC1·GCAP-1 peptides emerged (Fig.5). Based on these data cysteine pairs were identified in RetGC1 and GCAP-1 that become cross-linked and are thus likely to be separated by approximately the length of the cross-linker molecule. The linker arm of bismaleimide hexane is 16.1 Å long. To corroborate the cross-linking results we tested synthetic peptides corresponding to RetGC1 sequences for their ability to block regulation of RetGC activity by GCAP-1 in anin vitro cyclase assay (3Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1345-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The abilities of each peptide to interfere with inhibition of cyclase activity by Ca2+-GCAP-1 and to interfere with activation of cyclase activity by Ca2+-free GCAP-1 were evaluated. Each cross-linked cysteine identified by mass spectrometry analysis was considered to be within a contact surface or adjacent to one. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to regions flanking each of the identified cysteines (Table II). The peptides were 15–20 residues long. Each was tested in a standard cyclase assay (data not shown). Peptides were evaluated at 500 µm, GCAP-1 was used at 1 µm, and ROS membranes were present at 6 µm rhodopsin. Only those peptides that displayed some ability to block regulation of RetGC activity in this pilot assay were used for further analysis over a range of concentrations.Table IISequences of synthesized peptidesCysteinesSequencesGCAP-1Cys178SVEELSSTECHQWYKKFMTE27Cys10588EQKLRWYFKLYDVDGNGCID107Cys124111LLTIIRAIRAINPCSDSTMT130RetGC1Cys622615LAVVSEHCARGSLQD629,629DLLAQRDIKLDWMFKSS645Cys741731SLGIIMQEVVCRSAPYAMLE750,760VQSPPPLCRPSVSID774Cys780775QAPMECIQLMKQCWA789Cys984975IRIGLHSGPCVAGVVG990,965MRHMPEVPVRIRIGLH980Cys997987GVVGLTMPRYCLFGDT1002The left column lists cysteines in GCAP-1 and RetGC1 that were identified by COSUMAS.

Sequences that were unique for GCAP-1 and RetGC1 were selected for synthesis. Two peptides derived from the RetGC1 kinase homology domain were very effective at interfering with regulation by GCAP-1. We analyzed effects of these peptides on both GCAP-1-mediated inhibition in the presence of Ca2+ and activation in the absence of Ca2+. One peptide, 731SLGIIMQEVVCRSAPYAMLE750, produced a half-maximal effect at 40 µm in Ca2+ (Fig.6 A) and at 30 µmin EGTA (Fig. 7 A). A control peptide with the same amino acid composition but randomized residue order, CIEPLQSLAIRSVAMEGMVY, caused only a minor effect in Ca2+ (Fig. 6 B) and no detectable effect in EGTA (Fig. 7 B). Another peptide corresponding to a different kinase homology domain sequence,775QAPMECIQLMKQCWA789, produced a half-maximal effect at 80 µm in Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C) and at 75 µm in EGTA (Fig.7 C). The corresponding randomized control peptide, MLPQMACAIQWEQKC, did not produce significant effects on RetGC activity in the same concentration range (Figs. 6 D and 7 D). The two peptides corresponding to a RetGC1 catalytic domain sequence,965MRHMPEVPVRIRIGLH980 and975IRIGLHSGPCVAGVVG990, did not block regulation of RetGC activity by GCAP-1 either in Ca2+ or EGTA (only Ile975–Gly990 is shown in Figs.6 E and 7 E). This result is not consistent with a previous report (16Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that a similar peptide from this region, Gly961–Gly978, blocks activation by GCAP-1.Figure 7Effects of RetGC1 peptides on GCAP-1-mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase activity in ROS.

Guanylyl cyclase activity in 1 mm EGTA in the presence of GCAP-1 and the absence of peptides was taken to be 100% (This was 2.5–4-fold higher than the basal unstimulated activity defined as 0%.). The values shown are the percentage of this stimulated activity. The data shown are the average of duplicate data points obtained from one or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A peptide derived from the sequence adjacent to Cys622 in RetGC1, 629DLLAQRDIKLDWMFKSS645, blocked GCAP-1-meditated cyclase activation half-maximally at 270 µm in EGTA (Fig. 7 F). Its randomized analog, LSDQIAMKLRDFSLWDK, also exhibited some inhibitory effect in EGTA but at higher concentration (Fig. 7 G). The same peptide,629DLLAQRDIKLDWMFKSS645, did not interfere with inhibition of cyclase activity by Ca2+-GCAP-1 (Fig.6 F). Peptides with GCAP-1 sequences were analyzed for effects on basal RetGC activity in the absence of GCAP-1 as well as for their ability to block regulation of RetGC by GCAP-1. A peptide with the sequence8SVEELSSTECHQWYKKFMTE27 reduced cyclase activity to less than 50% of its basal level with a half-maximal effect at 100 µm (Fig.8 A). However, the control peptide with the same residues in random order, HKVEYMSEWKFSTLSCETEQ, also caused some inhibition at a similar concentration (Fig.8 B). A GCAP-1 peptide with the sequence88EQKLRWYFKLYDVDGNGCID107 also inhibited RetGC1 basal activity (Fig. 8 C), whereas the control randomized peptide NFLIEDRVQLKCKGDDWGYY did not (Fig. 8 D). A GCAP-1 peptide with the sequence111LLTIIRAIRAINPCSDSTMT130 did not affect cyclase activity at concentrations up to 1 mm (data not shown). In this study we provide evidence for multiple contact surfaces involved in RetGC1/GCAP-1 interaction (Fig.9). The evidence comes from two independent experimental methods. A novel mass spectrometry-based method, COSUMAS, identified cysteines in the two proteins that are sufficiently close to each other to be cross-linked by bMH. This method revealed previously unrecognized structures in the kinase homology domain of RetGC1 that are spatially proximate to bound GCAP-1. The involvement of these regions was confirmed by the second method, which was analyses of synthetic peptides derived from the RetGC1 sequence for the ability to interfere with regulation by GCAP-1. Peptides derived from the corresponding GCAP-1 sequence also were analyzed for effects on RetGC activity. The specificity of the effect of each peptide was controlled in our study by analyzing peptides with the same amino acid composition but randomized sequences. RetGC1 sequences that have the strongest inhibitory effect on regulation by GCAP-1 are731SLGIIMQEVVCRSAPYAMLE750 and775QAPMECIQLMKQCWA789. These peptides are derived from the kinase homology domain of RetGC1, and they interfere with GCAP-1 regulation at both high and low Ca2+concentrations. It is likely that these effects derive from the peptides competing with full-length RetGC1 for a binding site on GCAP-1. This suggests that interactions between GCAP-1 and the kinase homology domain occur independently of Ca2+. A Ca2+-independent interaction of GCAP-1 with RetGC1 is also consistent with the following previous observations. (i) GCAP-1 regulates RetGC activity in the presence as well as absence of Ca2+ (11Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). (ii) GCAP-1 stabilizes RetGC1 activity in the presence as well as absence of Ca2+ (23Tucker C.L. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11995-12000Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). (iii) GCAP-2 protects the kinase homology domain from proteolysis in the presence as well as absence of Ca2+ (22Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another region of the kinase homology domain of RetGC1, a region adjacent to Cys622,629DLLAQRDIKLDWMFKSS645, was also considered as a candidate for a contact surface based on our mass spectrometry data. This peptide, however, exhibited an effect on cyclase stimulation only in EGTA (Fig. 7 F). Because the interaction was detected using COSUMAS in the presence of Ca2+ this interaction may occur in the presence of Ca2+only when these amino acids are in the context of the folded RetGC1 protein. The free peptide may have a weaker affinity for GCAP-1 in the presence of Ca2+than in its absence. Alternatively, COSUMAS may have detected a specific spatial proximity that is a point of contact at low but not at high Ca2+ concentrations. The COSUMAS method also suggested that a region in the catalytic domain of RetGC1 is proximal to GCAP-1. This appears consistent with a previous finding (16Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) derived from peptide binding and inhibition experiments. However, neither of the two overlapping peptides we synthesized from this region affect regulation of cyclase by GCAP-1 either at high or low Ca2+ levels. Further studies will be required to confirm whether this region includes sites that interact directly with GCAP-1. COSUMAS identified two regions in GCAP-1 that cross-linked with RetGC1:8SVEELSSTECHQWYKKFMTE27 and88EQKLRWYFKLYDVDGNGCID107. The corresponding peptides affect basal cyclase activity suggesting that these sequences are capable of binding to RetGC as discrete peptides and influencing activity. Both peptides also block cyclase activation by GCAP-1 in EGTA (data not shown). It is likely that these peptides compete with full-length GCAP-1 for binding sites on RetGC1. The involvement of these two regions of GCAP-1 in cyclase regulation is in agreement with the functional map obtained in our previous mutagenesis study of GCAP-1 (18Krylov D.M. Niemi G.A. Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10833-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although COSUMAS suggested a third region of GCAP-1 may also interact with RetGC1 (111LLTIIRAIRAINPCSDSTMT130), peptide inhibition experiments did not confirm it. Not all cross-links identified by COSUMAS are expected to represent bona fideinteractions. This is most likely because the cross-linking agent bMH has reactive moieties that are spaced by a considerable length. We have shown in this study that the cross-linking/mass spectrometry method COSUMAS identifies potential regions of spatial proximity of two proteins in a complex. The identity of these regions as true sites of interaction must be validated by an independent method such as use of synthetic peptides to interfere with the interaction. COSUMAS is not limited to bMH; if a cross-linker with a shorter spacer arm is used only regions that are closer to each other should be identified. COSUMAS can also accommodate the use of a cross-linker with a different specificity and/or a photoactivatable cross-linker."

Molecular cloning and functional studies reveal that NMDA receptors are heteromeric and consist of three subunits named NR1, NR2, and NR3 in the rat (2Hollmann M. Jones P. Monyer H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors in CNS. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 3-98Google Scholar). The NR1 and NR2 subunits are named ζ and ε, respectively, in the mouse (3Mori H. Mishina M. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1219-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The NR2 subunit has four members that combine with the NR1 subunit to form functional NMDA receptors with distinct pharmacological properties. Additional diversity of NMDA receptors is achieved by alternative splicing of the NR1 subunit (4Zukin R.S. Bennett M.V.L. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 306-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The NR1 subunit, a product of a single gene, has eight isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exons 5, 21, and 22 (5, 6). Exon 5 encodes the N1 splice cassette that lies in the extracellular amino-terminal domain of the NR1 subunit. Exons 21 and 22 encode the carboxyl-terminal splice cassettes C1 and C2, respectively, and are a part of the intracellular domain of the NR1 subunit. NR1 splice variants lacking exon 22 contain an additional cassette, C2′, at the carboxyl-terminal end. The presence or absence of the N1, C1, and C2 cassettes influence the function of the NMDA receptors (6Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 974-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ethanol, one of the most abused drugs in our society, alters the expression and function of NMDA receptors in a treatment-dependent manner. Acute ethanol exposure in vivo inhibits NMDA receptor function, whereas chronic ethanol treatment in vivo and in vitro increases the NMDA receptor number and function (13Lovinger D.M. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 187A-191ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kumari M. Ticku M.K. Prog. Drug Res. 2000; 54: 152-189PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in receptor number following chronic ethanol treatment of fetal cortical neurons is a result of an augmentation of NR1 and NR2B polypeptides (15Follesa P. Ticku M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13297-13299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with a concomitant increase in NR2B mRNA levels (16Hu X.J. Follesa P. Ticku M.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although chronic ethanol treatment specifically enhances the half-life of NR1 mRNA in fetal cortical neurons (17Kumari M. Ticku M.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), NR1 mRNA levels are not increased (16Hu X.J. Follesa P. Ticku M.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The NR1 subunit has eight splice variants. It is possible that ethanol may affect only selective NR1 splice variants, resulting in no significant overall increase in NR1 mRNA levels in fetal cortical neurons. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of chronic ethanol treatment on NR1 splice variants at mRNA and polypeptide levels using our in vitro model system of mouse fetal cortical neurons. We performed a comprehensive analysis of all the NR1 splice variants at mRNA and polypeptide levels in mouse fetal cortical neurons. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the simultaneous amplification of exons 21 and 22 by RT-PCR, allowing the concurrent detection of NR1-1, NR1-2, NR1-3, and NR1-4 splice variants. Our results show that mouse fetal cortical neurons cultured for 5 days in vitro express four NR1 splice variants, NR1-3a, NR1-3b, NR1-4a, and NR1-4b. Chronic ethanol treatment decreased the expression of the NR1-4b splice variant at mRNA and polypeptide levels in fetal cortical neurons. Under similar culture conditions, ethanol (50 mm, 5 days) up-regulated the polypeptide levels of NR1-4, without any effect on NR1-3 polypeptide levels. Chronic ethanol treatment thus has a differential effect on mRNA and polypeptide levels of four NR1 splice variants expressed in fetal cortical neurons. Fetal cortical neurons isolated from 14–15-day-old mouse fetuses were cultured as described elsewhere (17Kumari M. Ticku M.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Time-pregnant mice (strain C57 BL/6) purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) were used in accordance with institutional guidelines, and procedures were approved by the animal welfare committee. Twenty-four h after the last ethanol treatment, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolated total RNA was rendered genomic DNA-free by digestion with RNase-free DNase (RQ1; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). Total RNA was purified again by organic extraction and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. DNA-free total RNA was used for Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses and ribonuclease protection assays. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred on to Gene Screen Plus membrane (DuPont). The NR1 mRNA was detected by hybridization to a 32P-labeled mouse NR1 cDNA labeled by the random prime method using Prime-It kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mouse NR1 cDNA was obtained from Dr. M. Mishina (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Following hybridization overnight at 42 °C, the membranes were washed and exposed to PhosphorImager screen. Results were analyzed on PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The effect of chronic ethanol treatment on the mRNA levels of β-actin, cyclophilin (IB15), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was determined by ribonuclease protection assay as described previously (17Kumari M. Ticku M.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmids to generate riboprobes for β-actin and GAPDH were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The riboprobe for cyclophilin was the same as described elsewhere (17Kumari M. Ticku M.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Data was analyzed using the ImageQuant software. Forward primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by filtering the reaction mix through a Sephadex G25 column. Labeled primers were further purified by the acrylamide gel (15%) purification method, suspended in water, and used within 1 week of32P labeling. The specific activity of32P-labeled forward primers ranged between 8.6 × 107 and 3.48 × 108 cpm/µg. RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that AmpliTaq Gold polymerase was used. RT-PCR conditions for exon 5 and exons 21 and 22 of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor were standardized using cRNA generated by in vitro transcription of NheI-linearized NR1-1b plasmid. The NR1-1b plasmid, obtained from Dr. M. Hollmann (Max-Planck-Institute for Experimental Medicine, Göttingen, Germany), was used as a positive control for the PCR step of RT-PCR. One hundred ng of total RNA were used for RT-PCR amplification of exon 5, exons 21 and 22, and β-actin, whereas 200 ng of total RNA were used for IB15 and GAPDH. Reverse transcription for exons 21 and 22 of the NR1 subunit was performed as follows: 15 min at 25 °C, 2 min at 40 °C and then ramp up 2 °C/min until reaching 60 °C, 30 min at 60 °C, 5 min at 99 °C, and 5 min at 5 °C. For β-actin, GAPDH, IB15, and exon 5 of the NR1 subunit, reverse transcription was performed using the following conditions: 15 min at 25 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 99 °C, and 5 min at 5 °C. Total RNA (300 ng/60 µl for exon 5, exons 21 and 22, and β-actin and 400 ng/40 µl for IB15 and GAPDH) mixed with RT master mix was reverse-transcribed. The final concentrations of components in 20 µl of RT reaction mix were as follows: 5 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer II, 1 mm each dNTPs, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 µm random hexamers, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Following reverse transcription, RT mix was divided into 20-µl aliquots. Each aliquot was mixed with 80 µl of PCR mix (final concentrations in 100 µl: 2 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer II, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 125 ng each of 32P-end-labeled forward primer and cold reverse primer for each gene under investigation in this study). For PCR amplification of exons 21 and 22, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the PCR reaction mix. PCR was performed as follows: step 1, 10 min at 95 °C × 1 cycle; step 2, 1 min at 95 °C; 1 min at 68 °C × 18 cycles for β-actin (25 cycles for IB15, 27 cycles for exon 5, and 28 cycles for exons 21 and 22); step 3, 7 min at 72 °C × 1 cycle and soak at 4 °C. PCR amplification of GAPDH was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C X 1 cycle, 30 s at 95 °C; 50 s at 56 °C; 1 min at 72 °C × 25 cycles, 7 min at 72 °C × 1 cycle, and soak at 4 °C. RT-PCR products (5 µl/sample) were separated on 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. The gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screen. Results were analyzed using the ImageQuant software. To determine the linear range of quantitation, RT-PCR was performed using 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 1,000 ng of purified total RNA from fetal cortical neurons cultured for 5 days in the absence of ethanol. The RT reaction for all genes under study was performed as above, except that each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 µl, and PCR was carried out in a final volume of 100 µl. Results were analyzed using PhosphorImager. Following optimization of the RNA concentration, the appropriate number of PCR cycles for each gene was empirically determined to provide values that fell into both the linear range of PCR and the linear range of detection by autoradiography. For quantitation of RT-PCR results, the signal intensity of 200-nt- (−E5), 263-nt- (+E5), 87-nt- (−E21/−E22), and 198-nt- (+E21/−E22) long DNA fragments were divided by the signal intensity of the “ethanol-insensitive” gene (encoding β-actin, IB15, or GAPDH) from the same RNA sample. Normalized values for −E5 (“a” isoforms) were divided by normalized values for +E5 (“b” isoforms) and expressed as a ratio of −E5/+E5. Similarly, normalized values for −E21/−E22 (NR1-4) were divided by normalized values for +E21/−E22 (NR1-3) and expressed as a ratio of NR1-4/NR1-3. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's least significant difference test. Identification of RT-PCR products was performed by restriction analysis. Unique restriction sites that lie within the amplified exons, as well as outside the amplified exons, were selected for exons 5 and 21 (see Table II). For β-actin, IB15, and GAPDH, a mouse sequence obtained from GenBankTM was analyzed, and unique restriction sites within the amplified region were selected (see Table II). RT-PCR products (10 µl) were digested with the selected restriction enzymes according to the instructions of the supplier and separated on 5% denaturing acrylamide gel. Results were analyzed using PhosphorImager.Table IIRestriction analysis of RT-PCR productsGene/exonRT-PCR product sizeRestriction enzymePredicted size of DNA bands following restriction digestionRestriction enzymePredicted size of DNA bands following restriction digestionNR1+E5*263TaqI*176PstI*230(b isoform)8733−E5*200TaqI*200PstI*166(a isoform)34NR1+E21/−E22*198EcoO109I*146PstI*50(NR1–3)52148−E21/−E22*87EcoO109I*87PstI*50(NR1–4)37IB15*503EcoO109I*223280β-Actin*285MspI*25035GAPDH*451EcoO109I*275176The table shows the predicted size of DNA fragments following restriction digestion of RT-PCR products with the respective restriction enzymes. * indicates radiolabeled RT-PCR products and DNA fragments obtained following restriction digestion.

Washed neurons were recovered by scraping, suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 µg/ml leupeptin, 100 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) (19Ehlers M.D. Fung E.T. O'Brien R.J. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 720-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing nuclei and/or unbroken cells were discarded, and supernatants (cell lysates) were recovered. Cell lysates, prepared as above from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of 6-month-old male mice, were used as controls. The protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were mixed with detergents (Triton X-100 to 1%, sodium deoxycholate to 1%, Nonidet P-40 to 1%, and SDS to 2%) and boiled for 2 min. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (15Follesa P. Ticku M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13297-13299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Proteins (10 µg of protein for cultured cells and 5 µg of protein for samples from adult brain) were separated on 8.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto Hybond ECL-pure nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-NMDAR1 monoclonal antibody (NR1pan) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-NMDAR1 N1 splice variant polyclonal antibody (Chemicon), rabbit anti-NMDAR1 C1 splice variant antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-rat NR1 alternative CT (C2′) polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Following incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, immunoreactive bands were visualized on x-ray film using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the linear range of detection of immunoreactive bands, Western blot analysis was performed as above using 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 µg of cell lysate from fetal cortical neurons grown in the absence of ethanol for 5 days. The concentrations of antibodies, as well as the exposure time to x-ray film, were optimized to provide density values that fell into the linear range of detection. Similar analysis was also performed for cell lysates prepared from the cerebral cortex (CC), hippocampus (H), and cerebellum (CB) of adult mice. The relative changes in the NR1 splice variants were measured by quantifying the intensity of immunoreactive bands and Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands using the NIH Image software (version 1.61, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Following transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, gels were stained with Coomassie B. Blue R250. A consistent protein band present in all the lanes was used to control for equal loading. To normalize the Western blot results, the density values of the immunoreactive bands were divided by the density values of the Coomassie Blue-stained protein band from the corresponding gel lanes. Results are expressed as a percent of control. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Fisher's least significant difference test. The effect of chronic ethanol treatment on the size of the NR1 mRNA in cultured fetal cortical neurons was determined by Northern blot analysis. Analysis of results indicated no apparent change in the size of the NR1 mRNA in fetal cortical neurons grown in the presence of ethanol as compared with the untreated controls (data not shown). Three genes, encoding β-actin, IB15, and GAPDH, were selected as internal controls for quantitative RT-PCR analysis because their expression is not altered by chronic ethanol treatment either in vivo or in vitro (16Hu X.J.

In this study, these genes are referred to as ethanol-insensitive genes. To confirm that chronic ethanol treatment has no effect on the mRNA levels of these three genes under our cell culture conditions, we performed ribonuclease protection assays using appropriate antisense riboprobes. Results shown in TableIII indicated that chronic ethanol treatment had no significant effect on the mRNA levels of β-actin, IB15, and GAPDH in fetal cortical neurons as compared with untreated controls.Table IIIEffect of chronic ethanol treatment on the mRNA levels of three ethanol-insensitive genes in fetal cortical neuronsGenemRNA levels (% of control)β-Actin101.04 ± 4.8IB15105.36 ± 3.6GAPDH99.26 ± 3.8Results are expressed as a percentage of control (mean ± S.E.;n = 10).

Expression of NR1 splice variants at the mRNA level was examined by RT-PCR in fetal cortical neurons cultured for 5 days in the absence of ethanol. Amplification of exons 21 (E21) and 22 (E22) using primers encompassing these two exons (TableI) was performed to determine the presence or absence of NR1-1, NR1-2, NR1-3, and NR1-4, whereas amplification of exon 5 (E5) allowed the detection of a (−E5) and b (+E5) isoforms of the NR1 subunit. The classification of NR1 splice variants used here is adapted from Hollmann et al.(6Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S.

Two DNA fragments 200 (−E5) and 263 (+E5) nt in length were amplified using total RNA from cortical neurons (Fig. 1 A,lane F). Using NR1-1b cRNA, a single DNA band of 263 nt (+E5) was amplified (Fig. 1 A, lane D). The NR1-1b cRNA contains exons 1–22 including exon 5 (6Hollmann M. Boulter J. Maron C. Beasley L. Sullivan J. Pecht G. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 943-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These results suggested the presence of both a and b isoforms of the NR1 subunit in fetal cortical neurons. We observed that the intensity of the 263-nt-long DNA fragment was less than the 200-nt-long DNA fragment. To ensure that this difference in intensities of DNA fragments was not due to differences in amplification efficiency, DNA-free total RNA from the cerebellum of the adult mouse was used as a control for RT-PCR. RT-PCR results in Fig. 1 A (lane CB) showed the amplification of 200- and 263-nt-long DNA fragments in equal proportion, as has been reported previously (26Vedova F.D. Bonecchi L. Bianchetti A. Fariello R.G. Speciale C. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Zhong J. Carrozza D.P. Williams K. Pritchett D.B. Molinoff P.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These results confirmed the differential expression of NR1 a and NR1 b isoforms in cultured fetal cortical neurons. Expression of NR1-1, NR1-2, NR1-3, and NR1-4 in fetal cortical neurons was detected by RT-PCR using primers spanning exons 21 and 22. RT-PCR products (10 µl) separated on 2% agarose gels (3:1 agarose, high resolution blend) were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (Fig.1 B). Two DNA fragments of 198 (+E21/−E22) and 87 (−E21/−E22) base pairs (bp) were amplified using total RNA isolated from fetal cortical neurons cultured in the absence or presence of ethanol (Fig. 1 B, lanes C and E). Using NR1-1b cRNA and cDNA, a single band of 552 bp (+E21/+E22 = NR1-1) was amplified (Fig. 1 B, lanes C1 andC2). This data suggested that cultured fetal cortical neurons express NR1-3 (198 bp) and NR1-4 (87 bp) splice variants only. Similar results were obtained using total RNA isolated from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of adult mice (Fig.1 B, lanes CC, H, and CB). Detection of both a and b isoforms of the NR1 subunit, as well as NR1-3 and NR1-4, indicated the presence of NR1-3a, NR1-3b, NR1-4a, and NR1-4b splice variants in cultured fetal cortical neurons, regardless of ethanol treatment. Restriction analyses of DNA fragments amplified by RT-PCR were performed to verify the amplified DNA sequences. Unique restriction sites that lie within the amplified exons, as well as outside the amplified exons, were selected for exons 5 and 21 (TableII). The sizes of DNA fragments obtained following restriction digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes (Fig. 2, A and B) were identical to the predicted sizes (Table II), demonstrating that appropriate exons of the NR1 subunit were amplified using the primer pairs shown in Table I. Restriction analysis was also performed for β-actin, IB15, and GAPDH (internal controls) using one restriction site in the amplified DNA sequence (Table II). Analysis of results showed that the appropriate gene products were amplified for each of the internal controls (Table II; Fig. 2 C). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the effect of chronic ethanol treatment on the expression of NR1-3a,b and NR1-4a,b splice variants in fetal cortical neurons. Total RNA isolated from cortical neurons grown in the presence of ethanol (50 mm, 5 days) was amplified using primers spanning exon 5 and exons 21 and 22 (Table I). Total RNA isolated from cortical neurons grown in the absence of ethanol served as untreated controls. Three ethanol-insensitive genes, encoding β-actin, IB15, and GAPDH, were employed as internal controls because chronic ethanol treatment did not significantly alter their mRNA levels in fetal cortical neurons (Table III). The autoradiogram in Fig. 3 shows the RT-PCR results for internal controls, whereas Figs.4 and 5show the RT-PCR results for exons 21 and 22 and exon 5 of the NR1 subunit, respectively. The RT-PCR results were quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because similar results were obtained with all the internal controls, only results normalized with β-actin were plotted (Fig. 6). Fetal cortical neurons express NR1-3 (+E21/−E22) and NR1−4 (−E21/−E22) splice variants regardless of ethanol treatment (Fig. 4). Quantitative analysis of results indicated that the expression of the NR1-4 splice variant was greater than that of the NR1-3 splice variant in fetal cortical neurons grown in the absence of ethanol, because the ratio of NR1-4/NR1-3 was 2.66 ± 0.14 (Figs. 4 and 6). Chronic ethanol treatment had no significant effect on the expression of NR1-3 and NR1-4 splice variants (NR1-4/NR1-3 = 2.27 ± 0.09) in fetal cortical neurons (Figs. 4 and 6). Fetal cortical neurons cultured in the absence or presence of ethanol express both a isoforms (−E5) and b isoforms (+E5) of the NR1 subunit (Fig. 5)"

The interactions ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae TBP with the E4 (TATATATA) and adenovirus major late (TATAAAAG) promoters have been modeled via global analysis of kinetic and thermodynamic data obtained using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A linear two-intermediate kinetic mechanism describes the reaction of both of these consensus strong promoters with TBP. Qualitative features common to both interactions include tightly bound TBP-DNA complexes with similar solution geometries, simultaneous DNA binding and bending, and the presence of intermediate TBP-DNA conformers at high mole fraction throughout most of the reaction and at equilibrium. Despite very similar energetic changes overall, the stepwise entropic and enthalpic compensations along the two pathways differ markedly following the initial binding/bending event. Furthermore, TBP-E4 dissociation ensues from both replacement and displacement processes, in contrast to replacement alone for TBP-adenovirus major late promoter. A model is proposed that explicitly correlates these similarities and differences with the sequence-specific structural properties inherent to each promoter. This detailed mechanistic comparison of two strong promoters interacting with TBP provides a foundation for subsequent comparison between consensus and variant promoter sequences reacting with TBP. Binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to promoter DNA bearing the TATA sequence is an obligatory initial step in RNA polymerase II transcription initiation.

TBP binds productively to consensus (TATAa/tAa/tN) and numerous variant TATA sequences, yielding binary complexes with the DNA bent in solution from 30° to 76° (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M.

These TBP-TATA complexes correspond ultimately to a broad range of transcription activities (9Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A strong correlation has been observed between the solution conformation of the TBP-TATA complex and the corresponding functional activity, including overall transcription efficiency and the details of the binary interaction. A very good correspondence is apparent betweenin vitro and in vivo transcription activity and the DNA solution bend angle in the binary complex (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), consistent with the TBP-TATA structure being a primary determinant of transcription activity. This relationship contrasts with a minimal correspondence of the TBP-DNA complex lifetime to bend angle and to transcription activity (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The relationships among TATA sequence, DNA solution bend angle, and transcription efficiency are very well described by a two-state model in which the TBP-TATA complex exists in two solution conformations: a transcriptionally inactive form with only slightly bent DNA and a transcriptionally active form with the DNA bent ∼80° (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sequence-dependent probability for the complex to assume the transcriptionally active conformation would then be highly correlated with successful preinitiation complex formation and subsequent transcription. The interaction between TBP and the consensus adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) (TATAAAAG) has been characterized using gel electrophoresis circular permutation analysis (10Hoopes B.C.

FRET studies reveal simultaneous binding and bending of AdMLP by TBP that is well described by a two-intermediate process with both intermediate conformers having bent DNA (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One of these intermediate species is significantly populated and has been proposed as a TBP-DNA complex upon which the preinitiation complex is assembled (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The details of the TBP-AdMLP association kinetics, monitored in real time, are highly sensitive to single point mutations in the core TATA sequence (17Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dramatic alterations in the solution geometry of a TBP-bound TATA variant (TATAAACG), induced by sequential addition of osmolyte, correspond to equally dramatic, successive changes in the TBP-DNA association binding curve (17Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Differences in the mechanistic details of the TBP-promoter interaction must give rise to these kinetic changes and correlate with the sequence-dependent binary structures in solution. Our goal is to further understand the functional consequences of variations in the TATA sequence-dependent solution conformation of the binary complex. A comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic comparison of two consensus strong promoters reacting with TBP has thus been conducted, providing the foundation for subsequent studies utilizing variant TATA sequences. The interaction of the E4 core promoter sequence (TATATATA) with TBP was chosen for further analysis because previous characterization using DNase I footprinting revealed functional differences relative to the AdMLP sequence (11Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Petri V. Hsieh M. Jamison E. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15842-15849Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Further examination of the TBP-E4 interaction over a range of temperatures and TBP concentrations using FRET in conjunction with steady-state, stopped-flow, and time-resolved measurements yields detailed kinetic and energetic profiles. The interaction of TBP with AdMLP was previously characterized in an analogous manner (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The complete set of kinetic and thermodynamic data describing that reaction has been further analyzed in this study to provide an unambiguous, direct comparison between the two strong promoters. The overall interactions of both the E4 and the adenovirus major late promoters with TBP are well described by a linear two-intermediate model (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This model is the simplest to which the data for each promoter correspond. Important differences in the stepwise progression of these two reactions can be related directly to differences in the sequence-induced structural features of the two promoters, yielding additional insight into the relationships among sequence, structure, and function. Fluorescently labeled 14-base DNA oligonucleotide probes, with 3′-fluorescein and/or 5′-TAMRA, and unlabeled complementary oligomers were synthesized and purified by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) as described (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The E4 coding strand was thus TAMRA-5′-GGGCTATATATAGG-3′-fluorescein, with the duplex denoted as T*E4dpx*F. Full-lengthSaccharomyces cerevisiae TBP was prepared as described (11Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,13Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Studies were conducted at the indicated temperatures in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Detailed discussions of FRET and its application to the present study have been published (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol.

Very briefly, FRET is the nonradiative transfer of excited state energy from a donor to an acceptor fluorophore, with the efficiency of such transfer exquisitely dependent on the distance between the two dyes. The binding of TBP to TATA-bearing DNA may thus be monitoredvia changes in the donor emission, because the TBP-induced DNA bending significantly decreases the inter-dye distance. The interaction of E4 with TBP has been monitored herein using FRET in conjunction with steady-state emission, stopped-flow, and time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements. The solution geometry of TBP-bound E4 was investigated by extracting the probability distributions characterizing the 5′ end to 3′ end distances from time-resolved fluorescence decays, as described (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), for the E4 duplex free and TBP-bound. A model-dependent solution bend angle for the bound E4 duplex was then determined as described (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that TBP is monomeric under the conditions of our studies (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Daugherty M.A. Brenowitz M. Fried M.G. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, to test the proposal that TBP dimerization explains the observed TBP-DNA kinetics (15Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Jackson-Fisher A.J. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L.A. Coleman R.A. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), stopped-flow association binding measurements have been conducted using equimolar concentrations of TBP and DNA. A 2 µm TBP solution was flowed together with a 2 µm AdMLP solution, with T*AdMLPdpx*F comprising 2% of the total DNA (the reliability of using the double-labeled duplex as a trace probe has been demonstrated) (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Simulations were conducted using the two-intermediate model that has been shown to characterize the TBP-AdMLP interaction together with the previously determined 20 °C rate constants (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with and without an additional step for TBP self-association. The rate constant for TBPdimer → 2 TBPmonomer was assigned the published value of 7.7 × 10−4 s−1 (29Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K. Benjamin L.R. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13842-13849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This value and the reported monomer-dimer equilibrium constant, 0.02 µm (15Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), were used to determine the rate constant for the reverse reaction. The experimental and simulated curves were then compared. Equilibrium constants for TBP binding to T*E4dpx*F were determined at 10, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, and 25 °C using steady-state emission spectra exactly as described (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,20Parkhurst L.J. Parkhurst K.M. Proc. Soc. Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. 1994; 2137: 475-483Google Scholar, 22Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The interaction of TBP with AdMLP was characterized previously using fluorescence stopped-flow and steady-state emission measurements in conjunction with FRET (13Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7459-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The TBP-E4 interaction has been investigated in an analogous manner. Instrumentation, data acquisition, and data analysis were as described (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with modifications as noted herein. Briefly, stopped-flow association binding measurements were conducted at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. Solutions of 40 nm T*E4dpx*F were flowed together with TBP solutions of 400, 800, or 1600 nm (before mixing). Replicate curves were averaged and very well fit to a biexponential decay model, yielding a set of nine curves, each representing a unique combination of temperature and TBP concentration. To determine the rate of DNA replacement and/or displacement from all conformers of the TBP-E4 complex, dissociation kinetic data were obtained as a function of unlabeled E4 duplex (E4dpx) at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. Briefly, the TBP-T*E4dpx*F complex was formed using 20–25.4 nm T*E4dpx*F and 412 nm TBP, ensuring ≥94% duplex saturation. Dissociation of the complex was initiated by addition of a large excess of unlabeled E4dpx in one of three concentration ranges: 5.50–5.56 µm, 8.91–9.57 µm, or 29.4–29.6 µm. The observed dissociation data were well fit to biexponential decay models as described (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To ensure a precise comparison, TBP-T*AdMLPdpx*F dissociation kinetic data were collected in an analogous manner using unlabeled AdMLPdpx. The dependence of the TBP-T*E4dpx*F dissociation kinetics on unlabeled E4dpx revealed two processes: passive replacement of labeled by unlabeled duplex, as expected, but also displacement, whereby the unlabeled duplex at very high concentration actively facilitates removal of the labeled duplex. Because only replacement is considered in the overall global analysis, it was necessary to extract that process from the complex dissociation kinetics. Two model-independent procedures were developed for removing the DNA concentration dependence from overall dissociation. In one procedure, the set of three experimental dissociation curves obtained as a function of DNA concentration at a given temperature, defined at discrete time points, was used in a Taylor series expansion about an intermediate DNA concentration to extrapolate to [DNA] = 0. The smoothed experimental data were used to obtain numerical first and second derivatives for the series. An alternate procedure was based on the observation that the two decay constants describing the biphasic dissociation curves were well separated, with λfast ≫ λslow. λfast was thus very nearly the trace of the rate constant matrix and linear in DNA concentration. The value of λfast for the pure replacement process was obtained from extrapolation to [DNA] = 0 of a plot of λfast versus [DNA]. Because the kinetic curves were normalized, the remaining values needed to describe replacement were λslow and the corresponding amplitude change. Both quantities were likewise linear in DNA concentration, although such a correlation is not required. Extrapolation of both values to [DNA] = 0 thus yielded the values needed to construct the pure replacement curves. These curves at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C were subsequently used in TBP-E4 global analysis. The correspondence of the ensemble of E4 data to several kinetic mechanisms was explored. These data included nine unique stopped-flow binding and four replacement kinetic curves and six equilibrium binding isotherms. Inclusion of the curves representing equilibrium binding and biphasic replacement rather than the two corresponding constants necessitated modification of the analysis described previously (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additional modifications were introduced to ensure appropriate weighting of the kinetic and equilibrium data. Analyses based on the two-, one-, and extended one-intermediate models are described below with changes noted relative to previous studies (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, to ensure a meaningful comparison, the complete set of AdMLP kinetic and thermodynamic data was reanalyzed in an entirely analogous manner using these modified procedures. The linear two-intermediate model is as follows.TBP+DNA⇄k2k1(TBP⋯DNA)1I1conformer⇄k4k3(TBP⋯DNA)2I2conformer⇄k6k5TBP−DNAFINAL(Eq. 1) Global analysis yielded values for the six rate constants,k 1–k 6, at 30 °C, as well as the corresponding six activation enthalpies. The value of ΔS°≠ for each step was calculated from these quantities. Also determined was the quantum yield of the donor fluorescein in each of the three TBP-bound duplexes relative to that of free T*E4dpx*F. These values derive from the distance-dependent rate of energy transfer between the two fluorescent labels and are interpreted to reflect the relative extent of DNA bending in each binary complex (6Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Smoothed, normalized representations of each of the nine stopped-flow association and four replacement kinetic curves were first constructed using 41 points/curve (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding isotherms were constructed from the experimentally determined K avalues using 19 points/curve and scaled from 0 to 0.419, the average overall amplitude change observed in steady-state FRET measurements. These 19 points emphasized the region from 45 to 55% saturation but extended to 98% saturation. Fitting to the shape of the curve rather than to a single K a value allows a priori for heterogeneity in analyses of these equilibria, although heterogeneity was neither detected nor expected for this model. The theoretical association response functions were determined as described (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Biphasic replacement response functions, reflecting the approach to equilibrium in the reverse direction, were determined in an analogous manner. The calculated equilibrium binding curves were constructed using K a values derived from the microscopic rate constants associated with the two-intermediate model (Equation 1).Ka=k1k21+k3k41+k5k6(Eq. 2) Evaluation of the overall quality of the fit was based on the weighted variance between the observed and theoretical points describing the shapes of the biphasic stopped-flow association (ςSF2) and replacement (ςR2) curves and the equilibrium binding isotherms (ςK2). The weighting factors of 0.041, 0.030, and 0.013 derived from the respective average errors in these data. To obtain ςglobal2, the three terms were further weighted to reflect the relative information content of each term, as follows.ςglobal2=1169ςSF2+3ςK2+4ςR2(Eq. 3) An ideal global fit to a model then yields ςglobal≤ 1, with each term within its experimental error. Error estimates for the optimal parameters were obtained exactly as described (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol.

The ensemble of TBP-E4 data was initially investigated, in a manner entirely analogous to that just described, using a one-intermediate model.TBP+DNA⇌k2k1TBP···DNAI1conformer⇌k4k3TBP­DNAFINAL(Eq. 4) This analysis yielded values at 30 °C for the rate constants,k 1–k 4, the corresponding activation enthalpies, and the relative quantum yields for TBP-bound DNA in the intermediate and final complexes. The TBP-TATA interactions were further explored in terms of an extended one-intermediate model having two forms of free DNA duplex and two TBP-bound complexes.DNA2k1⥯k2DNA1+TBP⇌k4k3TBP···DNAI1conformer⇌k6k5TBP­DNAFINAL(Eq. 5) An equilibrium between two conformations of DNA, one bent and thus predisposed to TBP binding (DNA1), characterizes the model (13Parkhurst K.M.

Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Global analysis was as described for the two-intermediate model but with k3 as a second-order rate constant and the quantum yields of DNA1, I1, and TBP-DNAFINAL determined relative to a quantum yield of 1 for DNA2. Only values ofk 1 and k 2 of approximately the same order of magnitude as the other rate constants were deemed acceptable in this analysis. For much larger values ofk 1 and k 2, Equation 5 is equivalent to the one-intermediate model in terms of accommodating the data, with k 3 simply scaled byk 1/k 2. The quality of the fit to Equation 5 was assessed as described for the two-intermediate model, with a constraint on the population distribution of DNA1 and DNA2 based on the near temperature independence of the fluorescence spectrum of the free duplex. At each iterative step of the global analysis, the corresponding theoretical fluorescein emission,F(T) calc, was determined for each temperature, T, using the following expression.F(T)calc=k1(20∘C)k2(20∘C)+1QYDNA1k1(T)k2(T)+1k1(T)k2(T)+1QYDNA1k1(20∘C)k2(20∘C)+1(Eq. 6) where QYDNA1 is the quantum yield of free, prebent DNA. F(T) calc values falling outside of the experimentally determined range resulted in penalization of ςglobal2 (Equation 3). Global analyses of the collective TBP-AdMLP data to one-, extended one-, and two-intermediate models were conducted, incorporating these modifications, and the optimal parameters were compared with those obtained previously (14Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The analysis included eleven stopped-flow association and four replacement kinetic curves and five equilibrium binding isotherms, the latter scaled to 0.440. In contrast to TBP-E4 dissociation, TBP-AdMLP dissociation was independent of the concentration of unlabeled AdMLPdpx. These latter experimental curves were therefore a direct measure of the replacement process and were used in the global analysis.

Important for these events is a family of proteases, caspases, which are activated by a proteolytic cleavage cascade and drive apoptosis by targeting key proteins within the cell. Here, we demonstrate that serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor essential for proliferative gene expression, is cleaved by caspases and that this cleavage occurs in proliferating murine fibroblasts and can be induced in the human B-cell line BJAB. We identify the two major sites at which SRF cleavage occurs as Asp245 and Asp254, the caspases responsible for the cleavage and generate a mutant of SRF resistant to cleavage in BJAB cells. Investigation of the physiological and functional significance of SRF cleavage reveals that it correlates with the loss of c-fos expression, whereby neither SRF cleavage fragment retains transcriptional activity. Moreover, the expression of a noncleavable SRF in BJAB cells suppresses apoptosis induced by Fas cross-linking. These results suggest that for apoptosis to proceed, the transcriptional events promoting cell survival and proliferation, in which SRF is involved, must first be inactivated.

The proto-oncogene c-fos represents a classic example of an immediate early (IE)1 gene, induced in response to growth factors and other mitogenic stimuli (1Rivera V.M. Greenberg M.E. New Biol. 1990; 2: 751-758PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shaw P.E. Gille H. Herrlich P. Angel P. The FOS and JUN Families of Transcription Factors. 1st Ed.

Contained within the promoter of c-fos and of other IE genes is the serum response element (SRE), which is essential for strict transcriptional control. Serum response factor (SRF) is a ubiquitously expressed, 67-kDa protein that binds, as a dimer, to the central element of the SRE, the CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG) (4Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SRF belongs to the MADS box family of transcription factors, named after four proteins identified with a common structural domain (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, SRF), all of which regulate transcription via the recruitment of auxiliary factors (5Schwarz-Sommer Z. Huijser P. Nacken W. Saedler H. Sommer H. Science. 1990; 250: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 6Pellegrini L. Song T. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The conserved core domain of SRF is sufficient for protein dimerization, DNA binding, and recruitment of ternary complex factors (TCFs). The TCFs form a subset of the ets family of proteins and include Elk-1, Sap1, and Net/Sap2/Erp (7Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In response to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, TCFs are rapidly phosphorylated, resulting in a dramatic increase in their transactivation potential (8Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1995; 6: 99-115PubMed Google Scholar, 9Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 10Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).In addition to its role at the SRE, SRF has been shown to regulate transcription in a TCF-independent manner. The exact function of SRF in this mode of gene expression is unclear. Within SRF, several amino-terminal phosphorylation sites have been identified (11Manak J.R. deBisschop N. Kris R.M. Prywes R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Manak J.R. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3652-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Janknecht R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of SRF at Ser103 correlates with c-fos expression (15Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.-H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,16Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain has also been mapped and shown to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery, in particular with Rap74, the large subunit of TFIIF (17Zhu H. Joliet V. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3489-3497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Joliet V. Demma M. Prywes R. Nature. 1995; 373: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TCF-independent transcriptional activation by SRF is regulated by the Rho family small GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42hs (19Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). These small G-proteins regulate several cytoskeletal processes, and recent data have suggested that the convergence of LIM kinase and RhoA signaling, via actin treadmilling, results in the transcriptional activation of some SRF-dependent genes (20Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this occurs has not yet been characterized in detail, and RhoA appears to function independently of Rac1 and Cdc42hs, implying that additional signaling pathways may be involved. The CArG box is frequently found in the promoters of muscle-specific genes. In this context, it has been demonstrated that SRF is essential for myogenic differentiation. Inhibition of SRF by microinjection of anti-SRF antibodies or the expression of antisense SRF RNA repressed muscle marker gene expression and blocked the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes (21Soulez M. Rouviere C.G. Chafey P. Hentzen D. Vandromme M. Lautredou N. Lamb N. Kahn A. Tuil D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M. Tuil D. Lautredou N. Morris M. Soulez M. Kahn A. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, homozygous SRF−/− mouse embryos fail to develop mesoderm (23Arsenien S. Weinhold B. Oelgeschläger M. Rüther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the process by which surplus or potentially harmful cells are removed from an organism in a nonphlogistic manner. Loss of the tight control governing this process can result in inflammation, cancer, stroke, and many neurodegenerative disorders. Caspases, or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases, form an integral part of the apoptosis machinery (24Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.C. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). In response to some extracellular stimuli, such as Fas ligand, TNFα, or genotoxic agents, caspases are activated in a hierarchical cleavage cascade. Once activated, they target and inactivate numerous intracellular substrates, including structural components of the cytoskeleton, DNA repair enzymes, protein kinases, and transcription factors as stricken cells are disassembled and removed by phagocytosis (25Savill J. Nature. 1998; 392: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).It is also known that caspases have additional roles beyond apoptosis, in line with their initial identification as relatives of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (26Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 27Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). For example, cleavage of GATA-1, mediated by caspases, has recently been demonstrated to block erythroid differentiation (28De Maria R. Zeuner A. Eramo A. Domenichelli C. Bonci D. Grignani F. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Testa U. Peschle C. Nature. 1999; 401: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, caspases have been shown to cleave the transcription factors NF-κB, resulting in the down-regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription, and STAT1, suggesting a role for caspases in mediating transcriptional responses (29Ravi R. Bedi A. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 882-886PubMed Google Scholar, 30van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8699-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Here we show that SRF also serves as a target for caspases in several cell types. Two adjacent cleavage sites recognized by caspases 3 and 7 allow SRF to be cleaved into two major fragments. Expression of the corresponding fragments reveals that they are unable to activate SRE-dependent transcription. Moreover, expression of a noncleavable SRF mutant suppresses apoptosis. Our results suggest that SRF is a focal point for cross-talk between signals promoting cell survival and proliferation and those promoting cell death.RESULTSThe experiments described here follow on from our initial observation of SRF fragments in NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for the protein. Two polyclonal antibodies, one raised against the amino-terminal portion of SRF (α1122) and the other against the carboxyl terminus (α1795), each recognized protein fragments of 30–35 kDa, approximately half the size of full-length SRF (Fig. 1, a and b,lane 1). To gain a first indication of the nature of these fragments, we compared their size and immunoreactivity with truncated forms of SRF expressed from suitably engineered vectors. Thus, the SRF fragment recognized by α1122 was larger than Ncore (lane 5) but almost identical in size to Ncore245 (lane 4), suggesting that it corresponds to SRF amino acids 1–245. Likewise, the SRF fragment recognized by α1795 was somewhat smaller than coreC (Fig. 1,lane 3) but very similar in size to SRF-C (amino acids 251–508). These observations suggest that in NIH3T3 cells SRF is cleaved in half under certain conditions and that the fragments are stable enough to accumulate in the cells.Variations in the level of SRF fragments indicated that SRF cleavage might be a regulated event, influenced perhaps by the growth state of the cells. We also noticed a cluster of six aspartate residues in the middle of SRF. In this context, caspases, a group of aspartate-directed proteases activated in cells undergoing apoptosis, are known to target numerous key proteins as the process unfolds. To assess a potential role for caspases in the cleavage of SRF, transfected NIH3T3 cells were treated with staurosporine for various times in the presence or absence of ZVAD, to drive cells into apoptosis and inhibit caspase activity, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1, c and d, staurosporine caused an increase in the yield of SRF fragments after 6 and 12 h (compare lanes 2 and 4with lane 1), which was strongly counteracted by ZVAD treatment (lanes 3 and 5), implicating caspases in this phenomenon. In this gel, it is also apparent that each antibody detects two SRF fragments, indicating that SRF is cleaved at two or more sites by caspases active in NIH3T3 cells.In parallel analyses, NIH3T3 cells were found to enter apoptosis with delayed and heterogeneous kinetics in response to staurosporine (result not shown). However, a more efficient means of inducing apoptosis by ligation of Fas proved to be impossible, since flow cytometric analysis revealed low surface expression of the receptor on NIH3T3 cells and a corresponding failure of the antibody (Jo-2) to elicit apoptosis (not shown). For this reason, we chose to analyze caspase cleavage of SRF further in a more appropriate cell system.The human mature B cell line BJAB expresses high levels of Fas on the cell surface and can be induced to undergo apoptosis upon receptor cross-linking by the agonistic monoclonal antibody CH11 (41Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). Thus, 4 h after treatment with CH11, >50% of BJAB cells have entered apoptosis, as assayed by DAPI staining and cell counting (see Fig.2 a), and by 10 h this number has risen to >90%. To determine if this process induces SRF cleavage, lysates were prepared from BJAB cells either untreated or incubated for various times with CH11. Cleavage of endogenous SRF was assayed by immunoblotting. Four hours after CH11 cross-linking, SRF fragments of approximately 30 kDa are detected and persist for the next 6 h (Fig. 2 b, lanes 4–6,arrowheads). The appearance of these bands is blocked by ZVAD (lane 7), indicating that they are caspase cleavage products. However, very little decrease in the amount of full-length SRF is apparent. The prominent 38-kDa species seen in untreated cells are unrelated to SRF, since they are not detected by antibodies specific to the carboxyl terminus of SRF (not shown), nor are they detected in a DNA-binding assay (see below).Figure 2Induction of SRF cleavage by Fas ligation on B cells. a, human BJAB cells, grown under normal conditions, were treated with the agonistic anti-Fas antibody CH11 alone or in the presence of ZVAD. Cells were harvested at the times indicated and analyzed for apoptosis by DAPI staining. Data show results from two experiments with duplicate points. b, as in a except that cells were lysed and analyzed for cleavage of endogenous SRF by immunoblotting (IB) with an amino-terminal SRF antibody (α1122). c, extracts prepared from BJAB cells, treated with CH11 for the times indicated, were incubated with a radiolabeled DNA fragment corresponding to the c-fos SRE alone (lanes 2-9) or in the presence of antibodies specific for the amino-terminal (lanes 10–12) or carboxyl-terminal (lanes 13–15) domain of SRF. The extract from untreated cells was also incubated with the corresponding preimmune sera (lanes 16 and17). Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel. The complex labeled with an arrowcorresponds to the SRF homodimer; the arrowheads indicate complexes containing SRF cleavage fragments. The identity of the complex indicated with an asterisk is unclear, but it is not recognized by any of the anti-SRF antibodies. d, a BJAB cell clone overexpressing His-tagged SRF (lanes 3 and4) and a control clone (lanes 1 and2) were untreated (−) or incubated with CH11 for 10 h (+). Cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an amino-terminal SRF antibody (α1122). Full-length SRF-Chis and its cleavage fragments are indicated with thin andthick arrows, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The integrity of endogenous SRF in CH11-treated BJAB cells was also investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a radiolabeled DNA probe corresponding to the human c-fos SRE (Fig. 2 c). The intensity of the SRF dimer complex is reduced by 4 h and continues to decrease up to 10 h (arrow). Moreover, two faster migrating bands appear at 2 h and decay over the same period (lower arrowheads). All three of these complexes are supershifted by α1122 (lanes 10–12), which recognizes the amino terminus of SRF, while α1795 supershifts only the upper two complexes (lanes 13–15). The simplest interpretation of these observations is that the lower complex corresponds to a homodimer of amino-terminal SRF fragments, the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 133–222) residing in the amino-terminal half of SRF, while the intermediate complex is a heterodimer in which just one SRF molecule is truncated.The apparent persistence of full-length SRF in BJAB cells seen in Fig.2 b is inconsistent with the loss of SRF-SRE complexes (Fig.2 c). To resolve this inconsistency, we generated a stable cell line that overexpresses a His-tagged version of SRF. When these cells were treated with CH11 and analyzed for SRF cleavage (Fig.2 d), we observed almost complete cleavage of SRF-Chis after 10 h (lane 4), in line with the loss of DNA binding. We also observed a nonspecific band migrating slightly faster than SRF-Chis in all lanes, which we believe co-migrates with endogenous SRF and masks its disappearance in Fig. 2 b. From these observations, we infer that SRF is completely processed in apoptotic BJAB cells.SRF cleavage was also observed in vitro when35S-labeled proteins were incubated in apoptotic BJAB cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3 b, incubation of SRF with lysates from CH11-treated cells (lane 3), but not from untreated cells (lane 2), led to the appearance of four SRF fragments of around 35 kDa, corresponding in size to those detected in NIH3T3 cells.Figure 3SRF cleavage by recombinant caspases. a, sequence of SRF amino acids 222–271 with aspartate residues highlighted with asterisks. SRF mutants used in this study are also indicated. Below is shown a diagrammatic representation of SRF cleavage and the resultant pattern of fragments resolved by SDS-PAGE. b, recombinant SRF (lanes 1–3) or the mutants EATA (lanes 4 and5), SASA (lanes 6 and 7), and the double mutant DM (lanes 8 and9), expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine by cell-free translation, were incubated with buffer B, extracts of untreated BJAB cells (−), or cells treated for 10 h with CH11 (+). Subsequently, reactions were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. c, recombinant SRF, expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine by cell-free translation, was incubated alone (lane 1) or with recombinant caspase 1 (lane 2), caspase 3 (lane 3), caspase 4 (lane 4), caspase 6 (lane 5), caspase 7 (lane 6), caspase 8 (lane 7), caspase 9 (lane 8), or caspase 10 (lane 9). Subsequently, reactions were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The data shown in Fig. 1 indicate that SRF cleavage occurs in the middle of the molecule, carboxyl-terminal to the DNA binding domain, referred to as coreSRF (42Schröter H. Mueller C.G.F. Meese K. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this region of SRF (amino acids 222–271) is depicted in Fig.3 a. Within this 10% of SRF, there are six aspartate residues, of which several could constitute sites of caspase cleavage. Within the remainder of SRF, there are only six additional aspartates. Mutations were therefore introduced into SRF to remove two possible caspase consensus sites at aspartate residues 245 and 254. Both individual mutants (EATA245 and SASA254) and the double mutant (DM) were then tested for cleavage by caspases present in CH11-treated BJAB cell lysates. Each single site mutant caused the loss of two SRF fragments (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 7and 5 with lane 3), while the double mutant abolished SRF cleavage in this assay. A similar set of results was obtained when lysates from etoposide-treated Jurkat cells were used (not shown), whereby cleavage was inhibited by the inclusion of ZVAD in the assay. Moreover, single alanine substitutions of Asp245and Asp254 had exactly the same effect as the EATA and SASA mutations on SRF cleavage in vitro (result not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SRF is cleaved at aspartates 245 and 254 by caspases induced in apoptotic BJAB cells and active to varying degrees in proliferating NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, we interpret the results to indicate that SRF can be cleaved at either but not both sites.To establish which caspase or caspases are responsible for SRF cleavage, radiolabeled SRF was incubated with each of eight active recombinant caspases and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This assay reveals that SRF is cleaved most effectively by caspases 3 and 7 but also, to a lesser extent, by caspases 6, 8, and 9 to yield similar fragments, suggesting that all five proteases recognize the same sites (Fig.3 c). In contrast, caspases 1 and 4 cleave SRF weakly to generate a distinct pattern of SRF fragments, while recombinant caspase 10 does not cleave SRF at all.SRF cleavage by caspases was analyzed further by comparing the susceptibility of SRF mutants to a subset of recombinant caspases (Fig.4). Caspase 1 cleaved each of the three mutants similarly to wtSRF, indicating that it does not recognize the sites at Asp245 and Asp254 but does recognize other sites in the protein. Cleavage of SRF by caspases 3 and 7 is influenced by both mutations. The mutations at Asp245 (EATA) result in the loss of two caspase 3 cleavage fragments and appear to enhance the yield of the others. The same mutant markedly reduces SRF cleavage by caspase 7. In contrast, mutations at Asp254 (SASA) lead to the reciprocal pattern of fragments obtained with caspase 3 but have little effect on SRF cleavage by caspase 7. The double mutant is resistant to cleavagein vitro by caspase 7 and is cleaved only weakly by caspase 3. Moreover, the fragment sizes suggest that caspase 3 may cleave DM-SRF at a site that is not recognized in wtSRF. In summary, caspase 7 cleaves at Asp245, while caspase 3 cleaves predominantly at Asp254 but also, suboptimally, at Asp245 and an additional site (possibly Asp261).Figure 4Identification of caspase cleavage sites. a, recombinant SRF, expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine by cell-free translation, was incubated alone (lane 1) or with caspase 1 (lane 2), caspase 3 (lane 3), caspase 7 (lane 4), or caspase 9 (lane 5), after which the reactions were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. b, as in a except with the mutant EATA-SRF. c, as in a except with the mutant SASA-SRF. d, as in a except with the mutant DM-SRF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We surmised that the cleavage of SRF by caspases was likely to alter the expression of IE genes such as c-fos. Accordingly, we examined the inducible level of Fos protein in BJAB cells at increasing times after CH11 treatment. Cells were pretreated with CH11 for various lengths of time and then with phorbol ester to induce c-fosexpression, which was assayed at the protein level by immunoblotting. Phorbol ester alone induced robust Fos expression (Fig.5 a, lane 2), but prior treatment with CH11 for 1 h or longer reduced and finally abolished inducible Fos expression (lanes 3–7). Thus, Fas cross-linking rapidly leads to the inhibition of Fos protein expression. To ascertain if the loss of Fos protein could be due to proteolysis, radiolabeled Fos protein was incubated in apoptotic BJAB cell lysates. However, no degradation of Fos was observed under conditions in which SRF cleavage was apparent (result not shown). Therefore, the absence of Fos in CH11-treated cells is probably due to loss of expression. To assess the extent to which this effect was due to transcriptional inhibition, the effect of CH11 on the expression of a c-fos reporter was measured. As shown in Fig. 5 b, CH11 inhibited c-fos reporter expression by 60%, and this inhibition could be blocked by ZVAD. In contrast, a c-fos reporter from which the SRE had been deleted (F10H) was refractory to CH11 treatment. It should be noted that expression of the control gene against which transfection efficiency was normalized was also insensitive to CH11 treatment. These results suggest that IE promoters containing SREs are down-regulated early in apoptosis, while other promoters remain unaffected.Figure 5Inhibition of c-fosexpression in apoptotic cells. a, human BJAB cells, cultured for 24 h in low serum (lane 1), were treated directly with phorbol ester (TPA) (lane 2) or after pretreatment with CH11 for the times shown (lanes 3–7). Cells were lysed, and Fos expression was monitored by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-Fos antibody. b, human BJAB cells were transfected with the firefly luciferase reporter Fos-Luc3 or the mutant ΔF10H-Luc3, which lacks the SRE, and after culture for 24 h in low serum they were treated with CH11, ZVAD, or both, as indicated (DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle). After 6 h, lysates were prepared and assayed as described. Luciferase activity is expressed as the ratio of relative light units (R.L.U.) and the β-galactosidase activity expressed from a co-transfected plasmid, whereby the value for untreated cells is set as unity. c, BJAB cells were transfected with the M20Fos-Luc reporter, which contains the M20 sequence in place of the SRE, and either control vector (pCMV5), MSRF, NMS4, or SRFC. After a 24-h culture in low serum, lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity is expressed as the ratio of relative light units and the β-galactosidase activity expressed from a co-transfected plasmid, whereby the value for cells transfected with pCMV5 is set as unity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It remained conceivable that the down-regulation of c-fosexpression could be due to something other than SRF cleavage. Since cleavage by caspases yields two SRF fragments, we chose to measure their direct influence on c-fos reporter expression. To this end, a mutant of SRF with altered DNA binding specificity was adopted. This mutant (MSRF), which was originally developed by Treisman and colleagues (38Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 43Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), contains part of the DNA-binding domain of MCM1 and binds to a sequence (M20) poorly recognized by SRF. A reporter containing the M20 element therefore has a low basal level of activity when transfected alone into BJAB cells (Fig. 5 c), which is elevated when MSRF is expressed in the cells. In contrast, expression of a carboxyl-terminal truncation of MSRF corresponding to the amino-terminal caspase fragment of SRF (NMS4) or the carboxyl-terminal fragment of SRF (SRFC) inhibits basal reporter expression slightly. Taken together, these results indicate that SRE-dependent c-fos expression is down-regulated early in apoptosis, that down-regulation is blocked by ZVAD, and that the fragments of SRF generated by caspase cleavage fail to maintain expression levels supported by full-length SRF.Given that the mutation of two predicted caspase sites produced a mutant of SRF resistant to caspase cleavage in vitro, we wished to see if the mutant was also resistant to cleavage in BJAB cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, BJAB cells expressing various forms of SRF were treated with CH11, and SRF cleavage was assessed by immunoblotting. We observed that mutation of the site at Asp254 had little effect on SRF cleavage in vivo, whereas cleavage was severely impaired by mutation of the site at Asp245 (Fig. 6). As"
https://openalex.org/W4236259684,"These are comments written by the Governing Council of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), the primary international organization dedicated to neuroimaging research. The purpose of these comments is to identify and frame issues concerning data sharing within the neuroimaging community. Data sharing has become an important issue in most fields of science. The neuroimaging community is no exception, and it clearly perceives potential benefits in such efforts, as have been realized in other fields such as genomics. At the same time, such efforts can be costly (both in time and expense), and there are important factors that differentiate brain imaging from other fields and that pose specific challenges to the generation of useful neuroimaging databases. These include the rapid pace of change in brain imaging technologies; the complexity of the variables that must be specified to meaningfully interpret the results (such as the method of image acquisition, behavioral design, and subject characteristics); and concerns about participant confidentiality. These issues are outlined with the goal of framing and promoting a public discussion of the benefits and risks of data sharing, which can inform the field of neuroimaging as well as others that face similar challenges."

https://openalex.org/W2066573186,"In a brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD), activated glial cells are observed surrounding amyloid plaque. In this study, to investigate the roles of carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTs) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in inflammatory processes possibly linked to neurodegeneration associated with AD, we examined the effects of the CT of APP with 105 amino acid residues (CT105) on the alteration of inflammatory mediators in rat cortical astrocytes and microglial cells and compared these effects to those of Aβ. We found that cytokines including interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor a and chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1a, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) were highly induced by 100 nM CT105 in a time-dependent manner, whereas the same amount of Aβ1-42 did not significantly induce these mediators. In addition, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitrite accumulation induced by CT105 were inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Furthermore, the addition of conditioned media from CT105-treated astrocytes to rat cortical neurons caused a decrease in cell viability. Pretreatment with IL-1ra, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (a specific inhibitor of NOS), and pyrollidine dithiocarbamate [an inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)] prevented neuronal cell death caused by conditioned media from CT105- treated astrocytes. Our results indicate that the activation of astrocytes by CT105 leads to neuronal cell death in vitro, presumably caused by the increase in nitric oxide derived from the induction of iNOS through the activation of cytokines and NF-κB. Thus, CT105 may contribute to stimulation of inflammatory processes linked to delayed neurodegeneration in AD."

In his Perspective, [Lemke][1] highlights the report by [Holland][2], who has found an interesting new mechanism for the formation of the Weddell Polynya, a hole the size of Great Britain that formed in the 1970s in three consecutive winters. The mechanism, which invokes eddies caused by a seamount, helps explain the formation of the polynya, but the question of why the polynya has not formed since the 1970s remains unanswered.

To understand its mechanism of action, we undertook cDNA differential display analysis to identify genes specifically regulated by HPR.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. HPR up-regulates prosaposin gene expressionThe c-DNA differential display screening was performed on mRNA extracted from T47D and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines treated or not for 24 h with 3 μM HPR. One RT-PCR band whose intensity was particularly elevated after retinoid exposure was excised from the gel and tested on Northern blots, where it hybridized to a transcript of ∼1.6 kb. Most important, the intensity of the signal was ∼2.4- to 3.0-fold higher after HPR treatment. The DNA sequence analysis of this RT-PCR band revealed homology with prosaposin, a gene coding for a multifunctional glycoprotein, precursor of four saposins that are localized partly within lysosomes, acting as a cofactors for sphingolipids hydrolysis, and partl..."
