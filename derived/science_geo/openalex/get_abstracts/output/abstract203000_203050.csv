https://openalex.org/W2077255588,"Immunization of host mice to homograft tissues prior to subcutaneous implantation of homograft bone' within diffusion chambers did not prevent new bone formation on the host side of the filter, thereby indicating its origin from host cells in response to a diffusible osteogenic inductor from within the chamber rather than from undetected escaping homograft cells"

The results indicated that the only necessary condition for a positive effect is that the model should be prominently displayed in the animal's visual environment."

https://openalex.org/W2014050778,"THE administration of allylisopropylacetamide (AIA) causes porphobilinogenuria in rabbits1, but it is not known whether this is caused by an increased synthesis of porphobilinogen (PBG) or a decreased utilization. PBG is synthesized in the liver via δ-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) from glycine and acetate or succinate and it seemed possible that a study of the effect of AIA on the metabolism of carbon-14-labelled glycine, acetate and succinate by rabbit liver might throw a light on the problem."

It appears that, once initiated, this process follows an irreversible course, at least in the aorta, since even 160 days after the initial insult there was no evidence of a reduction in the mineral content of the aorta. Attempts to inhibit calciferol-induced calcification of the aorta by the simultaneous administration of papain (which reduces the mucopolysaccharide content of the aorta) were unsuccessful3."
