https://openalex.org/W2122259760,"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) represent a serious patient safety issue. To prevent these infections, bundled interventions are increasingly recommended. We examine the extent of adoption of Central Line (CL) Bundle elements throughout US intensive care units (ICU) and determine their effectiveness in preventing CLABSIs.In this cross-sectional study, National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) hospitals provided the following: ICU-specific NHSN-reported rates of CLABSI/1,000 central line days; policies and compliance rates regarding bundle components; and other setting characteristics. In 250 hospitals the mean CLABSI rate was 2.1 per 1000 central line days and 49% reported having a written CL Bundle policy. However, of those that monitored compliance, only 38% reported very high compliance with the CL Bundle. Only when an ICU had a policy, monitored compliance, and had ≥ 95% compliance did CLABSI rates decrease. Complying with any one of three CL Bundle elements resulted in decreased CLABSI rates (β = -1.029, p = 0.015). If an ICU without good bundle compliance achieved high compliance with any one bundle element, we estimated that its CLABSI rate would decrease by 38%.In NHSN hospitals across the US, the CL Bundle is associated with lower infection rates only when compliance is high. Hospitals must target improving bundle implementation and compliance as opposed to simply instituting policies."
https://openalex.org/W2005123641,"One common criterion for classifying electrophysiological brain responses is based on the distinction between transient (i.e. event-related potentials, ERPs) and steady-state responses (SSRs). The generation of SSRs is usually attributed to the entrainment of a neural rhythm driven by the stimulus train. However, a more parsimonious account suggests that SSRs might result from the linear addition of the transient responses elicited by each stimulus. This study aimed to investigate this possibility.We recorded brain potentials elicited by a checkerboard stimulus reversing at different rates. We modeled SSRs by sequentially shifting and linearly adding rate-specific ERPs. Our results show a strong resemblance between recorded and synthetic SSRs, supporting the superposition hypothesis. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of entrainment of a neural oscillation at the stimulation frequency.This study provides evidence that visual SSRs can be explained as a superposition of transient ERPs. These findings have critical implications in our current understanding of brain oscillations. Contrary to the idea that neural networks can be tuned to a wide range of frequencies, our findings rather suggest that the oscillatory response of a given neural network is constrained within its natural frequency range."

Methods From June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2008, we estimated rates of acute lower respiratory tract illness (ALRI), diarrhea and acute febrile illness (AFI) among >50,000 persons participating in population-based surveillance in impoverished, rural western Kenya (Asembo) and an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya (Kibera). Field workers visited households every two weeks, collecting recent illness information and performing limited exams. Participants could access free high-quality care in a designated referral clinic in each site. Incidence and longitudinal prevalence were calculated and compared using Poisson regression. Results Incidence rates resulting in clinic visitation were the following: ALRI — 0.36 and 0.51 episodes per year for children <5 years and 0.067 and 0.026 for persons ≥5 years in Asembo and Kibera, respectively; diarrhea — 0.40 and 0.71 episodes per year for children <5 years and 0.09 and 0.062 for persons ≥5 years in Asembo and Kibera, respectively; AFI — 0.17 and 0.09 episodes per year for children <5 years and 0.03 and 0.015 for persons ≥5 years in Asembo and Kibera, respectively. Annually, based on household visits, children <5 years in Asembo and Kibera had 60 and 27 cough days, 10 and 8 diarrhea days, and 37 and 11 fever days, respectively. Household-based rates were higher than clinic rates for diarrhea and AFI, this difference being several-fold greater in the rural than urban site. Conclusions Individuals in poor Kenyan communities still suffer from a high burden of infectious diseases, which likely hampers their development. Urban slum and rural disease incidence and clinic utilization are sufficiently disparate in Africa to warrant data from both settings for estimating burden and focusing interventions."

The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of cancer-related health communications is patterned by race, ethnicity, language, and social class. Methodology/Principal Findings In a nationally-representative cross-sectional telephone survey, 5,187 U.S. adults provided information about demographic characteristics, cancer information seeking, and attention to and trust in health information from television, radio, newspaper, magazines, and the Internet. Cancer information seeking was lowest among Spanish-speaking Hispanics (odds ratio: 0.42; 95% confidence interval: 0.28–0.63) compared to non-Hispanic whites. Spanish-speaking Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to pay attention to (odds ratio: 3.10; 95% confidence interval: 2.07–4.66) and trust (odds ratio: 2.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.53–4.47) health messages from the radio. Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to pay attention to (odds ratio: 2.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.88–3.04) and trust (odds ratio: 2.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.61–2.90) health messages on television. Those who were college graduates tended to pay more attention to health information from newspapers (odds ratio: 1.98; 95% confidence interval: 1.42–2.75), magazines (odds ratio: 1.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.32–2.60), and the Internet (odds ratio: 4.74; 95% confidence interval: 2.70–8.31) and had less trust in cancer-related health information from television (odds ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.32–0.62) and radio (odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.34–0.86) compared to those who were not high school graduates. Conclusions/Significance Health media use is patterned by race, ethnicity, language and social class. Providing greater access to and enhancing the quality of health media by taking into account factors associated with social determinants may contribute to addressing social disparities in health."
https://openalex.org/W2094953064,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful initiators of innate and adaptive immune responses. Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasite arthropods that suppress host immunity by secreting immunomodulatory molecules in their saliva. Here, compounds present in Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick saliva with immunomodulatory effects on DC differentiation, cytokine production, and costimulatory molecule expression were identified. R. sanguineus tick saliva inhibited IL-12p40 and TNF-α while potentiating IL-10 cytokine production by bone marrow-derived DCs stimulated by Toll-like receptor-2, -4, and -9 agonists. To identify the molecules responsible for these effects, we fractionated the saliva through microcon filtration and reversed-phase HPLC and tested each fraction for DC maturation. Fractions with proven effects were analyzed by micro-HPLC tandem mass spectrometry or competition ELISA. Thus, we identified for the first time in tick saliva the purine nucleoside adenosine (concentration of ∼110 pmol/μl) as a potent anti-inflammatory salivary inhibitor of DC cytokine production. We also found prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ∼100 nm) with comparable effects in modulating cytokine production by DCs. Both Ado and PGE2 inhibited cytokine production by inducing cAMP-PKA signaling in DCs. Additionally, both Ado and PGE2 were able to inhibit expression of CD40 in mature DCs. Finally, flow cytometry analysis revealed that PGE2, but not Ado, is the differentiation inhibitor of bone marrow-derived DCs. The presence of non-protein molecules adenosine and PGE2 in tick saliva indicates an important evolutionary mechanism used by ticks to subvert host immune cells and allow them to successfully complete their blood meal and life cycle.

IntroductionTicks are phylogenetically distant from their hosts, but in general, these ectoparasites have developed, through their evolution, measures for adapting to host defense strategies. The most well studied approaches that ticks employ to evade host responses are the refined mixtures of proteic and non-protein molecules present in their saliva with anticlotting, anti-inflammatory, or immunomodulatory activities. As a result, a number of authors have demonstrated the suppression of cell-mediated and humorally mediated immune responses upon in vitro assays and following experimental models of tick infestations or naturally infested hosts (1Brown S.J.

In previous works, we have demonstrated the modulatory effects of saliva from Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks on differentiation, migration, and maturation of DCs (24Cavassani K.A. Aliberti J.C. Dias A.R. Silva J.S. Ferreira B.R. Immunology. 2005; 114: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Oliveira C.J. Cavassani K.A. Moré D.D. Garlet G.P. Aliberti J.C. Silva J.S.

Vet. Parasitol. 2010; 167: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite our wealth of knowledge, the molecules responsible for such effects have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we have identified for the first time the purine nucleoside adenosine (Ado), isolated directly from tick saliva, as an inhibitor of production of pro-inflammatory IL-12p40 and TNF-α cytokines and stimulator of production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 by murine DCs activated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We have also identified PGE2 in R. sanguineus tick saliva, which presented similar effects of Ado on cytokine production by DCs and additionally suppressed the differentiation of DCs from blood cell precursors. Our results also demonstrate that both Ado and PGE2 exert their modulatory effects on cytokine production by inducing a common cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Furthermore, both Ado and PGE2 were able to inhibit expression of CD40 in mature DCs and presented additive effects when administered together. Thus, this study demonstrates the central involvement of tick salivary Ado and PGE2 in modulation of the host inflammatory/immune responses. Moreover, the data presented here provide important insight to the evolution of host-tick interaction and provide a foundation for future pharmaceutical interventions that target non-protein molecules used by ticks to permit their blood feeding.DISCUSSIONThe discovery of new molecules produced by parasites has become an important venue of many researchers who are trying to comprehend host-parasite interactions. This tendency is growing because information about the biological activities, structure, ligand-binding affinities, and concentration of these molecules opens to a greater extent the array of possibilities for finding out how these organisms evade hemostatic, inflammatory, and immunologic host responses.Our group has worked to identify the molecules present in the saliva of the dog tick R. sanguineus with modulatory effects on diverse immune cells. Here, we identify for the first time in tick saliva the nucleoside Ado as a potent immunosuppressor of DCs. This study also demonstrates PGE2 from saliva of R. sanguineus ticks with comparable modulatory effects. Our data demonstrate clearly that both Ado and PGE2 cooperate in modulating the production of IL-12p40, TNF-α, and IL-10 cytokines and inhibiting expression of the stimulatory molecule CD40 on DCs activated with TLR agonists. The additive effect induced by Ado and PGE2 probably results from the capacity of both molecules to cooperate in induction of cAMP-PKA signaling in DCs.We demonstrated that salivary molecules from R. sanguineus ticks with a molecular mass below 5 kDa down-regulates production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α and up-regulates production of IL-10 by DCs stimulated with TLR-2, -4, and -9 agonists. These findings are of great interest, as IL-12p40 and TNF-α can induce functional maturation of DCs and could selectively stimulate their ability to induce Th1-type responses against ticks and tick-borne pathogens, although IL-10 is well known as an immunosuppressive cytokine (36Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 37D'Andrea A. Aste-Amezaga M. Valiante N.M. Ma X. Kubin M. Trinchieri G. J. Exp.

Pathol. 2008; 214: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Using microcon filtration and reversed-phase HPLC MS/MS, we found the nucleoside Ado in the saliva of R. sanguineus ticks. The saliva fraction that contained Ado presented a relevant effect on the biology of DCs, which may have important implications for our understanding of tick-host interactions. It is known that Ado is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates a wide variety of immunologic functions in antigen-presenting cells (39Haskó G. Pacher P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 40Haskó G. Linden J. Cronstein B. Pacher P. Nat. Rev.

It impairs TNF-α- and IL-12p40-mediated responses to LPS in human and murine DCs while enhancing production of IL-10 (43Panther E. Corinti S. Idzko M. Herouy Y. Napp M. la Sala A. Girolomoni G.

Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 33-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 45Haskó G. Szabó C. Németh Z.H. Kvetan V. Pastores S.M. Vizi E.S. J.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, others have shown that Ado-induced inhibition of TNF-α production by macrophages is not restricted to TLR-4-mediated activation, because Ado also down-modulates TNF-α production when cells are activated by TLR-2, -3, -7, and -9 agonists (47Pinhal-Enfield G. Ramanathan M. Hasko G. Vogel S.N. Salzman A.L. Boons G.J. Leibovich S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 711-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).Besides blocking LPS-induced TNF-α production, Ado markedly induces heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in inflamed tissues (48Haschemi A. Wagner O. Marculescu R. Wegiel B. Robson S.C. Gagliani N. Gallo D. Chen J.F. Bach F.H. Otterbein L.E. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is noteworthy because ticks are blood feeders and abundant quantities of heme, a potent pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory agent, are probably released at the tick feeding site. HO-1 removes heme and, furthermore, generates three metabolites, carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron, and biliverdin, all of which have an immune protective effect (49Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). A positive feedback loop exists among Ado, HO-1, and CO and resolves the inflammatory response (48Haschemi A. Wagner O. Marculescu R. Wegiel B. Robson S.C. Gagliani N. Gallo D. Chen J.F. Bach F.H. Otterbein L.E. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Blocking of HO-1 by RNA interference abrogates the effects of adenosine on TNF-α and HO-1 in macrophages. Another venue in which tick salivary Ado may disrupt host defenses is the migration of phagocytic cells to the site of tissue damage caused by tick feeding. Signaling by means of purinergic receptors has been recently shown to be essential for chemotaxis of macrophages in a gradient of C5a (50Kronlage M. Song J. Sorokin L. Isfort K. Schwerdtle T. Leipziger J. Robaye B. Conley P.B. Kim H.C. Sargin S. Schön P. Schwab A. Hanley P.J. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This requires sequential hydrolysis of nucleotides ending in Ado, and an excess of Ado provided by tick saliva may disrupt the sequence of events resulting in correct chemotactic navigation.Components from tick saliva and salivary glands, including Ado, inhibit the biology of not only DCs but that of many other immune cells including neutrophils, mast cells, NK cells, and T and B cells (42Kumar V. Sharma A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 616: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 51Ribeiro J.M. Evans P.M. MacSwain J.L. Sauer J. Exp.

This can be particularly relevant, as the tick Ado identified in this work could be responsible for the effects described above. Further studies must be performed to test this hypothesis. Furthermore, Ado possibly has an important role in evolution as an evasion mechanism for blood-sucking parasites. Indeed, salivary glands of other classes of hematophagous arthropods, notably sand flies Phlebotomus argentipes and Phlebotomus papatasi (55Ribeiro J.M. Katz O. Pannell L.K. Waitumbi J. Warburg A. J.

Parasitol. 2001; 87: 915-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), also produce Ado; however, it has not yet been tested for its immunomodulatory properties.We found another fraction of R. sanguineus tick saliva that had a modulatory effect on cytokine production by DCs. Using a competition ELISA, we ascertained that this fraction contained PGE2 in a considerable amount. Similarly to data described here, saliva of many tick species has been shown to contain PGE2; moreover, it has been associated with the saliva effect on suppression of host immune responses (13Sá-Nunes A.

PGE2 can also act directly on T cells by impairing production of IL-2 and IFN-γ (64Katamura K. Shintaku N. Yamauchi Y. Fukui T. Ohshima Y. Mayumi M. Furusho K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4604-4612PubMed Google Scholar), which also could induce a Th2-type response. In support of our findings, PGE2 isolated from I. scapularis saliva is the major inhibitor of IL-12 and TNF-α induced by LPS-stimulated DCs (13Sá-Nunes A. Bafica A. Lucas D.A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Andersen J.F. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, PGE2 concentrations in I. scapularis saliva were 10–100-fold higher than that found in our study. 3A. Sá-Nunes, personal communication. This might explain why R. sanguineus saliva needs an additional molecule, Ado, to reach modulatory activities in pharmacological levels.Related to Ado- and PGE2-induced intracellular cascade, we observed as expected that both molecules in the saliva fractions were able to induce production of cAMP by DCs; furthermore, when combined, they showed an additive effect. Interestingly, Ado or PGE2 used individually or in combination lose their modulatory activity when DCs are preincubated with H-89, a PKA inhibitor. This result is important because we demonstrate that both molecules affect production of cytokines by DCs by a common signal transduction pathway, linking increased production of cAMP and PKA activation. At the same line, it was demonstrated that Ado and PGE2 produced by human regulatory T cells have additive effects in down-regulating functions of immune cells through intracellular cAMP-PKA signaling (65Mandapathil M. Szczepanski M.J. Szajnik M. Ren J. Jackson E.K. Johnson J.T. Gorelik E. Lang S. Whiteside T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27571-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is essential to mention that the treatment of DCs with the PKA inhibitor did not restore completely the production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α, suggesting that Ado and PGE2 may modulate DCs via signaling pathways other than cAMP-PKA. Our data are in accordance with those of Vassiliou et al. (60Vassiliou E. Jing H. Ganea D. Cell. Immunol. 2003; 223: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), who reported that inhibition of LPS-stimulated TNF-α production in murine DCs by PGE2 was only partially prevented by the PKA inhibitor H-89. In support of this possibility, a recent work has revealed that alternative cAMP-binding targets, such as the guanine nucleotide exchange protein (Epac-1), can be also responsible for inhibition of TNF-α cytokine production in DCs (66Aronoff D.M. Carstens J.K. Chen G.H. Toews G.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006; 26: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Enhancement of costimulatory and stimulatory molecules on the surface of DCs is fundamental to induce a proper T cell response. Here, we demonstrate that tick saliva suppressed expression of CD40 and CD86 in DCs. Blocking binding of CD40 with its ligand CD40L (CD154) prevents T cell-dependent antibody production and reduces CD4+ T cell priming and expansion, which can impair the development of a protective host response to parasitic infections (67Grewal I.S. Xu J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 68Holländer G.A. Castigli E. Kulbacki R. Su M. Burakoff S.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4994-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 69O'Sullivan B. Thomas R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 23: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 70Subauste C.S. Semin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was shown that the blockage of CD40-CD154 and CD86-CD28 interactions could result in T cell anergy and high IL-10 production (71Van Gool S.W. Vermeiren J. Rafiq K. Lorr K. de Boer M. Ceuppens J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This aspect is relevant because the modulatory effect on cytokine production, together with reduction in expression of CD40 and CD86, could be an important “double-escape” mechanism used by ticks to induce regulatory T cells, T cell anergy, or to inhibit antigen presentation. These host conditions could probably help blood-feeding arthropods to complete their meal and, moreover, could facilitate transmission of vector-borne pathogens during the parasitic stage. Interestingly, only CD40 but not CD86 expression was down-regulated by saliva fractions containing Ado and/or PGE2. The explanation for why crude tick saliva and saliva filtrate impair CD86 expression but saliva fractions individually do not is unknown. Possibly a combination of saliva fractions is required. Additional studies must be done to identify these molecules.Finally, we showed that PGE2 from saliva dramatically inhibits differentiation of BM-derived DCs. These results are in accordance with previous results showing that PGE2 inhibits differentiation of murine and human DCs (72Yang L. Yamagata N. Yadav R. Brandon S. Courtney R.L. Morrow J.D. Shyr Y. Boothby M. Joyce S. Carbone D.P. Breyer R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 73Spaggiari G.M. Abdelrazik H. Becchetti F. Moretta L. Blood. 2009; 113: 6576-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The effect of R. sanguineus saliva in inhibiting differentiation of DCs was previously demonstrated by Cavassani et al. (24Cavassani K.A. Aliberti J.C. Dias A.R. Silva J.S. Ferreira B.R. Immunology. 2005; 114: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, only now has the molecule responsible for this effect been identified. Saliva fractions that contain Ado showed no effect on DC differentiation, possibly explained by work demonstrating that Ado is related to macrophage inhibition and DC differentiation in human (74Najar H.M. Ruhl S. Bru-Capdeville A.C. Peters J.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 75Giordano D. Magaletti D.M. Clark E.A. Beavo J.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6421-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but not in murine (76Novitskiy S.V. Ryzhov S. Zaynagetdinov R. Goldstein A.E. Huang Y. Tikhomirov O.Y. Blackburn M.R. Biaggioni I. Carbone D.P. Feoktistov I. Dikov M.M. Blood. 2008; 112: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) cells. Modulation of BM cells by PGE2 during differentiation to DCs is vitally important because in addition to inhibiting of the number of DCs differentiated, the DCs differentiated in the presence of PGE2 produce high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induce a Th2-type immune response (76Novitskiy S.V. Ryzhov S. Zaynagetdinov R. Goldstein A.E. Huang Y. Tikhomirov O.Y. Blackburn M.R. Biaggioni I. Carbone D.P. Feoktistov I. Dikov M.M. Blood. 2008; 112: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), a phenotype associated with immune suppression and tolerance to ticks.In conclusion, we describe for the first time Ado as one of the most important immunomodulatory molecules identified to date in a tick saliva. This molecule, produced and secreted in high concentration, is able to modulate almost all cells of the immune system (42Kumar V. Sharma A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 616: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), in addition to being vasodilatory and inhibiting platelet aggregation (77Collis M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 78Haslam R.J. Rosson G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 528-544PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we also found PGE2 in R. sanguineus saliva, which combined with Ado may augment anti-inflammatory and immunologic responses of their hosts. It is important to highlight that both salivary Ado and PGE2 are non-protein endogenous small host molecules, and accordingly no host immune responses can be directed against them. Taken together, our results support the concept that the biological activities of Ado and PGE2 counteract most of the host defenses and should help the tick to feed and reproduce. IntroductionTicks are phylogenetically distant from their hosts, but in general, these ectoparasites have developed, through their evolution, measures for adapting to host defense strategies. The most well studied approaches that ticks employ to evade host responses are the refined mixtures of proteic and non-protein molecules present in their saliva with anticlotting, anti-inflammatory, or immunomodulatory activities. As a result, a number of authors have demonstrated the suppression of cell-mediated and humorally mediated immune responses upon in vitro assays and following experimental models of tick infestations or naturally infested hosts (1Brown S.J.

To date, a diversity of proteic (e.g. chitinases, mucins, ixostatins, cystatins, defensins, hyaluronidases, Kunitz, lectins, and lipocalins) and non-protein molecules (e.g. prostaglandins and endocannabinoids) have been characterized (9Valenzuela J.G.

In previous works, we have demonstrated the modulatory effects of saliva from Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks on differentiation, migration, and maturation of DCs (24Cavassani K.A. Aliberti J.C. Dias A.R. Silva J.S. Ferreira B.R. Immunology. 2005; 114: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Oliveira C.J. Cavassani K.A. Moré D.D. Garlet G.P. Aliberti J.C. Silva J.S.

Vet. Parasitol. 2010; 167: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite our wealth of knowledge, the molecules responsible for such effects have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we have identified for the first time the purine nucleoside adenosine (Ado), isolated directly from tick saliva, as an inhibitor of production of pro-inflammatory IL-12p40 and TNF-α cytokines and stimulator of production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 by murine DCs activated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. We have also identified PGE2 in R. sanguineus tick saliva, which presented similar effects of Ado on cytokine production by DCs and additionally suppressed the differentiation of DCs from blood cell precursors. Our results also demonstrate that both Ado and PGE2 exert their modulatory effects on cytokine production by inducing a common cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Furthermore, both Ado and PGE2 were able to inhibit expression of CD40 in mature DCs and presented additive effects when administered together. Thus, this study demonstrates the central involvement of tick salivary Ado and PGE2 in modulation of the host inflammatory/immune responses. Moreover, the data presented here provide important insight to the evolution of host-tick interaction and provide a foundation for future pharmaceutical interventions that target non-protein molecules used by ticks to permit their blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2123490182,"The dynamic turnover of integrin-mediated adhesions is important for cell migration. Paxillin is an adaptor protein that localizes to focal adhesions and has been implicated in cell motility. We previously reported that calpain-mediated proteolysis of talin1 and focal adhesion kinase mediates adhesion disassembly in motile cells. To determine whether calpain-mediated paxillin proteolysis regulates focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility, we mapped the preferred calpain proteolytic site in paxillin. The cleavage site is between the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs and generates a C-terminal fragment that is similar in size to the alternative product paxillin delta. The calpain-generated proteolytic fragment, like paxillin delta, functions as a paxillin antagonist and impairs focal adhesion disassembly and migration. We generated mutant paxillin with a point mutation (S95G) that renders it partially resistant to calpain proteolysis. Paxillin-deficient cells that express paxillin S95G display increased turnover of zyxin-containing adhesions using time-lapse microscopy and also show increased migration. Moreover, cancer-associated somatic mutations in paxillin are common in the N-terminal region between the LD1 and LD2 motifs and confer partial calpain resistance. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin as a negative regulator of focal adhesion dynamics and migration that may function to limit cancer cell invasion.

The dynamic regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is important for cell migration in both normal and pathological processes, including tumor invasion and metastasis. Integrin-mediated adhesions assemble at the leading edge of cells and establish a structural link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. The correct spatial and temporal control of adhesion formation and disassembly at both the leading and trailing edge of cells is important for efficient cell migration. However, the mechanisms that regulate the turnover of adhesions in motile cells are still not well understood. Paxillin is an adaptor and phospho-protein that localizes to focal adhesions. Paxillin serves an important scaffolding function at focal adhesions by recruiting and binding to many signaling and structural proteins (1Deakin N.O. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). First identified as a 68-kDa protein that was heavily phosphorylated in Src-transformed fibroblasts (2Glenney Jr., J.R.

Paxillin expression and function is highly regulated by both alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications (4Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). An internal, alternative translation start site in paxillin is conserved in all species and produces the paxillin isoform known as paxillin delta (4Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), which functions as a paxillin antagonist that impairs cell migration (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Paxillin can also be modified by calpain-mediated proteolysis (6Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J.

Mutations were introduced into the paxillin calpain cleavage by site-directed mutagenesis of pEGFP-C1-paxillin or pcDNA3.1-paxillin-FLAG: 5′ CTAGTGCCAAAAGCGGCAGTGCCTCTGTTC (S95G primer) and 5′CAGTGCCTCTGTTGGAAGAGACGGGCTCAG (P100G primer). pENTR21-human paxillin (variant 2) mRNA was purchased from Invitrogen, amplified with a forward primer containing an AccIII site and a reverse primer containing a HindIII site, followed by ligation into pEGFP-C1 vector. Mutations were introduced into pEGFP-C1 human paxillin by site-directed mutagenesis: 5′CTCAGGACAGTGTTGCCTCTCCGTG (G105A primer) and CAAGCAGAAATCAACTGACGGTTCACCCACCG (A127T primer). HEK 293, H522, A431, and HeLa cells were purchased from the ATCC. MDA-231 cells were provided by Dr. Alan Raepraeger (University of Wisconsin-Madison). HEK, A431, and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics. H522 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. HEK transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation methods. Cells were analyzed 24 h posttransfection. HeLa transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Where indicated, HeLa cells were serum-starved for 16–18 h in DMEM containing 2% FBS. HeLa control and paxillin siRNA cells were generated by retroviral infection with pSUPER.retro.puro (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) containing shRNA against nontargeting sequence or human paxillin: 5′TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT3′ (control); 5′GCCTCTCCAGCAATAATGT3′ (target sequence for paxillin si-A); and 5′TGGTGACAGTCCAAACCAC3′ (target sequence for paxillin si-B). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Paxillin-FLAG was expressed in HEK 293 cells. 24–48 h later, cells were plated on dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 1 h. Media was exchanged with complete media containing a vehicle control, 50 μg/ml ALLM or 1 μm ionomycin, and 10 mm CaCl2, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h, which were washed extensively with lysis buffer. Beads were boiled in non-reducing sample buffer to elute protein and then separated on SDS-PAGE gels. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), stained with Coomassie Blue, and an individual band was subjected to N-terminal sequencing (performed at the Baylor College of Medicine Protein Chemistry/Proteomics core). Cells were plated on coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin in complete media for 6 h. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (13Cortesio C.L. Chan K.T. Perrin B.J. Burton N.O. Zhang S. Zhang Z.Y. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transwell assays were performed with 8-μm porous chambers (Fisher) and coated with10 μg/ml fibronectin on the top and bottom according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 10% FBS was used as chemoattractant in the lower compartment. Cells were allowed to migrate through the membrane for 6 h, 48 h after transient expression of the indicated constructs. Only experiments with ∼70% transient transfection efficiency were used for the migration assays. Expression was confirmed by Western immunoblotting for GFP. The cells that migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were then fixed and stained using a HEMA Stain 3 kit (Fisher). Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded on 6–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were imaged with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Omaha, NE). Live fluorescence microscopy and quantification of adhesion dynamics was performed 1–2 h after cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass-bottom dishes to analyze the dynamics of early adhesions. Fluorescence imaging of live cells was performed using a 60× objective on a Nikon inverted microscope housed in a 37 °C closed system. Glass-bottom dishes were acid-washed and coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and nonessential amino acids and allowed to adhere for 30 min, after which time the media was replaced with Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Fluorescent images were then captured every 2 min for 2 h using MetaVue imaging software for cells with equivalent GFP expression (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). Quantification of adhesion dynamics was performed as described previously (3Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 14Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Measurements were made from 10–15 adhesions from at least six individual cells per condition over three separate days. For statistical comparison, the two-tailed, paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test was used, with p values of <0.05 considered significant. Previous studies have demonstrated that paxillin is a calpain substrate (6Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Franco S. Perrin B. Huttenlocher A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, how calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin affects adhesion dynamics and cell migration has not been previously addressed. To determine how calpain proteolysis of paxillin regulates adhesion turnover and migration, we mapped the calpain proteolytic site in paxillin. HEK 293 cells that express paxillin-FLAG were cultured in the presence or absence of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, to increase calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate calpain specificity, cells were treated with the calpain inhibitor ALLM or a combination of both ionomycin and ALLM (Fig. 1A). A predominant calpain-dependent paxillin fragment of ∼55 kDa was identified, consistent with reports published previously (6Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Franco S. Perrin B. Huttenlocher A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The in vivo cleavage fragment was isolated, and the proteolytic site was mapped by N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 1B). The predominant proteolytic site is in the N-terminal region of paxillin after Ser-96 between the LD1 and LD2 motifs (Fig. 1C). The calpain proteolytic site is in close proximity to the alternative start site that generates the inhibitory fragment paxillin delta at Met-133 (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our findings indicate that calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin generates a fragment that is similar in size to the alternative product paxillin delta. Previous work demonstrated that expression of paxillin delta is inhibitory to cell migration (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether calpain proteolysis of paxillin also generates an inhibitory fragment of paxillin, we characterized the effects of paxillin delta or the calpain-mediated C-terminal fragment on cell migration of HeLa cells. Paxillin delta and the cleavage fragment were expressed at approximately equal levels in HeLa cells confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2), and both localized to focal adhesions (Fig. 3). Transient expression of either paxillin delta or the calpain proteolytic fragment of paxillin impaired HeLa (Fig. 2) and HEK 293 cell migration (data not shown) using a transwell assay. The inhibitory effects of the calpain-mediated proteolytic fragment on migration were modest but statistically significant. The findings suggest that expression of the calpain-generated paxillin fragment, as previously reported for paxillin delta (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), impairs cell migration.FIGURE 3The calpain-generated paxillin fragment and paxillin delta inhibit focal adhesion turnover. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with wild-type GFP-paxillin, GFP-paxillin delta, or GFP-paxillin cleavage fragment and RFP-zyxin. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass-bottom dishes and analyzed by time-lapse fluorescent microscopy. Images on the left show localization of wild-type GFP-paxillin, paxillin delta, and cleaved paxillin at focal adhesions. Time-lapse montages show representative images of RFP-zyxin dynamics in cells co-expressing RFP-zyxin and wild-type GFP-paxillin (WT), paxillin delta, or cleaved paxillin over a period of 80 min. Scale bar = 10 μm. See corresponding supplemental movies 1–3. Duration was measured as the time elapsed between the appearance and dissolution of an observed adhesion. Rate constants for net adhesion assembly and disassembly were calculated from plots of fluorescence intensities of RFP-zyxin over time, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data for each condition are mean ± S.E. At least 50 adhesions were measured for each condition, from at least eight different cells, on three independent days. *, p < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test) compared with wild-type GFP-paxillin-expressing cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have demonstrated that calpain-mediated proteolysis of either FAK or talin regulates focal adhesion disassembly (9Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To determine whether the calpain proteolytic fragment of paxillin affects focal adhesion dynamics, live time-lapse imaging was performed on RFP-zyxin-containing focal adhesions in cells that express wild-type GFP-paxillin, GFP-paxillin delta, or the GFP-paxillin cleavage fragment (Fig. 3 and supplemental movies 1–3). The duration of RFP-zyxin-containing adhesions was increased ∼2-fold in cells expressing paxillin delta or the cleaved form of paxillin. Moreover, focal adhesion disassembly rates were significantly impaired in cells that express either paxillin delta or the paxillin fragment compared with full-length paxillin (Fig. 3). Taken together, the findings suggest that the calpain-mediated paxillin fragment, like paxillin delta, impairs focal adhesion turnover. To further address the effects of calpain proteolysis of paxillin on adhesion dynamics, we generated a calpain-resistant mutant of paxillin through site-directed mutagenesis at several residues near the cleavage site (Fig. 4A). Point mutations at serine 95 or proline 100 (S95G or P100G) impaired calpain-mediated proteolysis of GFP-paxillin (Fig. 4B) or paxillin-FLAG (data not shown). Treatment of HEK cells that express wild-type GFP-paxillin with ionomycin induced the generation of a 35-kDa calpain-mediated proteolytic fragment compared with vehicle alone (data not shown). Quantification of susceptibility to calpain-mediated proteolysis of the paxillin mutants demonstrated that the S95G mutation rendered paxillin ∼50% resistant to calpain proteolysis compared with wild-type paxillin in the presence of ionomycin (Fig. 4B). Several other mutations near the cleavage site, including deletion mutations, also rendered paxillin only partially resistant to calpain proteolysis (data not shown), suggesting that there is flexibility in the precise site of calpain proteolysis. This is in contrast to other focal adhesion proteins, talin and FAK, where point mutations rendered the substrates almost completely calpain-resistant (9Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Calpain-resistant GFP-paxillin retained several properties of wild-type paxillin, including phosphorylation at tyrosine 31 and 118 (Fig. 4C) and interactions with specific binding proteins, including vinculin (data not shown). To determine whether the calpain-resistant paxillin affects cell migration, we depleted endogenous paxillin in HeLa cells using siRNA and expressed either wild-type GFP-paxillin or calpain-resistant GFP-paxillin (Fig. 5A). Paxillin levels were decreased by ∼70% in paxillin-deficient cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5A). Paxillin-deficient HeLa cells (target B) were transiently transfected with wild-type or calpain-resistant (S95G) GFP-paxillin and assayed for their ability to migrate by transwell assay (Fig. 5B). We observed increased migration with ectopic expression of calpain-resistant paxillin compared with wild-type paxillin despite approximately equal expression levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that calpain proteolysis of paxillin may function to limit cell migration. To determine whether paxillin proteolysis affects focal adhesion dynamics, we examined the dynamics of RFP-zyxin to quantify focal adhesion dynamics in paxillin-deficient cells expressing either wild-type GFP-paxillin or calpain-resistant paxillin (S95G) (Fig. 5C and supplemental movies 4 and 5). Both wild-type and calpain-resistant GFP-paxillin localized to focal adhesions (Fig. 5C). The duration of RFP-zyxin-containing adhesions was significantly reduced by ∼10 min in cells expressing calpain-resistant paxillin compared with wild-type paxillin (Fig. 5C). There was also a slight but not statistically significant increase in assembly and disassembly rates of RFP-zyxin in paxillin-deficient cells expressing calpain-resistant paxillin compared with wild-type paxillin (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our findings indicate that calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin impairs focal adhesion turnover. Previous studies have reported that calpain-mediated proteolysis of substrates is enhanced in Src-transformed cells (15Carragher N.O. Fonseca B.D. Frame M.C. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 53-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that calpain expression is increased in several cancer cell lines (16Wang Y. Klijn J.G. Zhang Y. Sieuwerts A.M. Look M.P. Yang F. Talantov D. Timmermans M. Meijer-van Gelder M.E. Yu J. Jatkoe T. Berns E.M. Atkins D. Foekens J.A.

To determine whether endogenous paxillin is cleaved in breast and lung cancer, we screened a series of breast and lung cancer cell lines for paxillin proteolysis. We observed detectable levels of endogenous calpain-mediated paxillin proteolysis in several invasive cancer cell lines, including MDA-231 and A431 breast cancer cells and H522 lung cancer cells, even in the absence of ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 6), suggesting that paxillin is an endogenous calpain substrate in cancer cell lines. Interestingly, several somatic mutations of paxillin have been identified from human lung cancer specimens that reside in the N-terminal region of paxillin close to the calpain proteolytic site. The most common mutation, A127T, results in a more invasive phenotype with enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion (19Jagadeeswaran R. Surawska H. Krishnaswamy S. Janamanchi V. Mackinnon A.C. Seiwert T.Y. Loganathan S. Kanteti R. Reichman T. Nallasura V. Schwartz S. Faoro L. Wang Y.C. Girard L. Tretiakova M.S. Ahmed S. Zumba O. Soulii L. Bindokas V.P. Szeto L.L. Gordon G.J. Bueno R.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that several of these mutations span a region between the LD1 and LD2 motifs near the calpain proteolytic site (Fig. 7A). To determine whether these mutations alter calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin, we generated GFP-tagged versions of wild-type human paxillin and two of the most frequent somatic mutations, G105A and A127T (Fig. 7A). HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type, G105A, or A127T GFP-paxillin were treated with ionomycin to stimulate calpain activity (Fig. 7B). Both the G105A and A127T mutations were resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis compared with wild-type GFP-paxillin (Fig. 7B). In particular, the most common mutation, A127T, was ∼50% resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 7B). Paxillin-deficient cells expressing either cancer-associated mutation exhibited enhanced transwell migration compared with wild-type paxillin (Fig. 7C). To determine whether the A127T mutation modulates focal adhesion dynamics, we performed live imaging of RFP-zyxin containing focal adhesions in paxillin-deficient HeLa cells expressing either wild-type human GFP-paxillin or the calpain-resistant GFP-paxillin A127T (Fig. 8 and supplemental movies 6 and 7). The duration of RFP-zyxin containing adhesions was significantly reduced by ∼10 min in cells expressing the A127T mutation compared with wild-type paxillin (Fig. 8). This reduction in focal adhesion duration was similar to that observed in cells expressing the calpain-resistant paxillin S95G (Fig. 5C). Previous studies have demonstrated that calpain is necessary for efficient cancer cell migration and invasion (13Cortesio C.L. Chan K.T. Perrin B.J. Burton N.O. Zhang S. Zhang Z.Y. Huttenlocher A. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a novel inhibitory role for calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin in adhesion dynamics and cell migration. Calpain proteolysis of paxillin occurs between the LD1 and LD2 motifs and generates a C-terminal fragment that is similar in size to the alternative product paxillin delta. The calpain-proteolytic fragment of paxillin, like paxillin delta, functions as a paxillin antagonist that impairs adhesion turnover and cell migration in HeLa cells. In contrast, expression of calpain-resistant paxillin is associated with increased cell migration and enhanced turnover of zyxin-containing focal adhesions compared with wild-type paxillin. Collectively, our findings identify a novel inhibitory role for calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin in regulating focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. Calpains target many adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins to regulate adhesion turnover and cell migration. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of the cytoskeletal proteins talin (14Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and FAK (9Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) is important for efficient adhesion dynamics. Moreover, calpain-mediated proteolysis of the actin-associated protein cortactin has been shown to positively regulate membrane protrusion (21Perrin B.J. Amann K.J. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and invadopodia dynamics (13Cortesio C.L. Chan K.T. Perrin B.J. Burton N.O. Zhang S. Zhang Z.Y. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Calpains have also been implicated in regulating cell spreading through proteolysis of the β-integrin cytoplasmic tail (22Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Calpain-mediated proteolysis of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins is generally associated with increased cell migration and invasion, consistent with the observation that calpains are up-regulated in invasive cancers (16Wang Y. Klijn J.G. Zhang Y. Sieuwerts A.M. Look M.P. Yang F. Talantov D. Timmermans M. Meijer-van Gelder M.E. Yu J. Jatkoe T. Berns E.M. Atkins D. Foekens J.A.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10700-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and have been suggested as a potential therapeutic target (20Mamoune A. Luo J.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4632-4640PubMed Google Scholar). It is intriguing that, in contrast to other substrates, we find that calpain proteolysis of paxillin is inhibitory to cell migration and adhesion dynamics, suggesting that calpains may be either positive or negative regulators of cell migration and invasion, depending on the substrate that is targeted (Fig. 9). It is interesting that calpain proteolysis of paxillin generates a fragment similar to paxillin delta (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that also antagonizes the function of endogenous paxillin in adhesion dynamics and cell migration. Calpain proteolysis generates an inhibitory paxillin fragment locally, providing a means to temporally and spatially regulate paxillin function in motile cells. It is possible that generation of cleaved paxillin may compensate for a lack of paxillin delta expression. This idea is consistent with the observation that cleavage of endogenous paxillin is a minor event in most cell types (data not shown), although endogenous cleavage is observed in many different cancer cell lines. Interestingly, calpain proteolysis of FAK generates a fragment similar in size to the alternative transcript known as FRNK; however, the direct consequence of the calpain-generated FAK fragment has not been tested (9Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Calpain-mediated proteolysis of protein kinase C also generates a fragment similar in size to an alternative protein kinase C gene transcript (26Bougie J.K. Lim T. Farah C.A. Manjunath V. Nagakura I. Ferraro G.B. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that calpain proteolysis may serve to generate protein fragments with redundant functions to alternative transcripts and translated products that may mediate crosstalk between transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms of cell signaling. Recent evidence has shown that single amino acid mutations between the LD1 and LD2 motifs of paxillin are correlated with enhanced invasive potential of cancer cells (19Jagadeeswaran R. Surawska H. Krishnaswamy S. Janamanchi V. Mackinnon A.C. Seiwert T.Y. Loganathan S. Kanteti R. Reichman T. Nallasura V. Schwartz S. Faoro L. Wang Y.C. Girard L. Tretiakova M.S. Ahmed S. Zumba O. Soulii L. Bindokas V.P. Szeto L.L. Gordon G.J. Bueno R. Sugarbaker D. Lingen M.W. Sattler M. Krausz T. Vigneswaran W. Natarajan V. Minna J. Vokes E.E. Ferguson M.K. Husain A.N. Salgia R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that two of the paxillin mutations previously identified in cancer cells affect susceptibility to calpain proteolysis (Fig. 6C). These findings raise the interesting possibility that somatic mutations in paxillin induced during cell transformation may result in enhanced invasive potential, at least in part by rendering paxillin resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis, preventing the generation of an inhibitory paxillin proteolytic fragment. A future challenge will be to determine the mechanism by which the calpain proteolysis of paxillin impairs cell motility. The mechanism by which paxillin delta inhibits cell migration is still largely unknown (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is likely that paxillin delta and the paxillin calpain fragment inhibit adhesion turnover and migration by similar mechanisms and likely involves changes in binding interactions. Several proteins preferentially bind to the LD1 domain of paxillin, including actopaxin (27Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies indicate that separation of the LD1 domain from paxillin would alter interactions with key players such as actopaxin and integrin-linked kinase and may modulate adhesion dynamics (30Wang X.

In accordance, we observed altered adhesion dynamics upon expression of paxillin delta and the paxillin calpain cleavage fragment, which lack the LD1 domain (Fig. 3). It is likely that the abrogation of these interactions upon calpain proteolysis of paxillin plays some role in the altered adhesion dynamics and migration in cells expressing paxillin delta and the paxillin cleavage fragment. Alternatively, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 promotes association with Crk and is necessary for efficient cell migration (32Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the absence of these phosphorylation sites in paxillin delta prevents Crk association, thereby inhibiting cell migration (5Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Hetey S.E. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4849-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, an important difference between paxillin delta and the calpain-generated fragment of paxillin is that the cleavage product lacks the Tyr-31 site but still contains the Tyr-118 site. If the calpain-generated fragment and paxillin delta function similarly to inhibit cell migration, this would suggest that the mechanism does not involve phosphorylation at Tyr-118. In summary, our findings support a novel role for calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin in limiting cell migration, at least in part by affecting focal adhesion dynamics and maturation. Future mechanistic studies are necessary to determine the relationship between paxillin delta and calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin in cells. A challenge for future investigation will also be to determine the physiological relevance of somatic mutations in paxillin that render paxillin partially resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2001746866,"Abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein are hallmarks of a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased tau phosphorylation is assumed to represent an early event in pathogenesis and a pivotal aspect for aggregation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. However, the regulation of tau phosphorylation in vivo and the causes for its increased stage of phosphorylation in AD are still not well understood, a fact that is primarily based on the lack of adequate animal models. Recently we described the reversible formation of highly phosphorylated tau protein in hibernating European ground squirrels. Hence, mammalian hibernation represents a model system very well suited to study molecular mechanisms of both tau phosphorylation and dephosphorylation under in vivo physiological conditions. Here, we analysed the extent and kinetics of hibernation-state dependent tau phosphorylation in various brain regions of three species of hibernating mammals: arctic ground squirrels, Syrian hamsters and black bears. Overall, tau protein was highly phosphorylated in torpor states and phosphorylation levels decreased after arousal in all species. Differences between brain regions, hibernation-states and phosphosites were observed with respect to degree and kinetics of tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, we tested the phosphate net turnover of tau protein to analyse potential alterations in kinase and/or phosphatase activities during hibernation. Our results demonstrate that the hibernation-state dependent phosphorylation of tau protein is specifically regulated but involves, in addition, passive, temperature driven regulatory mechanisms. By determining the activity-state profile for key enzymes of tau phosphorylation we could identify kinases potentially involved in the differentially regulated, reversible tau phosphorylation that occurs during hibernation. We show that in black bears hibernation is associated with conformational changes of highly phosphorylated tau protein that are typically related to neuropathological alterations. The particular hibernation characteristics of black bears with a continuous torpor period and an only slightly decreased body temperature, therefore, potentially reflects the limitations of this adaptive reaction pattern and, thus, might indicate a transitional state of a physiological process."
https://openalex.org/W2013030147,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium of clinical importance, forms more robust biofilm during anaerobic respiration, a mode of growth presumed to occur in abnormally thickened mucus layer lining the cystic fibrosis (CF) patient airway. However, molecular basis behind this anaerobiosis-triggered robust biofilm formation is not clearly defined yet. Here, we identified a morphological change naturally accompanied by anaerobic respiration in P. aeruginosa and investigated its effect on the biofilm formation in vitro. A standard laboratory strain, PAO1 was highly elongated during anaerobic respiration compared with bacteria grown aerobically. Microscopic analysis demonstrated that cell elongation likely occurred as a consequence of defective cell division. Cell elongation was dependent on the presence of nitrite reductase (NIR) that reduces nitrite (NO(2) (-)) to nitric oxide (NO) and was repressed in PAO1 in the presence of carboxy-PTIO, a NO antagonist, demonstrating that cell elongation involves a process to respond to NO, a spontaneous byproduct of the anaerobic respiration. Importantly, the non-elongated NIR-deficient mutant failed to form biofilm, while a mutant of nitrate reductase (NAR) and wild type PAO1, both of which were highly elongated, formed robust biofilm. Taken together, our data reveal a role of previously undescribed cell biological event in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and suggest NIR as a key player involved in such process."

Based on the ubiquitous expression pattern and its dominant effect in normoxia, it had to be assumed that PHD2 is the most critical HIF-1α-regulating PHD isoform in most tissues (11Berra E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38458-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). This notion, learned from in vitro studies, was confirmed by the up to now available genetically modified Phd2 mouse models (14Katschinski D.M. Acta Physiol. 2009; 195: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phd2 knock-out embryos die between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E14.5 (15Takeda K. Ho V.C. Takeda H. Duan L.J. Nagy A. Fong G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8336-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This time point coincides with the increased levels of PHD2 in wild-type (wt) mice starting from E9.0. A major role of PHD2 in regulating the HIF system is further underscored by mouse models with a somatic Phd2−/− knock out, which enable to analyze the in vivo function of PHD2 in the adult mice. Two independent inducible Phd2−/− mouse models were developed by Takeda et al. (16Takeda K. Cowan A. Fong G.H. Circulation. 2007; 116: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and Minamishima et al. (17Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Bardeesy N. Cullen D. Bronson R.T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Blood. 2008; 111: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The phenotype of these mice most obviously resembles the consequences of HIFα overexpression with increased angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and extramedullar hematopoiesis (17Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Bardeesy N. Cullen D. Bronson R.T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Blood. 2008; 111: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 18Takeda K. Aguila H.L. Parikh N.S. Li X. Lamothe K. Duan L.J. Takeda H. Lee F.S. Fong G.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 3229-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, these mice also develop a cardiac phenotype with symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy. In the heart, HIF-1α and thereby also the PHDs are known to influence key components of heart development, morphogenesis, and function (19Krishnan J. Ahuja P. Bodenmann S. Knapik D. Perriard E. Krek W. Perriard J.C. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Krishnan J. Suter M. Windak R. Krebs T. Felley A. Montessuit C. Tokarska- Schlattner M. Aasum E.

Long term activation of HIF-1α in the heart seems to activate detrimental pathways resulting in the development of heart failure (21Bekeredjian R. Walton C.B. MacCannell K.A. Ecker J. Kruse F. Outten J.T. Sutcliffe D. Gerard R.D. Bruick R.K. Shohet R.V. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that loss of PHD2 in the heart is responsible for the dilated cardiomyopathy as observed in the inducible Phd2−/− mice. However, because these mice also develop an increased hematocrit, secondary blood hyperviscosity-dependent cardiac changes cannot be ruled out. Therefore we have generated cardiomyocyte-specific PHD2 knock-out mice (cPhd2−/−) by crossing MLCvCre mice with Phd2flox/flox mice. While this work was ongoing Moslehi et al. have recently reported the generation of cardiac-specific PHD2 knock-out mice using αMHCCre expressing mice as deleter mice in combination with Phd2flox/flox mice (22Moslehi J. Minamishima Y.A. Shi J. Neuberg D. Charytan D.M. Padera R.F. Signoretti S. Liao R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Circulation. 2010; 122: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In line with our observation, Moslehi et al. observed no striking differences in morphology or function of resting young cPhd2−/− mice. Moslehi et al. additionally analyzed older mice and demonstrated that with increasing age cardiomyocyte-specific PHD2 knock-out mice developed changes, which phenocopy ischemic cardiomyopathy. At a young age these animals responded to increased afterload with fortified heart failure despite the successful development of cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast to the results of Moslehi et al., we did not observe significant changes in the development of hypertrophy and heart failure of young PHD2-deficient mice toward increased afterload in our animal model. Moreover, we observed cardioprotective effects in the PHD2-lacking mice in a model of myocardial ischemia. Challenging the mice with permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) resulted in cardiac tissue protection and decreased myocardial infarct size in the cPhd2−/− mice compared with Phd2 wt littermates. Taken together, our results show for the first time that lack of PHD2 in cardiomyocytes protects the heart from an acute ischemic insult. This phenomenon is at least in part most likely due to an increased capillary area in the cPhd2−/− mice. The generation and detailed characterization of Phd2flox/flox mice will be reported elsewhere. 3B. Wielockx, K. Anastassiadis, A. F. Stewart, and G. Breier, unpublished observations. In brief, LoxP sites were cloned into the Phd2 gene via Red/ET recombination (23Zhang Y. Muyrers J.P. Testa G. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) flanking exons 2 and 3. To characterize the Phd2flox/flox mice, full inactivation of the Phd2 gene was achieved via an intercross with PGKCre mice. Consistent with earlier reports, no viable PHD2−/− mice were obtained (15Takeda K. Ho V.C. Takeda H. Duan L.J. Nagy A. Fong G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8336-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 17Minamishima Y.A. Moslehi J. Bardeesy N. Cullen D. Bronson R.T. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Blood. 2008; 111: 3236-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated excision of exons 2 and 3 results in a frameshift mutation from exon 1 to 4 leading to an early translational stop and subsequent Phd2 knock out. Exons 2 and 3 encode for almost the entire catalytic domain of Phd2. The successful deletion of Phd2 in the floxed mice was verified by Western blotting on protein extracts of embryonic hearts (E14.5) from PGKCre × Phd2flox/flox mice using a homemade Phd2 antibody against a C-terminal peptide (supplemental Fig. 1). No PHD2 protein could be detected in Phd2−/− hearts. Moreover, the fact that HIF-1α protein is stabilized in these samples verifies the loss of functionality of Phd2. To analyze, if a shorter PHD2 protein encoded by exon 1 is formed, we performed Western blotting using an antibody, which detects the N-terminal part of PHD2 (supplemental Fig. 2). There is indeed a shorter Phd2 protein detectable in the Phd2+/− and Phd2−/− mice, which in its apparent molecular mass matches the predicted number of 31.5 kDa. The putatively exon 1-encoded protein, however, was expressed compared with the wt PHD2 protein in wt or Phd2+/− embryos only at very low levels. Whether this shorter protein would have a dominant negative character and therefore would bind to its interaction partner (e.g. HIFα) and block its normal function has not been studied. However, it was suggested that in human PHD2 both Arg371 and Pro317 (in mice Arg348 and Pro294 located in exons 3 and 2, respectively) contribute to the HIF-1α or HIF-2α binding (24Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Beer P.A. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Blood. 2007; 110: 2193-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In our mice these sites are not present anymore, and a dominant negative interaction with HIF-1α is therefore unlikely. All animals in this study were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice at least five times. Phd2flox/flox mice were crossed with MLCvCre+/− mice (25Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to generate Phd2flox/flox × MLCvCre+/− mice within two generations. Phd2flox/flox × MLCvCre+/− mice were then crossed with Phd2flox/flox mice to obtain cPhd2−/− (Phd2flox/flox × MLCvCre+/−) mice and littermate control wild-type mice (Phd2flox/flox). Mice were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: Cre forward, 5′-CGTACTGACGGTGGGAGAAT-3′ and Cre reverse, 5′-CGGCAAAACAGGTAGTTA-3′; PHD2 forward, 5′-CTCACTGACCTACGCCGTGT-3′ and PHD2 reverse, 5′-CGCATCTTCCATCTCCATTT-3′. The deletion of floxed exons in cDNAs isolated from ventricles or atria by PCRs was shown with the following primers: PHD2 forward, 5′-TACAGGATAAACGGCCGAAC-3′ and PHD2 reverse, 5′-GGCAACTGAGAGGCTGTAGG-3′. The forward primer binds in exon 1, the reverse primer binds in exon 5. Animal experimentation was performed with cPhd2−/− mice and littermate Phd2 wt control mice. All protocols regarding animal experimentation were conducted according to the German animal protection laws and approved by the responsible governmental authority (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit in Oldenburg; animal experimentation numbers 33.942502-04-10/0024 and 33.9-42502-04-10/0069). Pressure overload was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and performed essentially as described previously by our group with blunted 27-gauge needles as placeholders in 10-week-old female mice (26Silter M. Kögler H. Zieseniss A. Wilting J. Schafer K. Toischer K. Rokita A.G. Breves G. Maier L.S. Katschinski D.M. Eur. J. Physiol. 2010; 459: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). LAD ligations were performed by an investigator who was blinded regarding the genotypes of the mice. The measurement of infarct size was performed by an additional investigator, who was likewise blinded. LAD ligation was performed on female mice having a minimum weight of 21 g (8–12 weeks of age). Mice were anesthetized (2% isoflurane). The trachea was surgically exposed, and tracheal intubation was performed. A blunt intubation cannula (intubation cannula, stainless steel with Y-adapter, 1.2-mm outer diameter, 30-mm length; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Harvard Apparatus GmbH) was inserted into the trachea. Correct tube placement was confirmed by direct visualization of the cannula within the previously exposed trachea. The tracheal tube was connected to a mechanical ventilator (MiniVent; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Harvard Apparatus GmbH), and the animals were ventilated by using a pressure-controlled ventilation mode (stroke volume 150 μl, 150 strokes/min fractional inspired O2 = 0.3). After exposing the heart, the pericardium was removed, and a 9-0 polyamide suture with a U-shaped needle was passed under the left anterior descending artery. The suture was tied to occlude the artery. The chest was closed and the mouse recovered. Echocardiography and measurement of posterior wall thickness, septum thickness, left ventricular end systolic diameter, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and fractional shortening (FS) were performed as described by Silter et al. (26Silter M. Kögler H. Zieseniss A. Wilting J. Schafer K. Toischer K. Rokita A.G. Breves G. Maier L.S. Katschinski D.M. Eur. J. Physiol. 2010; 459: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Six hours after LAD ligation the mice were given heparin (250 units) and anesthetized, and the hearts were excised. Myocardial infarct size was determined by using Evans blue/2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as described by Bohl et al. (27Bohl S. Medway D.J. Schulz-Menger J. Schneider J.E. Neubauer S. Lygate C.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2009; 297: H2054-H2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ascending aorta was cannulated with a 20-gauge tubing adapter, and 1% Evans blue was perfused into the aorta and coronary arteries to delineate the “area at risk” (AAR). The Evans blue dye was distributed uniformly to those areas of the myocardium, which were well perfused; hence, the area of the myocardium that was not stained with Evans blue was defined as the AAR. The left ventricle was separated from the rest of the heart and sectioned into three transverse slices. Sections were incubated in 2% TTC for 20 min at 37 °C to identify viable tissue. Infarct quantification was performed on digital photographs (SMZ 100; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The area of necrosis (AON) and AAR were determined as the average percent area per slice from the middle section and the lowest section. Also, myocardial samples were collected for cyrosectioning and assessment of apoptosis. Heart tissue was rapidly homogenized in a buffer containing 4 m urea, 140 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were quantified (DC Protein Assay; Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analysis protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting (PeqLab). Primary antibodies used were: anti-PHD2 (NB100-2219; Novus), anti-HIF-1α (NB100-479; Novus), and anti-vinculin (hVin-1, V9264; Sigma). For detection of immunocomplexes, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used, and membranes were incubated with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.65 mm H2O2, 0.45 mm luminol, and 0.625 mm coumaric acid for 1 min. Chemiluminescence signals were detected with the LAS3000 camera system (Fuji Film Europe, Düsseldorf, Germany). After RNA extraction reverse transcription (RT) was performed with 2 μg of RNA and a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot). mRNA levels were quantified by using 1 μl of the cDNA reaction and a SYBR Green qPCR reaction kit (Clontech) in combination with a MX3000P light cycler (Stratagene). The initial template concentration of each sample was calculated by comparison with serial dilutions of a calibrated standard. Primers were as follows: glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) forward, 5′-TGGCCTTGCTGGAACGGCTG and Glut-1 reverse, 5′-TCCTTGGGCTGCAGGGAGCA-3′; mS12 forward, 5′-GAAGCTGCCAAGGCCTTAGA-3 and mS12 reverse, 5′-AACTGCAACCAACCACCTTC-3′; PHD2 forward, 5′-TTGCTGACATTGAACCCAAA-3′ and PHD2 reverse, 5′-GGCAACTGAGAGGCTGTAGG-3′; PHD1 forward, 5′-GCTAGGCTGAGGGAGGAAGT-3′ and PHD1 reverse, 5′-TCTACCCAGGCAATCTGGTC-3′; PHD3 forward, 5′-GGCCGCTGTATCACCTGTAT-3 and PHD3 reverse, 5′-TTCTGCCCTTTCTTCAGCAT-3′; brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) forward, 5′-AAGTCCTAGCCAGTCTCCAGA-3′ and BNP reverse, 5′-GAGCTGTCTCTGGGCCATTTC-3′; phosphofruktokinase 1 (Pfkl) forward, 5′-ACGAGGCCATCCAGCTCCGT-3′ and Pfkl reverse 5′-TGGGGCTTGGGCAGTGTCCT-3′; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK-1) forward, 5′-GTTCACGTCACGCTGGGCGA-3′ and PDK-1 reverse, 5′-CCAGGCGTCCCATGTGCGTT-3′; phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) forward, 5′-ACGTCTGCCGCGCTGTTCTC-3′ and PGK reverse, 5′-ACCATGGAGCTATGGGCTCGGT-3′; VEGF forward, 5′-CGAACGTACTGCCGATTGAGA-3 and VEGF reverse, 5′-TGGTGAGGTTTGATCCGCATGATCTG-3′; angiopoietin (Ang)-1 forward, 5′-CGCTCTCATGCTAACAGGAGGTTGG-3′ and Ang-1 reverse, 5′-GCATTCTCTGGACCCAAGTGGCG-3′; Ang-2 forward, 5′-CACCCAACTCCAAGAGCTCGG-3′ and Ang-2 reverse, 5′-CACGTAGCGGTGCTGACCGG-3′; BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) forward, 5′-GTCCAGTGTCGCCTGGCCTC-3′ and Bnip3 reverse, 5′-TGGGAGCGAGGTGGGCTGTC-3′; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; (iNOS) forward, 5′-GCTGCCTTCCTGCTGTCGCA-3′ and iNOS reverse, 5′-GGAGCCGCTGCTGCCAGAAA-3; hemoxygenase (Hox)-1 forward, 5′-TGGTGCAAGATACTGCCCCTGC-3′ and Hox-1 reverse, 5′-TGGGGGACAGCAGTCGTGGT-3′, apelin forward, 5′-TGCAGTTTGTGGAGTGCCACTG-3′ and apelin reverse, 5′-GCACCGGGAGGCACT-3′; adrenomedullin forward, 5′-TGGCCCCCTACAAGCCAGCAAT-3′ and adrenomedullin reverse, 5′-GCCAACGGGATACTCGCCCG-3′. The sets of primers for adenosine receptor A2b and CD73 were according to previously published sequences (28Eckle T. Köhler D. Lehmann R. El Kasmi K. Eltzschig H.K. Circulation. 2008; 118: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Plasma BNP levels were measured using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit (catalog number EK-011-23; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Trichrome staining, heart tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and embedded in paraffin before sectioning. Freshly isolated hearts were treated as described before (29Zieseniss A. Schroeder U. Buchmeier S. Schoenenberger C.A. van den Heuvel J. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. Cell Tissue Res. 2007; 327: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were sectioned (5–10 μm) in a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, and dried for at least 30 min. After being washed with PBS, the sections were briefly incubated with 1% Triton X-100 and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The sections were then incubated with the polyclonal anti-CD31 antibodies (DIA 310, diluted 1:20; Dianova) and anti-vinculin antibodies (hVin-1, diluted 1:100; Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with anti-mouse TR (diluted 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rat FITC (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were counterstained for DNA (Hoechst). Finally, samples were washed extensively in PBS, mounted in Mowiol, and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer D1; Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The capillary area was determined by analyzing CD31-positive pixels using ImageJ. In addition, the number of capillaries were counted per view of field. Paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained as described by others (22Moslehi J. Minamishima Y.A. Shi J. Neuberg D. Charytan D.M. Padera R.F. Signoretti S. Liao R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Circulation. 2010; 122: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The anti-HIF-1α primary antibody (Novus NB100-123) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Standard procedures were applied for fixation (1.5% glutaraldehye and 1.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer) of hearts of cPhd2−/− and Phd2 wt mice. The hearts were then washed in PBS and fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide. The samples were dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol and embedded in Araldite. Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% methanolic uranyl acetate. Samples were then examined in a transmission electron microscope equipped with photodocumentation. Apoptotic cells were detected with a TUNEL assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, catalog number 11 684 795 001; Roche Applied Science). Three hearts of each genotype were analyzed, and five random high power fields from each heart sample were quantified. Data were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test or (in case of repeated echocardiography analysis after TAC treatment) as paired t test and presented as mean ± S.E. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For generating cPhd2−/− mice, we crossed Phd2flox/flox mice with mice that express the Cre recombinase under the control of the MLCv promoter (25Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The MLCv-driven Cre permits recombination of the floxed Phd2 exons 2 and 3 in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1A). Isolation and PCR analysis of cDNAs from atria and ventricles of cPhd2−/− and littermate Phd2 wt control mice verified successful recombination in the ventricles but not in the atria of the cPhd2−/− mice (Fig. 1B). The additional bands seen in the PCR analysis of Phd2 wt mice most likely are the result of described PHD2 splice variants (30Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Quantification of PHD2 RNA levels in the left ventricles and atria of cPhd2−/− mice compared with Phd2 wt mice revealed a roughly 5-fold reduction in the knock-out ventricles but not the atria, confirming the MLCvCre-mediated knock out in the ventricular cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1C). Considering that the RNA was isolated from the whole left ventricles, which besides the cardiomyocytes also contain especially cardiac fibroblasts but also endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells etc., this reduction in PHD2 expression is in accordance with a successful recombination in the Cre-expressing cardiomyocytes. In line, cardiac PHD2 expression was also reduced at the protein level in left ventricles but not the atria of cPhd2−/− mice as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1D). As a consequence of the PHD2 knock out, HIF-1α protein levels were slightly increased (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the accumulation of HIF-1α protein in cell nuclei of the cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2). Detection of HIF-2α by immunohistochemistry was hampered by varying qualities of the batches of the commercially available polyclonal anti-HIF-2α antibodies. At least in vitro it was described that in contrast to PHD3, PHD2 seems to have higher activity toward HIF-1α compared with HIF-2α (30Hirsilä M. Koivunen P. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore the increased levels of HIF-1α in the cardiomyocytes are in line with an effective PHD2 knock out in our mouse model. A moderate activation of the HIF-signaling pathway in the hearts of cPhd2−/− mice was likewise detected by analyzing the expression of the HIF target genes PHD3 (Fig. 1C), Glut-1, Pfk1, and PDK1 (Fig. 3A). Whereas increased levels of Glut-1, Pfk1, and PDK1 reflect the impact of HIF on glucose transport and glucose metabolism, respectively (31Wenger R.H. Stiehl D.P. Camenisch G. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re12PubMed Google Scholar), the elevated levels of PHD3 are indicative of the described negative HIF/PHD feedback loop, which involves the HIF-dependent transcription of PHD3 (32Stiehl D.P. Wirthner R. Köditz J. Spielmann P. Camenisch G. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23482-23491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, PHD1 RNA levels, which are not inducible by hypoxia (13Appelhoff R.J. Tian Y.M. Raval R.R. Turley H. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38458-38465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), were not affected in the hearts of cPhd2−/− mice (Fig. 1C). HIF target genes involved in angiogenesis (VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2), vasotonus regulation (adrenomedullin, apelin, iNOS, and Hox-1), purinergic signaling (CD73, and adenosine receptor A2b), and apoptosis (Bnip3) were found to be unchanged (Fig. 3B). BNP is produced in the ventricles and is regarded as surrogate marker for heart failure (33Palazzuoli A. Gallotta M. Quatrini I. Nuti R. Vasc. Health Risk Manag. 2010; 6: 411-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyzing BNP RNA levels in the left ventricles o"
https://openalex.org/W1980530607,"Many mutations associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) lie within complement control protein modules 19-20 at the C terminus of the complement regulator factor H (FH). This region mediates preferential action of FH on self, as opposed to foreign, membranes and surfaces. Hence, speculation on disease mechanisms has focused on deficiencies in regulation of complement activation on glomerular capillary beds. Here, we investigate the consequences of aHUS-linked mutations (R53H and R78G) within the FH N-terminal complement control protein module that also carries the I62V variation linked to dense-deposit disease and age-related macular degeneration. This module contributes to a four-module C3b-binding site (FH1-4) needed for complement regulation and sufficient for fluid-phase regulatory activity. Recombinant FH1-4(V62) and FH1-4(I62) bind immobilized C3b with similar affinities (K(D) = 10-14 μM), whereas FH1-4(I62) is slightly more effective than FH1-4(V62) as cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. The mutant (R53H)FH1-4(V62) binds to C3b with comparable affinity (K(D) ∼12 μM) yet has decreased cofactor activities both in fluid phase and on surface-bound C3b, and exhibits only weak decay-accelerating activity for C3 convertase (C3bBb). The other mutant, (R78G)FH1-4(V62), binds poorly to immobilized C3b (K(D) >35 μM) and is severely functionally compromised, having decreased cofactor and decay-accelerating activities. Our data support causal links between these mutations and disease; they demonstrate that mutations affecting the N-terminal activities of FH, not just those in the C terminus, can predispose to aHUS. These observations reinforce the notion that deficiency in any one of several FH functional properties can contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054215403,"Background Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine related cancer with increasing incidences during the past five years. Current treatments for thyroid cancer, such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy, often require patients to be on lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy and given the significant recurrence rates of thyroid cancer, new preventive modalities are needed. The present study investigates the property of a natural dietary compound found in cruciferous vegetables, 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM), to target the metastatic phenotype of thyroid cancer cells through a functional estrogen receptor. Methodology/Principal Findings Thyroid cancer cell lines were treated with estrogen and/or DIM and subjected to in vitro adhesion, migration and invasion assays to investigate the anti-metastatic and anti-estrogenic effects of DIM. We observed that DIM inhibits estrogen mediated increase in thyroid cell migration, adhesion and invasion, which is also supported by ER-α downregulation (siRNA) studies. Western blot and zymography analyses provided direct evidence for this DIM mediated inhibition of E2 enhanced metastasis associated events by virtue of targeting essential proteolytic enzymes, namely MMP-2 and MMP-9. Conclusion/Significance Our data reports for the first time that DIM displays anti-estrogenic like activity by inhibiting estradiol enhanced thyroid cancer cell proliferation and in vitro metastasis associated events, namely adhesion, migration and invasion. Most significantly, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are known to promote and enhance metastasis, were determined to be targets of DIM. This anti-estrogen like property of DIM may lead to the development of a novel preventive and/or therapeutic dietary supplement for thyroid cancer patients by targeting progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2039839887,"Germ cells possess the unique ability to acquire totipotency during development in vivo as well as give rise to pluripotent stem cells under the appropriate conditions in vitro. Recent studies in which somatic cells were experimentally converted into pluripotent stem cells revealed that genes expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs), such as Oct3/4, Sox2, and Lin28, are involved in this reprogramming. These findings suggest that PGCs may be useful for identifying factors that successfully and efficiently reprogram somatic cells into toti- and/or pluripotent stem cells. Here, we show that Blimp-1, Prdm14, and Prmt5, each of which is crucial for PGC development, have the potential to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. Among them, Prmt5 exhibited remarkable reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into which Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4 were introduced. The resulting cells exhibited pluripotent gene expression, teratoma formation, and germline transmission in chimeric mice, all of which were indistinguishable from those induced with embryonic stem cells.

These data indicate that some of the factors that play essential roles in germ cell development are also active in somatic cell reprogramming. Yamanaka and colleagues (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19305) Google Scholar) showed that somatic cells could be reprogrammed by specific factors. To achieve this, the authors induced somatic cells to adopt an embryonic stem (ES) 4The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; iPS, induced pluripotent stem; PGC, primordial germ cell; PKO cells, Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4-induced pluripotent cells; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; EG, embryonic germ. cell-like state by introducing Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc into mouse fibroblasts. This technique for producing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has also been applied to human somatic cells (2Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15287) Google Scholar, 3Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A.

Because the generation of iPS cells is not plagued by either ethical considerations or immune rejection, the potential of this technology is of great importance for the field of regenerative medicine. Apart from the potential clinical applications, iPS cell generation also provides an excellent model system for investigating the mechanisms underlying cellular reprogramming in vitro through the identification of alternative or additional factors involved in this process. So far, a number of reprogramming factors, including Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf2/4/5, c-Myc, and Lin28, as well as reprogramming-inhibitory factors such as p53 and let7, have been identified in this way (3Yu J.

Of note, each factor is not only active during reprogramming but it also has biological significance in development and homeostasis in the cells and tissues. Frequency of the conversion into iPS cells by transfection with these four reprogramming factors is still very low, implying that other, unidentified reprogramming factors may exist. Before the discovery of iPS cells, pluripotent cells could only be established from germ cells in post-implantation embryos. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonia are known to de-differentiate into pluripotent stem cells, embryonic germ (EG) cells and multipotent germline stem cells, respectively (6Matsui Y. Zsebo K. Hogan B.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 7Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Inoue K. Lee J. Yoshimoto M. Ogonuki N. Miki H. Baba S. Kato T. Kazuki Y.

Consistent with their ability to de-differentiate, cells from the germ cell lineage express key factors that maintain pluripotency, such as Oct3/4 and Sox2 (8Mise N. Fuchikami T. Sugimoto M. Kobayakawa S. Ike F. Ogawa T. Tada T. Kanaya S. Noce T. Abe K. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 863-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the efficiency of deriving of EG cells from PGCs is much higher than the efficiency of generating iPS cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that germ cells already possess critical reprogramming factors. Recent studies have identified several factors that are crucial for germ cell specification and development (9Saitou M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, a pair of PR domain-containing factors, Blimp-1/Prdm1 and Prdm14, is essential for early PGC development. Blimp-1 is detectable at the earliest stage of PGC specification and is essential for repressing somatic programs such as Hox gene expression. Prdm14 expression follows Blimp-1 expression in PGCs and also plays a pivotal role in germ cell specification (10Ohinata Y. Payer B. O'Carroll D. Ancelin K. Ono Y. Sano M. Barton S.C. Obukhanych T. Nussenzweig M. Tarakhovsky A. Saitou M. Surani M.A. Nature. 2005; 436: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 11Yamaji M. Seki Y. Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Yuasa M. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Ohinata Y. Saitou M. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Both mutants of these genes fail to allocate the PGC population, which has been attributed to the impaired repression of somatic programs followed by genome-wide reprogramming. Although it is unclear whether PR domains are essential for reprogramming, Blimp-1 is known to interact with many epigenetic factors, including the arginine-specific histone methyltransferase, Prmt5. Prmt5 is thought to play a role in epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells (12Pal S. Sif S. J. Cell Physiol. 2007; 213: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Ancelin K. Lange U.C. Hajkova P. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Surani M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). During germ cell development, epigenetic reprogramming occurs via massive DNA demethylation and altered histone modification that normally occurs in the embryonic gonad (14Hajkova P. Ancelin K. Waldmann T. Lacoste N. Lange U.C. Cesari F. Lee C. Almouzni G. Schneider R. Surani M.A. Nature. 2008; 452: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), suggesting that the combined expression of Blimp-1, Prmd14, and Prmt5 evokes proper epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs. Likewise, during iPS cell induction, somatic cell gene expression is repressed and histone modification patterns are markedly altered (15Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that there is a functional relationship between germ cell development and somatic cell reprogramming. Here, we investigated whether Blimp-1, Prdm14, and Prmt5, which are important for reprogramming in PGCs, are also active in somatic cell reprogramming. We screened cells expressing combinations of these transcription factors and found that all of these factors had reprogramming activity. Somatic cell reprogramming of MEFs was especially effective when Prmt5 was introduced in combination with Klf4 and Oct3/4 (PKO cells). PKO cells were indistinguishable from ES cells in terms of their gene expression profile, DNA methylation status, capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers, and germline transmission. Here we show that factors with essential roles in germ cell development are also active in somatic cell reprogramming. A Nanog-GFP-IRES-puro transgenic mouse (RBRC02290) was provided by RIKEN BRC, which is participating in the National Bio-Resource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan (16Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 and Balb/c nude mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of Keio University for animal and recombinant DNA experiments. MEFs were prepared from E13.5 embryos obtained by crossing Nanog-GFP mice with C57BL/6. PKO cells were cultured on mitomycin C-treated STO cells with knock-out DMEM containing 15% FCS, LIF, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and non-essential amino acids. The PKO cells were depleted of feeder cells by being incubated twice on a 2% gelatin-coated dish. Collected cells were used for DNA and RNA analysis. STO cells were treated with 12 μg/ml of mitomycin C for 2 h and plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/55 cm2. Retroviral plasmids for iPS cell induction were provided by Addgene as follows: pMXs-Sox2 (Addgene plasmid 13367), pMXs-Oct3/4 (Addgene plasmid 13366), pMXs-Klf4 (Addgene plasmid 13370), and pMXs-c-Myc (Addgene plasmid 13375). The Blimp-1-IRES-GFP vector was a gift from Dr. Kiyoshi Takatsu and the IRES-GFP region was excised (17Horikawa K. Takatsu K. Immunology. 2006; 118: 497-508PubMed Google Scholar). Prdm14 and Prmt5 were cloned by PCR, inserted into the pGEM-T-easy plasmid (Promega), and converted to pMXs via the BamHI and XhoI sites. The PCR primers used were: Prdm14, forward, 5′-CCGCGGTCCGCAAAACTCAGGCCACCATGG-3′, and Prdm14, reverse, 5′-CTCGAGAACCATGCCCACGCGACACAGACA-3′; Prmt5, forward, 5′-GGATCCGGCCGCGCGAGGGCCACCATGGCG-3′, and Prmt5, reverse, 5′-CTCGAGAACCAGCAGATGTTCTACACCTTC-3′. PKO cells were generated by the iPS cell induction method as described previously (16Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S.

MEFs transfected with Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4 were reseeded on mitomycin C-treated STO cells at 5 days after infection, at the cell densities indicated under Table 2. Primary ES cell-like colonies of MEFs transfected with Blimp-1, Prdm14, and c-Myc were reseeded onto a 0.1% gelatin-coated dish without STO feeder cells at a density of 580,000 cells/35-mm dish.TABLE 2PKO cell colony numbersWell No.Number of cells at reseedingPuromycin selectionNumbers of Nanog-GFP positive coloniesTotalDay 23Day 26Day 29×105/35 mmdays after infection18.7516200225.816300330.5816100148.75233521055.8230931260.58230202Yamanaka's method0.5814 Open table in a new tab Primers and probes for Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc were designed to distinguish between endogenous and viral transcripts (see supplemental Table S1).

To produce teratomas, 1.0 × 106 cells were suspended in BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into nude mice. Three to 4 weeks later, tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To analyze the germ cell contribution of PKO cells, PKO cells were injected into blastocysts from ICR mice. Gonads were isolated at E12.5 and examined for PKO cell-derived Nanog-GFP fluorescence. At the same time, the contribution of PKO cells to the eyes was also analyzed by the examination of pigment cells. To generate adult chimeric mice from PKO cells, blastocysts with a B6 background were used. Functional germ cell development was analyzed by the fluorescence of Nanog-GFP in the F1 morula. Expression profiles were analyzed using the three-dimensional Gene Mouse Oligo chip 24K (Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence intensities were detected using the Scan-Array Life Scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PMT levels were adjusted to achieve 0.1–0.5% pixel saturation. Each TIFF image was analyzed using GenePix Pro version 6.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were filtered to remove low confidence measurements and globally normalized per array, such that the median signal intensity was adjusted to 50 after normalization (accession number GSE18813). Genomic integration of introduced factors were analyzed with the following primers: Virus Klf4, forward, 5′-CATCCTCTAGACTGCCGGATCT-3′ and Virus Klf4, reverse, 5′-GATTCAATATAAACCGGCGATGTC-3′; Virus Sox2, forward, 5′-TTAAGGATCCCAGTGTGGTGGTA-3′, and Virus Sox2, reverse, 5′-TTCAGCTCCGTCTCCATCATG-3′; Virus Oct3/4, forward, 5′-CATCCTCTAGACTGCCGGATCT-3′, and Virus Oct3/4, reverse, 5′-TGCTTCAGCAGCTTGGCAAACTGT-3′; Virus c-Myc, forward, 5′-CATCCTCTAGACTGCCGGATCT-3′, and Virus c-Myc, reverse, 5′-AGGTCATAGTTCCTGTTGGTGAAGT-3′; Virus Prmt5, forward, 5′-CATCCTCTAGACTGCCGGATCT-3′ and Virus Prmt5, reverse, 5′-AATTCAGGTCCCTCCCGCTGGACA-3′; control (IL-2), forward, 5′-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT-3′, and control (IL-2), reverse, 5′-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC-3′. Previously reported sequences were used for the knockdown of Prmt5 (18Zhao Q. Rank G. Tan Y.T. Li H. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Cerruti L. Curtis D.J. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The sequences were introduced with a retroviral expression vector (19Fujino R.S. Tanaka K. Morimatsu M. Tamura K. Kogo H. Hara T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Virus production and infection during the reprogramming process were performed as described as above (16Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). The viruses for knockdown were added at a 3 times higher concentration than the reprogramming factors. MEFs infected with three or four factors were harvested at days 3 and 12. The cells were incubated with anti-FcγR antibody (2.4G2) (eBioscience) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, cells were continuously incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody (53-2.1) (BD Biosciences) and PE-conjugated anti-SSEA-1 monoclonal antibody (MC-480) (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, samples were sorted by FACS AriaII (BD Biosciences). The unique relationship between PGCs and pluripotency led to an investigation of the reprogramming activity of factors involved in PGC development, EG cell derivation, or both. Factors that met the following criteria were selected: (i) preferential expression in early PGCs during reprogramming, (ii) a role in early PGC development, and (iii) involvement in pluripotent EG cell derivation. This screen yielded three candidate genes: Blimp-1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14, and Prmt5. Subsequently, the reprogramming activity of Blimp-1, Prdm14, and Prmt5 was examined in somatic cells. Various combinations of the three factors were introduced, along with Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, or c-Myc, into MEFs carrying the Nanog-GFP reporter gene (Table 1). Although no Nanog-positive colonies grew after the expression of each of the three factors alone, Nanog-GFP-positive colonies were detected in two conditions when the cells were co-infected with the three known factors. In the first instance, MEFs co-infected with Blimp-1, Prdm14, and c-Myc (Table 1, case 4) produced primary colonies with an ES cell-like morphology (Fig. 1). A few colonies occasionally expressed Nanog-GFP but most did not (Fig. 1), and the Nanog-positive colonies exhibited severely inhibited growth. Moreover, cell growth was arrested when the Nanog-GFP-positive colonies were isolated and re-plated. Thus, despite the emergence of primary Nanog-GFP-positive colonies after infection with Blimp-1, Prdm14, and c-Myc, the MEFs did not become completely reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells. Because Blimp-1 is not expressed in ES cells (Fig. 1), it is possible that this factor acts only during the induction phase. Indeed, overexpression of Blimp-1 in ES cells resulted in cell growth defects (Fig. 1). This may explain why the appearance of Nanog-GFP colonies was very rare and why a cell line could not be established by infection with Blimp-1, Prdm14, and c-Myc. Complete silencing of Blimp-1 may be necessary to establish a cell line during reprogramming.TABLE 1Screened combination of introduced genesCaseNameInduced factorsGFPaNanog-GFP positive colonies.Klf4Sox2Oct3/4c-MycBlimp-1Prdm14Prmt51K,1,14+++2S,1,14+++3O,1,14+++4M,1,14++++5K,1,5+++6S,1,5+++7O,1,5+++8M,1,5+++9K,14,5+++10S,14,5+++11O,14,5+++12M,14,5+++13K,S,1+++14K,S,14+++15K,S,5+++16K,O,1+++17K,O,14+++18K,O,5++++19S,O,1+++20S,O,14+++21S,O,5+++22K,S,1,14++++23K,O,1,14++++24S,O,1,14++++25K,S,1,5++++26K,O,1,5++++27S,O,1,5++++28K,S,14,5++++29K,O,14,5++++30S,O,14,5++++311,14++321,5++3314,5++341+3514+365+37K,1++38S,1++39O,1++40M,1++41K,14++42S,14++43O,14++44M,14++45K,5++46S,5++47O,5++48M,5++491,14,5+++50K,S,O++++51K,S,O,M+++++a Nanog-GFP positive colonies. Open table in a new tab The second instance in which Nanog-GFP-positive primary colonies were detected occurred following the co-infection of cells with Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4 (Table 1, case 18). Under these conditions, we observed ES cell-like primary colonies, many of which were positive for Nanog-GFP (Fig. 1). In contrast to the primary colonies derived from Blimp-1/Prdm14/c-Myc co-infection, Nanog-GFP-positive colonies from Prmt5/Klf4/Oct3/4 co-infection grew and were successfully maintained as stable lines (Fig. 1). These cells were subsequently designated PKO cells (Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4). Genomic PCR analysis showed that PKO cells actually integrated exogenous Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4, but not Sox2 or c-Myc (Fig. 1). PKO cells were successfully re-plated and their growth rate was comparable with the growth rate of ES cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Even with continuous passage, the level of Nanog-GFP expression in PKO cells remained as high as during the early passage. Upon induction of differentiation, Nanog-GFP expression was down-regulated, supporting that PKO cells are reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells with ES cell characteristics. The gene expression patterns in PKO cells were analyzed. PKO cells exhibited up-regulated endogenous expression of many known reprogramming factors, including Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Fig. 2). In addition, PKO cells expressed other ES cell-specific genes such as Nanog, ECAT-1, and Eras, whereas parental MEFs did not (Fig. 2) (20Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi K. Mitsui K. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2003; 423: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although PKO cells were induced by Prmt5, which is critical for germ cell specificity, the gene expression patterns of PKO cells were distinct from those of germ cells, as shown by the expression of MVH (mouse vasa homolog) and Blimp-1 (Fig. 2) (10Ohinata Y. Payer B. O'Carroll D. Ancelin K. Ono Y. Sano M. Barton S.C. Obukhanych T. Nussenzweig M. Tarakhovsky A. Saitou M. Surani M.A. Nature. 2005; 436: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka S.S. Toyooka Y. Akasu R. Katoh-Fukui Y. Nakahara Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Noce T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 841-853PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microarray analysis of PKO cells showed that the gene expression patterns of PKO cells became ES cell-like (Fig. 2). Next, the DNA methylation states of the Oct3/4- and Nanog-regulatory elements were examined (16Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). In contrast to the promoter regions of these two genes in MEFs, the promoter regions of these two genes were demethylated in PKO cells (Fig. 3). Compared with ES cells, the Oct3/4 locus of PKO cells was partially methylated, indicating that the PKO was composed of heterogeneous cells, some of which could have been incompletely reprogrammed. To distinguish whether PKO cells were derived from the direct reprogramming of MEFs or by mediating MEF-derived PGCs from Prmt5/Klf4/Oct3/4 co-infection, the DNA methylation pattern of the imprinted loci, Igf2r, was examined. Because germ cells lose the parental methylation pattern, even the early stage PGCs, the methylation status would be altered if the PKO cells were derived from PGCs. However, the Igf2r locus was not altered after reprogramming (Fig. 3). Thus, PKO cells did not progress through the germ cell phase during reprogramming, indicating that they are similar to ES cells but not EG cells. Finally, we tested the pluripotency of PKO cells. When PKO cells were injected into nude mice, PKO cells produced teratomas that contained tissues derived from all three germ layers (Fig. 4). Although some PKO cells contained a methylated Oct3/4-regulatory element, PKO cells were able to differentiate into germ cells through the formation of a chimeric embryo (Fig. 4). PKO cells were also detected in the eyes of chimeric embryos (Fig. 4). In addition to their presence in the embryo, adult chimeras were also produced from PKO cells and some of these demonstrated the incorporation of PKO cells by their coat color (Fig. 4). Furthermore, chimeric mice produced PKO cell-derived F1 progeny, confirmed by Nanog-GFP fluorescence of the morula (Fig. 4). These results demonstrated that somatic cells were reprogrammed to a pluripotent status by expression of reprogramming factors Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4. To investigate whether endogenous Prmt5 also contributed to reprogramming by Yamanaka factors, we knocked down the expression of Prmt5 in combination with the exogenous expression of four or three known reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2 with or without c-Myc). The knockdown efficiency was estimated in ES cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 5). The number of Nanog-GFP positive colonies was counted at day 14 for four factors and at day 18 for three factors, respectively (Fig. 5). In both cases, Nanog-GFP colonies were decreased by Prmt5 knockdown, especially in the case of four factors. These data indicate that Prmt5 also participates in the reprogramming process mediated by Yamanaka factors. Because germ cells are closely related to pluripotent stem cells, certain endogenous factors in germ cells are predicted to have reprogramming activity. In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of Blimp-1, Prdm14, and c-Myc resulted in the partial reprogramming of somatic cells, whereas the induction of Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4 conferred pluripotency to somatic cells, making them comparable with ES cells with respect to gene expression, epigenetic modification of the promoter regions of Nanog and Oct3/4, and the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers. Blimp-1 is an essential factor in germ cell specification, demonstrated by the failure of Blimp-1-deficient PGCs to suppress Hox gene expression (10Ohinata Y. Payer B. O'Carroll D. Ancelin K. Ono Y. Sano M. Barton S.C. Obukhanych T. Nussenzweig M. Tarakhovsky A. Saitou M. Surani M.A. Nature. 2005; 436: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Prdm14 is also essential for establishing PGCs, and Prdm14 deficiency leads to the failure of Sox2 reactivation in PGCs. More importantly, Prdm14-deficient PGCs fail to give rise to pluripotent EG cells (11Yamaji M. Seki Y. Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Yuasa M. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Ohinata Y. Saitou M. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition, in human ES cells, PRDM14 is important for maintaining pluripotency (23Tsuneyoshi N. Sumi T. Onda H. Nojima H. Nakatsuji N. Suemori H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The third factor, Prmt5, forms a complex with Blimp-1 in PGCs and is thought to be important for PGC development (13Ancelin K. Lange U.C. Hajkova P. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Surani M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Prmt5 is important for PGC conversion into EG cells (24Durcova-Hills G. Tang F. Doody G. Tooze R. Surani M.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: 27Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, each of the three factors is essential factors for germ cell specificities. iPS cell generation was first characterized by exogenous expression of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (9Saitou M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thereafter, it became evident that the control of epigenetic regulators, such as histone deacetylase and G9a (histone H3K9-specific methyltransferase), could improve the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming (25Huangfu D. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Snitow M. Chen A.E. Melton D.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 26Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Murakami K. Takahashi K. Niwa H. Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that both histone deacetylase and G9a play inhibitory roles in reprogramming. Until now, no epigenetic factor was known to act as a positive regulator of somatic cell reprogramming. The work described in this study demonstrates that Prmt5 could be one such factor, as it promoted somatic cell reprogramming when it was overexpressed in MEFs together with Klf4 and Oct3/4. Furthermore, the knockdown of Prmt5 showed that it also works in the reprogramming process mediated by Yamanaka factors. Taken together, it is important to consider the role of Prmt5 from both genetic and epigenetic aspects of the reprogramming process. The reprogramming activity of Prmt5 could depend on its ability to symmetrically methylate arginine R3 of histone H2/4 and arginine R8 of H3 (27Lacroix M. El Messaoudi S. Rodier G. Le Cam A. Sardet C. Fabbrizio E. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a process that has been linked to gene silencing (18Zhao Q. Rank G. Tan Y.T. Li H. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Cerruti L. Curtis D.J. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Alternatively, arginine methylation of proteins other than histones could be crucial for somatic cell reprogramming. Indeed, it has been reported that Prmt5-mediated arginine methylation of p53 weakens its target specificity and function (28Jansson M. Durant S.T. Cho E.C. Sheahan S. Edelmann M. Kessler B. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because p53 inhibits the generation of iPS cells (5Zhao Y. Yin X. Qin H. Zhu F. Liu H. Yang W. Zhang Q. Xiang C. Hou P. Song Z. Liu Y. Yong J. Zhang P. Cai J. Liu M. Li H. Li Y. Qu X. Cui K. Zhang W. Xiang T. Wu Y. Liu C. Yu C. Yuan K. Lou J. Ding M. Deng H. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 475-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), it is also feasible that functional inhibition of p53 by Prmt5 contributes to the generation of PKO cells. To evaluate these possibilities, it will be important to identify the target of Prmt5 methylation and the effect of p53 activity during PKO cell generation. Furthermore, to address the function of Prmt5 during PKO cell generation, the subcellular localization of Prmt5 must also be evaluated because Prmt5 localization changes during the conversion of unipotent PGCs to pluripotent EG cells (24Durcova-Hills G. Tang F. Doody G. Tooze R. Surani M.A. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: 27Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the significance of the location and activation of Prmt5 is not yet clear, it is likely to be important for future identification of the molecular targets of Prmt5. Dign et al. (29Yuan X. Wan H. Zhao X. Zhu S. Zhou Q. Ding S. Stem Cells. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a combination with Oct3/4 introduction, inhibitor for Prmt, and TGF-βR could induce iPS cells. A Prmt inhibitor, AMI-5, which they used inhibits the activities of Prmt1/3/4/6. It suggests unique reprogramming activity of Prmt5. Although Prmt5, Klf4, and Oct3/4 induced pluripotency in somatic cells, the process was largely inefficient and the timing of reprogramming was relatively late compared with the established method (Table 2). This indicates that reprogramming in these cells occurred in a novel manner. Supporting this idea, the expression of Prmt5 was not up-regulated after infection of three or four factors (supplemental Fig. S1). The repression of somatic cell genes is an early event in reprogramming (30Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Breault D.T. Hochedlinger K. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and c-Myc overexpression has a unique effect on repression compared with the other three reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2) (31Sridharan R. Tchieu J. Mason M.J. Yachechko R. Kuoy E. Horvath S. Zhou Q. Plath K. Cell. 2009; 136: 364-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our preliminary data showed that the activity of Prmt5 in repressing the somatic cell gene, Thy-1, is similar to the activity of c-Myc. Because germ cell development is accompanied by the repression of somatic lineage differentiation, it is likely that Prmt5 may repress Thy-1 expression. PGCs arise directly from the epiblast (9Saitou M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). During the process of cell commitment, PGCs have a unique gene expression profile that includes Sox2 reactivation and Hox gene repression (9Saitou M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Blimp-1 and Prdm14 play central roles in establishing these gene expression patterns. Thereafter, PGCs change their genome-wide chromatin structure during development. As shown here, factors that are important in early PGCs also have reprogramming activity, we show that several genes expressed in PGCs could be involved in the reprogramming of somatic cells. During development, genome-wide reprogramming that occurs in PGCs is the sole process by which differentiating epiblast cells are efficiently reprogrammed (32Seki Y. Yamaji M. Yabuta Y. Sano M. Shigeta M. Matsui Y. Saga Y. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Saitou M. Development. 2007; 134: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As such, there are a number of similarities between the reprogramming in PGCs and generation of iPS cells, such as the expression of Sox2 and Nanog, a functional requirement for Lin28, and repression of G9a activity (3Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. Slukvin I.I. Thomson J.A.

These data, together with the results of the present study, strongly indicate that other reprogramming factors exist that are involved in both PGC development and iPS cell derivation. A more thorough understanding of how germ cells undergo genome-wide cellular reprogramming should provide useful clues about the identities of these factors and increase our knowledge of somatic cell reprogramming.

https://openalex.org/W2041250281,"Poxviruses use an arsenal of molecular weapons to evade detection and disarm host immune responses. We used DNA microarrays to investigate the gene expression responses to infection by monkeypox virus (MPV), an emerging human pathogen, and Vaccinia virus (VAC), a widely used model and vaccine organism, in primary human macrophages, primary human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Even as the overwhelmingly infected cells approached their demise, with extensive cytopathic changes, their gene expression programs appeared almost oblivious to poxvirus infection. Although killed (gamma-irradiated) MPV potently induced a transcriptional program characteristic of the interferon response, no such response was observed during infection with either live MPV or VAC. Moreover, while the gene expression response of infected cells to stimulation with ionomycin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or poly (I-C) was largely unimpaired by infection with MPV, a cluster of pro-inflammatory genes were a notable exception. Poly(I-C) induction of genes involved in alerting the innate immune system to the infectious threat, including TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and beta, CCL5 and IL-6, were suppressed by infection with live MPV. Thus, MPV selectively inhibits expression of genes with critical roles in cell-signaling pathways that activate innate immune responses, as part of its strategy for stealthy infection."
https://openalex.org/W2066542358,"The tolerance of cells toward different stresses is very important for industrial strains of microbes, but difficult to improve by the manipulation of single genes. Traditional methods for enhancing cellular tolerances are inefficient and time-consuming. Recently, approaches employing global transcriptional or translational engineering methods have been increasingly explored. We found that an exogenous global regulator, irrE from an extremely radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans, has the potential to act as a global regulator in Escherichia coli, and that laboratory-evolution might be applied to alter this regulator to elicit different phenotypes for E. coli.To extend the methodology for strain improvement and to obtain higher tolerances toward different stresses, we here describe an approach of engineering irrE gene in E. coli. An irrE library was constructed by randomly mutating the gene, and this library was then selected for tolerance to ethanol, butanol and acetate stresses. Several mutants showing significant tolerances were obtained and characterized. The tolerances of E. coli cells containing these mutants were enhanced 2 to 50-fold, based on cell growth tests using different concentrations of alcohols or acetate, and enhanced 10 to 100-fold based on ethanol or butanol shock experiments. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays showed that intracellular ROS levels were sharply reduced for cells containing the irrE mutants. Sequence analysis of the mutants revealed that the mutations distribute cross all three domains of the protein.To our knowledge, this is the first time that an exogenous global regulator has been artificially evolved to suit its new host. The successes suggest the possibility of improving tolerances of industrial strains by introducing and engineering exogenous global regulators, such as those from extremophiles. This new approach can be applied alone or in combination with other global methods, such as global transcriptional machinery engineering (gTME) for strain improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2084469720,"Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activity is deregulated in human GBM due to amplification and rearrangement of the PDGFR-alpha gene locus or overexpression of the PDGF ligand, resulting in the activation of downstream kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Aberrant PDGFR signaling is observed in approximately 25-30% of human GBMs, which are frequently molecularly classified as the proneural subclass. It would be valuable to understand how PDGFR driven GBMs respond to Akt and mTOR inhibition.Using genetically engineered PTEN-intact and PTEN-deficient PDGF-driven mouse models of GBM that closely mimic the histology and genetics of the human PDGF subgroup, we investigated the effect of inhibiting Akt and mTOR alone or in combination in vitro and in vivo. We used perifosine and CCI-779 to inhibit Akt and mTOR, respectively. Here, we show in vitro data demonstrating that the most effective inhibition of Akt and mTOR activity in both PTEN-intact and PTEN-null primary glioma cell cultures is obtained when using both inhibitors in combination. We next investigated if the effects we observed in culture could be duplicated in vivo by treating mice with gliomas for 5 days. The in vivo treatments with the combination of CCI-779 and perifosine resulted in decreased Akt and mTOR signaling, which correlated to decreased proliferation and increased cell death independent of PTEN status, as monitored by immunoblot analysis, histology and MRI.These findings underline the importance of simultaneously targeting Akt and mTOR to achieve significant down-regulation of the PI3K pathway and support the rationale for testing the perifosine and CCI-779 combination in the human PDGF-subgroup of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2008545665,"The formation of multicellular communities known as biofilms is the part of bacterial life cycle in which bacteria display cooperative behaviour and differentiated phenotypes leading to specific functions. Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium that has served for a decade as a model to study the molecular pathways that control biofilm formation. Most of the data on B. subtilis biofilms have come from studies on the formation of pellicles at the air-liquid interface, or on the complex macrocolonies that develop on semi-solid nutritive agar. Here, using confocal laser scanning microcopy, we show that B. subtilis strains of different origins are capable of forming biofilms on immersed surfaces with dramatically protruding “beanstalk-like” structures with certain strains. Indeed, these structures can reach a height of more than 300 µm with one undomesticated strain from a medical environment. Using 14 GFP-labeled mutants previously described as affecting pellicle or complex colony formation, we have identified four genes whose inactivation significantly impeded immersed biofilm development, and one mutation triggering hyperbiofilm formation. We also identified mutations causing the three-dimensional architecture of the biofilm to be altered. Taken together, our results reveal that B. subtilis is able to form specific biofilm features on immersed surfaces, and that the development of these multicellular surface-associated communities involves regulation pathways that are common to those governing the formation of pellicle and/or complex colonies, and also some specific mechanisms. Finally, we propose the submerged surface-associated biofilm as another relevant model for the study of B. subtilis multicellular communities."
https://openalex.org/W1972535578,"H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) is a histone posttranslational modification (PTM) that has emerged as hallmark of pericentromeric heterochromatin. This constitutive chromatin domain is composed of repetitive DNA elements, whose transcription is differentially regulated. Mammalian cells contain three HP1 proteins, HP1α, HP1β and HP1γ These have been shown to bind to H3K9me3 and are thought to mediate the effects of this histone PTM. However, the mechanisms of HP1 chromatin regulation and the exact functional role at pericentromeric heterochromatin are still unclear. Here, we identify activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) as an H3K9me3 associated factor. We show that ADNP does not bind H3K9me3 directly, but that interaction is mediated by all three HP1 isoforms in vitro. However, in cells ADNP localization to areas of pericentromeric heterochromatin is only dependent on HP1α and HP1β. Besides a PGVLL sequence patch we uncovered an ARKS motif within the ADNP homeodomain involved in HP1 dependent H3K9me3 association and localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin. While knockdown of ADNP had no effect on HP1 distribution and heterochromatic histone and DNA modifications, we found ADNP silencing major satellite repeats. Our results identify a novel factor in the translation of H3K9me3 at pericentromeric heterochromatin that regulates transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2049975070,"Octopamine plays an important role in many behaviors in invertebrates. It acts via binding to G protein coupled receptors located on the plasma membrane of responsive cells. Several distinct subtypes of octopamine receptors have been found in invertebrates, yet little is known about the expression pattern of these different receptor subtypes and how each subtype may contribute to different behaviors. One honey bee (Apis mellifera) octopamine receptor, AmOA1, was recently cloned and characterized. Here we continue to characterize the AmOA1 receptor by investigating its distribution in the honey bee brain. We used two independent antibodies produced against two distinct peptides in the carboxyl-terminus to study the distribution of the AmOA1 receptor in the honey bee brain. We found that both anti-AmOA1 antibodies revealed labeling of cell body clusters throughout the brain and within the following brain neuropils: the antennal lobes; the calyces, pedunculus, vertical (alpha, gamma) and medial (beta) lobes of the mushroom body; the optic lobes; the subesophageal ganglion; and the central complex. Double immunofluorescence staining using anti-GABA and anti-AmOA1 receptor antibodies revealed that a population of inhibitory GABAergic local interneurons in the antennal lobes express the AmOA1 receptor in the cell bodies, axons and their endings in the glomeruli. In the mushroom bodies, AmOA1 receptors are expressed in a subpopulation of inhibitory GABAergic feedback neurons that ends in the visual (outer half of basal ring and collar regions) and olfactory (lip and inner basal ring region) calyx neuropils, as well as in the collar and lip zones of the vertical and medial lobes. The data suggest that one effect of octopamine via AmOA1 in the antennal lobe and mushroom body is to modulate inhibitory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2051439391,"Notch signaling involves ligand-receptor interactions through direct cell-cell contact. Multiple Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles during embryonic development and the adult stage. Although Notch signaling plays an important role in regulating differentiation of the epidermis and hair follicles, it remains unclear how Notch signaling participates in late-stage epidermal differentiation and postnatal hair cycle homeostasis.We applied Cre/loxP system to generate conditional gene targeted mice that allow inactivation of critical components of Notch signaling pathway in the skin. Rbpj, the core component of all four Notch receptors, and Pofut1, an essential factor for ligand-receptor interactions, were inactivated in hair follicle lineages and suprabasal layer of the epidermis using the Tgfb3-Cre mouse line. Rbpj conditional inactivation resulted in granular parakeratosis and reactive epidermal hyperplasia. Pofut1 conditional inactivation led to ultrastructural abnormalities in the granular layer and altered filaggrin processing in the epidermis, suggesting a perturbation of the granular layer differentiation. Disruption of Pofut1 in hair follicle lineages resulted in aberrant telogen morphology, a decrease of bulge stem cell markers, and a concomitant increase of K14-positive keratinocytes in the isthmus of mutant hair follicles. Pofut1-deficent hair follicles displayed a delay in anagen re-entry and dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis during the hair cycle transition. Moreover, increased DNA double stand breaks were detected in Pofut1-deficent hair follicles, and real time PCR analyses on bulge keratinocytes isolated by FACS revealed an induction of DNA damage response and a paucity of DNA repair machinery in mutant bulge keratinocytes.our data reveal a role for Notch signaling in regulating late-stage epidermal differentiation. Notch signaling is required for postnatal hair cycle homeostasis by maintaining proper proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049767049,"Gene duplication is a key evolutionary mechanism providing material for the generation of genes with new or modified functions. The fate of duplicated gene copies has been amply discussed and several models have been put forward to account for duplicate conservation. The specialization model considers that duplication of a bifunctional ancestral gene could result in the preservation of both copies through subfunctionalization, resulting in the distribution of the two ancestral functions between the gene duplicates. Here we investigate whether the presumed bifunctional character displayed by the single branched chain amino acid aminotransferase present in K. lactis has been distributed in the two paralogous genes present in S. cerevisiae, and whether this conservation has impacted S. cerevisiae metabolism.Our results show that the KlBat1 orthologous BCAT is a bifunctional enzyme, which participates in the biosynthesis and catabolism of branched chain aminoacids (BCAAs). This dual role has been distributed in S. cerevisiae Bat1 and Bat2 paralogous proteins, supporting the specialization model posed to explain the evolution of gene duplications. BAT1 is highly expressed under biosynthetic conditions, while BAT2 expression is highest under catabolic conditions. Bat1 and Bat2 differential relocalization has favored their physiological function, since biosynthetic precursors are generated in the mitochondria (Bat1), while catabolic substrates are accumulated in the cytosol (Bat2). Under respiratory conditions, in the presence of ammonium and BCAAs the bat1Δ bat2Δ double mutant shows impaired growth, indicating that Bat1 and Bat2 could play redundant roles. In K. lactis wild type growth is independent of BCAA degradation, since a Klbat1Δ mutant grows under this condition.Our study shows that BAT1 and BAT2 differential expression and subcellular relocalization has resulted in the distribution of the biosynthetic and catabolic roles of the ancestral BCAT in two isozymes improving BCAAs metabolism and constituting an adaptation to facultative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2095037241,"The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in a subset of prostate stromal cells and functional stromal cell AR is required for normal prostate developmental and influences the growth of prostate tumors. Although we are broadly aware of the specifics of the genomic actions of AR in prostate cancer cells, relatively little is known regarding the gene targets of functional AR in prostate stromal cells. Here, we describe a novel human prostate stromal cell model that enabled us to study the effects of AR on gene expression in these cells. The model involves a genetically manipulated variant of immortalized human WPMY-1 prostate stromal cells that overexpresses wildtype AR (WPMY-AR) at a level comparable to LNCaP cells and is responsive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation. Use of WPMY-AR cells for gene expression profiling showed that the presence of AR, even in the absence of DHT, significantly altered the gene expression pattern of the cells compared to control (WPMY-Vec) cells. Treatment of WPMY-AR cells, but not WPMY-Vec control cells, with DHT resulted in further changes that affected the expression of 141 genes by 2-fold or greater compared to vehicle treated WPMY-AR cells. Remarkably, DHT significantly downregulated more genes than were upregulated but many of these changes reversed the initial effects of AR overexpression alone on individual genes. The genes most highly effected by DHT treatment were categorized based upon their role in cancer pathways or in cell signaling pathways (transforming growth factor-β, Wnt, Hedgehog and MAP Kinase) thought to be involved in stromal-epithelial crosstalk during prostate or prostate cancer development. DHT treatment of WPMY-AR cells was also sufficient to alter their paracrine potential for prostate cancer cells as conditioned medium from DHT-treated WPMY-AR significantly increased growth of LNCaP cells compared to DHT-treated WPMY-Vec cell conditioned medium."
https://openalex.org/W2062760517,"Four minimal (119-145 residue) active site fragments of Escherichia coli Class II histidyl-tRNA synthetase were constructed, expressed as maltose-binding protein fusions, and assayed for histidine activation as fusion proteins and after TEV cleavage, using the (32)PP(i) exchange assay. All contain conserved Motifs 1 and 2. Two contain an N-terminal extension of Motif 1 and two contain Motif 3. Five experimental results argue strongly for the authenticity of the observed catalytic activities: (i) active site titration experiments showing high (∼0.1-0.55) fractions of active molecules, (ii) release of cryptic activity by TEV cleavage of the fusion proteins, (iii) reduced activity associated with an active site mutation, (iv) quantitative attribution of increased catalytic activity to the intrinsic effects of Motif 3, the N-terminal extension and their synergistic effect, and (v) significantly altered K(m) values for both ATP and histidine substrates. It is therefore plausible that neither the insertion domain nor Motif 3 were essential for catalytic activity in the earliest Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The mean rate enhancement of all four cleaved constructs is ∼10(9) times that of the estimated uncatalyzed rate. As observed for the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) Urzyme, these fragments bind ATP tightly but have reduced affinity for cognate amino acids. These fragments thus likely represent Urzymes (Ur = primitive, original, earliest + enzyme) comparable in size and catalytic activity and coded by sequences proposed to be antisense to that coding the previously described Class I TrpRS Urzyme. Their catalytic activities provide metrics for experimental recapitulation of very early evolutionary events."
https://openalex.org/W2094559890,"Rationale Little is known about gender differences in plasma biomarker levels in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hypothesis There are differences in serum biomarker levels between women and men with COPD. Objective Explore gender differences in plasma biomarker levels in patients with COPD and smokers without COPD. Methods We measured plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, MCP-1, MMP-9, PARC and VEGF in 80 smokers without COPD (40 males, 40 females) and 152 stable COPD patients (76 males, 76 females) with similar airflow obstruction. We determined anthropometrics, smoking history, lung function, exercise tolerance, body composition, BODE index, co-morbidities and quality of life. We then explored associations between plasma biomarkers levels and the clinical characteristics of the patients and also with the clinical and physiological variables known to predict outcome in COPD. Results The plasma biomarkers level explored were similar in men and women without COPD. In contrast, in patients with COPD the median value in pg/mL of IL-6 (6.26 vs 8.0, p = 0.03), IL-16 (390 vs 321, p = 0.009) and VEGF (50 vs 87, p = 0.02) differed between women and men. Adjusted for smoking history, gender was independently associated with IL-16, PARC and VEGF levels. There were also gender differences in the associations between IL-6, IL-16 and VEGF and physiologic variables that predict outcomes. Conclusions In stable COPD patients with similar airflow obstruction, there are gender differences in plasma biomarker levels and in the association between biomarker levels and important clinical or physiological variables. Further studies should confirm our findings."

Objective Determination of the biological consequences of ultradian cortisol pulsatility. Design A novel flow through cell culture system was developed to deliver ultradian pulsed or continuous cortisol to cells. The effects of cortisol dynamics on cell proliferation and survival, and on gene expression were determined. In addition, effects on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression levels and phosphorylation, as a potential mediator, were measured. Results Pulsatile cortisol caused a significant reduction in cell survival compared to continuous exposure of the same cumulative dose, due to increased apoptosis. Comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome response by microarray identified genes with a differential response to pulsatile versus continuous glucocorticoid delivery. These were confirmed with qRT-PCR. Several transcription factor binding sites were enriched in these differentially regulated target genes, including CCAAT-displacement protein (CDP). A CDP regulated reporter gene (MMTV-luc) was, as predicted, also differentially regulated by pulsatile compared to continuous cortisol delivery. Importantly there was no effect of cortisol delivery kinetics on either GR expression, or activation (GR phosphoSer211). Conclusions Cortisol oscillations exert important effects on target cell gene expression, and phenotype. This is not due to differences in cumulative cortisol exposure, or either expression, or activation of the GR. This suggests a novel means to regulate GR function."
https://openalex.org/W2060176486,"Finding new peptide biomarkers for stomach cancer in human sera that can be implemented into a clinically practicable prediction method for monitoring of stomach cancer. We studied the serum peptidome from two different biorepositories. We first employed a C8-reverse phase liquid chromatography approach for sample purification, followed by mass-spectrometry analysis. These were applied onto serum samples from cancer-free controls and stomach cancer patients at various clinical stages. We then created a bioinformatics analysis pipeline and identified peptide signature discriminating stomach adenocarcinoma patients from cancer-free controls. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) results from 103 samples revealed 9 signature peptides; with prediction accuracy of 89% in the training set and 88% in the validation set. Three of the discriminating peptides discovered were fragments of Apolipoproteins C-I and C-III (apoC-I and C-III); we further quantified their serum levels, as well as CA19-9 and CRP, employing quantitative commercial-clinical assays in 142 samples. ApoC-I and apoC-III quantitative results correlated with the MS results. We then employed apoB-100-normalized apoC-I and apoC-III, CA19-9 and CRP levels to generate rules set for stomach cancer prediction. For training, we used sera from one repository, and for validation, we used sera from the second repository. Prediction accuracies of 88.4% and 74.4% were obtained in the training and validation sets, respectively. Serum levels of apoC-I and apoC-III combined with other clinical parameters can serve as a basis for the formulation of a diagnostic score for stomach cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2049440532,"Background This prospective longitudinal study investigates whether suspected motor problems and low preference for active play in childhood are associated with physical inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence. Methodology/Principal Findings The study sample consisted of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC 1986) composed of 5,767 children whose parents responded to a postal inquiry concerning their children's motor skills at age 8 years and who themselves reported their physical activity at age 16 years. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with a cycle ergometer test at age 16 years. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the level of physical activity and fitness were obtained from multinomial logistic regression and adjusted for socio-economic position and body mass index. Low preference for active play in childhood was associated with physical inactivity (boys: OR 3.31, 95% CI 2.42–4.53; girls: OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.36–2.36) and low cardiorespiratory fitness (boys: OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.27–2.74; girls: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09–2.11) in adolescence. Suspected gross (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.33–3.49) and fine (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.35–2.60) motor problems were associated with physical inactivity among boys. Children with suspected motor problems and low preference for active play tended to have an even higher risk of physical inactivity in adolescence. Conclusions/Significance Low preference for active play in childhood was associated with physical inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence. Furthermore, children with suspected motor problems and low preference for active play tended to have an even higher risk of physical inactivity in adolescence. Identification of children who do not prefer active play and who have motor problems may allow targeted interventions to support their motor learning and participation in active play and thereby promote their physical activity and fitness in later life."
https://openalex.org/W1996410567,"Background Animals typically show less habituation to biologically meaningful sounds than to novel signals. We might therefore expect that acoustic deterrents should be based on natural sounds. Methodology We investigated responses by western grey kangaroos (Macropus fulignosus) towards playback of natural sounds (alarm foot stomps and Australian raven (Corvus coronoides) calls) and artificial sounds (faux snake hiss and bull whip crack). We then increased rate of presentation to examine whether animals would habituate. Finally, we varied frequency of playback to investigate optimal rates of delivery. Principal Findings Nine behaviors clustered into five Principal Components. PC factors 1 and 2 (animals alert or looking, or hopping and moving out of area) accounted for 36% of variance. PC factor 3 (eating cessation, taking flight, movement out of area) accounted for 13% of variance. Factors 4 and 5 (relaxing, grooming and walking; 12 and 11% of variation, respectively) discontinued upon playback. The whip crack was most evocative; eating was reduced from 75% of time spent prior to playback to 6% following playback (post alarm stomp: 32%, raven call: 49%, hiss: 75%). Additionally, 24% of individuals took flight and moved out of area (50 m radius) in response to the whip crack (foot stomp: 0%, raven call: 8% and 4%, hiss: 6%). Increasing rate of presentation (12x/min ×2 min) caused 71% of animals to move out of the area. Conclusions/Significance The bull whip crack, an artificial sound, was as effective as the alarm stomp at eliciting aversive behaviors. Kangaroos did not fully habituate despite hearing the signal up to 20x/min. Highest rates of playback did not elicit the greatest responses, suggesting that ‘more is not always better’. Ultimately, by utilizing both artificial and biological sounds, predictability may be masked or offset, so that habituation is delayed and more effective deterrents may be produced."
https://openalex.org/W2069026920,"Research has shown that the synergistic interaction between vagal cholecystokinin-A receptors (CCKARs) and leptin receptors (LRbs) mediates short term satiety. We hypothesize that this synergistic interaction is mediated by cross-talk between signaling cascades used by CCKARs and LRbs, which, in turn, activates closure of K(+) channels, leading to membrane depolarization and neuronal firing. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed on isolated rat nodose ganglia neurons. Western immunoblots elucidated the intracellular signaling pathways that modulate leptin/CCK synergism. In addition, STAT3, PI3K, Src, and MAPK genes were silenced by lentiviral infection and transient Lipofectamine transfection of cultured rat nodose ganglia to determine the effect of these molecules on leptin/CCK synergism. Patch clamp studies showed that a combination of leptin and CCK-8 caused a significant increase in membrane input resistance compared with leptin or CCK-8 alone. Silencing the STAT3 gene abolished the synergistic action of leptin/CCK-8 on neuronal firing. Leptin/CCK-8 synergistically stimulated a 7.7-fold increase in phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), which was inhibited by AG490, C3 transferase, PP2, LY294002, and wortmannin, but not PD98059. Silencing the Src and PI3K genes resulted in a loss of leptin/CCK-stimulated pSTAT3. We conclude that the synergistic interaction between vagal CCKARs and LRbs is mediated by the phosphorylation of STAT3, which, in turn, activates closure of K(+) channels, leading to membrane depolarization and neuronal firing. This involves the interaction between CCK/Src/PI3K cascades and leptin/JAK2/PI3K/STAT3 signaling pathways. Malfunctioning of these signaling molecules may result in eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2039683912,"Site-specific proteolysis of proteins plays an important role in many cellular functions and is often key to the virulence of infectious organisms. Efficient methods for characterization of proteases and their substrates will therefore help us understand these fundamental processes and thereby hopefully point towards new therapeutic strategies. Here, a novel whole-cell in vivo method was used to investigate the substrate preference of the sequence specific tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp). The assay, which utilizes protease-mediated intracellular rescue of genetically encoded short-lived fluorescent substrate reporters to enhance the fluorescence of the entire cell, allowed subtle differences in the processing efficiency of closely related substrate peptides to be detected. Quantitative screening of large combinatorial substrate libraries, through flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting, enabled identification of optimal substrates for TEVp. The peptide, ENLYFQG, identical to the protease's natural substrate peptide, emerged as a strong consensus cleavage sequence, and position P3 (tyrosine, Y) and P1 (glutamine, Q) within the substrate peptide were confirmed as being the most important specificity determinants. In position P1', glycine (G), serine (S), cysteine (C), alanine (A) and arginine (R) were among the most prevalent residues observed, all known to generate functional TEVp substrates and largely in line with other published studies stating that there is a strong preference for short aliphatic residues in this position. Interestingly, given the complex hydrogen-bonding network that the P6 glutamate (E) is engaged in within the substrate-enzyme complex, an unexpectedly relaxed residue preference was revealed for this position, which has not been reported earlier. Thus, in the light of our results, we believe that our assay, besides enabling protease substrate profiling, also may serve as a highly competitive platform for directed evolution of proteases and their substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2079297762,"Background The epidemic of gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has garnered popular media attention, but is incompletely described in the medical literature to date. In particular, the relative importance of militarized compared to civilian rape and the impact on vulnerable populations merits further study. We describe a retrospective case series of sexual abuse among children and youth in eastern DRC. Methods Medical records of patients treated for sexual assault at HEAL Africa Hospital, Goma, DRC between 2006 and 2008 were reviewed. Information extracted from the chart record was summarized using descriptive statistics, with comparative statistics to examine differences between pediatric (≤18 yrs) and adult patients. Findings 440 pediatric and 54 adult sexual abuse cases were identified. Children and youth were more often assaulted by someone known to the family (74% vs 30%, OR 6.7 [95%CI 3.6–12], p<0.001), and less frequently by military personnel (13% vs 48%, OR 0.14 [95%CI 0.075–0.26], p<0.001). Delayed presentation for medical care (>72 hours after the assault) was more common in pediatric patients (53% vs 33%, OR 2.2 [95%CI 1.2–4.0], p = 0.007). Physical signs of sexual abuse, including lesions of the posterior fourchette, hymeneal tears, and anal lesions, were more commonly observed in children and youth (84% vs 69%, OR 2.3 [95%CI 1.3–4.4], p = 0.006). Nine (2.9%) pediatrics patients were HIV-positive at presentation, compared to 5.3% of adults (p = 0.34). Interpretation World media attention has focused on violent rape as a weapon of war in the DRC. Our data highlight some neglected but important and distinct aspects of the ongoing epidemic of sexual violence: sexual abuse of children and youth."
https://openalex.org/W1972839799,"A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the rearrangement of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide to a non-native conformation that promotes the formation of toxic, nanoscale aggregates. Recent studies have pointed to the role of sample preparation in creating polymorphic fibrillar species. One of many potential pathways for Aβ toxicity may be modulation of lipid membrane function on cellular surfaces. There are several mutations clustered around the central hydrophobic core of Aβ near the α-secretase cleavage site (E22G Arctic mutation, E22K Italian mutation, D23N Iowa mutation, and A21G Flemish mutation). These point mutations are associated with hereditary diseases ranging from almost pure cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) to typical Alzheimer's disease pathology with plaques and tangles. We investigated how these point mutations alter Aβ aggregation in the presence of supported lipid membranes comprised of total brain lipid extract. Brain lipid extract bilayers were used as a physiologically relevant model of a neuronal cell surface. Intact lipid bilayers were exposed to predominantly monomeric preparations of Wild Type or different mutant forms of Aβ, and atomic force microscopy was used to monitor aggregate formation and morphology as well as bilayer integrity over a 12 hour period. The goal of this study was to determine how point mutations in Aβ, which alter peptide charge and hydrophobic character, influence interactions between Aβ and the lipid surface. While fibril morphology did not appear to be significantly altered when mutants were prepped similarly and incubated under free solution conditions, aggregation in the lipid membranes resulted in a variety of polymorphic aggregates in a mutation dependent manner. The mutant peptides also had a variable ability to disrupt bilayer integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2071963408,"Background Despite its initial positive response to hormone ablation therapy, prostate cancers invariably recur in more aggressive, treatment resistant forms. The lack of our understanding of underlying genetic alterations for the transition from androgen-dependent (AD) to ADI prostate cancer growth hampers our ability to develop target-driven therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of ADI prostate cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings By screening a library of activated human kinases, we have identified TPL2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, as driving ADI prostate cancer growth. TPL2 activation by over-expressing either wild-type or a constitutively activated form of TPL2 induced ADI growth, whereas the suppression of TPL2 expression and its kinase activity in ADI prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation under androgen-depleted conditions. Most importantly, TPL2 is upregulated in ADI prostate cancers of both the Pten deletion mouse model and the clinical prostate cancer specimens. Conclusions/Significance Together these data suggest that TPL2 kinase plays a critical role in the promotion of ADI prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, the suppression of TPL2 diminishes ADI prostate cancer growth and a high frequency of TPL2 overexpression in human ADI prostate cancer samples validates TPL2 as a target for the treatment of this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W1977626022,"Interleukin 1α (IL1α) plays an important role in several key biological functions, such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth in several types of cancer. IL1α is a potent cytokine that induces a wide spectrum of immunological and inflammatory activities. The biological effects of IL1α are mediated through the activation of transmembrane receptors (IL1Rs) and therefore require the release of the protein into the extracellular space. IL1α is exported through a non-classical release pathway involving the formation of a specific multiprotein complex, which includes IL1α and S100A13. Because IL1α plays an important role in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, inhibiting the formation of the IL1α-S100A13 complex would be an effective strategy to inhibit a wide range of cancers. To understand the molecular events in the IL1α release pathway, we studied the structure of the IL1α-S100A13 tetrameric complex, which is the key complex formed during the non-classical pathway of IL1α release."
https://openalex.org/W2001750244,"Background Animal mitochondrial genomes typically encode one tRNA for each synonymous codon family, so that each tRNA anticodon essentially has to wobble to recognize two or four synonymous codons. Several factors have been hypothesized to determine the nucleotide at the wobble site of a tRNA anticodon in mitochondrial genomes, such as the codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis, the wobble versatility hypothesis, the translation initiation and elongation conflict hypothesis, and the wobble cost hypothesis. Principal Findings In this study, we analyzed codon usage and tRNA anticodon wobble sites of 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes to evaluate features of the wobble nucleotides in tRNA anticodons. The strand-specific mutation bias favors G and T on the H strand in all the 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes. A bias favoring G and T is also visible in the third codon positions of protein-coding genes and the wobble sites of anticodons, rejecting that codon usage bias drives the wobble sites of tRNA anticodons or tRNA anticodon bias drives the evolution of codon usage. Almost all codon families (98.9%) from marine bivalve mitogenomes support the wobble versatility hypothesis. There are a few interesting exceptions involving tRNATrp with an anticodon CCA fixed in Pectinoida species, tRNASer with a GCU anticodon fixed in Mytiloida mitogenomes, and the uniform anticodon CAU of tRNAMet translating the AUR codon family. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that most of the nucleotides at the wobble sites of tRNA anticodons in marine bivalve mitogenomes are determined by wobble versatility. Other factors such as the translation initiation and elongation conflict, and the cost of wobble translation may contribute to the determination of the wobble nucleotide in tRNA anticodons. The finding presented here provides valuable insights into the previous hypotheses of the wobble nucleotide in tRNA anticodons by adding some new evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2019067787,"Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (Lef) 1 is a high mobility group protein best known as a Wnt-responsive transcription factor that associates with β-catenin. Lef1ΔN is a short isoform of Lef1 that lacks the first 113 amino acids and a well characterized high affinity β-catenin binding domain present in the full-length protein. Both Lef1 isoforms bind DNA and regulate gene expression. We previously reported that Lef1 is expressed in proliferating osteoblasts and blocks osteocalcin expression. In contrast, Lef1ΔN is only detectable in the later stages of osteoblast differentiation and promotes osteogenesis in vitro. Here, we show that Lef1ΔN retains the ability to interact physically and functionally with β-catenin. Unlike what has been reported in T cells and colon cancer cell lines, Lef1ΔN activated gene transcription in the absence of exogenous β-catenin and cooperated with constitutively active β-catenin to stimulate gene transcription in mesenchymal and osteoblastic cells. Residues at the N terminus of Lef1ΔN were required for β-catenin binding and the expression of osteoblast differentiation genes. To determine the role of Lef1ΔN on bone formation in vivo, a Lef1ΔN transgene was expressed in committed osteoblasts using the 2.3-kb fragment of the type 1 collagen promoter. The Lef1ΔN transgenic mice had higher trabecular bone volume in the proximal tibias and L5 vertebrae. Histological analyses of tibial sections revealed no differences in osteoblast, osteoid, or osteoclast surface areas. However, bone formation and mineral apposition rates as well as osteocalcin levels were increased in Lef1ΔN transgenic mice. Together, our data indicate that Lef1ΔN binds β-catenin, stimulates Lef/Tcf reporter activity, and promotes terminal osteoblast differentiation."

A functional genetic polymorphism of the 5-HT 2a receptor (5-HTR2a His452Tyr), which leads to blunted intracellular signaling, has previously been associated with explicit memory performance in several independent cohorts, but the underlying neural mechanisms are thus far unclear. The human hippocampus plays a critical role in memory, particularly in the detection and encoding of novel information. Here we investigated the relationship of 5-HTR2a His452Tyr and hippocampal novelty processing in 41 young, healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed a novelty/familiarity task with complex scene stimuli, which was followed by a delayed recognition memory test 24 hours later. Compared to His homozygotes, Tyr carriers exhibited a diminished hippocampal response to novel stimuli and a higher tendency to judge novel stimuli as familiar during delayed recognition. Across the cohort, the false alarm rate during delayed recognition correlated negatively with the hippocampal novelty response. Our results suggest that previously reported effects of 5-HTR2a on explicit memory performance may, at least in part, be mediated by alterations of hippocampal novelty processing."
https://openalex.org/W2053509462,"Classical ecological theory predicts that changes in the availability of essential resources such as nitrogen should lead to changes in plant community composition due to differences in species-specific nutrient requirements. What remains unknown, however, is the extent to which climate change will alter the relationship between plant communities and the nitrogen cycle. During intervals of climate change, do changes in nitrogen cycling lead to vegetation change or do changes in community composition alter the nitrogen dynamics? We used long-term ecological data to determine the role of nitrogen availability in changes of forest species composition under a rapidly changing climate during the early Holocene (16k to 8k cal. yrs. BP). A statistical computational analysis of ecological data spanning 8,000 years showed that secondary succession from a coniferous to deciduous forest occurred independently of changes in the nitrogen cycle. As oak replaced pine under a warming climate, nitrogen cycling rates increased. Interestingly, the mechanism by which the species interacted with nitrogen remained stable across this threshold change in climate and in the dominant tree species. This suggests that changes in tree population density over successional time scales are not driven by nitrogen availability. Thus, current models of forest succession that incorporate the effects of available nitrogen may be over-estimating tree population responses to changes in this resource, which may result in biased predictions of future forest dynamics under climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2091331270,"Whether species exhibit significant heritable variation in fitness is central for sexual selection. According to good genes models there must be genetic variation in males leading to variation in offspring fitness if females are to obtain genetic benefits from exercising mate preferences, or by mating multiply. However, sexual selection based on genetic benefits is controversial, and there is limited unambiguous support for the notion that choosy or polyandrous females can increase the chances of producing offspring with high viability. Here we examine the levels of additive genetic variance in two fitness components in the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. We found significant sire effects on egg-to-adult viability and on son, but not daughter, survival to sexual maturity, as well as moderate coefficients of additive variance in these traits. Moreover, we do not find evidence for sexual antagonism influencing genetic variation for fitness. Our results are consistent with good genes sexual selection, and suggest that both pre- and postcopulatory mate choice, and male competition could provide indirect benefits to females."
https://openalex.org/W2008023480,"Genetic variations in the gene encoding dysbindin has consistently been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, although little is known about the neural functions carried out by dysbindin. To gain some insight into this area, we took advantage of the readily available dysbindin-null mouse sandy (sdy-/-) and studied hippocampal neurogenesis using thymidine analogue bromodeoxuridine (BrdU). No significant differences were found in the proliferation (4 hours) or survival (1, 4 and 8 weeks after the last BrdU injection) of progenitors in the subgranular regions of the dentate gyrus between sdy-/- and sdy+/+ (control) mice. However, 4 weeks after the last BrdU injection, a significant reduction was observed in the ratio of neuronal differentiation in sdy-/- when compared to that of sdy+/+ (sdy+/+ = 87.0 ± 5.3% vs. sdy-/- = 71.3 ± 8.3%, p = 0.01). These findings suggest that dysbindin plays a role during differentiation process in the adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that its deficit may negatively affect neurogenesis-related functions such as cognition and mood."

With the recent descriptions of the new species B. rhizoxinica and B. endofungorum, which are considered endosymbiotic bacteria in Rhizopus microsporus fungi, we now identify seven of these clinical isolates as B. rhizoxinica and one as B. endofungorum based on biochemical testing, 16s rRNA, and DNA-DNA hybridization results. We also further characterize these isolates by assessing toxin production and/or by multiple locus sequence typing."
https://openalex.org/W1991531363,"Relying on surveillance of clinical cases limits the ability to understand the full impact and severity of an epidemic, especially when subclinical cases are more likely to be present in the early stages. Little is known of the infection and transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) virus outside of Mexico prior to clinical cases being reported, and of the knowledge pertaining to immunity and incidence of infection during April-June, which is essential for understanding the nature of viral transmissibility as well as for planning surveillance and intervention of future pandemics.Starting in the fall of 2008, 306 persons from households with schoolchildren in central Taiwan were followed sequentially and serum samples were taken in three sampling periods for haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Age-specific incidence rates were calculated based on seroconversion of antibodies to the pH1N1 virus with an HI titre of 1:40 or more during two periods: April-June and September-October in 2009. The earliest time period with HI titer greater than 40, as well as a four-fold increase of the neutralization titer, was during April 26-May 3. The incidence rates during the pre-epidemic phase (April-June) and the first wave (July-October) of the pandemic were 14.1% and 29.7%, respectively. The transmissibility of the pH1N1 virus during the early phase of the epidemic, as measured by the effective reproductive number R(0), was 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.34).Approximately one in every ten persons was infected with the 2009 pH1N1 virus during the pre-epidemic phase in April-June. The lack of age-pattern in seropositivity is unexpected, perhaps highlighting the importance of children as asymptomatic transmitters of influenza in households. Although without virological confirmation, our data raise the question of whether there was substantial pH1N1 transmission in Taiwan before June, when clinical cases were first detected by the surveillance network."
https://openalex.org/W1993027005,"Background The load theory of selective attention hypothesizes that distractor interference is suppressed after perceptual processing (i.e., in the later stage of central processing) at low perceptual load of the central task, but in the early stage of perceptual processing at high perceptual load. Consistently, studies on the neural correlates of attention have found a smaller distractor-related activation in the sensory cortex at high relative to low perceptual load. However, it is not clear whether the distractor-related activation in brain regions linked to later stages of central processing (e.g., in the frontostriatal circuits) is also smaller at high rather than low perceptual load, as might be predicted based on the load theory. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 24 healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a visual target identification task with two perceptual loads (low vs. high). Participants showed distractor-related increases in activation in the midbrain, striatum, occipital and medial and lateral prefrontal cortices at low load, but distractor-related decreases in activation in the midbrain ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (VTA/SN), striatum, thalamus, and extensive sensory cortices at high load. Conclusions Multiple levels of central processing involving midbrain and frontostriatal circuits participate in suppressing distractor interference at either low or high perceptual load. For suppressing distractor interference, the processing of sensory inputs in both early and late stages of central processing are enhanced at low load but inhibited at high load."
https://openalex.org/W1976046251,"A fundamental trait of the human self is its continuum experience of space and time. Perceptual aberrations of this spatial and temporal continuity is a major characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum disturbances – including schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder and schizotypy. We have previously found the classical Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) scores, related to body and space, to be positively correlated with both behavior and temporo-parietal activation in healthy participants performing a task involving self-projection in space. However, not much is known about the relationship between temporal perceptual aberration, behavior and brain activity. To this aim, we composed a temporal Perceptual Aberration Scale (tPAS) similar to the traditional PAS. Testing on 170 participants suggested similar performance for PAS and tPAS. We then correlated tPAS and PAS scores to participants' performance and neural activity in a task of self-projection in time. tPAS scores correlated positively with reaction times across task conditions, as did PAS scores. Evoked potential mapping and electrical neuroimaging showed self-projection in time to recruit a network of brain regions at the left anterior temporal cortex, right temporo-parietal junction, and occipito-temporal cortex, and duration of activation in this network positively correlated with tPAS and PAS scores. These data demonstrate that schizotypal perceptual aberrations of both time and space, as reflected by tPAS and PAS scores, are positively correlated with performance and brain activation during self-projection in time in healthy individuals along the schizophrenia spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2146780772,"In a recent directed-evolution study, Escherichia coli D-sialic acid aldolase was converted by introducing eight point mutations into a new enzyme with relaxed specificity, denoted RS-aldolase (also known formerly as L-3-deoxy-manno-2-octulosonic acid (L-KDO) aldolase), which showed a preferred selectivity toward L-KDO. To investigate the underlying molecular basis, we determined the crystal structures of D-sialic acid aldolase and RS-aldolase. All mutations are away from the catalytic center, except for V251I, which is near the opening of the (α/β)(8)-barrel and proximal to the Schiff base-forming Lys-165. The change of specificity from D-sialic acid to RS-aldolase can be attributed mainly to the V251I substitution, which creates a narrower sugar-binding pocket, but without altering the chirality in the reaction center. The crystal structures of D-sialic acid aldolase·l-arabinose and RS-aldolase·hydroxypyruvate complexes and five mutants (V251I, V251L, V251R, V251W, and V251I/V265I) of the D-sialic acid aldolase were also determined, revealing the location of substrate molecules and how the contour of the active site pocket was shaped. Interestingly, by mutating Val251 alone, the enzyme can accept substrates of varying size in the aldolase reactions and still retain stereoselectivity. The engineered D-sialic acid aldolase may find applications in synthesizing unnatural sugars of C(6) to C(10) for the design of antagonists and inhibitors of glycoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2076961505,"Background Many countries face severe scale-up barriers toward achievement of MDGs. We ascertained motivational and experiential dimensions of participation in a novel, rapid, “diagonal” Integrated Prevention Campaign (IPC) in rural Kenya that provided prevention goods and services to 47,000 people within one week, aimed at rapidly moving the region toward MDG achievement. Specifically, the IPC provided interventions and commodities targeting disease burden reduction in HIV/AIDS, malaria, and water-borne illness. Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with 34 people (18 living with HIV/AIDS and 16 not HIV-infected) randomly selected from IPC attendees consenting to participate. Interviews were examined for themes and patterns to elucidate participant experience and motivation with IPC. Findings Participants report being primarily motivated to attend IPC to learn of their HIV status (through voluntary counseling and testing), and with receipt of prevention commodities (bednets, water filters, and condoms) providing further incentive. Participants reported that they were satisfied with the IPC experience and offered suggestions to improve future campaigns. Interpretation Learning their HIV status motivated participants along with the incentive of a wider set of commodities that were rapidly deployed through IPC in this challenging region. The critical role of wanting to know their HIV status combined with commodity incentives may offer a new model for rapid scaled-up of prevention strategies that are wider in scope in rural Africa."
https://openalex.org/W1997530178,"Background HIV adherence to erythrocytes has been demonstrated in vitro, and it has been suggested that erythrocytes may be carriers of the virus. However, the association between HIV particles or viral proteins and erythrocytes in HIV-infected individuals is still to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings HIV-positive participants (n = 112) were classified into two groups according to values of three plasma viral loads (pVL) determined during the 12-month period prior to the study. The first group included 71 individuals with detectable pVL, whereas the second group included 41 individuals with undetectable pVL. Plasma viral load, erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen and p24-antigen in plasma were determined at the moment of the study. A total of 51 out of the 71 patients with detectable pVL showed erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen whereas 13 showed p24-antigen in plasma. Twenty-two out of the 51 patients with erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen showed pVL<10,000 copies/ml and undetectable p24-antigen in plasma. The data indicates that the amount of erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen was not related to p24-antigen in plasma or pVL levels in this group. Among the 41 patients with prior undetectable pVL, eight presented detectable pVL and erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen at the moment of the study. The other 33 showed undetectable pVL and five of these presented erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen. A positive relationship was found between the presence of erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen and the detectable pVL at the moment of the study (p<0.00001). Even more, in another series of assays, a detectable viral load associated to erythrocytes was determined and it was always accompanied by erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen detection. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates the presence of erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen in HIV-infected individuals. Since erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen is not always related to pVL or p24-antigen in plasma, erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen showed viral expression not represented in plasma. Therefore, the determination of erythrocyte-associated p24-antigen may contribute to better understand the kinetics and/or evolution of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2117859779,"Face aftereffects are proving to be an effective means of examining the properties of face-specific processes in the human visual system. We examined the role of gender in the neural representation of faces using a contrast-based adaptation method. If faces of different genders share the same representational face space, then adaptation to a face of one gender should affect both same- and different-gender faces. Further, if these aftereffects differ in magnitude, this may indicate distinct gender-related factors in the organization of this face space. To control for a potential confound between physical similarity and gender, we used a Bayesian ideal observer and human discrimination data to construct a stimulus set in which pairs of different-gender faces were equally dissimilar as same-gender pairs. We found that the recognition of both same-gender and different-gender faces was suppressed following a brief exposure of 100ms. Moreover, recognition was more suppressed for test faces of a different-gender than those of the same-gender as the adaptor, despite the equivalence in physical and psychophysical similarity. Our results suggest that male and female faces likely occupy the same face space, allowing transfer of aftereffects between the genders, but that there are special properties that emerge along gender-defining dimensions of this space."
https://openalex.org/W2002173490,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder manifesting in debilitating motor symptoms. This disorder is characterized by abnormal activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop at both the single neuron and network levels. Previous neurophysiological studies have suggested that the encoding of movement in the parkinsonian state involves correlated activity and synchronized firing patterns. In this study, we used multi-electrode recordings to directly explore the activity of neurons from the globus pallidus of parkinsonian primates during passive limb movements and to determine the extent to which they interact and synchronize. The vast majority (80/103) of the recorded pallidal neurons responded to periodic flexion-extension movements of the elbow. The response pattern was sinusoidal-like and the timing of the peak response of the neurons was uniformly distributed around the movement cycle. The interaction between the neuronal activities was analyzed for 123 simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons. Movement-based signal correlation values were diverse and their mean was not significantly different from zero, demonstrating that the neurons were not activated synchronously in response to movement. Additionally, the difference in the peak responses phase of pairs of neurons was uniformly distributed, showing their independent firing relative to the movement cycle. Our results indicate that despite the widely distributed activity in the globus pallidus of the parkinsonian primate, movement encoding is dispersed and independent rather than correlated and synchronized, thus contradicting current views that posit synchronous activation during Parkinson's disease."
