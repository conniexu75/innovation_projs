https://openalex.org/W1798313689,"Dendritic spines serve as preferential sites of excitatory synaptic connections and are pleomorphic. To address the structure-function relationship of the dendritic spines, we used two-photon uncaging of glutamate to allow mapping of functional glutamate receptors at the level of the single synapse. Our analyses of the spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons reveal that AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)-type glutamate receptors are abundant (up to 150/spine) in mushroom spines but sparsely distributed in thin spines and filopodia. The latter may be serving as the structural substrates of the silent synapses that have been proposed to play roles in development and plasticity of synaptic transmission. Our data indicate that distribution of functional AMPA receptors is tightly correlated with spine geometry and that receptor activity is independently regulated at the level of single spines."
https://openalex.org/W2075930760,"Amyloid beta protein (AbetaP) is the major constituent of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its mechanistic role in AD pathogenesis is poorly understood. Globular and nonfibrillar AbetaPs are continuously released during normal metabolism. Using techniques of atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy, electrical recording, and biochemical assays, we have examined the molecular conformations of reconstituted globular AbetaPs as well as their real-time and acute effects on neuritic degeneration. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of AbetaP1-42 shows globular structures that do not form fibers in physiological-buffered solution for up to 8 h of continuous imaging. AFM of AbetaP1-42 reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer reveals multimeric channel-like structures. Consistent with these AFM resolved channel-like structures, biochemical analysis demonstrates that predominantly monomeric AbetaPs in solution form stable tetramers and hexamers after incorporation into lipid membranes. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate the presence of multiple single channel currents of different sizes. At the cellular level, AbetaP1-42 allows calcium uptake and induces neuritic abnormality in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. At physiological nanomolar concentrations, rapid neuritic degeneration was observed within minutes; at micromolar concentrations, neuronal death was observed within 3-4 h. These effects are prevented by zinc (an AbetaP channel blocker) and by the removal of extracellular calcium, but are not prevented by antagonists of putative AbetaP cell surface receptors. Thus, AbetaP channels may provide a direct pathway for calcium-dependent AbetaP toxicity in AD."

To address this issue directly, we employed caveolin-1 gene knock-out mice that lack caveolin-1 protein expression and caveolae organelles. Here, we show that endothelial cell caveolae are required for the efficient uptake and transport of a known caveolar ligand, i.e. albumin,in vivo. Caveolin-1-null mice were perfused with 5-nm gold-conjugated albumin, and its uptake was followed by transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicate that gold-conjugated albumin is not endocytosed by Cav-1-deficient lung endothelial cells and remains in the blood vessel lumen; in contrast, gold-conjugated albumin was concentrated and internalized by lung endothelial cell caveolae in wild-type mice, as expected. To quantitate this defect in uptake, we next studied the endocytosis of radioiodinated albumin using aortic ring segments from wild-type and Cav-1-null mice. Interestingly, little or no uptake of radioiodinated albumin was observed in the aortic segments from Cav-1-deficient mice, whereas aortic segments from wild-type mice showed robust uptake that was time- and temperature-dependent and competed by unlabeled albumin. We conclude that endothelial cell caveolae are required for the efficient uptake and transport of albumin from the blood to the interstitium.

They represent an appendage of the plasma membrane. Caveolae are most abundant in endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, although they are thought to exist in most cell types (reviewed in Refs. 1Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.

The exact function of caveolae remains largely unknown; however, they are thought to function in both cellular transport processes, such as endothelial cell transcytosis, and signal transduction. In the early 1950s (6Palade G.E. J. Appl. Phys. 1953; 24: 1424-1436Google Scholar, 7Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), caveolae were first implicated in the fluid phase transcytosis of both large and small molecules across capillary endothelial cells (8Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 586-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition, albumin undergoes receptor-mediated transcytosis across endothelia via caveolae (9Ghitescu L. Fixman A. Simonescu M. Simonescu N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Ghitescu L. Bendayan M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As albumin is an abundant serum protein that functions as a carrier for fatty acids, steroids, and thyroid hormones, the caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin may represent the mechanism by which these important molecules are distributed from the vascular space to surrounding tissues (11Predescu D. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H725-733PubMed Google Scholar,12Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H937-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of albumin may be related to its ability to bind fatty acids as fatty acid-carrying albumin is endocytosed and transcytosed by endothelial cells at a rate 1.5–2.4-fold higher than defatted albumin (13Galis Z. Ghitescu L. Simionescu M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1988; 47: 358-365PubMed Google Scholar). In support of these morphological studies, albumin was shown to be a major protein component of caveolae purified from lung tissue (an endothelial-rich tissue source), providing a biochemical correlate to these earlier observations (14Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. Hermanoski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The finding that a putative luminal content molecule is retained within these membrane domains could also imply that either albumin is receptor-bound or that a fraction of these vesicular structures remains sealed throughout the isolation procedure. However, over the years, many investigators have challenged the idea that caveolae function in the transport of macromolecules across the endothelial barrier (15Bretscher M. Whytock S. J. Ultrastruc.

Rev. 1983; 63: 1536-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this regard, the role of caveolae in endothelial uptake and transport still remains uncertain (11Predescu D. Palade G.E. Am.

It has been proposed that caveolin functions as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate specific lipids (cholesterol and sphingolipids; Refs. 30Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Recently, our group as well as others have identified a family of caveolin-related proteins (caveolin-2 and caveolin-3; Refs. 36Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P.

Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 appears to be an essential component of caveolae (40Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, caveolin-1 protein expression directly parallels caveolae formation during adipocyte differentiation (36Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 41Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Conversely, caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression are lost or reduced during cell transformation and caveolae are absent from these cell lines (43Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Recombinant overexpression of caveolin-1 in caveolin-deficient cell lines results in (i) the correct biochemical targeting of caveolin-1 to caveolae-enriched membrane fractions (44Scherer P.E.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results provide direct evidence that caveolin family members participate in caveolae formation. The mechanism of how caveolin-1 expression induces caveolae formation remains unknown. This may be related to the self-assembly properties of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 undergoes two stages of oligomerization. First, in the endoplasmic reticulum, caveolin-1 monomers assemble into discrete multivalent homo-oligomers containing ∼14–16 monomers per oligomer (35Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 47Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these individual caveolin-1 homo-oligomers (4–6-nm spherical particles) can interact with each other to form clusters of particles that are ∼25–50 nm in diameter (35Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Also caveolin-1 homo-oligomers interact specifically with sphingolipids (48Fra A.M. Masserini M. Palestini P. Sonnino S. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and cholesterol (30Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Weiland F. Kurzchalia T. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Thus, we envisage that through the interaction of caveolin-1 with itself and the caveolin-mediated selection of endogenous lipid components, a caveolae-sized vesicle is generated (40Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have generated Cav-1-deficient mice by using a targeted gene disruption approach (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these mice are viable and fertile. However, Cav-1-null mice clearly lack caveolae organelles in the cell types where the caveolin-1 protein is normally expressed, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The loss of caveolae organelles in Cav-1-deficient mice makes them a useful experimental system to study the putative functions of caveolae in anin vivo setting. Given that the role of caveolae in endothelial cell-mediated transcytosis has been a hotly debated topic for many years, we decided to assess whether caveolae organelles were required in vivo to mediate the uptake and transport of albumin by endothelial cells. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells are defective in the uptake and transport of albumin. The strategy used to target the caveolin-1 locus and generate Cav-1-null mice was as previously described (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F.

All animals used in these studies (mice homozygous null for the caveolin-1 gene and their wild-type littermates) were in a C57BL/6 × sv129 genetic background and were genotyped by PCR, as previously described (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Housing and maintenance was provided by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM) barrier facility; mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and had ad libitum access to chow (Picolab 20, PMI Nutrition International) and water. All animal protocols used in this study were pre-approved by the AECOM Institute for Animal Studies. 0.5 ml of BSA1 coupled to 5-nm gold particles (A520 ∼5.0, Sigma) was diluted into 5 ml of aerated serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 14 mm glucose and prewarmed to 37 °C. The circulatory system was washed with 3 ml of PBS after a laparatomy was performed. The gold solution was injected into the right ventricle of anesthetized aged-matched wild-type and Cav-1-null mice using a 5-cc syringe and a 30-gauge needle. The gold solution was injected at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. After 15 min from the beginning of perfusion, the lung tissue was removed from the mouse, rinsed in PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer. The tissue was then processed for transmission electron microscopy, as previously described (43Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Samples were then placed in 30% sucrose overnight and frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek). Five micron sections were cut using a Leica CM 3050 cryostat and placed on super frost plus slides (Fisher). The slides were then hematoxylin- and eosin-stained according to standard laboratory protocols. Uptake studies with radioiodinated albumin were performed essentially as described previously, with minor modifications (52Tiruppathi C. Song W. Bergenfeldt M. Sass P. Malik A.B. J. Biol.

Five segments were used per time point and were incubated with 25 μl of 125I-BSA (0.5 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.5 ml of aerated serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 15, 30, and 45 min. One set of aortic segments from both genotypes was also incubated with an excess of cold BSA at 5 mg/ml for 45 min. All the above time points and conditions were then incubated at 37 °C. An additional set of segments from both genotypes was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C to block any internalization via endocytosis. All samples were then washed four times in 0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl buffer, pH 2.5, to remove any 125I-BSA that remained attached to the cell surface. The amount of radioactivity was determined for each aortic segment individually using an LKB 1282 CompuGamma scintillation counter. The samples were then dried and weighed. The final value for each sample was determined by dividing the cpm value by the dry weight. The individual segments adjusted cpm values for each time point and condition and were then averaged for that condition to yield the final cpm value. Using targeted gene disruption, we recently generated caveolin-1-deficient mice (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G.

As these animals also lack caveolae organelles, these mice represent a new model system in which to study the in vivo function of caveolae. Our preliminary experiments with fibroblasts isolated from Cav-1-null mouse embryos indicated that these cells were defective in the in vitrouptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin, a known caveolar ligand, as seen by fluorescence microscopy (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

This initial finding prompted us to study the endocytic behavior of Cav-1-null endothelial cellsin vivo. Transport of ligands from the blood-space to the tissue-space via endothelial cell caveolae has remained a controversial topic in cell biology for over 40 years. We reasoned that the use of caveolin-1-deficient mice should allow us to finally resolve this controversy. Albumin has been used previously to examine caveolar endocytosis in the lung in vivo (9Ghitescu L. Fixman A. Simonescu M. Simonescu N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 53Ghinea N. Fixman A. Alexandru D. Popov D. Hasu M. Ghitescu L. Eskenasy M. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the in situ ability of lung endothelial cells from Cav-1-null mice to endocytose gold-labeled BSA. Animals were perfused with gold-labeled BSA, and lung tissue samples were collected and processed for transmission electron microscopy (See “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1 shows that lung endothelial cells from Cav-1-deficient mice do not have any caveolae and cannot endocytose albumin. After 15 min, the gold-labeled BSA still remains within the lumen of the blood vessels (panels C andD). In contrast, lung endothelial cells from wild-type littermates (panels A and B), taken at the same time point, show a large portion of the gold-labeled BSA within caveolae. Fig. 2 presents higher magnification views of albumin endocytosis via caveolae in the lung. These micrographs clearly show multiple gold particles within caveolae both open to the lumen (panel A), as well as already detached from the plasma membrane and internalized (panel C). The internalized caveolae (plasmalemmal vesicles) support the idea that caveolae are indeed responsible for albumin endocytosis. However, micrographs of the Cav-1-deficient mouse endothelium show no caveolae and, as a result, the gold-labeled BSA remains in the lumen (panel B) of the blood vessel even at a time when endocytosis in the wild-type endothelium is well underway. These results directly support the idea that caveolae participate in the endocytosis of ligands, such as albumin. In an attempt to more accurately quantify the endocytosis defect observed in the Cav-1-deficient mice, we used aortic ring segments generated from both wild-type and Cav-1-null mice, a system previously used for physiological studies (49Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 276: H1911-H1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to these studies, we needed to ensure there were no major anatomical defects in the Cav-1-null aorta that might affect our uptake studies. Cross-sections of wild-type and Cav-1-null aorta were generated and hematoxylin- and eosin-stained. These sections were examined and no major morphological differences could be detected. A low magnification view of the Cav-1-null aorta (Fig. 3C) shows that the overall size and shape is similar to the wild-type aorta (Fig. 3A). A higher magnification view of the Cav-1-null aorta (Fig. 3D) shows that all three layers of the aorta (tunica intima, media, and adventitia) appear intact and unchanged in their composition, compared with wild-type aorta (Fig.3B). Aortic ring segments were then generated from Cav-1-null mice and wild-type littermates to quantify their ability to endocytose albumin. For this study, aortic rings were incubated with 125I-BSA at 37 °C for 15, 30, and 45 min, and then the amount of radioiodinated BSA incorporated into the tissue was measured. Control samples were incubated: (i) at 4 °C to prevent endocytic uptake, or (ii) at 37 °C with excess unlabeled cold BSA to demonstrate that the observed internalization was specific. All samples were washed extensively in 0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl buffer, pH 2.5, to remove any cell surface bound 125I-BSA. As a consequence, only internalized albumin that remained in a protected endocytic compartment was detected. Fig. 4 shows that little or no uptake of radioiodinated BSA was observed in the aortic segments from Cav-1-deficient mice, while aortic segments from wild-type mice showed robust uptake that was time- and temperature-dependent and competed by unlabeled cold albumin. Taken together, our current results clearly demonstrate that endothelial cells from Cav-1 null mice are incapable of endocytosing albumin to any appreciable level, compared with wild-type animals. However, the fact that Cav-1-null mice remain viable suggests that other pathways must at least partially compensate for the absence of caveolae in vivo. As mentioned above, the uptake and transport of macromolecules by endothelial cell caveolae (plasmalemmal vesicles) has remained controversial for more than four decades. To resolve this issue, we have now employed a new experimental model system (Cav-1-deficient mice) that allows the study of the in vivofunction of caveolae. The power of this genetic model system is that the ablation of a single gene (CAV-1) results in the loss of morphological caveolae, i.e. an organelle knock-out. Using this model system, we show here that Cav-1-null lung endothelial cells lack caveolae and fail to endocytose gold-labeled BSA in vivo. Similarly, aortic ring segments from Cav-1-null mice are quantitatively defective in the internalization of radioiodinated BSA. This is also the first clear demonstration that caveolae represent an internalized membrane compartment that is sealed off from the external environment, because the internalized pool of radioiodinated BSA in wild-type cells was resistant to stringent washes (at acid pH and with high concentrations of NaCl) that remove surface-bound material. Undoubtedly, Cav-1-deficient mice will help resolve many of the other controversies that still exist in the caveolae field."

The metabolic thiol antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid has been suggested to be of therapeutic value in pathologies associated with redox imbalances. We investigated the role of (R)-alpha-lipoic acid (LA) vs. glutathione and ascorbic acid in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) -induced adhesion molecule expression and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Preincubation of HAEC for 48 h with LA (0.05-1 mmol/l) dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha (10 U/ml) -induced adhesion of human monocytic THP-1 cells, as well as mRNA and protein expression of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. LA also strongly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 but did not affect expression of TNF-alpha receptor 1. Furthermore, LA dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activation, subsequent degradation of IkappaB, the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitor, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and adhesion molecule expression were not affected by ascorbic acid or by manipulating cellular glutathione status with l-2-oxo-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, or d,l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine. Our data show that clinically relevant concentrations of LA, but neither vitamin C nor glutathione, inhibit adhesion molecule expression in HAEC and monocyte adhesion by inhibiting the IkappaB/NF-kappaB signaling pathway at the level, or upstream, of IkappaB kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2161157580,"The onset of diabetic neuropathy, a complication of diabetes mellitus, has been linked to poor glycemic control. We tested the hypothesis that the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) form transducers for the damaging effects of high glucose. In cultures of adult rat sensory neurons, high glucose activated JNK and p38 MAPK but did not result in cell damage. However, oxidative stress activated ERK and p38 MAPKs and resulted in cellular damage. In the dorsal root ganglia of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (a model of type I diabetes), ERK and p38 were activated at 8 wk duration, followed by activation of JNK at 12 wk duration. We report activation of JNK and increases in total levels of p38 and JNK in sural nerve of type I and II diabetic patients. These data implicate MAPKs in the etiology of diabetic neuropathy both via direct effects of glucose and via glucose-induced oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W1974256482,"Wound closure of epithelial tissues must occur efficiently to restore rapidly their barrier function. We have developed a tissue-engineered wound-healing model composed of human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts to better understand the mechanisms of reepithelialization. It allowed us to quantify the reepithelialization rate, which was significantly accelerated in the presence of fibrin or platelet-rich plasma. The reepithelialization of these 6 mm excisional wounds required the contribution of keratinocyte proliferation, migration, stratification, and differentiation. The epidermis regenerated progressively from the surrounding wound margins. After 3 days, the neoepidermis showed a complete spectrum of changes. Near the wound margin, the differentiation of the neoepidermis (keratins 1/10, filaggrin, and loricrin) and regeneration of the dermoepidermal junction (laminin 5 and collagen IV) were more advanced than toward the wound center, where the proliferative index was significantly increased. The spatial distribution of keratinocytes distinguished by particular features suggests two complementary mechanisms of reepithelialization: 1) the passive displacement of the superficial layers near the wound margin that would rapidly regenerate a barrier function and 2) the crawling of keratinocytes over each other at the tip of the progressing neoepidermis. Therefore, this study brings a new perspective to long-standing questions concerning wound reepithelialization."
https://openalex.org/W1978602320,"In a neutrophil-dependent model of acute postischemic renal failure (APRF), eliminating or blocking P-selectin reduces postischemic neutrophil infiltration and preserves kidney function. This study was designed to identify the role of platelet vs. endothelial P-selectin in APRF. Using wild-type (wt) and P-selectin-deficient (P-/-) mice, we generated chimeric mice by bone marrow transplantation. Chimeric mice exclusively expressed either platelet (Plt-P) or endothelial P-selectin (EC-P). APRF was induced by bilateral renal ischemia in situ (32 min), followed by reperfusion; 48 h after reperfusion, EC-P had significantly lower creatinine concentrations (twofold over sham) than Plt-P (eightfold over sham). Compared with wt, protection from renal failure in EC-P was similar to that observed in P-/-. Plt-P and EC-P demonstrated similar overall postischemic neutrophil infiltration as measured by renal myeloperoxidase activity. However, Plt-P showed massive neutrophil infiltration into outer and inner medulla, similar to that in wt. EC-P had only patchy, more diffuse neutrophil influx. Our study identifies platelet P-selectin as crucial for postischemic neutrophil recruitment into outer and inner medulla, which is detrimental to the development of APRF. This suggests that novel therapeutic strategies for postischemic organ failure could be aimed at neutrophil-platelet interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2142233913,"Several molecules were shown to bind advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vitro, but it is not known whether they all serve as AGE receptors and which functional role they play in vivo. We investigated the role of galectin-3, a multifunctional lectin with (anti)adhesive and growth-regulating properties, as an AGE receptor and its contribution to the development of diabetic glomerular disease, using a knockout mouse model. Galectin-3 knockout mice obtained by gene ablation and the corresponding wild-type mice were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and killed 4 months later, together with age-matched nondiabetic controls. Despite a comparable degree of metabolic derangement, galectin-3-deficient mice developed accelerated glomerulopathy vs. the wild-type animals, as evidenced by the more pronounced increase in proteinuria, extracellular matrix gene expression, and mesangial expansion. This was associated with a more marked renal/glomerular AGE accumulation, indicating it was attributable to the lack of galectin-3 AGE receptor function. The galectin-3-deficient genotype was associated with reduced expression of receptors implicated in AGE removal (macrophage scavenger receptor A and AGE-R1) and increased expression of those mediating cell activation (RAGE and AGE-R2). These results show that the galectin-3-regulated AGE receptor pathway is operating in vivo and protects toward AGE-induced tissue injury in contrast to that through RAGE."
https://openalex.org/W1969876145,"The physiological function of the human uncoupling protein 3 UCP3, which was discovered in 1997, is unknown. Here we evaluate the available data on human UCP3 expression and show that UCP3 is up-regulated in situations where fatty acid delivery to the mitochondria exceeds oxidative capacity, whereas down-regulation of UCP3 is observed when oxidative capacity is enhanced. With a surplus of fatty acid delivery, accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids in the cytoplasm is likely to occur. Although the inner mitochondrial membrane provides a barrier for nonesterified fatty acids, neutral nonesterified fatty acids can partition into the phospholipid bilayer and flip-flop to the other side of the membrane, where they can be released into the mitochondrial matrix. Due to pH differences, these nonesterified fatty acids will be protonated. Because fatty acid anions can neither be metabolized inside the matrix or cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids inside the matrix might occur. Therefore, we postulate that UCP3 is required for the outward translocation of fatty acids from the mitochondrial matrix. In this way, UCP3 is involved in the protection of mitochondria against accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids inside the mitochondrial matrix."

https://openalex.org/W2117036786,"Tyrosine nitration is considered a key reaction of peroxynitrite-triggered tissue injury in inflammatory diseases. We investigated the potential involvement of peroxynitrite in protein tyrosine nitration in isolated murine peritoneal macrophages activated either in vitro with interferon-gamma/lipopolysaccharide or in vivo by priming mice with Corynebacterium parvum (10 mgxkg-1). Both protocols led to release of NO and accumulation of nitrite accompanied by formation of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine. Oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123, a measure of peroxynitrite release, remained close to basal levels upon in vitro activation of the macrophages but was increased approximately twofold in vivo. Tyrosine nitration in macrophages activated in vitro was inhibited by catalase and the time course of nitration correlated with nitrite accumulation, whereas superoxide (O2*-) and H2O2 release occurred at much earlier times. To address the contribution of O2*- and peroxynitrite to in vivo nitration, a O2*- scavenger (MnTBAP; 1 mgxkg-1) was given to C. parvum-primed mice. MnTBAP led to almost complete inhibition of C. parvum-triggered O2*- and peroxynitrite release, whereas nitrite accumulation and formation of 3-nitrotyrosine were less affected ( approximately 50% of controls). These results argue against an essential role of peroxynitrite in protein tyrosine nitration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024597168,"The 42 amino acid form of beta amyloid (Abeta42) plays a pivotal role in neurotoxicity and the activation of mononuclear phagocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent study revealed that FPRL1, a G-protein-coupled receptor, mediates the chemotactic and activating effect of Abeta42 on mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and microglia), suggesting that FPRL1 may be involved in the proinflammatory responses in AD. We investigated the role of FPRL1 in cellular uptake and the subsequent fibrillar formation of Abeta42 by using fluorescence confocal microscopy. We found that upon incubation with macrophages or HEK293 cells genetically engineered to express FPRL1, Abeta42 associated with FPRL1 and the Abeta42/FPRL1 complexes were rapidly internalized into the cytoplasmic compartment. The maximal internalization of Abeta42/FPRL1 complexes occurred by 30 min after incubation. Removal of free Abeta42 from culture supernatants at 30 min resulted in a progressive recycling of FPRL1 to the cell surface and degradation of the internalized Abeta42. However, persistent exposure of the cells to Abeta42 over 24 h resulted in retention of Abeta42/FPRL1 complexes in the cytoplasmic compartment and the formation of Congo red positive fibrils in macrophages but not in HEK 293 cell transfected with FPRL1. These results suggest that besides mediating the proinflammatory activity of Abeta42, FPRL1 is also involved in the internalization of Abeta42, which culminates in the formation of fibrils only in macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2019193813,"Over the last quarter of the 20th century, there has been a boom in biomedical research discoveries that, for the most part, has not been successfully exploited for improving medical therapy or diagnosis. This lack of success is surprising because there is a broad consensus within academic medical centers (AMCs) that a primary mission is to move scientific discoveries into meaningful clinical outcomes, and there are numerous opportunities for doing so. We illustrate the latter point with 10 clinical opportunities for translating scientific discoveries from our field of vascular biology and transplantation. We attribute the limited success of translation to various factors, chief of which is that translation is rarely straightforward and requires continuing research in both the clinic and the laboratory. Translational research is hindered by insufficient targeted resources, a shortage of qualified investigators, an academic culture that hinders collaboration between clinical and laboratory-based investigators, a traditional structure of the AMC that favors departmental efforts over interdisciplinary programs, an increasing regulatory burden, and a lack of specific mechanisms within the AMC for facilitating solutions to these problems. We offer several suggestions to reduce these impediments."
https://openalex.org/W2023370394,"Bronchial vascular remodeling is an important feature of the pathology of chronic asthma, but the responsible mechanisms and main sources of angiogenic factors are unclear. Here we report that human airway smooth muscle cells express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)121, 165, 189, 206 splice variants and secrete VEGF protein constitutively. VEGF protein secretion was increased by the proinflammatory asthma mediator bradykinin through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Bradykinin-induced VEGF secretion was dependent on the B2 bradykinin receptor, activation of protein kinase C, and generation of endogenous prostanoids. This is the first report that bradykinin can increase VEGF secretion in any biological system and the first to show that airway smooth muscle cells produce VEGF. Our results suggest a novel role for human airway smooth muscle in contributing to bronchial mucosal angiogenesis in chronic asthma by secretion of VEGF and suggest a wider role for mesenchymal cell products in mediating angiogenesis in inflammatory and allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2074069675,"Nonenzymatic glycosylation (glycation) is recognized as an important post-translational modification underlying alterations of structure and function of extracellular proteins. The effect of glycation on intracellular proteins is, on the other hand, less well known despite the vital importance of intracellular proteins for cell, tissue, and organ function. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of glycation on the structure and function of skeletal muscle myosin. Myosin was incubated for up to 30 min with glucose and subsequently tested for structural and functional modifications by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and a single-fiber in vitro motility assay, respectively. MALDI spectra revealed glycation-related structural alterations as evidenced by the disappearance of specific Lys-C proteolysis products and the appearance of higher mass peaks that are attributed to cross-linking by glucose. This change was paralleled by a significant reduction in the in vitro motility speed, suggesting a structure-related decline in myosin mechanics in response to glucose exposure. Further evidence that early glycation products form in the regulatory regions of the myosin molecule is derived from the fact that there is complete reversal of motility speed after reaction with the Schiff base-cleaving agent hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Thus, glycation of skeletal muscle myosin has a significant effect on both the structural and functional properties of the protein, a finding that is important in understanding the mechanisms underlying the impairment in muscle function associated with aging and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2042102227,"Evidence indicates that lipoxygenases (LO) may play a role in cancer cell survival. We show that human malignant pleural mesothelial (MM) cells, but not normal mesothelial (NM) cells, express a catalytically active 5-LO. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MM cell 5-LO determined nucleosome formation and induced a DNA fragmentation pattern typical of apoptosis. This was completely reversed by exogenously added 5(S)-HETE but not by 12(S)-, 15(S)-HETE, or leukotriene (LT)B4. A 5-LO antisense oligonucleotide potently and time-dependently reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and constitutive VEGF accumulation in the conditioned media of MM cells. When NM cells were transfected with a 5-LO cDNA, basal and arachidonic acid-induced VEGF formation increased consistently by 6- and 12-fold, respectively. This was associated with a significant increase in DNA synthesis that was counteracted by a specific anti-VEGF antibody. Arachidonic acid and 5(S)-HETE also potently stimulated the activity of a VEGF promoter construct. Thus, 5-LO is a key regulator of MM cell proliferation and survival via a VEGF-related circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2025173334,"Fas-mediated mechanisms of apoptosis are thought to be involved in the bile duct loss that characterizes diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). We have previously shown that activation of CD40 on hepatocytes can amplify Fas-mediated apoptosis; in the present study, we investigated interactions between CD40 and Fas in biliary epithelial cells (BEC). We report that the bile ducts in PBC liver tissue frequently express increased levels of Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), and CD40 associated with apoptotic BEC. The portal mononuclear infiltrate contains CD40L+ve T cells and macrophages, thereby demonstrating a potential mechanism for CD40 engagement in vivo. Primary cultures of human BEC also expressed Fas, FasL, and CD40 but not CD40L protein or mRNA. Activation of CD40 on BEC using recombinant CD40L increased transcriptional expression of FasL and induced apoptosis, which was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to either Fas or FasL. Thus, CD40-induced apoptosis of BEC is mediated through Fas/FasL. We then investigated the intracellular signals and transcription factors activated in BEC and found that NF-kappaB and AP-1 were both activated after CD40 ligation. Increased functional NF-kappaB was seen early after CD40 ligation, but returned to baseline levels after 4 h. In contrast, the rapid up-regulation of AP-1 was sustained over 24 h. This study provides further functional evidence of the ability of CD40 to induce Fas/FasL-dependent apoptosis of liver epithelial cells supporting the importance of cross-talk between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members as an amplification step in apoptosis induction. Sustained activation of AP-1 in the absence of NF-kappaB signaling may be a critical factor in determining the outcome of CD40 engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2059909690,"Cathepsin-D, a lysosomal aspartyl proteinase, is highly secreted by breast cancer cells and its over-expression by transfection stimulates cancer cell proliferation. The mechanism by which this protease affects proliferation remains, however, unknown. In order to determine whether proteolytic activity is necessary, we abolished its enzymatic activity using site-directed mutagenesis followed by stable transfection in 3Y1-Ad12 cancer cells. Substitution of the aspartic acid residue 231 by an asparagine residue in its catalytic site abrogated the cathepsin-D proteolytic activity but did not affect its expression level, processing or secretion. However, like wild-type cathepsin-D, this mutated catalytically-inactive cathepsin-D retained its capacity to stimulate proliferation of cells embedded in Matrigel or collagen I matrices, colony formation in soft agar and tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Addition on the mock-transfected cells, of either conditioned media containing the wild-type or the mutated pro-cathepsin-D, or of the purified mutated pro-cathepsin-D, partially mimicked the mitogenic activity of the transfected cathepsin-D, indicating a role of the secreted pro-enzyme. Moreover, addition of two anti-cathepsin-D antibodies on the cathepsin-D transfected cells inhibited their proliferation, suggesting an action of the secreted pro-cathepsin-D via an autocrine loop. A synthetic peptide containing the 27-44 residue moiety of the cathepsin-D pro-fragment was, however, not mitogenic suggesting that a receptor for the pro-fragment was not involved. Furthermore, the cathepsin-D mitogenicity was not blocked by inhibiting the interaction of pro-cathepsin-D with the mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Our results altogether demonstrate that a mutated cathepsin-D devoid of catalytic activity is still mitogenic and suggest that it is acting extra-cellularly by triggering directly or indirectly a yet unidentified cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2320829700,"The metabolism of tumor cells (tumor metabolome) is characterized by a high concentration of glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK), a high glutaminolytic capacity, high fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) levels and a low (ATP+GTP):(CTP+UTP) ratio. The sequence of events required for the establishment of the tumor metabolome is presently unknown. In non-transformed rat kidney (NRK) cells we observed a high glutaminolytic flux rate and a low (ATP+GTP):(CTP+UTP) ratio, whereas FBP levels and M2-PK activity are still extremely low. After stable expression of oncogenic ras in NRK cells a strong upregulation of FBP levels and of M2-PK activity was observed. Elevated FBP levels induce a tetramerization of M2-PK and its migration into the glycolytic enzyme complex. AMP levels increase whereas UTP and CTP levels strongly decrease. Thus, ras expression completes the glycolytic part of tumor metabolism leading to the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis and cell proliferation. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, which cooperates with ras in cell transformation, directly binds to M2-PK, induces its dimerization and restores nucleic acid synthesis as well as cell proliferation. Apparently, the combination of the different metabolic effects of ras and E7 constructs the perfect tumor metabolome as generally found in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980691663,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and its G-protein-coupled receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2 Rs) are prominent in the immune system. In T cells, VPAC1 R is expressed constitutively whereas VPAC2 R is induced only after stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) or exposure to some cytokines. VPAC1 R and VPAC2 R also transduce different effects of VIP on T cells. Constitutive expression of VPAC2 R selectively in CD4+ T cells (helper-inducer Th cells) of transgenic (TG) C57BL/6 mice directed by the lck tyrosine kinase promoter is now shown to evoke production of more Th2-type interleukins 4 and 5, and less Th1-type interferon gamma after TCR activation. VPAC2 R TG mice consequently have significant elevations of blood IgE, IgG1, and eosinophils. VPAC2 R TG mice also show increased IgE antibody responses, which mediate heightened cutaneous allergic reactions, and have depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity. VIP enhancement of the ratio of Th2 cell to Th1 cell cytokines thus evokes an allergic state in normally nonallergic mice, which suggests the possibility of neuropeptide contributions to immune phenotypic alterations in human hypersensitivity diseases."

In our search for this gene, we identified a candidate, 5qNCA (LOC51780), which lies within a consistently-deleted segment of 5q31. 5qNCA expresses a 7.2-kb transcript with a 5286-bp open reading frame which is present at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and liver as well as CD34+ cells and AML cell lines. 5qNCA encodes a 191-kD nuclear protein which contains a highly-conserved C-terminus containing a zinc finger with the unique spacing Cys-X2-Cys-X7-His-X2-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys and a jmjC domain, which is often found in proteins that regulate chromatin remodeling. Expression of 5qNCA in a del(5q) cell line results in suppression of clonogenic growth. Preliminary sequence results in AML and MDS samples and cell lines has revealed a possible mutation in the KG-1 cell line resulting in a THR to ALA substitution that has not been found in over 100 normal alleles to date. We propose 5qNCA is a good candidate for the del(5q) tumor suppressor gene based on its predicted function and growth suppressive activities, and suggest that further mutational and functional study of this interesting gene is warranted."

Preliminary findings in our laboratory suggested that the expression of TFPI-2 is downregulated or lost during tumor progression in human gliomas. To investigate the role of TFPI-2 in the invasiveness of brain tumors, we stably transfected the human high-grade glioma cell line SNB19 and the human low-grade glioma cell line Hs683 with a vector capable of expressing a transcript complementary to the full-length TFPI-2 mRNA in either sense (0.7 kb) or antisense (1 kb) orientations. Parental cells and stably transfected cell lines were analysed for TFPI-2 protein by Western blotting and for TFPI-2 mRNA by Northern blotting. The levels of TFPI-2 protein and mRNA were higher in the sense clones (SNB19) and decreased in the antisense (Hs683) clones than in the corresponding parental and vector controls. In spheroid and matrigel invasion assays, the SNB19 parental cells were highly invasive, but the sense-transfected SNB-19 clones were much less invasive; the antisense-transfected Hs683 clones were more invasive than their parental and vector controls. After intracerebral injection in mice, the sense-transfected SNB19 clones were less able to form tumors than were their parental and vector controls, and the antisense-Hs683 clones but not the parental or vector controls formed small tumors. This is the first study to demonstrate that down- or upregulation of TFPI-2 plays a significant role in the invasive behavior of human gliomas."

Although HIV-1 infection primed phytohemagglutinin-activated CD4+ T cells for death induced by anti-CD95 antibody, T cell death was not prevented by a CD95-Fc decoy receptor, nor by decoy receptors of other members of the TNFR family (TNFR1/R2, TRAILR1/R2/OPG, TRAMP) or by various blocking antibodies, suggesting that triggering of death receptors by their cognate ligands is not involved in HIV-induced CD4 T cell death. HIV-1 induced CD4 T cell shrinkage, cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. A typical apoptotic phenotype (nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation) only occurred in around half of the dying cells. Treatment with benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, prevented nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation in HIV-infected CD4+ T cells and in a cell-free system (in which nuclei were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts from the HIV-infected CD4+ T cells). Nevertheless, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone did not prevent mitochondrial membrane potential loss and cell death, suggesting that caspases are dispensable for HIV-mediated cell death. Our findings suggest a major role of the mitochondria in the process of CD4 T cell death induced by HIV, in which targeting of Bax to the mitochondria may be involved.

The finding that the level of the viral load established soon after infection correlates with the rate of CD4 T cell loss and the development of AIDS (1Mellors J.W. Rinaldo Jr., C.R. Gupta P. White R.M. Todd J.A. Kingsley L.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1167-1170Google Scholar) supports the idea that active HIV-1 replication directly contributes to the depletion of CD4+ T cells. Accordingly,in vitro studies have shown that HIV-1 replication induces apoptosis in proliferating primary CD4+ T cells stimulated with PHA/IL-2 and in CD4+ T cell lines (2Laurent-Crawford A.G.

Other findings, however, support the idea that death of uninfected T cells also contributes to AIDS pathogenicity. Both spontaneous and activation-induced apoptosis occur in vitro (7Estaquier J.

Despite intensive investigations, several important questions remain about the mechanisms through which HIV infection induces CD4 T cell death. The first, as stated above, is whether HIV induces death in infected and/or uninfected CD4+ T cells. The second concerns the nature of the signal(s) that initiate cell death. T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals show enhanced cell surface expression of CD95 and exhibit increased susceptibility in vitro to CD95-mediated cell death, induced either by an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody, by soluble CD95 ligand (CD95L) (14Gougeon M.L.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 143-152Google Scholar). HIV-mediated death of productively infected CD4+ T cells in vitro has, however, been found to be independent of CD95/CD95L interactions (4Glynn J.M. McElligott D.L. Mosier D.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2754-2758Google Scholar, 5Gandhi R.T. Chen B.K. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. J. Exp.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8061-8072Google Scholar), and the possible involvement of other members of the TNF receptor family has not been explored. Several findings suggest that viral proteins encoded by HIV-1 (gp120 envelope glycoprotein, Vpr) may induce death of either infected or uninfected CD4+ T cells in productively infected CD4 T cell cultures (22Laurent-Crawford A.G.

Med. 2000; 192: 1081-1092Google Scholar). Finally, another area of uncertainty concerns the identification of the effector pathways that lead to cell death following HIV infection. It has been reported that treatment of HIV-infected cells with caspase inhibitors prevents CD4 T cell death and results in increased viral production (4Glynn J.M. McElligott D.L. Mosier D.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2754-2758Google Scholar, 29Chinnaiyan A.M. Woffendin C. Dixit V.M. Nabel G.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 333-337Google Scholar), whereas other studies have found that caspase inhibitors did not prevent the death of infected CD4+ T cells (5Gandhi R.T. Chen B.K. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1113-1122Google Scholar). Two pathways are known to be important for transducing death signals to the apoptotic machinery. The “extrinsic” pathway involves activation of death receptors and recruit procaspase-8 through FADD (30Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 31Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar). Downstream of caspase-8, two pathways have been reported; caspase-8 may either directly activate caspase-3 or cleave Bid (a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family), inducing the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria. Cytochrome c, together with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9, leading to the activation of the caspase-3 (32Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar, 33Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 34Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). The “intrinsic” pathway is death receptor-independent; stress signals activate proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bak, etc.) and induce the permeabilization of the mitochondria and the release of apoptogenic factors (35Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar). Although caspases are essential effectors of the nuclear apoptotic phenotype (chromatin condensation and fragmentation), evidence from experimental systems using broad spectrum caspase inhibitors support the notion that programmed cell death can proceed in a caspase-independent manner (36McCarthy N.J. Whyte M.K. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Google Scholar, 37De Quignon F. Bels F. Koken M. Feunteun J. Ameisen J.C. de The H. Nat.

Moreover, recent reports have suggested that caspase inhibitors, which inhibit apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli, lead to the appearance of dead cells expressing necrotic-like phenotype (40Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Google Scholar, 41Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar). Cellular mechanisms that account for caspase-independent programmed cell death are still elusive and may involve release by mitochondria of effectors such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (43Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Google Scholar). To further characterize the mechanisms responsible for cell death induced by HIV-1, freshly isolated CD4+ T cells were infected with HIV-1 and stimulated with PHA/IL-2. We observed that only around half of the dying CD4+ T cells displayed a typical apoptotic phenotype (cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation), the other half showing a nonapoptotic cell death phenotype (membrane permeabilization and intact nucleus) that only shared one feature with apoptosis (cell shrinkage). Treatment with zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, prevented the induction of an apoptotic phenotype (nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation) in the HIV-infected CD4+ T cells but did not prevent loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and cell death. Our results support a scenario in which disruption of the mitochondria membrane permeability is a central event in cell death following HIV-1 infection. Murine monoclonal antibodies with the following specificities were used: CD14, CD19, CD56, and CD8 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); agonistic anti-CD95 mAb (CH11 and 7C11) (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL); antagonistic anti-CD95 mAb (ZB4) (Coulter Corp.); antagonistic anti-TNFR1 and -TNFR2 mAbs (R&D Systems); neutralizing anti-TNF antibody (R&D Systems). Soluble decoy proteins were human CD95-Fc immunoglobulin fusion protein (binds CD95L) purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), TRAILR1-Fc, TRAILR2-Fc (binds TRAIL), OPG-Fc (binds RANKL and TRAIL), TNFR1-Fc (binds TNF and lymphotoxin α), and TRAMP/DR3-Fc (orphan receptor) produced as described (44Holler N.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 325-345Google Scholar). Labeled antibodies were as follows: PercP-labeled CD4 mAb (Leu 3a; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA); PC5-labeled CD4 mAb (13B8.2; Coulter Corp.); phosphatidylethanolamine-labeled anti-p24 antigen (KC-57; Coulter Corp.); FITC-labeled anti-Bcl-2 (124; DAKO, Trappes, France). For Western blotting we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), a rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-9 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), a mouse IgG2b anti-caspase-8 (5F7; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), a mouse IgG1 anti-PARP (C2-10; Pharmingen), a mouse IgG1 anti-survivin (MAB747; R&D Systems), a mouse IgG1 anti-c-IAP1 (B75-1; Pharmingen), and a mouse anti-actin (AC40; Sigma). Cytochrome c was probed with a mouse IgG2b anti-cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; Pharmingen), and AIF was probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-AIF obtained from rabbit immunized against a mixture of three different human AIF peptides (amino acids 106–120, 512–526, and 588–602). Bax and VDAC were probed with a mouse IgG1 anti-Bax (6A7; Pharmingen) and a mouse anti-VDAC (Calbiochem). Recombinant human IL-2 was kindly provided by Chiron Corp. (Emeryville, CA). Other reagents were annexin-V-FITC (Coulter Corp.), propidium iodide and DiOC6 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk was purchased from Calbiochem, while DDI, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma. Heparinized venous peripheral blood was obtained from HIV-seronegative healthy donors. PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Greeley, CO), 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). When indicated, purified CD4+ T cells were obtained by depleting PBMC of B cells, NK cells, and CD8+ T cells by negative selection, using CD19, CD56, and CD8 mAbs and magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG (Dynal, Lake Success, NY). PBMC were incubated in the absence or presence of virus at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 2 h at 37 °C. After two washes, the cells were resuspended in complete medium in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml PHA-P (Sigma) and 100 IU/ml IL-2. When indicated, CD4+ T cells were incubated with either agonistic CD95 mAb or Fc decoy receptors. HIV p24 antigen was measured by an enzyme immunoassay as described by the manufacturer (Abbott). Intracellular p24 antigen was also assessed by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization of CD4+ T cells with Intraprep permeabilization reagent (Coulter Corp.). Efficiency of decoy receptors was tested as described. Jurkat cells were incubated with FLAG-TRAIL (400 ng/ml) and cross-linked with anti-FLAG M2 (2 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of decoy receptors (TRAILR1-Fc, TRAILR2-Fc, OPG-Fc) (40 μg/ml) for 16 h, and apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry using annexin-V-FITC. WEHI 164 cells were incubated with TNFα in the absence or presence of TNFR1-Fc (40 μg/ml) for 16 h. Living cells were stained with the PMS/MTS test (phenazine methosulfate/3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) as previously described (44Holler N. Kataoka T. Bodmer J.L. Romero P. Romero J. Deperthes D. Engel J. Tschopp J. Schneider P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 237: 159-173Google Scholar). High titer stocks of the laboratory strain HIV-1LAI (106 TCID50/ml) were prepared by inoculating CEM at an MOI of 0.001 and growing the cells for 10 days. 10 ml of this culture were added to 400 ml of uninfected CEM (5 × 105 cells/ml) and grown for 5–7 days until abundant syncytia were present. The cells were pelleted (300 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in one-one hundredth of the initial volume for 8 h. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min). Nuclear condensation and fragmentation (typical morphological changes of apoptosis) was visualized by UV microscopy using Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye. Cells were also double-stained with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 to distinguish apoptotic cells from cells that lost membrane integrity. Intact blue nuclei, condensed fragmented blue-pink nuclei, and intact pink nuclei were considered viable, apoptotic (early and late), and nonapoptotic cells, respectively. Cells were also analyzed by light microscopy using trypan blue dye reagent (Sigma). Live cells showed normal refringent cytoplasm, apoptotic cells displayed typical chromatin condensation and fragmentation and excluded trypan blue, and nonapoptotic cells were trypan blue positive, as previously described (7Estaquier J. Idziorek T. de Bels F. Barre-Sinoussi F. Hurtrel B. Aubertin A.M. Venet A. Mehtali M. Muchmore E. Michel P. Mouton Y. Girard M. Ameisen J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By flow cytometry, we determined dying cells using FITC-conjugated annexin-V, and to evaluate Δψm, cells were stained with DiOC6. Nuclear condensation and fragmentation was also assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide. For total extracts, cells were incubated in SDS lysis buffer, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at room temperature. Total protein was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and run on a 4/20% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Western blots were then visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of cytochrome c and AIF, cells were incubated in cell extract buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmcytochalasin B, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored as cytosolic fraction. The mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane (HM) fraction was prepared as follows. Cells were washed in isotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were separated at 120 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to collect HM pellet. Cytoplasmic extracts were derived from uninfected and HIV-infected primary CD4+ T cells stimulated with PHA/IL-2. Cytoplasmic extracts from Jurkat T cells incubated in the absence or presence of CD95 mAbs (7C11, Coulter Corp.) for 4 h were also used as a control. Cell-free extracts and nuclei from CEM cells were prepared as previously described (47Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5191-5200Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 20 min with cell extract buffer. Cells were lysed with a B-type pestle. Lysis was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 17,000 × g, and the clear cytosol was carefully removed. CEM nuclei were prepared as follows. CEM cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and once in nuclei isolation buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm cytochalasin B, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), resuspended in nuclei isolation buffer, allowed to swell on ice for 20 min, and gently lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Liberated nuclei were then layered over 30% sucrose in nuclei isolation buffer and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min, followed by washing in nuclei isolation buffer and resuspension in nuclei storage buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm spermine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50% glycerol) at 2 × 108 nuclei/ml. Nuclei were stored at −80 °C until use. Cell-free reactions (25 μl) comprised 20 μl of cytoplasmic extract (2–10 mg/ml protein), 1 μl (2 × 105) of nuclei, and 4 μl of extract dilution buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase). Two-color flow cytofluorometric analysis (FACScan; Becton Dickinson) was performed by co-staining cells with mAbs (including isotype controls) directly labeled with phosphatidylethanolamine or PercP. Lymphocytes were gated by forward and side scatter parameters. Statistical significance (p) was assessed using the paired Student's ttest as indicated in the figure legends. Resting PBMC from healthy donors were incubated for 2 h with the laboratory strain HIV-1LAI. After removing unbound residual virus, T cells were stimulated with PHA and IL-2 for 4 days, and cell death and viral production were assessed. Both cell death and viral replication (assessed by p24 expression) increased with the inoculum (Fig.1A). Absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells were decreased in the infected cultures, the extent of depletion being proportional to the viral input (Fig. 1B). Cytofluorimetric analysis of T cell populations indicated that after 4 days of PHA and IL-2 stimulation, ∼10% of CD4+ T cells from six different donors inoculated with HIV-1LAI remained in the culture, compared with 55% in the uninfected cultures (Fig.1C). Cell death preceded any significant appearance of syncytia in the culture (data not shown). In order to exclude the possibility that HIV-induced CD4 T cell death in the cultures resulted (at least in part) from CD8+ T cell-mediated killing, we purified CD4+ T cells by negative selection prior incubation with HIV-1LAI and PHA/IL-2 stimulation (Fig.1D). In these conditions (as in unfractionated PBMC), HIV-1LAI induced CD4 T cell depletion. This strongly suggested that viral-induced CD4 T cell depletion occurred independently of participation of additional lymphoid cells, such as CD8+ T cells, NK cells, or B cells. Approximately 50% of the HIV-infected cells displayed cell shrinkage (Fig. 2, B and E), phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (Fig. 2, C andE) and loss in Δψm (Fig. 2, D andE). In contrast, nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation typical of apoptosis, as visualized by UV microscopy using Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye (Fig. 2A), was observed in only 20–30% of CD4+ T cells in the HIV-infected cultures (Fig.2E). Thus, half of the dying CD4+ T cells displayed typical apoptosis, and the other half displayed a nonapoptotic cell death phenotype characterized by lack of nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation associated with a loss in membrane integrity (Fig.2E). By double staining using annexin-V, which detects PS exposure, and propidium iodide (PI), which measures membrane integrity, HIV-infected cultures contained both annexin-V-positive/PI-negative CD4+ T cells (apoptotic) and annexin-V-positive/PI-positive CD4+ T cells (nonapoptotic) (20.5 ± 6 and 32.3 ± 8%, respectively; data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that HIV induces both typical apoptosis and an additional phenotype of cell death. The latter was distinct from necrosis (membrane permeability and cell swelling), since CD4+ T cells displayed a membrane permeability associated with a cell shrinkage. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, when CD4+ T cells were incubated with HIV-1LAI and stimulated by PHA/IL-2, CD4+ T cells were primed for cell death in response to antibody-mediated CD95 ligation at day 4. In contrast, uninfected activated CD4+ T cells became sensitive to CD95 ligation-mediated death at day 6, as previously described (48Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G. Medema J.P. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although HIV-infected CD4+ T cells became sensitive to CD95 ligation, this process appeared not to account for their subsequent death in the absence of any CD95 antibody treatment. Indeed, when cultures were treated 3 days after PHA/IL-2 stimulation with a neutralizing mAb (ZB4) or a CD95-Fc decoy receptor (which prevents interaction between CD95L and CD95 (49Buzyn A. Petit F. Ostankovitch M. Figueiredo S. Varet B. Guillet J.G. Ameisen J.C. Estaquier J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3135-3140Google Scholar)), CD4 T cell death observed 3 days later was not prevented (Fig. 3C). Similarly, no preventive effect was observed when CD95-Fc was added at day 1 following PHA stimulation (data not shown). The cellular localization of CD95L was examined (50Bossi G. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 90-96Google Scholar) by isolating cytosolic and membrane fractions of CD4+ T cells after stimulation with PHA/IL-2 and evaluating the presence of CD95L by Western blotting. At both days 4 and 6, CD95L (35-kDa protein) was localized in the cytosolic fraction, not in the membrane fraction, of both uninfected and HIV-infected CD4+ T cells (data not shown). CD95L/CD95 is a death ligand/receptor pair of the TNF/TNF receptor superfamily, which also includes other pairs, such as TRAIL/TRAILR1, TRAIL/TRAILR2, and the orphan death receptor TRAMP(DR3) (51Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Google Scholar). Using either neutralizing antibodies or decoy receptors that have been previously demonstrated to block the interaction between ligands and receptors (44Holler N. Kataoka T. Bodmer J.L. Romero P. Romero J. Deperthes D. Engel J. Tschopp J. Schneider P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 237: 159-173Google Scholar, 45Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 325-345Google Scholar, 52Rennert P.

In vitrotreatment with the decoy receptors or neutralizing antibodies 3 days after PHA/IL-2 stimulation did not prevent CD4 T cell death observed 3 days later (Fig. 3C). The"
https://openalex.org/W2036235019,"TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) induces apoptosis in susceptible cells by binding to death receptors 4 (DR4) and 5 (DR5). TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed cells and the identification of mechanisms by which TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be enhanced may lead to novel cancer chemotherapeutic strategies. Here we show that reovirus infection induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines derived from human breast, lung and cervical cancers. Reovirus-induced apoptosis is mediated by TRAIL and is associated with the release of TRAIL from infected cells. Reovirus infection synergistically and specifically sensitizes cancer cell lines to killing by exogenous TRAIL. This sensitization both enhances the susceptibility of previously resistant cell lines to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and reduces the amount of TRAIL needed to kill already sensitive lines. Sensitization is not associated with a detectable change in the expression of TRAIL receptors in reovirus-infected cells. Sensitization is associated with an increase in the activity of the death receptor-associated initiator caspase, caspase 8, and is inhibited by the peptide IETD-fmk, suggesting that reovirus sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a caspase 8-dependent manner. Reovirus-induced sensitization of cells to TRAIL is also associated with increased cleavage of PARP, a substrate of the effector caspases 3 and 7."
https://openalex.org/W2104634115,"PRUNE, the human homologue of the Drosophila gene, is located in 1q21.3, a region highly amplified in human sarcomas, malignant tumours of mesenchymal origin. Prune protein interacts with the metastasis suppressor nm23-H1, but shows impaired affinity towards the nm23-H1 S120G mutant associated with advanced neuroblastoma. Based on these observations, we previously suggested that prune may act as a negative regulator of nm23-H1 activity. We found amplification of PRUNE in aggressive sarcoma subtypes, such as leiomyosarcomas and malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) as well as in the less malignant liposarcomas. PRUNE amplification was generally accompanied by high mRNA and moderate to high protein levels. The sarcoma samples expressed nm23-H1 mostly at low or moderate levels, whereas mRNA and protein levels were moderate to high in breast carcinomas. For the more aggressive sarcoma subtypes, 9/13 patients with PRUNE amplification developed metastases. A similar situation was observed in all breast carcinomas with amplification of PRUNE. Infection of NIH3T3 cells with a PRUNE recombinant retrovirus increased cell proliferation. Possibly, amplification and overexpression of PRUNE has the same effect in the tumours. We suggest that amplification and overexpression of PRUNE could be a mechanism for inhibition of nm23-H1 activity that affect the development or progression of these tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1984649993,"Proteolytic cleavage of single-chain, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) by kallikrein releases the short-lived vasodilator bradykinin and leaves behind a two-chain, high molecular weight kininogen (HKa) reported to bind to the beta2-integrin Mac-1 (CR3, CD11b/CD18, alphaMbeta2) on neutrophils and exert antiadhesive properties by binding to the urokinase receptor (uPAR) and vitronectin. We define the molecular mechanisms for the antiadhesive effects of HK related to disruption of beta2-integrin-mediated cellular interactions in vitro and in vivo. In a purified system, HK and HKa inhibited the binding of soluble fibrinogen and ICAM-1 to immobilized Mac-1, but not the binding of ICAM-1 to immobilized LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18, alphaLbeta2). This inhibitory effect could be attributed to HK domain 5 and to a lesser degree to HK domain 3, consistent with the requirement of both domains for binding to Mac-1. Accordingly, HK, HKa, and domain 5 inhibited the adhesion of Mac-1 but not LFA-1-transfected K562 human erythroleukemic cells to ICAM-1. Moreover, adhesion of human monocytic cells to fibrinogen and to human endothelial cells was blocked by HK, HKa, and domain 5. By using peptides derived from HK domain 5, the sequences including amino acids H475-G497 (and to a lesser extent, G440-H455) were identified as responsible for the antiadhesive effect, which was independent of uPAR. Finally, administration of domain 5 into mice, followed by induction of thioglycollate-provoked peritonitis, decreased the recruitment of neutrophils by approximately 70% in this model of acute inflammation. Taken together, HKa (and particularly domain 5) specifically interacts with Mac-1 but not with LFA-1, thereby blocking Mac-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion to fibrinogen and endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo and serving as a novel endogenous regulator of leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2031984107,"Despite many efforts to alter the relentlessly aggressive progression of tumors of neural origin, individuals bearing these tumors exhibit poor prognosis for long-term survival. In an attempt to find an effective treatment, we examined the efficacy of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen, to suppress the growth of tumor cell lines derived from medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme. Results from cell proliferation assays have revealed that flurbiprofen effectively inhibits the growth of various tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner and causes a noticeable change in the progression of cells through cell cycle stages. Treatment of tumor cells with flurbiprofen reduced the number of cells in G1 and G2, and significantly increased their numbers in S phase, suggesting that, flurbiprofen accelerates G1/S entry, and/or delays cell exit from S to G2/M stages. Results from RNase protection assay and Western blot analysis showed that while treatment of cells with flurbiprofen causes a minor change in the RNA level of different cyclins, there is a significant decrease in the level of cyclin B protein upon flurbiprofen treatment. Examination of tumor suppressors by RNase protection technique showed a subtle increase in the levels of several tumor suppressors upon flurbiprofen treatment. Interestingly, at the protein level, p53 tumor suppressor was substantially increased upon flurbiprofen treatment, yet the level of p21, a downstream target for p53 remained unchanged. Curiously, treatment of the cells with flurbiprofen enhanced the level of COX-2 expression. Results from co-immunoprecipitation showed association of COX-2 with p53 in tumor cells. These observations suggest that the interaction of COX-2 with p53 may cause p21-independent suppression of tumor cell growth upon flurbiprofen treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2094754259,"Salicylic acid (SA), an endogenous signaling molecule of plants, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions in human. Its derivative, aspirin, is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug. Aspirin and sodium salicylate (salicylates) have been reported to have multiple pharmacological actions. However, it is unclear whether they bind to a cellular protein. Here, we report for the first time the purification from human fibroblasts of a approximately 78 kDa salicylate binding protein with sequence identity to immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The Kd values of SA binding to crude extract and to recombinant BiP were 45.2 and 54.6 microM, respectively. BiP is a chaperone protein containing a polypeptide binding site recognizing specific heptapeptide sequence and an ATP binding site. A heptapeptide with the specific sequence displaced SA binding in a concentration-dependent manner whereas a control heptapeptide did not. Salicylates inhibited ATPase activity stimulated by this specific heptapeptide but did not block ATP binding or induce BiP expression. These results indicate that salicylates bind specifically to the polypeptide binding site of BiP in human cells that may interfere with folding and transport of proteins important in inflammation."

Higher NO concentrations, as synthesized by the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) during inflammatory processes, show additional effects: NO may react with O2, yielding nitrogen oxides like N2O3 that are able to nitrosate thiols. A variety of proteins involved in very different functions of the cell contain cysteine-Zn2+ complexes. Effects of NO on different proteins containing cysteine-Zn2+ domains and playing essential roles during transcription, protein folding, and proteolysis are discussed. It is suggested that iNOS-derived NO acts as a signal molecule targeting cysteine-Zn2+ linkages, thus enabling cells to react toward nitrosative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2103178229,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to activate NF-kappaB whereas the lipid mediator ceramide was recently shown to inhibit activation of this transcription factor (1, 2). In this study, the mechanisms by which ceramide interferes with this pathway were examined in Jurkat leukemia and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ceramide inhibited selectively PKC-mediated activation of NF-kappaB by reverting PKC translocation to the membrane. Next, confocal and immunofluorescence studies were performed to evaluate the direct effects of ceramide on PKC. These studies showed that ceramide inhibited translocation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-PKCbeta2 fusion protein in response to PMA. A mutant PKC in which autophosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine (PKC-DA) was resistant to ceramide. A kinase-inactive mutant (PKC-KR) was also resistant to ceramide action, and the results were supported using kinase inhibitors of the enzyme. Finally, overexpression of PKC-DA prevented, at least partly, the ability of ceramide to inhibit activation of NF-kappaB. Taken together, these studies show that ceramide has acute effects on translocation of PKC by inducing reverse translocation, and this reversal requires both the kinase activity of PKC and phosphorylation of the autophosphorylation sites."

https://openalex.org/W2330555267,"Studies have revealed that human adenovirus-encoded E1A protein promotes cell proliferation through the targeted interaction with cellular proteins that act as key negative regulators of cell growth. The targets of E1A protein include the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb). Because p202, an interferon (IFN)-inducible murine protein (52-kDa), negatively regulates cell growth in part through the pRb/E2F pathway, we tested whether the p202 is a target of the adenovirus-encoded E1A protein for functional inactivation. Here we report that the expression of E1A protein overcame p202-mediated inhibition of cell growth and this correlated with an alleviation of p202-mediated inhibition of the transcriptional activity of E2F. Furthermore, E1A protein relieved p202-mediated inhibition of the specific DNA-binding activity of E2F complexes, including those containing the pocket proteins. Additionally, the E1A protein bound to p202 both in vitro and in vivo and a deletion of four amino acids in the conserved region 2 (CR2) of E1A protein significantly reduced the binding of E1A to p202. Interestingly, ectopic expression of p202 under reduced serum conditions significantly reduced E1A-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our observations provide support to the idea that the p202 and adenovirus E1A protein functionally counteract each other and E1A protein targets p202 to promote cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2314494221,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) type II receptor (T beta R-II) is responsible for transducing the growth inhibitory signals of TGF beta. The T beta R-II gene promoter lacks both a TATA box and a CAAT box near the transcription initiation site, and has been shown to contain binding sequences for several transcription factors (Sp1, AP1, NF-Y, Cut and ERT) which are important for T beta R-II gene promoter activity in vitro. However, it is still not clear which interactions are important for the regulation of T beta R-II gene promoter activity in vivo. Using in vivo genomic DNA footprinting of normal human epithelial cells (HaCaT), we have identified two novel identical and strongly protected sites (ggggctgg) at positions -59 and -102 of the T beta R-II gene promoter. Mutation of either site significantly reduced promoter activity in transient transfections. Protein binding to these sites, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), was specifically competed with consensus Sp1 oligonucleotides. Furthermore, anti-Sp1/3 antibodies produced band shifts when incubated with the T beta R-II -59 and -102 DNA probes. Importantly, Sp1 protein binding was influenced by the presence of an intact NF-Y binding site at position -83. Our data suggests that both Sp1 and NF-Y may play an important role in regulating T beta R-II gene promoter basal activity in vivo."

In this study, we determined whether the induction of IFN-gamma was required for NOS II-mediated antitumor activity in vivo. Highly metastatic H7 murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were implanted into the subcutis, footpad, and pancreas of syngeneic IFN-gamma(+/+) and IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. These cells grew and produced metastases and ascites in IFN-gamma(+/+) mice. In sharp contrast, the same tumor cells grew much more aggressively, metastasized more extensively, and produced a larger amount of malignant ascites in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. Also, induction of IFN-gamma correlated with NOS II gene expression and NO production in IFN-gamma(+/+) injected with the tumor cells but not in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice or IFN-gamma(+/+) mice without tumor challenge. In vitro, only LPS plus IFN-gamma induced a high level of NO production and cytotoxicity against H7 cells. These data suggested that the tumor cells stimulated IFN-gamma secretion from host cells, which in turn stimulated NO production by host cells and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis."

Here, we assessed the relationship between CGA status (as determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR) and the response to tamoxifen therapy in a well-defined cohort of 125 ER alpha-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with primary surgery followed by adjuvant tamoxifen alone. CGA overexpression, observed in 37.6% of patients, was associated with good relapse-free survival (P=0.037; univariate analysis). CGA status, combined with ERBB2 status (a marker of poor outcome), was an independent predictor of the response to tamoxifen (P=0.020; multivariate analysis). CGA status, especially when combined with ERBB2 status, may thus provide useful predictive information on tamoxifen responsiveness in breast cancer."

We colocalized ribozymes with their mRNA targets in an animal model by using the discrete RNA localization signals present in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of Drosophila bicoid and oskar mRNAs. These signals have been fused to a lacZ mRNA target and hammerhead ribozymes targeted against lacZ. Ribozyme efficacy was first assessed by an oligodeoxyribonucleotide-based assay to identify the most accessible sites for ribozyme interaction on native lacZ transcripts in ovary extracts. The most accessible sequence was used for the design and in vivo testing of a hammerhead ribozyme. When the ribozyme and target with synonymous 3' UTRs were expressed in the same ovaries, colocalization could be indirectly demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Colocalized ribozyme and target mRNAs resulted in a two- to threefold enhancement of ribozyme function compared with noncolocalized transcripts. This study provides the first demonstration of functional ribozyme target colocalization in an animal model."
