https://openalex.org/W3000736974,"Stress granules are condensates of non-translating mRNAs and proteins involved in the stress response and neurodegenerative diseases. Stress granules form in part through intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions, and to better understand how RNA-based condensation occurs, we demonstrate that RNA is effectively recruited to the surfaces of RNA or RNP condensates in vitro. We demonstrate that, through ATP-dependent RNA binding, the DEAD-box protein eIF4A reduces RNA condensation in vitro and limits stress granule formation in cells. This defines a function for eIF4A to limit intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions in cells. These results establish an important role for eIF4A, and potentially other DEAD-box proteins, as ATP-dependent RNA chaperones that limit the condensation of RNA, analogous to the function of proteins like HSP70 in combatting protein aggregates."

To characterize this understudied process, we profiled and analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of ∼10,000 testicular cells from four boys spanning puberty and compared them to those of infants and adults. During puberty, undifferentiated spermatogonia sequentially expand and differentiate prior to the initiation of gametogenesis. Notably, we identify a common pre-pubertal progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells and delineate candidate factors controlling pubertal differentiation. Furthermore, pre-pubertal Sertoli cells exhibit two distinct transcriptional states differing in metabolic profiles before converging to an alternative single mature population during puberty. Roles for testosterone in Sertoli cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide secretion, and spermatogonial differentiation are further highlighted through single-cell analysis of testosterone-suppressed transfemale testes. Taken together, our transcriptional atlas of the developing human testis provides multiple insights into developmental changes and key factors accompanying male puberty.

Taken together, our transcriptional atlas of the developing human testis provides multiple insights into developmental changes and key factors accompanying male puberty. Human male puberty involves major changes in testis physiology, a large increase in testicular volume, and complex hormonal and molecular modulation, to accomplish both somatic cell proliferation/maturation and the initiation of spermatogenesis (Koskenniemi et al., 2017Koskenniemi J.J.

Proliferation and functional maturation of Sertoli cells, and their relevance to disorders of testis function in adulthood.Reproduction. 2003; 125: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Puberty is initiated by re-activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis following a period of relative quiescence during childhood (Plant, 2015Plant T.M. Neuroendocrine control of the onset of puberty.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2015; 38: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This hormonal control requires hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulating the release of gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). LH is responsible for stimulating Leydig cells to produce testosterone (T), while FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to support spermatogenesis (Herbison, 2016Herbison A.E.

Neuroendocrine control of the onset of puberty.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2015; 38: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To date, our understanding of puberty derives mostly from physiological approaches in humans and primates complemented by extensive molecular and genetic approaches in rodents, which includes the use of sophisticated lineage-tracing and transgenic technologies. However, fundamental differences exist between human and rodent with respect to hormonal control of puberty and onset of spermatogenesis (Tharmalingam et al., 2018Tharmalingam M.D. Jorgensen A. Mitchell R.T. Experimental models of testicular development and function using human tissue and cells.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2018; 468: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In mice, type B spermatogonia begin to develop at day 8 (d8) resulting in a synchronous “first wave” of spermatogenesis (Bellvé et al., 1977Bellvé A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O’Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. Spermatogenic cells of the prepuberal mouse. Isolation and morphological characterization.J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), during which pro-spermatogonia undergo differentiation and synchronously generate both self-renewing and differentiating spermatogonia (Kluin and de Rooij, 1981Kluin P.M. de Rooij D.G.

The first round of mouse spermatogenesis is a distinctive program that lacks the self-renewing spermatogonia stage.Development. 2006; 133: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This results in the first round of murine sperm production at around d35 (Vergouwen et al., 1993Vergouwen R.P. Huiskamp R. Bas R.J. Roepers-Gajadien H.L. Davids J.A. de Rooij D.G. Postnatal development of testicular cell populations in mice.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Subsequently, self-renewing spermatogonia, residing in the niche, commence differentiation and produce successive and continuous waves of gametogenesis from 2–3 weeks after birth (Kanatsu-Shinohara and Shinohara, 2013Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Shinohara T. Spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and development.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29: 163-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, humans lack the equivalent of this first wave of spermatogenesis and instead are believed to maintain spermatogonia in an undifferentiated (though largely uncharacterized) state prior to the initiation of puberty (Paniagua and Nistal, 1984Paniagua R. Nistal M. Morphological and histometric study of human spermatogonia from birth to the onset of puberty.J. Anat. 1984; 139: 535-552PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, puberty typically begins between 10 and 13 years after birth. However, low levels of incomplete spermatogenesis is observed in portions of the testis in juveniles prior to puberty, though mature sperm are usually not present prior to age 10–11, and meiotic cells typically undergo apoptosis during peri-pubertal phases (Chemes, 2001Chemes H.E. Infancy is not a quiescent period of testicular development.Int. J. Androl. 2001; 24: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (note: we define “juvenile” as the developmental period after the infant stage but prior to full adult sexual maturity [typically ages from 1–14]). Morphologically, the pre-pubertal testis resembles that of the early postnatal mouse, with undifferentiated spermatogonia embedded in small “cords” of Sertoli cells, that lack a defined tubular lamina or lumen. During puberty, formation of the basal lamina and lumen creates structured seminiferous tubules (Paniagua and Nistal, 1984Paniagua R. Nistal M. Morphological and histometric study of human spermatogonia from birth to the onset of puberty.J. Anat. 1984; 139: 535-552PubMed Google Scholar), which involves the coordinated development of myoid cells (contributing to the formation of the basal lamina), Leydig cells (responsible for hormonal signaling), and Sertoli cells with multiple functions within the tubule—and which together define the main niche components. However, our understanding of this crucial developmental period is limited, and much remains to be characterized at the molecular and genome-wide level, including the mechanisms that maintain human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in a slowly self-renewing and undifferentiated state during childhood and the processes responsible for initiation and progression to spermatogenesis at puberty. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches provide unique and powerful tools to examine human testis development, enabling the simultaneous examination of thousands of individual cells, faithfully representing the constituents of entire organs, without the need for prior sorting or enrichment procedures (Birnbaum, 2018Birnbaum K.D.

The lack of spatial information obtained from this approach can be alleviated by using orthogonal validation approaches such as co-localization of specific proteins in fixed tissues (Guo et al., 2018Guo J. Grow E.J. Mlcochova H. Maher G.J. Lindskog C. Nie X. Guo Y. Takei Y. Yun J. Cai L. et al.The adult human testis transcriptional cell atlas.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, we profiled ∼10,000 single-cell transcriptomes from whole-testes of four juvenile males (7, 11, 13, and 14 years old) and compared these data to our previously published infant (1 year old) and adult (25 years old) datasets (Guo et al., 2018Guo J. Grow E.J. Mlcochova H. Maher G.J. Lindskog C. Nie X. Guo Y. Takei Y. Yun J. Cai L. et al.The adult human testis transcriptional cell atlas.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our study uncovers dramatic changes in germline stem cells and heretofore unappreciated, complex modulations of the somatic niche revealing candidate factors and pathways that regulate somatic cell development during puberty. Certain changes in the niche, such as T production, are accompanied by changes in germ cell states—indicating communication between the germline and niche. To explore the role of T on germline and niche development and function, we analyzed the transcriptome of testes from T-suppressed adult transfemales (that retained spermatogonia), which revealed roles for T in promoting and/or supporting testis development during puberty. Taken together, our datasets and comparative analyses provide multiple insights into the development of SSCs and their niche during puberty in humans, while also providing a valuable data resource (https://humantestisatlas.shinyapps.io/humantestisatlas1/) for the research community. We collected whole-testes through a rapid autopsy program from 4 juvenile donors aged 7, 11, 13, and 14 years (Figure 1A), with Johnsen scores (Johnsen, 1970Johnsen S.G. Testicular biopsy score count--a method for registration of spermatogenesis in human testes: normal values and results in 335 hypogonadal males.Hormones. 1970; 1: 2-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) at 3, 4, 4, and 7, respectively. Consistent with prior observations (Paniagua and Nistal, 1984Paniagua R. Nistal M. Morphological and histometric study of human spermatogonia from birth to the onset of puberty.J. Anat. 1984; 139: 535-552PubMed Google Scholar), our histological examination revealed major changes in morphology and composition along this timeline (Figure 1B): in the 7-year-old sample, small testis cords lacking an apparent lamina or lumen were observed, forming structures reminiscent of those seen in fetal/early postnatal mouse testes. A tubular structure became progressively apparent in the 11-year-old sample, while a clear defined lamina and lumen were observed across the tubules of the 13- and 14-year-old samples (Figure 1B). To characterize the molecular features accompanying this developmental progression, we isolated single cells from these testicular tissues and performed scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics platform. For each donor, two separate technical replicates were performed, resulting in eight datasets. From a total of ∼10,000 cells, 7,675 passed standard quality-control (QC) dataset filters and were retained for downstream analysis (see STAR Methods for details). We obtained ∼200K reads/cell, which enabled the analysis of ∼1,500–2,000 genes/cell (Figure S1A). The sequencing saturation rate was ∼85%, and technical replicates were highly similar (r > 0.95) (Figures S1A and S1B). To describe pubertal development and to enable comparison to other time points, we combined the juvenile datasets with our previously published adult and infant datasets, yielding a total of 13,797 single cells (after QC filtering). We first performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analysis on the combined datasets using the Seurat package (Butler et al., 2018Butler A. Hoffman P. Smibert P. Papalexi E. Satija R. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar; Figure 1C), which yielded eight major clusters that were subsequently annotated using known gene markers (Figure 1D; Figures S1D and S1E). Clusters 1–3 are germ cells, with C1 representing spermatogonia (UTF1+, FGFR3+), C2 consisting of spermatocytes (SYCP3+), and C3 identifying post-meiotic spermatids (PRM3+). Clusters 4–8 correspond to a heterogenous mixture of Sertoli cells (C4; SOX9+), Leydig and myoid-like cells (C5; IGF1+ and/or ACTA2+), smooth muscle (C6; NOTCH3+), macrophages (C7: CD14+), and endothelial cells (C8; VWF+), respectively (see Figures S1D and S1E for additional markers). We examined changes in germ cell composition during puberty by analyzing the germ cells, following specific reclustering of initial clusters 1–3 (Figure 2A). Expression patterns of key markers and comparisons to prior work enable assignment of germ cells into four broad developmental stages: slowly self-renewing and undifferentiated spermatogonia (referred to as States 0–1 in [Guo et al., 2017Guo J. Grow E.J. Yi C. Mlcochova H. Maher G.J. Lindskog C. Murphy P.J. Wike C.L. Carrell D.T.

Cai L. et al.The adult human testis transcriptional cell atlas.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar]) marked by UTF1+ and largely MKI67–, differentiating spermatogonia (States 2–4) marked by KIT+ and largely MKI67+ (note: State 4 is preparing to enter meiosis and lacks MKI67), spermatocytes (from STRA8+ to GPR85+), and spermatids (PRM3+) (Figures 2A and 2B). An orthogonal pseudotime analysis using the Monocle package (Qiu et al., 2017Qiu X. Mao Q. Tang Y. Wang L. Chawla R. Pliner H.A. Trapnell C. Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) further supports this pseudotime trajectory (Figures 2C and 2D; Figures S2A and S2B). Germ cells were then parsed out to examine their relative composition at different phases of puberty (Figures 2D and 2E). Interestingly, germ cells from both the 1- and 7-year-old samples consisted of only undifferentiated spermatogonia (corresponding to States 0–1) (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E) that expressed UTF1 and other early germline stem cell markers (Figure 2B; Figures S2A and S2B). In the 11-year-old sample, while a high proportion of cells were still States 0–1 spermatogonia, differentiating spermatogonia and meiotic cells also began to emerge (Figures 2D and 2E). Notably, in the infant and 7-year-old samples, spermatogonia were relatively rare (∼3%–4% of total testicular cells), whereas in the 11-year-old and older samples, the relative proportion of spermatogonia increased considerably to represent ∼10%–15% of total testicular cells (Figure S1C), consistent with a spermatogonial amplification and proliferative phase prior to a differentiation phase. The 13-year-old sample largely resembled the 11-year-old sample (likely reflecting the known age differences in puberty onset) though post-meiotic cells increased in proportion, indicating a more robust commitment to meiosis. Last, germ cell composition in the 14-year-old sample resembled the adult, indicating nearly full spermatogenesis (Figure 2E). Next, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) to confirm our scRNA-seq findings (Figures 2F and 2G; Figures S2C and S2D). First, we observed UTF1+ undifferentiated spermatogonia (State 0–1) at all ages analyzed. In contrast, proliferative and differentiating spermatogonia (States 2–3) display strong increases in multiple proliferative markers (e.g., cyclins, CDKs, TOP2A, MKI67, KIT [Figure S2E]) and MKI67+ spermatogonia become apparent only from 11 years old onward, and significant levels of the meiotic marker SYCP3 were found only at/after 14 years old (Figure S2C). Co-staining for UTF1 and KIT confirmed the gradual and steady increase in KIT+ spermatogonia during juvenile development (Figures 2F and 2G), indicative of progressive commitment to spermatogonial differentiation. Taken together, our transcriptomic and protein data combined with prior immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies (Paniagua and Nistal, 1984Paniagua R. Nistal M. Morphological and histometric study of human spermatogonia from birth to the onset of puberty.J. Anat. 1984; 139: 535-552PubMed Google Scholar) point to three separate phases between infancy and puberty: (1) a phase where undifferentiated spermatogonia are quiescent or slowly self-renew, (2) a transient period of spermatogonial proliferation (mitosis) with limited and incomplete spermatogonial differentiation, occurring early in puberty, which gradually transitions to (3) the establishment of steady and balanced spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation, alongside commitment to full gametogenesis. We next explored Sertoli cell development during puberty. As previewed above, in the pre-pubertal samples (7 years old), staining of UTF1 and SOX9 revealed cord-like structures consisting of intermingled spermatogonia and Sertoli cells (Figure 3A). On initiation of puberty (e.g., 11- and 13-year-old samples), Sertoli cells and spermatogonia align at the basement membrane of the tubules and a lumen begins to form—a pattern that developed further in the 14-year-old sample (Figure 3A). To characterize this morphological re-organization, we parsed out and examined the Sertoli cell populations (cluster 4 in Figure 1C). Here, we note that mature Sertoli cells are typically larger than the preferred size for capture in the 10x Genomics system, likely explaining the low proportion of Sertoli cells at older ages. Hence, although we obtained sufficient cell numbers to define Sertoli cell transcriptional signatures, this caveat prevents quantitation of changes in total Sertoli cell numbers during development. Our clustering analysis defined two large Sertoli clusters flanking two smaller clusters (Figures 3B and 3C). Notably, cell-cycle analysis (see STAR Methods) reveals that the large right cluster (Figures 3B and 3C) contains cells from all juvenile samples and displays a G1 phase-bias, while the left cluster is mainly composed of cells from the younger samples (1–7 years old) at different cell-cycle phases. Interestingly, Monocle pseudotime analysis also partitioned the 1- and 7-year-old Sertoli cells into two distinct states, termed Immature #1 and #2 (Figures 3D and 3E). Remarkably, these two states merge into one path that lead to mature Sertoli cells, which start emerging in samples from 11 years old onward (Figures 3D and 3E). We observed multiple features of Immature #1 and mature Sertoli cells that distinguish them from Immature #2 cells, including high AR (Androgen Receptor) target gene expression (defined by a set of ∼70 known AR-dependent genes) (Bolton et al., 2007Bolton E.C. So A.Y. Chaivorapol C. Haqq C.M. Li H. Yamamoto K.R. Cell- and gene-specific regulation of primary target genes by the androgen receptor.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2005-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), high mitochondrial transcription, and lower expression of ribosomal protein genes (Figure 3F). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment for terms such as nucleus and transcription in Immature #1 (Figure S3H). IF co-staining for AR and SOX9 confirms this sequence of events, by showing gradual AR upregulation and co-localization in Sertoli cells as puberty proceeds (Figure 3H). Immature #2 cells have the converse properties of Immature #1 described above and are enriched in GO terms for translation and ribosome function (Figure S3H). They exhibit higher transcription of ribosomal protein genes, mitochondrial ATPases (e.g., ATP5E), and mitochondrial membrane proteins (e.g., TOMM7) and contain a higher fraction of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figures 3F and S3E). Taken together, these two immature Sertoli cell states differ markedly in their metabolic/mitochondrial, translational, and cell-cycle properties (as indicated by transcriptional signatures). Analysis of Sertoli maturation via pseudotime and differential gene expression revealed dynamic expression of ∼1,000 genes (Figure S3F) that differ between the immature and mature stages. As expected, genes associated with cytoskeleton, cell morphogenesis, and extracellular matrix were upregulated during Sertoli maturation (Griswold, 2018Griswold M.D. 50 years of spermatogenesis: Sertoli cells and their interactions with germ cells.Biol. Reprod. 2018; 99: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; Figure S3F). Genes encoding antimicrobial innate immunity peptides (including the defensin class of peptides) and immunity-related genes (e.g., ISG15) were also upregulated during puberty (Figures 3F, 3G, and S3G), supporting a role for Sertoli cells in protecting the testis from infection (Com et al., 2003Com E. Bourgeon F. Evrard B. Ganz T. Colleu D. Jégou B. Pineau C. Expression of antimicrobial defensins in the male reproductive tract of rats, mice, and humans.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), especially after sexual maturation. To confirm this, we performed IF/IHC staining and observed downregulation of the immature Sertoli marker AMH during puberty (Figures 3J and S3I), and upregulation of the immune peptides LGALS3 and S100A6 in Sertoli cells in the 14-year-old sample (Figures 3I and S3J). Interestingly, immunostaining of an Immature #1 marker, PDPN (Figure 3F), showed spatial separation in the 11-year-old testis (Figure S3D), suggesting that the maturation of Sertoli cells in different tubules is asynchronous and proceeds gradually. Taken together, our data describe complex developmental progression in Sertoli cell states late in puberty that involve morphogenesis, metabolism, and innate immunity. Interestingly, the clustering analysis had initially placed Leydig and myoid cells together into a single large cluster (C5; Figure 1C), prompting further exploration. Reclustering of C5 revealed that cells from the 11-year-old and younger samples largely overlapped and shared the expression of known markers of fetal Leydig and myoid precursors in the mouse (e.g., MAFB and NR4A1; Figures 4A and 4B ; DeFalco et al., 2011DeFalco T. Takahashi S. Capel B. Two distinct origins for Leydig cell progenitors in the fetal testis.Dev. Biol. 2011; 352: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Wen et al., 2016Wen Q. Cheng C.Y. Liu Y.-X. Development, function and fate of fetal Leydig cells.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 59: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as heterogeneous co-expression of markers typically associated with both mature Leydig and myoid cells (e.g., DLK1 and ACTA2, respectively) (Guo et al., 2018Guo J. Grow E.J. Mlcochova H. Maher G.J. Lindskog C. Nie X. Guo Y. Takei Y. Yun J. Cai L. et al.The adult human testis transcriptional cell atlas.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, in samples from 13 years old to adult, we observed a clear separation of Leydig (marked by DLK1 and IGF1) and myoid cells (marked by ACTA2 and MYH11). In keeping, Monocle pseudotime analysis revealed that cells from pre-puberty (1–7 years old) tightly cluster together, and the trajectory bifurcates into two clusters as puberty proceeds (Figures 4C and 4D; Figures S4C and S4D). Thus, both modes of computational analysis suggest a common expression program defining a bipotential progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells prior to puberty. We next identified lineage-specific genes and programs, yielding ∼1,000 differentially expressed genes (Figure 4E). Early precursors expressed particular genes associated with transcription (e.g., MAFB and NR4A1); as cells progress toward the myoid lineage, cytoskeleton- and cell adhesion-related genes become expressed, consistent with myoid cells forming their distinctive peritubular structure (Maekawa et al., 1996Maekawa M. Kamimura K. Nagano T. Peritubular myoid cells in the testis: their structure and function.Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1996; 59: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells progressing along the Leydig lineage express genes involved in secretion, consistent with the known steroidogenic function of these cells (Chen et al., 2009Chen H. Ge R.-S. Zirkin B.R. Leydig cells: From stem cells to aging.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 306: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). IF stainings revealed that ACTA2 and MYH11 signals were low or absent in the tubule lamina in the 7- and 11-year-old samples, which display a layered ring structure around the tubules from 13 years old and onward (Figures 4F and 4G). Likewise, protein expression of CYP11A1, a marker for Leydig cell steroidogenesis, progressively appears as puberty proceeds (Figure 4H). To further validate our results, we performed IHC on five additional infant-juvenile samples (1, 2, 4, 11, and 14 years old) (Figures S4E and S4F). In keeping with the results above, we observed progressive upregulation of AR expression during puberty, concomitant with gradual AMH downregulation as Sertoli cells mature (Figure S4E). Furthermore, in these independent samples the expression of CYP11A1 was evident only in the 14-year-old sample, indicating complete maturation of adult Leydig cells. Likewise, the myoid marker, ACTA2, displays clear laminar expression only later in puberty (14 years old, Figure S4F). These stainings provide additional confirmation for the generality of our genomics findings and validation of the 4 analyzed testis samples. To explore germ cell-niche and niche-niche interactions during puberty, we examined signaling factor relationships (Figure S5). We observed dynamic and cell-type-specific expression of genes encoding ligands, inhibitors, receptors, and gene targets from multiple signaling pathways, including retinoic acid (RA), activin/inhibin, NOTCH, GDNF, FGF, and WNT (Figures S5B–S5H). This genome-wide view confirmed known relationships, previously documented in either humans or mice, while other observations provide useful cues regarding temporal and molecular relationships during puberty. For example, as STRA8 expression was absent from the 7- to 11-year-old samples (Figure S5B), RA is unlikely to be involved in the transition from undifferentiated to differentiating spermatogonia during human puberty, in contrast with findings in pre-pubertal mice (Velte et al., 2019Velte E.K.

The extracellular C terminus binds the adhesion GPCR Latrophilin, forming a trans-cellular complex with synaptogenic functions. However, Teneurins, Latrophilins, and FLRT proteins are also expressed during murine cortical cell migration at earlier developmental stages. Here, we present crystal structures of Teneurin-Latrophilin complexes that reveal how the lectin and olfactomedin domains of Latrophilin bind across a spiraling beta-barrel domain of Teneurin, the YD shell. We couple structure-based protein engineering to biophysical analysis, cell migration assays, and in utero electroporation experiments to probe the importance of the interaction in cortical neuron migration. We show that binding of Latrophilins to Teneurins and FLRTs directs the migration of neurons using a contact repulsion-dependent mechanism. The effect is observed with cell bodies and small neurites rather than their processes.

Teneurins are eukaryotic cell adhesion receptors that are thought to have evolved through a horizontal gene transfer event, where fusion of a bacterial toxin gene to a eukaryotic receptor resulted in a large type II transmembrane protein (Tucker et al., 2012Tucker R.P. Beckmann J. Leachman N.T. Schöler J. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Phylogenetic analysis of the teneurins: conserved features and premetazoan ancestry.Mol. Biol.

The four mammalian Teneurin homologs, Ten1 to Ten4, (also referred to as Ten-m1 to Ten-m4 and Odz-1 to Odz-4) are found predominantly, but not exclusively, in the nervous system, where they display complementary expression patterns from early development through to adulthood (Li et al., 2006Li H.

The mammalian Teneurins are modular, ∼2,800-residue-long type II transmembrane proteins whose ∼250-kDa extracellular domain comprises at least 16 annotated domains (Figure 1A). We recently revealed the first X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy structures of an ∼200-kDa fraction of the Gallus gallus Ten2 and murine Ten3 extracellular domains. These revealed a conserved superfold of eight domains (Jackson et al., 2018Jackson V.A. Meijer D.H. Carrasquero M. van Bezouwen L.S. Lowe E.D. Kleanthous C. Janssen B.J.C. Seiradake E. Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A similar cryoelectron microscopy structure of human Ten2 (Li et al., 2018Li J. Shalev-Benami M. Sando R. Jiang X. Kibrom A. Wang J. Leon K. Katanski C. Nazarko O. Lu Y.C. et al.Structural Basis for Teneurin Function in Circuit-Wiring: A Toxin Motif at the Synapse.Cell. 2018; 173: 735-748.e15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) confirmed that key features of this fold are conserved. The structures revealed three signature motifs of the Teneurin fold: (1) the spiraling beta-barrel tyrosine-aspartate repeat “YD shell” domain, (2) a specialized “fibronectin plug” domain that seals off the YD shell at the N-terminal side, and (3) a beta-propeller referred to as the NCL-1, HT2A, and Lin-41 (NHL) domain. These three elements form a superfold that is widespread in bacterial genomes, suggesting that they represent an evolutionarily ancient uncharacterized family of secreted bacterial proteins (Jackson et al., 2018Jackson V.A. Meijer D.H. Carrasquero M. van Bezouwen L.S. Lowe E.D. Kleanthous C. Janssen B.J.C. Seiradake E. Structures of Teneurin adhesion receptors reveal an ancient fold for cell-cell interaction.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The YD shell bears structural similarity to bacterial toxins of the TcB-TcC family (Busby et al., 2013Busby J.N. Panjikar S.

The regions upstream and downstream of the fibronectin (FN) plug, NHL, and YD shell are highly conserved in mammalian Teneurins. C-terminal of the YD shell is an ∼200-amino-acid linker that resides in the YD repeat shell and leads through the shell wall to form the antibiotic-binding-like (ABD) and Tox-GHH domains. The Tox-GHH harbors a colicin-like DNase fold (Ferralli et al., 2018Ferralli J. Tucker R.P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. The teneurin C-terminal domain possesses nuclease activity and is apoptogenic.Biol.

Direct. 2012; 7: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that includes a Teneurin C-terminal associated peptide, TCAP. This neuropeptide is either cleaved from the full Teneurin protein or transcribed separately and is thought to modulate murine stress behavior (Woelfle et al., 2016Woelfle R. D’Aquila A.L. Lovejoy D.A. Teneurins, TCAP, and latrophilins: roles in the etiology of mood disorders.Transl. Neurosci. 2016; 7: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Upstream of the Teneurin core fold lies the extracellular transthyretin (TTR)-like domain, a cysteine-rich region that is not structurally annotated, and eight epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, two of which form disulphide bridges and mediate Teneurin dimer formation, presumably “in cis” (between Teneurins on the same cell). An ∼180-amino-acid-long linker leads from the EGF domains to the transmembrane (TM) helix and intracellular domain (ICD). Pioneering studies in flies, which have two Teneurins, Ten-a and Ten-m, revealed roles in synaptic matching in the olfactory system (Hong et al., 2012Hong W. Mosca T.J. Luo L. Teneurins instruct synaptic partner matching in an olfactory map.Nature. 2012; 484: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and at neuromuscular junctions (Mosca et al., 2012Mosca T.J.

Latrophilins contain a short C-terminal ICD, a seven-TM GPCR domain (7TM), the extracellular GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing and hormone domains (GAIN/Horm), a glycosylated linker region (∼100 residues), and N-terminal olfactomedin (Olf) and lectin (Lec) domains (Figure 1A). FLRTs are single-spanning type I TM proteins with an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that is connected to a downstream FN-like domain via a glycosylated linker (Figure 1A). The LRR domain of FLRT binds the Latrophilin Olf domain (Jackson et al., 2015Jackson V.A. del Toro D. Carrasquero M. Roversi P. Harlos K. Klein R. Seiradake E.

Chem. 2014; 289: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The linker between the Lec and Olf domains undergoes alternative splicing and determines the affinity of Latrophilin binding to Teneurin (Boucard et al., 2014Boucard A.A. Maxeiner S. Südhof T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that FLRT3, Lphn2/3, and Ten2 work together as coincidence receptors in directing hippocampal synapse formation (Sando et al., 2019Sando R. Jiang X. Südhof T.C. Latrophilin GPCRs direct synapse specificity by coincident binding of FLRTs and teneurins.Science. 2019; 363: eaav7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). How Teneurins and Latrophilins interact at the molecular level and whether Teneurin-Latrophilin interactions have functions in early neurodevelopment prior to wiring has remained unclear. Here we ask the following questions. What is the structural mechanism of the Teneurin-Latrophilin interaction? Is it compatible with the known FLRT-Latrophilin binding mechanism? What is the function of the synaptic proteins Teneurin, Latrophilin, and FLRT during early cortex development? With X-ray crystallography, we reveal the Latrophilin binding site on Teneurin at the lateral side of the YD shell domain. The Teneurin-Latrophilin binding mechanism we reveal is consistent with coincidence binding of FLRT to the Latrophilin Olf domain, and we suggest a ternary complex model using our previous structural data on the Latrophilin-FLRT interaction (Jackson et al., 2016Jackson V.A. Mehmood S. Chavent M. Roversi P. Carrasquero M. Del Toro D. Seyit-Bremer G. Ranaivoson F.M. Comoletti D. Sansom M.S.P.M. et al.Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We use the structural results to probe for receptor functions in early cortical development and reveal a repulsion-mediated mechanism of cell body guidance. These results expand the functional repertoire of these receptors beyond a role in synapse development. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Lec domain of Latrophilin is essential and sufficient for binding to Teneurin proteins (Boucard et al., 2014Boucard A.A. Maxeiner S. Südhof T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We produced murine Latrophilin 2 (Lphn2 Lec domain, residues 30–137) and chicken Teneurin 2 (residues 1,043–2,802) individually in HEK293 cells and mixed the purified proteins. Crystals of Ten2 and Lphn2 grew in sitting drops at 4°C. We collected X-ray diffraction data up to 3.6-Å resolution and solved the structure by molecular replacement (Figure 1B; PDB: 6SKE). Crystallographic details are summarized in Table S1. The data reveal the Lphn2 Lec binding site on the Teneurin YD shell, spanning the tiers of the spiraling YD shell domain (Figure 1B) and burying a total of ∼1,500 Å2 surface area. The Olf domain is thought to contribute to the binding between Teneurin and Latrophilin (Boucard et al., 2014Boucard A.A. Maxeiner S. Südhof T.C. Latrophilins function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules by binding to teneurins: regulation by alternative splicing.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore also expressed murine Latrophilin 1 (Lphn1 Lec-Olf domains, residues 29–395) in HEK293 cells and produced complex crystals with Ten2 (residues 955–2802) in sitting drops at 18°C. We collected X-ray diffraction data up to 3.86-Å resolution and solved the structure by molecular replacement (Figures 1C and S1A; PDB: 6SKA). This second structure confirms the conserved Lec binding site on the Ten2 YD shell domain (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). Most of the buried Teneurin surface is contacted by the Lec domain, which is consistent with previous reports showing that Lec is essential and sufficient for the interaction. The total buried surface in this complex is ∼2,500 Å2. In both structures, the C-terminal Tox-GHH/TCAP domain lies ∼6 nm away from the Latrophilin binding site (Figures 1D and 1E). FLRT is known to bind Latrophilin Olf via the concave surface of its LRR domain (Jackson et al., 2015Jackson V.A. del Toro D. Carrasquero M. Roversi P. Harlos K. Klein R. Seiradake E.

Superposition of the previously solved Lphn3-FLRT2 complex structure (Jackson et al., 2016Jackson V.A. Mehmood S. Chavent M. Roversi P. Carrasquero M. Del Toro D. Seyit-Bremer G. Ranaivoson F.M.

Commun. 2016; 7: 11184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) produces a model of how the three proteins likely interact in a ternary complex (Figures 1C and S1D). Sequence conservation in the binding interfaces of vertebrate Latrophilins and Teneurins (Figures S1E and S1F) suggests that the interaction has conserved functional importance that restrains sequence diversion in this area. We chose the minimal complex of Lphn2 Lec-Ten2 (Figure 1B) for a set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the stability of the complex and to better define the positions of side chains in the interface. A 500-ns unrestrained simulation of the complex showed little movement between the Lec and YD shell (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD], ∼0.2 nm), suggestive of a stable complex (Figure S1G). In contrast, the NHL domain drifted from its original position at the YD shell (RMSD, ∼1.2 nm), suggesting that it is connected via a flexible hinge. The FN plug domain, ABD, and Tox-GHH domains were displaced by ∼0.3 nm RMSD. These results are consistent with previous cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, which also suggested flexibility in these areas (Jackson et al., 2018Jackson V.A. Meijer D.H.

We also performed a 50-ns simulation in which the protein backbone atom positions were restrained to refine the positions of the side chains. The results suggested two binding hotspots within the interface; one of these contacts is centered around D55, located in the loop between Lphn2 Lec strands β2 and β3 (Figures 1F–1H, and S1H). Analysis of the hydrogen bond pattern showed that D55 forms a stable salt bridge with R2197, located in the top tier of the Ten2 YD shell. A second contact is formed by the β1-β2 and β4-h1 loops of Lec, which"

The present study identifies critical factors responsible for poverty alleviation in India with the aid of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) deployed for showcasing causal reasoning. It is through FCM-based simulations that the study evaluates the efficacy of existing poverty alleviation approaches, including community organisation based micro-financing, capability and social security, market-based and good governance. Our findings confirm, to some degree, the complementarity of various approaches to poverty alleviation that need to be implemented simultaneously for a comprehensive poverty alleviation drive. FCM-based simulations underscore the need for applying an integrated and multi-dimensional approach incorporating elements of various approaches for eradicating poverty, which happens to be a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Besides, the study offers policy implications for the design, management, and implementation of poverty eradication programmes. On the methodological front, the study enriches FCM literature in the areas of knowledge capture, sample adequacy, and robustness of the dynamic system model."
https://openalex.org/W3000602238,"Purpose To determine the trends of infection sites and outcome of sepsis using a national population-based database. Materials and methods Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database of the US, adult sepsis hospitalizations and infection sites were identified using a validated approach that selects admissions with explicit ICD-9-CM codes for sepsis and diagnosis/procedure codes for acute organ dysfunctions. The primary outcome was the trend of incidence and in-hospital mortality of specific infection sites in sepsis patients. The secondary outcome was the impact of specific infection sites on in-hospital mortality. Results During the 9-year period, we identified 7,860,687 admissions of adult sepsis. Genitourinary tract infection (36.7%), lower respiratory tract infection (36.6%), and systemic fungal infection (9.2%) were the leading three sites of infection in patients with sepsis. Intra-abdominal infection (30.7%), lower respiratory tract infection (27.7%), and biliary tract infection (25.5%) were associated with highest mortality rate. The incidences of all sites of infections were trending upward. Musculoskeletal infection (annual increase: 34.2%) and skin and skin structure infection (annual increase: 23.0%) had the steepest increase. Mortality from all sites of infection has decreased significantly (trend p<0.001). Skin and skin structure infection had the fastest declining rate (annual decrease: 5.5%) followed by primary bacteremia (annual decrease: 5.3%) and catheter related bloodstream infection (annual decrease: 4.8%). Conclusions The anatomic site of infection does have a differential impact on the mortality of septic patients. Intra-abdominal infection, lower respiratory tract infection, and biliary tract infection are associated with higher mortality in septic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2999622178,"Background Oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention strategy for adherent users. Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa may particularly benefit from PrEP because of the disproportionate burden of HIV in this group. Understanding potential users’ perceptions of and interest in using PrEP is critical to promote the utilization of PrEP by individuals at risk of HIV. Methods This qualitative investigation of AGYW’s knowledge of and interest in PrEP use was conducted in the context of Girl Power, a quasi-experimental cohort study comparing four models of service delivery at four health centers in Lilongwe, Malawi. We conducted individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 40 HIV-negative AGYW ages 15–24 years old six months after enrolment in the parent study. An explanation of PrEP was provided to participants. Interview topics included participants’ prior knowledge of, interest in, concerns about, and delivery preferences for PrEP. Analysis consisted of structural coding of interview transcripts corresponding to interview topics, summary of responses within these topics, and identification and description of emerging themes within each topic. Results None of the AGYW had knowledge of PrEP prior to the IDIs, but once explained, a majority expressed an interest in using it due to inconsistencies in condom use, condom use errors, their own or their partners’ concurrent sexual partnerships, and rape. Most AGYW hoped that PrEP would be available in youth-friendly sections of health centers for easy access and youth-friendly counselling. They suggested that discrete packaging of PrEP would be needed to ensure user privacy. Concerns about relationship destabilization and accusations of promiscuity were raised as potential barriers to use. Conclusion General interest in PrEP among AGYW was high. Discrete packaging and access to youth-friendly PrEP delivery modalities may facilitate the utilization of PrEP as a prevention strategy among sexually active AGYW. Attention to potential negative reactions from partners and community members to PrEP use will be needed when introducing PrEP to this population."
https://openalex.org/W2998921455,"Integral membrane proteins are exposed to a complex and dynamic lipid environment modulated by nonbilayer lipids that can influence protein functions by lipid-protein interactions. The nonbilayer lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the most abundant lipid in plant photosynthetic thylakoid membranes, but its impact on the functionality of energy-converting membrane protein complexes is unknown. Here, we optimized a detergent-based reconstitution protocol to develop a proteoliposome technique that incorporates the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) into compositionally well-defined large unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicles to study the impact of MGDG on light harvesting by LHCII. Using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, and time-correlated single-photon counting, we found that both chlorophyll fluorescence quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes clearly indicate that the presence of MGDG in lipid bilayers switches LHCII from a light-harvesting to a more energy-quenching mode that dissipates harvested light into heat. It is hypothesized that in the in vitro system developed here, MGDG controls light harvesting of LHCII by modulating the hydrostatic lateral membrane pressure profile in the lipid bilayer sensed by LHCII-bound peripheral pigments."
https://openalex.org/W3000186133,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease complex and the leading infectious disease in post-weaned beef cattle. Clinical manifestations of BRD are recognized in beef calves within a high-risk setting, commonly associated with weaning, shipping, and novel feeding and housing environments. However, the understanding of complex host immune interactions and genomic mechanisms involved in BRD susceptibility remain elusive. Utilizing high-throughput RNA-sequencing, we contrasted the at-arrival blood transcriptomes of 6 beef cattle that ultimately developed BRD against 5 beef cattle that remained healthy within the same herd, differentiating BRD diagnosis from production metadata and treatment records. We identified 135 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the differential gene expression tools edgeR and DESeq2. Thirty-six of the DEGs shared between these two analysis platforms were prioritized for investigation of their relevance to infectious disease resistance using WebGestalt, STRING, and Reactome. Biological processes related to inflammatory response, immunological defense, lipoxin metabolism, and macrophage function were identified. Production of specialized pro-resolvin mediators (SPMs) and endogenous metabolism of angiotensinogen were increased in animals that resisted BRD. Protein-protein interaction modeling of gene products with significantly higher expression in cattle that naturally acquire BRD identified molecular processes involving microbial killing. Accordingly, identification of DEGs in whole blood at arrival revealed a clear distinction between calves that went on to develop BRD and those that resisted BRD. These results provide novel insight into host immune factors that are present at the time of arrival that confer protection from BRD."
https://openalex.org/W2998903841,"The ability to interpret transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) potentials (TEPs) is limited by artifacts, such as auditory evoked responses produced by discharge of the TMS coil. TEPs generated from direct cortical stimulation should vary in their topographical activity pattern according to stimulation site and differ from responses to sham stimulation. Responses that do not show these effects are likely to be artifactual. In 20 healthy volunteers, we delivered active and sham TMS to the right prefrontal, left primary motor, and left posterior parietal cortex and compared the waveform similarity of TEPs between stimulation sites and active and sham TMS using a cosine similarity-based analysis method. We identified epochs after the stimulus when the spatial pattern of TMS-evoked activation showed greater than random similarity between stimulation sites and sham vs. active TMS, indicating the presence of a dominant artifact. To do this, we binarized the derivatives of the TEPs recorded from 30 EEG channels and calculated cosine similarity between conditions at each time point with millisecond resolution. Only TEP components occurring before approximately 80 ms differed across stimulation sites and between active and sham, indicating site and condition-specific responses. We therefore conclude that, in the absence of noise masking or other measures to decrease neural artifact, TEP components before about 80 ms can be safely interpreted as stimulation location-specific responses to TMS, but components beyond this latency should be interpreted with caution due to high similarity in their topographical activity pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2999320663,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation for the treatment of macular degeneration has been studied for over 30 years. Human clinical trials have demonstrated that RPE monolayers exhibit improved cellular engraftment and survival compared to single cell suspensions. The use of a scaffold facilitates implantation of a flat, wrinkle-free, precisely placed monolayer. Scaffolds currently being investigated in human clinical trials are non-degradable which results in the introduction of a chronic foreign body. To improve RPE transplant technology, a degradable scaffold would be desirable. Using human fibrin, we have generated scaffolds that support the growth of an RPE monolayer in vitro. To determine whether these scaffolds are degraded in vivo, we developed a surgical approach that delivers a fibrin hydrogel implant to the sub-retinal space of the pig eye and determined whether and how fast they degraded. Using standard ophthalmic imaging techniques, the fibrin scaffolds were completely degraded by postoperative week 8 in 5 of 6 animals. Postmortem histologic analysis confirmed the absence of the scaffold from the subretinal space at 8 weeks, and demonstrated the reattachment of the neurosensory retina and a normal RPE–photoreceptor interface. When mechanical debridement of a region of native RPE was performed during implantation surgery degradation was accelerated and scaffolds were undetectable by 4 weeks. These data represent the first in situ demonstration of a fully biodegradable scaffold for use in the implantation of RPE and other cell types for treatment of macular degeneration and other retinal degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2999685294,"Apple decline in Washington state has been increasing in incidence, particularly on Honeycrisp trees grown on G.935 rootstock. In this disease the trees exhibit dieback with necrosis at the graft union and in the rootstock. The cause of this disease remains unknown. To identify viral candidates, RNA-seq was performed on six trees: four trees exhibiting decline and two healthy trees. Across the samples, eight known viruses and Apple hammerhead viroid were detected, however none appear to be specifically associated with the disease. A BLASTx analysis of the RNA-seq data was performed to identify novel viruses that might be associated with apple decline. Seventeen novel putative viruses were detected, including an ilarvirus, two tombus-like viruses, a barna-like virus, a picorna-like virus, three ourmia-like viruses, three partiti-like viruses, and two narna-like viruses. Four additional viruses could not be classified. Three of the viruses appeared to be missing key genes, suggesting they may be dependent upon helper viruses for their function. Others showed a specific tropism, being detected only in the roots or only in the leaves. While, like the known apple viruses, none were consistently associated with diseased trees, it is possible these viruses may have a synergistic effect when co-infecting that could contribute to disease. Or the presence of these viruses may weaken the trees for some other factor that ultimately causes decline. Additional research will be needed to determine how these novel viruses contribute to apple decline."

Using the Korean National Health Insurance Services database, we identified patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM between 2010 and 2016. The annual prevalence and incidence of HCM, and their clinical characteristics were investigated. The prevalence of HCM has increased from 0.016% (n = 6313) in 2010 to 0.031% (n = 13,035) in 2016. During a 7-year period, 13,229 patients were newly diagnosed with HCM. The incidence rate increased from 4.15 (per 100,000 person-years) in 2010 to 5.6 in 2016. The prevalence and incidence of HCM increased with age and peaked during the 70s, with male predominance in all age groups. Chest pain is the most frequent clinical presentation followed by shortness of breath and syncope. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the two most common comorbidities. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in about 1/3 and 1/4 of patients with HCM, respectively. The prevalence and incidence of HCM gradually increased from 2010 to 2016, possibly due to heightened recognition of the disease. Given the progressively high incidence of HCM with age and high prevalence of coexisting modifiable risk factors, continued efforts are required to increase awareness regarding HCM-related symptoms and potential complications."
https://openalex.org/W2999709773,"To facilitate hand gesture recognition, we investigated the use of acoustic signals with an accelerometer and gyroscope at the human wrist. As a proof-of-concept, the prototype consisted of 10 microphone units in contact with the skin placed around the wrist along with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The gesture recognition performance was evaluated through the identification of 13 gestures used in daily life. The optimal area for acoustic sensor placement at the wrist was examined using the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance feature selection algorithm. We recruited 10 subjects to perform over 10 trials for each set of hand gestures. The accuracy was 75% for a general model with the top 25 features selected, and the intra-subject average classification accuracy was over 80% with the same features using one microphone unit at the mid-anterior wrist and an IMU. These results indicate that acoustic signatures from the human wrist can aid IMU sensing for hand gesture recognition, and the selection of a few common features for all subjects could help with building a general model. The proposed multimodal framework helps address the single IMU sensing bottleneck for hand gestures during arm movement and/or locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W3000069894,"Class 3 mutations in B-Raf proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (BRAF), that result in kinase-impaired or kinase-dead BRAF have the highest mutation frequency in BRAF gene in lung adenocarcinoma. Several studies have reported that kinase-dead BRAF variants amplify mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by dimerizing with and activating WT C-Raf proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (CRAF). However, the structural and functional principles underlying their activation remain elusive. Herein, using cell biology and various biochemical approaches, we established that variant BRAFD594G, a kinase-dead representative of class 3 mutation-derived BRAF variants, has a higher dimerization potential as compared with WT BRAF. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered that the D594G substitution orients the αC-helix toward the IN position and extends the activation loop within the kinase domain, shifting the equilibrium toward the active, dimeric conformation, thus priming BRAFD594G as an effective allosteric activator of CRAF. We found that B/CRAF heterodimers are the most thermodynamically stable RAF dimers, suggesting that RAF heterodimers, and not homodimers, are the major players in determining the amplitude of MAPK signaling in cells. Additionally, we show that BRAFD594G:CRAF heterodimers bypass autoinhibitory P-loop phosphorylation, which might contribute to longer duration of MAPK pathway signaling in cancer cells. Last, we propose that the dimer interface of the BRAFD594G:CRAF heterodimer may represent a promising target in the design of novel anticancer therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2999549583,"Rotator cuff tear is the most frequent tendon injury in the adult population. Despite current improvements in surgical techniques and the development of grafts, failure rates following tendon reconstruction remain high. New therapies, which aim to restore the topology and functionality of the interface between muscle, tendon and bone, are essentially required. One of the key factors for a successful incorporation of tissue engineered constructs is a rapid ingrowth of cells and tissues, which is dependent on a fast vascularization. The dorsal skinfold chamber model in female BALB/cJZtm mice allows the observation of microhemodynamic parameters in repeated measurements in vivo and therefore the description of the vascularization of different implant materials. In order to promote vascularization of implant material, we compared a porous polymer patch (a commercially available porous polyurethane based scaffold from Biomerix™) with electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber mats and chitosan-graft-PCL coated electrospun PCL (CS-g-PCL) fiber mats in vivo. Using intravital fluorescence microscopy microcirculatory parameters were analyzed repetitively over 14 days. Vascularization was significantly increased in CS-g-PCL fiber mats at day 14 compared to the porous polymer patch and uncoated PCL fiber mats. Furthermore CS-g-PCL fiber mats showed also a reduced activation of immune cells. Clinically, these are important findings as they indicate that the CS-g-PCL improves the formation of vascularized tissue and the ingrowth of cells into electrospun PCL scaffolds. Especially the combination of enhanced vascularization and the reduction in immune cell activation at the later time points of our study points to an improved clinical outcome after rotator cuff tear repair."
https://openalex.org/W2999834211,"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include mainly Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are common chronic inflammatory conditions of the digestive system. The diagnosis of IBD relies on the use of a combination of factors including symptoms, endoscopy and levels of serum proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or faecal calprotectin. Currently there is no single reliable biomarker to determine IBD. Galectins are a family of galactoside-binding proteins that are commonly altered in the circulation of disease conditions such as cancer and inflammation. This study investigated serum galectin levels as possible biomarkers in determining IBD and IBD disease activity. Levels of galectins-1, -2, -3, -4, -7 and -8 were analysed in 208 samples from ambulant IBD patients (97 CD, 71 UC) patients and 40 from healthy people. Disease activity was assessed using Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and simple clinical colitis activity index for UC. The relationship of each galectin in determining IBD and IBD disease activity were analysed and compared with current IBD biomarker CRP. It was found that serum level of galectin-1 and -3, but not galectins-2, -4, -7 and -8, were significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy people. At cut-off of 4.1ng/ml, galectin-1 differentiated IBD from healthy controls with 71% sensitivity and 87% specificity. At cut-off of 38.5ng/ml, galectin-3 separated IBD from healthy controls with 53% sensitivity and 87% specificity. None of the galectins however were able to distinguish active disease from remission in UC or CD. Thus, levels of galectins-1 and -3 are significantly elevated in both UC and CD patients compared to healthy people. Although the increased galectin levels are not able to separate active and inactive UC and CD, they may have the potential to be developed as useful biomarkers for IBD diagnosis either alone or in combination with other biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2999059108,"This large-scale cross-sectional study had the aim to investigate whether adolescent males and females differ in self-perceived self-regulation. The large sample size allowed us to investigate sex differences in three age-groups of young (n = 161), middle (n = 133) and late (n = 159) adolescents. Self-regulation was evaluated with a self-report questionnaire, the Amsterdam Executive Functioning Inventory (AEFI). This questionnaire gives a proxi for three executive functions that are important for proper self-regulation: (1) self-control & self-monitoring, (2) attention, and (3) planning & initiative taking. Results revealed clear sex differences in the self-regulation as perceived by mid-adolescents (i.e., 13–16 years). In this age period, females evaluated their attention higher than males, and they reported higher levels of self-control & self-monitoring. Our findings offer important new insights with respect to the decision making, academic achievements and behaviour of 13-16-year olds. Self-regulation is known to have a central role in academic achievement and in behavioural organisation. The sex differences in self-regulation in mid-adolescence may therefore explain part of the difference which males and females in this age-group exhibit in academic achievements and behavioural organisations. The results imply that self-regulation may be a relevant intervention target: rather than focussing on changing behaviour, interventions may focus more on self-insights and thereby changing the adolescent’s perceptions about their behaviour. Increased self-insight may have the potency to actually change behaviour, which might be an interesting target for future investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2999784938,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships among the following elements: unhealthy work indicators (job stress and emotional exhaustion at work), the decision to drive (or not), and driving crashes suffered by Spanish workers. Methods For this cross-sectional study, a full sample of 1,200 Spanish drivers (44% women and 56% men) was used, their mean age being 42.8 years. They answered a questionnaire divided into three sections: demographic and driving-related data; burnout, job stress, and life stress; and self-reported road behaviors and driving safety indicators. Results Overall, 41.6% of drivers reported emotional exhaustion at work. Furthermore, 80.2% of the participants showing substantial signs of job stress or exhaustion had experienced one or more important stressful life events during the previous year. Job stress was associated with the number of driving crashes suffered along the last 3 years. Also, and especially in situations where drivers admit not feeling well enough to drive, job stress and emotional exhaustion seem to be independent from the decision to drive, and from perceiving these variables as potential impairers of driving performance. Conclusions First of all, this study showed a high prevalence of job stress and emotional exhaustion symptoms experienced at work by Spanish workers. Moreover, significant relationships were found among self-rated driving performance, workplace stress and burnout indicators, which suggests that job stress and emotional exhaustion levels may, indeed, impair driving performance, but they do not influence the decision to drive or not. In other words, even when they are significantly affected by job stress or emotional exhaustion at work, most Spanish drivers still drive."
https://openalex.org/W3000368113,"Treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a major hurdle in the field of oncology. Less than half of patients respond to frontline chemotherapy and the pancreatic tumor microenvironment limits the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. Targeted therapies could serve as effective treatments to enhance the clinical response rate. One potential therapeutic target is survivin, a protein that is normally expressed during embryonic and fetal development and has a critical impact on cell cycle control and apoptosis. In adulthood, survivin is not present in most normal adult cells, but is significantly re-expressed in tumor tissues. In PDAC, elevated survivin expression is correlated with treatment resistance and lower patient survival, although the underlying mechanisms of survivin's action in this type of cancer is poorly understood. Using patient derived xenografts of PDAC and their corresponding primary pancreatic cancer lines (PPCL-46 and PPCL-LM1) possessing increased expression of survivin, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic response of a novel survivin inhibitor, UFSHR, with respect to survivin expression and the tumorigenic characteristics of PDAC. Cell viability and apoptosis analyses revealed that repressing survivin expression by UFSHR or YM155, a well-known inhibitor of survivin, in PPCLs effectively reduces cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Tumor cell migration was also hindered following treatment with YM155 and UFSHR. In addition, both survivin inhibitors, particularly UFSHR, effectively reduced progression of PPCL-46 and PPCL-LM1 tumors, when compared to the untreated cohort. Overall, this study provides solid evidence to support the critical role of survivin in PDAC progression and proposes a novel survivin inhibitor UFSHR that can become an alternative strategy for this type of cancer."

Outpatient prescription data was extracted from the Hospital Prescription Analysis Cooperative Project. Prescribing patterns, trends of visits, and corresponding expenditures for glaucoma medications were analyzed.A total of 84297 ambulatory prescriptions were included in the current study. Visits by glaucoma patients increased from 13808 in 2013 to 20060 in 2017. Over the same period, the yearly expenditure for glaucoma drugs increased from 2.33 million to 3.95 million Chinese Yuan (CNY). Among all the six classes of glaucoma drugs (prostaglandin analogues, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α-receptor agonists, β-receptor antagonists, cholinergic agonists and fixed combinations), β-receptor antagonists were the most commonly prescribed in 2013, accounting for 34.3% of patients, but gradually decreased to 27.1% in 2017. Prostaglandin analogues became the most frequently prescribed drugs in 2017, accounting for 30.2% of the visits. Prostaglandin analogues are the most expensive and yielded a total expenditure of 2.34 million CNY in 2017, followed by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α-receptor agonists, β-receptor antagonists, fixed combinations, and cholinergic agonists. Combination therapy became increasingly prescribed in 2017.Glaucoma prescribing practices exhibited substantial changes over the study period. The number of glaucoma prescriptions continuously increased from 2013 to 2017, leading to increased prescription costs. These findings implied a similar trend observed in previous studies, as well as recommendations in the appropriate guidelines."

Methods US autoantibody prevalence estimates for detectable rheumatoid factor, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroperoxidase, anti-transglutaminase, anti-endomysial, anti-GAD65, antinuclear autoantibodies, and autoantibodies to extractable nuclear antigens were estimated from the 1960–1962 National Health Examination Survey, NHANES III (1988–1994), and the NHANES 1999–2014 cross-sectional surveys. Survey design variables and sample weights were used to account for differential probabilities of selection within the complex survey design. Data analysis used SASTM and SUDAAN™ software. US Census Bureau data were used to estimate the absolute numbers of persons with autoantibodies. Results NHANES III data show that the overall US prevalence of having a detectable serum autoantibody is substantial in adults, in both women and men. Thyroid autoantibodies were present in 18% of US adults (31 million persons) including 10% of younger adults and 25% of older persons. Overall autoantibody prevalences increased significantly with age: 32% of US adults 60+ years of age (12.8 million persons) had at least one of the four autoantibodies rheumatoid factor, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroperoxidase, or anti-tissue transglutaminase. Older women had higher levels of autoantibodies, but this was a relative difference. Autoantibody prevalence in both sexes was substantial (women 39%; men 22%). Fourteen percent of adults 60+ years of age have multiple autoantibodies. Conclusions Autoantibodies are present in a significant fraction of the general population, especially in older adults and women relative to men. Although all known clinically significant autoantibodies were not analyzed, these data provide an important population perspective on the scope and magnitude of humoral autoimmunity in the US. This is vital for prevention efforts to reduce autoimmune disease and helps clarify the potential impact of autoimmunity on the general population."

Patients underwent full ophthalmic examinations, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and angiography, prior to and 1, 3, and 6 months after the treatment. Clinical and tomographic features of the choriocapillaris and choroidal thickness and vascular changes were evaluated by assessing flow signal voids.All 56 eyes of 56 patients showed complete resolution of subretinal fluid at 3 months after photodynamic therapy. The best-corrected visual acuity significantly improved at 6 months (p<0.001). The central subfield thickness, subfoveal choroidal thickness, subfoveal choroidal large vessel layer thickness, and mean total area of flow signal voids decreased significantly at 6 months (all p values < 0.001), but the subfoveal choriocapillaris layer thickness did not change significantly at 6 months (p≥0.16). Multivariate analysis revealed positive linear correlations of the central subfield thickness and subfoveal choroidal large vessel layer thickness with the mean total area of flow signal voids at 6 months (p<0.001). There was a negative linear correlation between the subfoveal choriocapillaris layer and the mean total area of flow signal voids at 6 months (p = 0.013).Half-dose photodynamic therapy improved the anatomic and functional outcomes of central serous chorioretinopathy, induced subfoveal choroidal thickness thinning, and increased choriocapillaris perfusion. In addition, the recovery of the subfoveal choriocapillaris layer thickness and improved choriocapillaris perfusion were closely associated."
https://openalex.org/W3000497104,"We evaluated antiviral therapy (AVT) eligibility in a population-based sample of adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Zambia.Using a household survey, adults (18+ years) were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Sociodemographic correlates of HBsAg-positivity were identified with multivariable regression. HBsAg-positive individuals were referred to a central hospital for physical examination, elastography, and phlebotomy for HBV DNA, hepatitis B e antigen, serum transaminases, platelet count, and HIV-1/2 antibody. We determined the proportion of HBV monoinfected adults eligible for antiviral therapy (AVT) based on European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2017 guidelines. We also evaluated the performance of two alternative criteria developed for use in sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Treat-B guidelines.Across 12 urban and 4 rural communities, 4,961 adults (62.9% female) were tested and 182 (3.7%) were HBsAg-positive, 80% of whom attended hospital follow-up. HBsAg-positivity was higher among men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.87) and with decreasing income (AOR, 0.89 per household asset; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98). Trends toward higher HBsAg-positivity were also seen at ages 30-39 years (AOR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.96-4.63) and among pregnant women (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.93-3.25). Among HBV monoinfected individuals (i.e., HIV-negative) evaluated for AVT, median age was 31 years, 24.6% were HBeAg-positive, and 27.9% had HBV DNA >2,000 IU/ml. AVT-eligibility was 17.0% by EASL, 10.2% by WHO, and 31.1% by Treat-B. Men had increased odds of eligibility. WHO (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], 0.68) and Treat-B criteria (AUROC, 0.76) had modest accuracy. Fourteen percent of HBsAg-positive individuals were HIV coinfection, and most coinfected individuals were taking tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).Approximately 1 in 6 HBV monoinfected adults in the general population in Zambia may be AVT-eligible. Men should be a major focus of hepatitis B diagnosis and treatment. Further development and evaluation of HBV treatment criteria for resource-limited settings is needed. In settings with overlapping HIV and HBV epidemics, scale-up of ART has contributed towards hepatitis B elimination."
https://openalex.org/W3000128551,"Introduction We characterized dermal innervation in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) as potential contribution to small fiber pathology. Methods Skin biopsies of the calf were collected (86 FMS patients, 35 healthy controls). Skin was immunoreacted with antibodies against protein gene product 9.5, calcitonine gene-related peptide, substance P, CD31, and neurofilament 200 for small fiber subtypes. We assessed two skin sections per patient; on each skin section, two dermal areas (150 x 700 μm each) were investigated for dermal nerve fiber length (DNFL). Results In FMS patients we found reduced DNFL of fibers with vessel contact compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). There were no differences for the other nerve fiber subtypes. Discussion We found less dermal nerve fibers in contact with blood vessels in FMS patients than in controls. The pathophysiological relevance of this finding is unclear, but we suggest the possibility of a relationship with impaired thermal tolerance commonly reported by FMS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3000504236,"Background Increasing evidence has suggested that multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act key regulatory functions in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer. This study aimed to determine the expression and clinical significance of lncRNA ROR1 antisense RNA 1 (ROR1-AS1) from patients with bladder cancer, and to explore the potential role and mechanism underlying ROR1-AS1-related cancer progression. Methods Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted to detected the expression levels of ROR1-AS1 and miR-504 in bladder cancer samples and cell lines. Chi-square test was used for correlation analysis. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and wound scratch assays were applied to assesses the effects of ROR1-AS1 overexpression and knockdown on bladder cancer cell growth and migration in vitro, respectively. The prognosis of bladder cancer patients was evaluated by survival curves with Kaplan-Meier method. The regulatory mechanism of ROR1-AS1 on miR-504 was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay. Results ROR1-AS1 levels were obviously upregulated in bladder cancer tissues than matched normal bladder tissues. High expression of ROR1-AS1 was remarkably correlated with higher histological grade, advanced tumor stage, and positive lymph node metastasis. High ROR1-AS1 expression was markedly correlated with shorter overall survival of bladder cancer patients. Moreover, knockdown of ROR1-AS1 notably repressed T24 and 5637 cell growth and migration. ROR1-AS1 directly bound with miR-504 and act as a molecular sponge to decrease miR-504 expression. Silencing of miR-504 partly abrogated ROR1-AS1 knockdown-induced inhibitory effects on bladder cancer cell growth and migration. Conclusions Our data demonstrated that increased ROR1-AS1 promotes cell growth and migration of bladder cancer via regulation of miR-504, indicating ROR1-AS1 may be used as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2998767970,"Autoimmune reactions in Graves' disease (GD) occur not only in the thyroid gland, but also in the orbital connective tissue, eyelids, extraocular muscles. The occurrence of orbitopathy in the course of GD is influenced by environmental factors, e.g. cigarette smoking.The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of cigarette smoking on the efficacy of activity of radioiodine(131I) therapy in patients with GD. We also studied the influence of cigarette smoking and the efficacy of prednisone prophylaxis on the risk of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) development after radioiodine therapy (RIT) during two years of follow-up.Medical records of hyperthyroid patients treated with radioiodine had been included. Patients were scheduled to visit outpatient clinics at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after RIT.The studied group consisted of 336 patients (274 women, 62 men) diagnosed with GD and treated with RIT; 130 patients received second therapeutic dose of 131I due to recurrent hyperthyroidism. Among all studied patients, 220 (65.5%) were smokers and 116 (34.5%) non-smokers. In the group of smokers 115 (52.2%) of patients received single RIT, 105 (47.8%) received second dose of RAI due to recurrent hyperthyroidism. In non-smokers 91 (78.6%) received single activity of RAI, while 25 (21.4%) patients required second RIT due to recurrent hyperthyroidism. The ophthalmic symptoms in the group of smokers after RIT were less frequent, if the patient received preventative treatment in the form of oral prednisone (P = 0.0088).The results of our study suggest that cigarette smoking reduces the efficacy of treatment with 131I in patients with GD. The study also confirmed the effectiveness of steroid prophylaxis against TAO development or exacerbation after RIT."
https://openalex.org/W2998919013,"The functional morphology of sauropod dinosaur long necks has been studied extensively, with virtual approaches yielding results that are difficult to obtain with actual fossils, due to their extreme fragility and size. However, analyses on virtual fossils have been questioned on several of their premises, such as the ability to accurately reconstruct intervertebral tissue with only skeletal data; or whether zygapophyseal overlap can be used to determine the limits of range of motion, since some extreme neck poses in extant giraffes have been claimed not to retain any zygapophyseal overlap. We compared articulation and range of motion in extant giraffes with the exceptionally well-preserved and complete basally branching eusauropod Spinophorosaurus nigerensis from the Middle (?) Jurassic of Niger, under the same virtual paleontology protocols. We examined the articulation and range of motion on grown and young specimens of both Spinophorosaurus and giraffes in order to record any potential changes during ontogeny. Also, the postures of virtual giraffes were compared with previously published data from living animals in the wild. Our analyses show that: (i) articulation of virtual bones in osteologically neutral pose (ONP) does enable accurate prediction of the amount of inter-vertebral space in giraffes and, roughly, in Spinophorosaurus; (ii) even the most extreme neck postures attained by living giraffes in the wild do not require to disarticulate cervical vertebrae; (iii) both living giraffes and Spinophorosaurus have large intervertebral spaces between their cervical centra in early ontogenetical stages, which decrease as ontogeny advances; and (iv) that grown specimens have a greater osteological range of motion in living giraffes and Spinophorosaurus."
https://openalex.org/W2999525791,"General perfectionistic tendencies as well as perfectionism focussed specifically on one's physical appearance have been implicated as risk factors for disordered eating. This study extends previous research on protective factors by investigating self-compassion as a moderator of the relationship between both general and physical-appearance-perfectionism and disordered eating. A cross-sectional online survey assessed general perfectionism, physical-appearance-perfectionism, disordered eating symptoms, self-compassion and negative affect in female UK university students (N = 421). Results showed physical-appearance-perfectionism explained variance (15%) in disordered eating symptoms above general perfectionism and negative affect. Both perfectionistic concerns about and strivings for appearance perfection were significant unique predictors of disordered eating. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between both perfectionistic concerns and strivings of physical-appearance-perfectionism, but not general perfectionism, and disordered eating. This study suggests both perfectionistic concerns about and strivings for appearance perfection represent potential risk factors for disordered eating among female university students and that self-compassion may reduce their impact."
https://openalex.org/W2999902452,"The study's main objective was to describe the prevalence and severity of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) amongst a group of Ghanaian women in the outpatient setting of the predominantly rural Volta region of Ghana. Additionally we determine the predictors of FSD severity and care seeking behaviors of women with the condition.This was a cross sectional study conducted in the outpatient setting of the Ho Teaching Hospital in the rural-savannah, agro-ecological zone of Volta Region, Ghana.FSD was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. FSD was defined with a cutoff of ≤23 so as not to under-estimate the prevalence in this conservative setting. FSFI score >23 was designated ""no FSD"". We further categorized women with FSD as having mild (FSFI Total score 18-23), moderate (FSFI Total score <18 to >10) or severe (FSFI Total score ≤10) FSD. Due to sample size restrictions, we combined the moderate and severe FSD groups in our analyses and defined ""moderate/severe FSD"" as an FSFI Total score < 18. Participants with FSD were further asked to indicate whether or not they sought help for their conditions, the reasons they sought help, and the types of help they sought. We used p<0.05 to determine statistical significance for all analyses and logistic regression models were used to determine crude and age-adjusted effect estimates.FSD Prevalence: Out of 407 women approached, 300 (83.8%) agreed and consented to participate in the study. The prevalence of FSD was 48.3% (n = 145). Compared to those without FSD, over a third of the FSD women resided in rural settings (37.90% vs 20.60%; p = 0.001) and tended to be multiparous, with a significantly greater proportion having at least three children (31.70% vs 18.10%; p = 0.033). FSD Severity: Over a quarter of the sample (27.6%, n = 40) met the cut-off for moderate to severe FSD. In age-adjusted models, lubrication disorder was associated with 45 times the odds of moderate/severe FSD (age-adj. OR: 45.38, 95% CI: 8.37, 246.00; p<0.001), pain with 17times the odds (age-adj. OR: 17.18, 95% CI: 4.50, 65.50; p<0.001) and satisfaction almost 5times the odds (age-adj. OR: 4.69, 95% CI: 1.09, 20.2; p = 0.04). Compared to those with 1-3 children, nulliparous women had 3.5 times higher odds of moderate/severe sexual dysfunction as well (age-adj. OR:3.51, 95% CI:1.37,8.98; p = 0.009). FSD-related Health Seeking Behaviors: Statistically significant predictors of FSD-related care seeking included having FSD of pain disorder (age-adj. OR: 5.91, 95% CI:1.29, 27.15; p = 0.02), having ≥4 children (age-adj. OR: 6.29, 95%CI: 1.53, 25.76; p = 0.01). Of those who sought help, seven in 10 sought formal help from a healthcare provider, with General Practitioners preferred over Gynecologist. About one in 3 (31.3%) who did not seek help indicated that they did not know their sexual dysfunction was a medical condition, over a quarter (28.9%) ""thought it was normal"" to have FSD, and interestingly, 14.1% did not think a medical provider would be able to provide them with assistance.Sexual dysfunctions are prevalent yet taboo subjects in many countries, including Ghana. Awareness raising and efforts to feminize the physician workforce are necessary to meet the healthcare needs of vulnerable members of Ghanaian society."
https://openalex.org/W2999160934,"Klotho is an age-extending, cognition-enhancing protein found to be down-regulated in aged mammals when age-related diseases start to appear. Low levels of Klotho occur in neurodegenerative diseases, kidney disease and many cancers. Many normal and pathologic processes involve the proteolytic shedding of membrane proteins. Transmembrane (TM) Klotho contains two homologous domains, KL1 and KL2 with homology to glycosidases. After shedding by ADAM 10 and 17, a shed Klotho isoform is released into serum and urine by the kidney, and into the CSF by the choroid plexus. We previously reported that human Klotho contains two major cleavage sites. However, the exact cleavage site responsible for the cleavage between the KL1 and KL2 domains remains unknown for the human Klotho, and both sites are unknown for mouse Klotho. In this study, we aimed to identify the cleavage sites leading to the shed forms of human and mouse Klotho. Mutations in the region close to the TM domain of mouse Klotho result in the reduced shedding of the 130 kD (KL1+KL2) and 70 kD (KL1) fragments, suggesting that the cleavage site lies within the mutated region. We further identified the cleavage sites responsible for the cleavage between KL1 and KL2 of human and mouse Klotho. Moreover, mutated Klotho proteins have similar subcellular localization patterns as wild type Klotho. Finally, in an FGF23 functional assay, all Klotho mutants with a nine amino acid deletion can also function as an FGFR1 co-receptor for FGF23 signaling, however, the signaling activity was greatly reduced. The study provides new and important information on Klotho shedding, and paves the way for studies aimed to distinguish between the distinct roles of the various isoforms of Klotho."
https://openalex.org/W2999576076,"Mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) are contaminants of concern for fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). We explored Hg and Se in fish tissues (2,324 individuals) collected over 50 years (1962–2011) from the UCRB. Samples include native and non-native fish collected from lotic waterbodies spanning 7 major tributaries to the Colorado River. There was little variation of total mercury (THg) in fish assemblages basin-wide and only 13% (272/1959) of individual fish samples exceeded the fish health benchmark (0.27 μg THg/g ww). Most THg exceedances were observed in the White-Yampa tributary whereas the San Juan had the lowest mean THg concentration. Risks associated with THg are species specific with exceedances dominated by Colorado Pikeminnow (mean = 0.38 and standard error ± 0.08 μg THg/g ww) and Roundtail Chub (0.24 ± 0.06 μg THg/g ww). For Se, 48% (827/1720) of all individuals exceeded the fish health benchmark (5.1 μg Se/g dw). The Gunnison river had the most individual exceedances of the Se benchmark (74%) whereas the Dirty Devil had the fewest. We identified that species of management concern accumulate THg and Se to levels above risk thresholds and that fishes of the White-Yampa (THg) and Gunnison (Se) rivers are at the greatest risk in the UCRB."
https://openalex.org/W3000217216,"KHM-1 was first reported in 1997 in Japan as a novel metallo-β-lactamase mediated by Citrobacter freundii carrying pKHM-1 plasmid. There have been few reports in the clinical field since then. A blaKHM-1–positive Enterobacter hormaechei subsp. hoffmannii in E. cloacae complex, isolate OIPH-N069 was isolated from an inpatient blood culture in 2016. The isolate was characterized by whole-genome sequencing, comparative analysis of the blaKHM-1 encoding plasmid, antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and bacterial conjugation. OIPH-N069 was classified into ST78 of E. cloacae complex, and was multidrug resistant because of the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in addition to blaKHM-1 on its chromosome and plasmids. blaKHM-1 was located on 136,816 bp of the IncA/C2 plasmid pN069-1, which could be transferred to different bacterial species. The backbone structure, genetic arrangement of the class 1 integron cassette, and the blaKHM-1 gene located downstream of the IncA/C2 antibiotic resistance island, ARI-A, in pN069-1 and pKHM-1 were identical. Horizontal gene transfer of the blaCTX-M-2–ISEcp1 resistance gene module only occurred with pN069-1. The study findings indicate not only the structural conservation of blaKHM-1 encoding plasmids over time and across species, but also the risk of the spread of blaKHM-1 encoding plasmids to other bacterial species and the accumulation of additional resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W2999835181,"From January 2015 to December 2016, the health authorities in Burundi piloted the inclusion of child nutrition services into the pre-existing performance-based financing free health care policy (PBF-FHC). An impact evaluation, focused on health centres, found positive effects both in terms of volume of services and quality of care. To some extent, this result is puzzling given the harshness of the contextual constraints related to the fragile setting.With a multi-methods approach, we explored how contextual and implementation constraints interacted with the pre-identified tracks of effect transmission embodied in the intervention. For our analysis, we used a hypothetical Theory of Change (ToC) that mapped a set of seven tracks through which the intervention might develop positive effects for children suffering from malnutrition. We built our analysis on (1) findings from the facility surveys and (2) extra qualitative data (logbooks, interviews and operational document reviews).Our results suggest that six constraints have weighted upon the intervention: (1) initial low skills of health workers; (2) unavailability of resources (including nutritional dietary inputs and equipment); (3) payment delays; (4) suboptimal information; (5) restrictions on autonomy; and (6) low intensity of supervision. Together, they have affected the intensity of the intervention, especially during its first year. From our analysis of the ToC, we noted that the positive effects largely occurred as a result of the incentive and information tracks. Qualitative data suggests that health centres have circumvented the many constraints by relying on a community-based recruitment strategy and a better management of inputs at the level of the facility and the patient himself.Frontline actors have agency: when incentives are right, they take the initiative and find solutions. However, they cannot perform miracles: Burundi needs a holistic societal strategy to resolve the structural problem of child malnutrition.Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT02721160; March 2016 (retrospectively registered)."
https://openalex.org/W3000409578,"KL-6 is an antigen produced mainly by damaged type II pneumocytes that is involved in interstitial lung disease. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) after lung transplantation (LT) is a major concern for LT clinicians, especially in patients with restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). We investigated KL-6 levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as a potential biomarker of the RAS phenotype. Levels of KL-6 in serum and BALF were measured in 73 bilateral LT recipients, and patients were categorized into 4 groups: stable (ST), infection (LTI), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and RAS. We also studied a healthy cohort to determine reference values for serum KL-6. The highest levels of KL-6 were found in the serum of patients with RAS (918 [487.8–1638] U/mL). No differences were found for levels of KL-6 in BALF. Using a cut-off value of 465 U/mL serum KL-6 levels was able to differentiate RAS patients from BOS patients with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75%. Furthermore, higher serum KL-6 levels were associated with a decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at 6 months after sample collection. Therefore, KL-6 in serum may well be a potential biomarker for differentiating between the BOS and RAS phenotypes of CLAD in LT recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2999579498,"Lycian salamanders (genus Lyciasalamandra) constitute an exceptional case of micro-endemism of an amphibian species on the Asian Minor mainland. These viviparous salamanders are confined to karstic limestone formations along the southern Anatolian coast and some islands. We here study the genetic differentiation within and among 118 populations of all seven Lyciasalamandra species across the entire genus’ distribution. Based on circa 900 base pairs of fragments of the mitochondrial 16SrDNA and ATPase genes, we analysed the spatial haplotype distribution as well as the genetic structure and demographic history of populations. We used 253 geo-referenced populations and CHELSA climate data to infer species distribution models which we projected on climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Within all but one species, distinct phyloclades were identified, which only in parts matched current taxonomy. Most haplotypes (78%) were private to single populations. Sometimes population genetic parameters showed contradicting results, although in several cases they indicated recent population expansion of phyloclades. Climatic suitability of localities currently inhabited by salamanders was significantly lower during the LGM compared to recent climate. All data indicated a strong degree of isolation among Lyciasalamandra populations, even within phyloclades. Given the sometimes high degree of haplotype differentiation between adjacent populations, they must have survived periods of deteriorated climates during the Quaternary on the spot. However, the alternative explanation of male biased dispersal combined with a pronounced female philopatry can only be excluded if independent nuclear data confirm this result."
https://openalex.org/W2999585551,"The cell cycle regulator p27Kip1 is a critical factor controlling cell number in many lineages. While its anti-proliferative effects are well-established, the extent to which this is a result of its function as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor or through other known molecular interactions is not clear. To genetically dissect its role in the developing corneal endothelium, we examined mice harboring two loss-of-function alleles, a null allele (p27−) that abrogates all protein function and a knockin allele (p27CK−) that targets only its interaction with cyclins and CDKs. Whole-animal mutants, in which all cells are either homozygous knockout or knockin, exhibit identical proliferative increases (~0.6-fold) compared with wild-type tissues. On the other hand, use of mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to produce infrequently-occurring clones of wild-type and mutant cells within the same tissue environment uncovers a roughly three- and six-fold expansion of individual p27CK−/CK− and p27−/− cells, respectively. Mosaicism also reveals distinct migration phenotypes, with p27−/− cells being highly restricted to their site of production and p27CK−/CK− cells more widely scattered within the endothelium. Using a density-based clustering algorithm to quantify dispersal of MADM-generated clones, a four-fold difference in aggregation is seen between the two types of mutant cells. Overall, our analysis reveals that, in developing mouse corneal endothelium, p27 regulates cell number by acting cell autonomously, both through its interactions with cyclins and CDKs and through a cyclin-CDK-independent mechanism(s). Combined with its parallel influence on cell motility, it constitutes a potent multi-functional effector mechanism with major impact on tissue organization."
https://openalex.org/W2999158497,"The physiological effects of short-term stress responses typically lead to increased individual survival as it prepares the body for fight or flight through catabolic reactions in the body. These physiological effects trade off against growth, immunocompetence, reproduction, and even long-term survival. Chronic stress may thus reduce individual and population performance, with direct implications for the management and conservation of wildlife populations. Yet, relatively little is known about how chronic stress levels vary across wild populations and factors contributing to increased chronic stress levels. One method to measure long-term stress in mammals is to quantify slowly incorporated stress hormone (cortisol) in hair, which most likely reflect a long-term average of the stress responses. In this study, we sampled 237 harvested moose Alces alces across Sweden to determine the relative effect of landscape variables and disturbances on moose hair cortisol levels. We used linear model combinations and Akaike's Information Criterion (corrected for small sample sizes), and included variables related to human disturbance, ungulate competition, large carnivore density, and ambient temperature to estimate the covariates that best explained the variance in stress levels in moose. The most important variables explaining the variation in hair cortisol levels in moose were the long-term average temperature sum in the area moose lived and the distance to occupied wolf territory; higher hair cortisol levels were detected where temperatures were higher and closer to occupied wolf territories, respectively."

In Brazil, Curatella americana is traditionally used by local people to treat wounds, ulcers and inflammations. However, to the best of our knowledge, its traditional use in the treatment of wounds has not been validated by a scientific study. Here, some compounds, many of them flavonoids, were identified in the hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of C. americana (HECA) by LC-HRMS and LC-MS/MS. Besides that, solutions containing different concentrations of HECA and a gel produced with this extract were evaluated for its antimicrobial, coagulant and wound healing activities on an excision mouse wound model as well as its acute dermal safety. A total of thirteen compounds were identified in HECA, mainly quercetin, kaempferol and glucoside derivatives of both, besides catechin and epicatechin known as wound healing agents.

https://openalex.org/W3000648910,"Enterotoxin-based proteins are powerful manipulators of mucosal immunity. The A1 domain of heat-labile enterotoxin from E. coli, or LTA1, is a newer adjuvant from this family under investigation for intranasal vaccines. Although LTA1 has been examined in mouse vaccination studies, its ability to directly stimulate immune cells compared to related adjuvant proteins has not been well explored. Here, we perform the first rigorous examination of LTA1's effect on antigen presenting cells (APC) using a human monocyte cell line THP-1. To better understand LTA1's stimulatory effects, we compared it to dmLT, or LT-R192G/L211A, a related AB5 adjuvant in clinical trials for oral or parenteral vaccines. LTA1 and dmLT both activated APCs to upregulate MHC-II (HLA-DR), CD86, cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-1β) and inflammasome activation. The effect of LTA1 on surface marker changes (e.g., MHC-II) was highly dose-dependent whereas dmLT exhibited high MHC-II expression regardless of dose. In contrast, cytokine secretion profiles were similar and dose-dependent after both LTA1 and dmLT treatment. Cellular activation by LTA1 was independent of ganglioside binding, as pre-treatment with purified GM1 blocked the effect of dmLT but not LTA1. Unexpectedly, while activation of the inflammasome and cytokine secretion by LTA1 or dmLT was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (similar to previous reports), these responses were not inhibited by a more specific PKA peptide inhibitor or antagonist; thus Indicating that a novel and unknown mechanism is responsible for inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion by LT proteins. Lastly, LTA1 stimulated a similar cytokine profile in primary human monocytes as it did in THP1 cells, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNFα. Thus, we report that LTA1 protein programs a dendritic cell-like phenotype in APCs similar to dmLT in a mechanism that is independent of PKA activation and GM1 binding and entry."
https://openalex.org/W3000140390,"Objectives To evaluate the predictive performance of comb-push ultrasound shear elastography for the differentiation of reactive and metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Methods From June 2014 through September 2018, 114 female volunteers (mean age 58.1±13.3 years; range 28–88 years) with enlarged axillary lymph nodes identified by palpation or clinical imaging were prospectively enrolled in the study. Mean, standard deviation and maximum shear wave elastography parameters from 117 lymph nodes were obtained and compared to fine needle aspiration biopsy results. Mann-Whitney U test and ROC curve analysis were performed. Results The axillary lymph nodes were classified as reactive or metastatic based on the fine needle aspiration outcomes. A statistically significant difference between reactive and metastatic axillary lymph nodes was observed based on comb-push ultrasound shear elastography (CUSE) results (p<0.0001) from mean and maximum elasticity values. Mean elasticity showed the best separation with a ROC analysis resulting in 90.5% sensitivity, 94.4% specificity, 0.97 area under the curve, 95% positive predictive value, and 89.5% negative predictive value with a 30.2-kPa threshold. Conclusions CUSE provided a quantifiable parameter that can be used for the assessment of enlarged axillary lymph nodes to differentiate between reactive and metastatic processes."
https://openalex.org/W3000368286,"Fuzzy evidence theory, or fuzzy Dempster-Shafer Theory captures all three types of uncertainty, i.e. fuzziness, non-specificity, and conflict, which are usually contained in a piece of information within one framework. Therefore, it is known as one of the most promising approaches for practical applications. Quantifying the difference between two fuzzy bodies of evidence becomes important when this framework is used in applications. This work is motivated by the fact that while dissimilarity measures have been surveyed in the fields of evidence theory and fuzzy set theory, no comprehensive survey is yet available for fuzzy evidence theory. We proposed a modification to a set of the most discriminative dissimilarity measures (smDDM)-as the minimum set of dissimilarity with the maximal power of discrimination in evidence theory- to handle all types of uncertainty in fuzzy evidence theory. The generalized smDDM (FsmDDM) together with the one previously introduced as fuzzy measures make up a set of measures that is comprehensive enough to collectively address all aspects of information conveyed by the fuzzy bodies of evidence. Experimental results are presented to validate the method and to show the efficiency of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3000668493,"Many freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and particularly Mediterranean ones, show increasing levels of salinity. These changes in water conditions could affect abundance and distribution of inhabiting species as well as the provision of ecosystem services. In this study we conduct laboratory experiments using the macroinvertebrate Smicridea annulicornis as a model organism. Our factorial experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of geographical origin of organisms and salinity levels on survival and behavioral responses of caddisflies. The experimental organisms were captured from rivers belonging to three hydrological basins along a 450 Km latitudinal gradient in the Mediterranean region of Chile. Animals were exposed to three conductivity levels, from 180 to 1400 μS/cm, close to the historical averages of the source rivers. We measured the behavioral responses to experimental stimuli and the survival time. Our results showed that geographical origin shaped the behavioral and survival responses to salinity. In particular, survival and activity decreased more strongly with increasing salinity in organisms coming from more dilute waters. This suggests local adaptation to be determinant for salinity responses in this benthic invertebrate species. In the current scenario of fast temporal and spatial changes in water levels and salt concentration, the conservation of geographic intra-specific variation of aquatic species is crucial for lowering the risk of salinity-driven biodiversity loss."
https://openalex.org/W2998877855,"Background The objective of this study was to assess regional and ethnic differences in an unselected patient population treated with polymer-free sirolimus-eluting stents (PF-SES) in Asia and Europe. Methods Two all-comers observational studies based on the same protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02629575 and NCT02905214) were combined for data analysis to assure sufficient statistical power. The primary endpoint was the accumulated target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate at 9–12 months. Results Of the total population of 7243 patients, 44.0% (3186) were recruited in the Mediterranean region and 32.0% (2317) in central Europe. The most prominent Asian region was South Korea (17.6%, 1274) followed by Malaysia (5.7%, 413). Major cardiovascular risk factors varied significantly across regions. The overall rates for accumulated TLR and MACE were low with 2.2% (140/6374) and 4.4% (279/6374), respectively. In ACS patients, there were no differences in terms of MACE, TLR, MI and accumulated mortality between the investigated regions. Moreover, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimens were substantially longer in Asian countries even in patients with stable coronary artery disease as compared to those in Europe. Conclusions PF-SES angioplasty is associated with low clinical event rates in all regions. Further reductions in clinical event rates seem to be associated with longer DAPT regimens."
https://openalex.org/W3000086915,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and immunity against cytomegalovirus (CMV) may be a contributing factor. We hypothesized that enhanced T-cell responses against CMV and CMV-IgG antibody-levels are associated with higher arterial blood pressure in PLHIV. We assessed serum CMV-IgG, systolic- (SBP) and diastolic- (DBP) blood pressure, pulse pressure (PP), traditional risk factors, activated CD8+ T-cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), senescent CD8+ T-cells (CD28-CD57+) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 60 PLHIV and 31 HIV-uninfected controls matched on age, gender, education and comorbidity. In PLHIV, expression of interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ was measured by intracellular-cytokine-staining after stimulation of T-cells with CMV-pp65 and CMV-gB. Associations between CMV-specific immune responses and hypertension, SBP, DBP or PP were assessed by multivariate logistic and linear regression models adjusted for appropriate confounders. The median age of PLHIV was 47 years and 90% were male. Prevalence of hypertension in PLHIV was 37% compared to 55% of HIV-uninfected controls. CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were independently associated with higher PP (CMV-pp65; β = 2.29, p = 0.001, CMV-gB; β = 2.42, p = 0.001) in PLHIV. No significant differences were found with regard to individual measures of SBP and DBP. A possible weak association was found between CMV-IgG and hypertension (β = 1.33, p = 0.049) after adjustment for age, smoking and LDL-cholesterol. HIV-related factors, IL-6, CD8+ T-cell activation or CD8+ T-cell senescence did not mediate the associations, and no associations were found between CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses and blood pressure in PLHIV. In conclusion, increased arterial blood pressure in PLHIV may be affected by heightened CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W3000433919,"Particle size is one factor affecting phosphorus (P) dynamics in soils and sediments. This study investigated how flow facilitated by hydraulic pumps and aquatic vegetation species water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) affected particle size and P-dynamics in organic sediments in agricultural drainage ditches. Sediments with finer particle size (>0.002 mm) were hypothesized to contain greater total P (TP) and less labile P than sediments with coarser particle size. Particle size was determined using a LS 13 320 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer. Sediments were tested for pH, TP, and organic matter. Fractions of P were determined using a sequential fractionation experiment and 31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Larger average particle size and lower average total P concentrations were found in the inflows of the field ditches compared to the outflows. Presence of flow and aquatic vegetation did not have a significant impact on particle size, TP, or labile P fractions. Median (p = 0.10) particle size was not significantly correlated to TP. Overall, there was an average trend of coarser particle size and lower P concentrations in the inflow compared to the outflow. The presence of inorganic limerock could have affected results due to increased P adsorption capacity and larger average particle size compared to the organic fraction of the sediment."
https://openalex.org/W3000625218,"The objective of this work is to advance the understanding of helicopter accidents by examining and quantifying the association between helicopter-specific configurations (number of main rotor blades, number of engines, rotor diameter, and takeoff weight) and the likelihood of accidents. We leverage a dataset of 8,338 turboshaft helicopters in the U.S. civil fleet and 825 accidents from 2005 to 2015. We use the dataset to develop a logistic regression model using the method of purposeful selection, which we exploit for inferential purposes and highlight the novel insights it reveals. For example, one important question for the design and acquisition of helicopters is whether twin-engine turboshaft helicopters exhibit a smaller likelihood of accidents than their single-engine counterparts, all else being equal. The evidence-based result we derive indicates that the answer is contingent on other covariates, and that a tipping point exists in terms of the rotor diameter beyond which the likelihood of accidents of twin-engines is higher (worse) than that of their single-engine counterparts. Another important result derived here is the association between the number of main rotor blades and likelihood of accidents. We found that for single-engine turboshaft helicopters, the four-bladed ones are associated with the lowest likelihood of accidents. We also identified a clear coupling between the number of engines and the rotor diameter in terms of likelihood of accidents. In summary, we establish important relationships between the different helicopter configurations here considered and the likelihood of accident, but these are associations, not causal in nature. The causal pathway, if it exists, may be confounded or mediated by other variables not accounted for here. The results provided here lend themselves to a rich set of interpretive possibilities, and because of their significant safety implications they deserve careful attention from the rotorcraft community."
https://openalex.org/W2998770050,"In pregnancies after a previous cesarean section (CS), a planned repeat CS delivery has been associated with excess risk of adverse outcome. However, also the alternative, a trial of labor after CS (TOLAC), has been associated with excess risks. A TOLAC failure, involving a non-planned CS, carries the highest risk of adverse outcome and a vaginal delivery the lowest. Thus, the decision regarding delivery mode is pivotal in clinical handling of these pregnancies. However, even with a high TOLAC rate, as seen in Norway, repeat CSs are regularly performed for no apparent medical reason. The objective of the present study was to assess to which extent demographic, socioeconomic, and health system factors are determinants of TOLAC and TOLAC failure in low risk pregnancies, and whether any effects observed changed with time.The study group comprised 24 645 second deliveries (1989-2014) after a first delivery CS. Thus, none of the women had prior vaginal deliveries or more than one CS. Included pregnancies were low risk, cephalic, single, and had gestational age ≥ 37 weeks. Data were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). The exposure variables were (second delivery) maternal age, length of maternal education, maternal country of origin, size of the delivery unit, health region (South-East, West, Mid, North), and maternal county of residence. The outcomes were TOLAC and TOLAC failure, as rates (%), relative risk (RR) and relative risk adjusted (ARR). Changes in determinant effects over time were assessed by comparing rates in two periods, 1989-2002 vs 2003-2014, and including these periods in an interaction model.The TOLAC rate was 74.9%, with a TOLAC failure rate of 16.2%, resulting in a vaginal birth rate of 62.8%. Low TOLAC rates were observed at high maternal age and in women from East Asia or Latin America. High TOLAC failure rates were observed at high maternal age, in women with less than 11 years of education, and in women of non-western origin. The effects of health system factors, i.e. delivery unit size and administrative region were considerable, on both TOLAC and TOLAC failure. The effects of several determinants changed significantly (P < 0.05) from 1989-2002 to 2003-2014: The association between non-TOLAC and maternal age > 39 years became weaker, the association between short education and TOLAC failure became stronger, and the association between TOLAC failure and small size of delivery unit became stronger.Low maternal age, high education, and western country of origin were associated with high TOLAC rates, and low TOLAC failure rates. Maternity unit characteristics (size and region) contributed with effects on the same level as individual determinants studied. Temporal changes were observed in determinant effects."
https://openalex.org/W2999017573,"The cluster innovation network is an important part of regional economic development. In addition, the fairness preference of internal innovators in the processes of investment and benefit distribution are particularly important for curbing ""free riding"" and other speculative behaviors and for creating a good cooperation environment. Therefore, taking a cluster innovation network constructed by the weighted evolutionary BBV model as the research subject, this paper constructs an evolutionary game model of a cluster innovation network based on a spatial public goods game and the theory of fairness preferences, which involves the processes of investment and payoff allocation. Using simulation analysis, this paper studies the evolution of innovators' cooperative behaviors and benefits in cluster innovation network under the conditions of a fairness preference and a return intensity. The results show that an increase in the weight coefficient, gain coefficient and degree of differentiation between the previous income and current investment can effectively promote improvements in the level of enterprise cooperation. Indeed, the greater the weight coefficient, the gain coefficient and the degree of differentiation are, the more substantial the improvement in the level of enterprise cooperation will be. Moreover, an improvement in the differentiation of the breadth and depth of enterprise cooperation has an inhibitory effect on enterprise cooperation. Furthermore, whereas increases in regulation and gain coefficients can effectively promote enterprise cooperation. However, the increase in the weight coefficient has a different effect on enterprise benefit in terms of the breadth and depth of cooperation. Finally, we hope to improve the overall cooperation level and cooperation income of the network by deeply understanding the fair preferences of innovators in the processes of investment and benefit distribution, which is helpful for promoting the evolution and development of cluster innovation networks."
https://openalex.org/W2999058473,"Viruses depend on the host cell translation machinery for their replication, and one common strategy is the presence of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) in the viral RNAs, using different sets of host translation initiation factors. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES binds eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), but the exact functional role of the eIF3 complex and of its subunits remains to be precisely defined. Toward this goal, here we focused on eIF3 subunit e. We used an in vitro assay combining a ribosome-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysate and ribosomes prepared from HeLa or Huh-7.5 cells transfected with either control or eIF3e siRNAs. eIF3e silencing reduced translation mediated by the 5'UTR of various cellular genes and HCV-like IRESs. However, this effect was not observed with the bona fide HCV IRES. Silencing of eIF3e reduced the intracellular levels of the c, d, and l subunits of eIF3 and their association with the eIF3 core subunit a. A pulldown analysis of eIF3 subunits associated with the HCV IRES disclosed similar effects and that the a subunit is critical for binding to the HCV IRES. Carrying out HCV infections of control and eIF3e-silenced Huh-7.5 cells, we found that in agreement with the in vitro findings, eIF3e silencing does not reduce HCV replication and viral protein expression. We conclude that unlike for host cellular mRNAs, the entire eIF3 is not required for HCV RNA translation, favoring viral expression under conditions of low eIF3e levels."
https://openalex.org/W2999792444,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk of developing stroke due to augmented systemic inflammation. While regular exercise has been shown to reduce inflammation in human subjects, the purpose of our study is to determine whether increased frequency of rehabilitation is protective against stroke or not.A total of 16,224 rheumatoid arthritis patients with a catastrophic illness certificate were identified in our database from 2000 to 2006, and 663 of them developed stroke before the end of 2013. After statistically matching for age, sex, and the time interval between the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and stroke, 642 patients without stroke were identified as the control group. Analyses with Student's t test and Chi-square test were done to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with and without stroke, and logistic regression analysis was then performed to evaluate the odds ratio of stroke.Higher odds ratio of stroke was revealed in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and moderate degree of rheumatoid arthritis disease severity. Furthermore, more than 40 rehabilitation sessions per year reduced the risk of developing stroke in patients with moderate disease severity.Physical activities brought by more rehabilitation sessions are beneficial and should be encouraged in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly for those with higher disease activity but not taking biologic agents."
