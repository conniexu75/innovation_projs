https://openalex.org/W2041639550,"The biochemical analysis of cellular trans-activators involved in promoter recognition provides an important step toward understanding the mechanisms of gene expression in animal cells. The promoter selective transcription factor, Sp1, has been purified from human cells to more than 95 percent homogeneity by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. Isolation and renaturation of proteins purified from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels allowed the identification of two polypeptides (105 and 95 kilodaltons) as those responsible for recognizing and interacting specifically with the GC-box promoter elements characteristic of Sp1 binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2081062649,"Yeast GCN4 protein binds specifically to the promoters of amino acid biosynthetic genes and coordinately induces their transcription. Serially deleted GCN4 and hybrid LexA-GCN4 proteins were assayed for specific DNA binding activity in vitro, and for stimulation of transcription in vivo. The specific DNA binding activity resides in the 60 C-terminal amino acids, a basic region of GCN4. However, certain deletions containing the entire DNA binding region are unable to activate transcription and instead act as repressors in vivo. The activation function appears to critically involve just 19 amino acids that are centrally located in an acidic region of GCN4. In addition to their functional separation, the DNA binding and transcriptional activation regions of the protein can be separated physically by elastase cleavage. The implications of these results for the mechanisms of DNA sequence recognition and transcription activation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1991548997,"A novel, highly quantitative transient expression assay based on the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene was used to examine the trans-activation of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/HTLV-III/LAV/ARV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in a range of eukaryotic cell lines. In the absence of the trans-activating viral gene product, tat-III, IL-2 transcripts specific for the HIV LTR were present in low abundance in transfected cells and showed a low translational efficiency, when compared with IL-2 mRNAs transcribed from other viral promoters. Coexpression of tat-III resulted in a marked increase in the steady state level of IL-2 mRNAs transcribed from the HIV LTR, and these mRNAs also demonstrated a specific enhancement of their translational efficiency. These results suggest a bimodal mechanism of action for tat-III in the trans-activation of HIV-specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2055600356,"Fusions of the secreted protein alkaline phosphatase to an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein of Escherichia coli showed different activities depending on where in the membrane protein the alkaline phosphatase was fused. Fusions to positions in or near the periplasmic domain led to high alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas those to positions in the cytoplasmic domain gave low activity. Analysis of alkaline phosphatase fusions to membrane proteins of unknown structure may thus be generally useful in determining their membrane topologies."
https://openalex.org/W2059759744,"We have established, by means of a monoclonal antibody and a cDNA clone, that a desmosomal polypeptide of Mr 83,000 also occurs at the plaques of other types of adhering junctions, including the vinculin-actin-associated intercellular junctions, e.g., the zonula adhaerens of epithelial cells and the endothelial, lens, and Sertoli cell junctions. This is the first component found in common among otherwise biochemically distinct plaque domains. Despite its concentration at these intercellular junctions, it is absent from the respective cell-substratum contact sites. In addition, it appears in a globular soluble 7S form in the cytoplasm. We discuss the significance of this protein, for which the name plakoglobin is proposed, in terms of its interaction with such biochemically diverse membrane domains and their different types of associated cytoskeletal filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2066295910,Sensitivity to proteolytic degradation was used to monitor folding of polypeptides in vivo. A correlation between competence for export and lack of stable tertiary structure was established by comparing the kinetics of folding of mutated precursor maltose-binding protein that carries a defective leader peptide with the kinetics of folding of wild-type precursor that is competent for export. It is proposed that during export a kinetic competition exists between productive translocation and folding of precursor intracellularly into a stable conformation that is not compatible with transfer.
https://openalex.org/W2087085187,"Expression of the yeast his3 and other amino acid biosynthetic genes is induced during conditions of amino acid starvation. The coordination of this response is mediated by a positive regulatory protein called GCN4, which binds specifically to regulatory sites upstream of all coregulated genes and stimulates their transcription. The nucleotide sequence requirements of the his3 regulatory site were determined by analysis of numerous point mutations obtained by a novel method of cloning oligonucleotides. Almost all single base pair mutations within the nine base pair sequence ATGACTCTT significantly reduce his3 induction in vivo and GCN4 binding in vitro, whereas changes outside this region have minimal effects. One mutation, which generates a sequence that most closely resembles the consensus for 15 coregulated genes, increases both the level of induction and the affinity for GCN4 protein. The palindromic nature of the optimal sequence, ATGACTCAT, suggests that GCN4 protein binds as a dimer to adjacent half-sites that possibly overlap."

https://openalex.org/W2003327103,"Friend murine erythroleukaemia (F-MEL) cells are a permanent line of primitive erythroid precursors originally derived from the spleens of mice infected with the Friend strain of murine leukaemia virus. F-MEL cells differentiate in vitro in response to various chemical inducers. Concomitantly with induction, a biphasic regulation of c-myc oncogene transcripts is observed. Within one hour of the addition of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or hypoxanthine (Hyp), the levels of c-myc transcripts fall dramatically and remain virtually undetectable for the next few hours. Between 8 and 24 hours after induction, c-myc transcripts return to pre-induction levels and then decline again between 3 and 5 days as most of the cells undergo terminal differentiation. To explore the potential relationship between c-myc expression and F-MEL terminal differentiation, we have investigated here whether reversing the early fluctuations in c-myc transcript levels affects the ability of F-MEL cells to differentiate. We therefore constructed an amplifiable plasmid vector containing a full-length mouse c-myc complementary DNA and introduced it stably into recipient F-MEL cells. The exogenous c-myc sequences are transcribed in F-MEL cells and the transcript levels do not change significantly in response to inducing agents. The net result is continued c-myc expression following DMSO or Hyp induction and a complete or partial inhibition of F-MEL differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2085801794,"Transducin is a guanyl nucleotide-binding protein that couples rhodopsin photolysis to hydrolysis of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in rod photoreceptor cells of vertebrate retinas. Several complementary DNA clones encoding transducin subunits have recently been characterized. One clone, isolated from a bovine retina complementary DNA library, encodes a previously unidentified polypeptide with an amino acid sequence 78% identical to the sequence of the alpha subunit of bovine rod outer segment transducin. Antibodies to a synthetic peptide with amino acid sequence derived specifically from this novel polypeptide recognize a 41-kilodalton polypeptide in homogenates of bovine retina. Localization of this polypeptide in bovine retina by indirect immunofluorescence demonstrates that it is expressed only in cone outer segments. Antibodies to specific sequences found only in the rod transducin alpha subunit recognize a polypeptide localized only in the rod outer segment. Therefore, bovine rod and cone cells each express structurally related yet significantly different forms of transducin."
https://openalex.org/W1496494806,"Two apparently homologous proteins, designated CIF-A and CIF-B, were previously isolated from bovine bone on the basis of their cartilage-inducing activity in culture. CIF-A has been shown to probably be identical to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). To address the question of tissue localization, antibodies to CIF-A were produced using a synthetic polypeptide identical to N-terminal residues 1-30. The antibodies were immunoreactive with bovine CIF-A and human TGF-beta, did not recognize CIF-B, and did not recognize other molecular weight species in crude bovine bone extracts. The antibodies were used to immunohistochemically localize CIF-A/TGF-beta in fetal bovine bone and other tissues. There was abundant staining of osteocytes throughout cancellous and cortical bone as well as chondrocytes within the articular cartilage, although growth plate-associated chondrocytes were not labeled. In addition, immunoreactive cells were detected in bone marrow (megakaryocytes and some mononuclear cells), fetal liver (hematopoietic stems cells), and the thymus (Hassall's corpuscle and some medullary thymocytes). In the kidney, the antibodies labeled a population of epithelial cells lining the calyces. Tissues which did not have detectable amounts of CIF-A/TGF-beta included the thyroid, adrenal, salivary gland, and aorta. Results presented here suggest that the factor may function in vivo as a general development and repair factor and may play a significant role in the differentiation of many cell types including chondrocytes, osteocytes, T-lymphocytes, and red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W2124755314,"Lipopolysaccharides in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria elicit toxic as well as potentially beneficial inflammatory responses in animals. It is now reported that tissue toxicity caused by lipopolysaccharides is preferentially reduced by an enzymatic activity in human neutrophils. Acyloxyacyl hydrolysis removes fatty acyl chains that are linked to the hydroxyl groups of 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl residues in the bioactive lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharides. Maximal acyloxyacyl hydrolysis reduced lipopolysaccharide tissue toxicity, as measured in the dermal Shwartzman reaction, by a factor of 100 or more. In contrast, the ability of the deacylated lipopolysaccharides to stimulate B lymphocytes to divide was decreased only by a factor of 12. It is suggested that during tissue invasion by Gram-negative bacteria acyloxyacyl hydrolysis may be a defense mechanism that reduces the toxicity of lipopolysaccharides while preserving some of their potentially beneficial inflammatory and immune stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2076466120,"Although the kidney is a major source of prorenin, the precursor of renin, there are extrarenal sources for plasma prorenin that have not been identified. The selective increase in plasma prorenin at the time of ovulation suggested that one of these sources might be the ovary. Prorenin was therefore measured in fluid aspirated from 18 ovarian follicles and in plasma collected from three women who were undergoing in vitro fertilization. The follicular fluid contained high concentrations of prorenin that were approximately 12 times higher than plasma prorenin. The prorenin from follicular fluid was immunochemically identical to kidney and plasma prorenin. Thus, the ovary is a likely source for the ovulatory peak of plasma prorenin."

https://openalex.org/W2131192326,"Myosin heavy chains are encoded by distinct members of a multigene family at different stages of muscle development. Study of the underlying regulatory mechanisms has been hindered because transitions in myosin expression have not been readily attained in tissue culture. Here we show a transition from early (fetal) to late (perinatal/adult) myosins defined by two monoclonal antibodies, F1.652 and N3.36, in the myotubes of mouse C2C12 cells. On day 1 of differentiation, essentially all myosin was early myosin. By day 8, early myosin dropped to 25% of its day 1 value and was replaced by late myosin. The transition occurred without neural contact, connective tissue components, or complex substrates, suggesting that its regulation may be intrinsic to the muscle cell. Our results demonstrate that a developmental progression in myosin gene expression, which occurs rapidly, with high frequency, and under relatively simple conditions, is now amenable to molecular analysis in cultured muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024258680,"Abstract The human invariant chain (Iγ) of class II histocompatibility antigens spans the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum once. It exposes a small amino-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side and a carboxyterminal, glycosylated domain on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. When the exoplasmic domain of Iγ is replaced by the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), CAT becomes the exoplasmic, glycosylated domain of the resulting membrane protein IγCAT∗. Deletion of the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain from IγCAT gives rise to a secreted protein from which an amino-terminal segment is cleaved, most likely by signal peptidase. We conclude that the membrane-spanning region of Iγ contains a signal sequence in its amino-terminal half and that hydrophilic residues at the amino-terminal end of a signal sequence can determine cleavage by signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1569061529,"The nuclear lamina, a structure closely apposed to the inner nuclear membrane, is believed to provide a framework important for nuclear envelope integrity and interphase chromatin organization. So far, in mammalian and avian species three major constituents of the lamina, lamins A, B, and C, have been identified. These proteins migrate to characteristic positions on two-dimensional gels, being more acidic than lamins A and C. Here, we show that the composition of the nuclear lamina in avian and mammalian cells is more complex than previously assumed. When analyzed on two-dimensional gels, the major 66-kDa chicken lamin B protein can readily be identified. However, an additional 68-kDa protein migrates to a similarly acidic position. Based on the following evidence, both proteins can be considered as two distinct members of the protein family. First, peptide mapping experiments and immunological criteria demonstrate that these two proteins are not related to each other or to A via postsynthetic modifications or precursor-product relationships. Second, as determined by immunocytochemical techniques, both proteins are located exclusively at the nuclear periphery. Third, both proteins display the biochemical properties characteristic of proteins, i.e. they are resistant to extraction of nuclei with nonionic detergents, nucleases, and high salt. Fourth, both proteins are immunologically related to previously characterized proteins: the major 66-kDa chicken lamin B protein shares at least two epitopes with A. However, contrary to what current nomenclature might suggest, this 66-kDa chicken lamin B protein is not related to rat liver B, but to a minor component of rat liver pore-complex lamina preparations that had not previously been recognized as a protein. Conversely, the minor 68-kDa component of chicken lamina preparations that had not previously been considered to be a protein is immunologically related to rat liver B. Thus, in addition to demonstrating the existence of quantitatively minor proteins in higher vertebrates, our results caution against assigning structural homologies between proteins from different species on the basis of gel electrophoresis analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2138618846,"The genes for the two subunits of the formate dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium formicicum were cloned and their sequences determined. When expressed in Escherichia coli, two proteins were produced which had the appropriate mobility on an SDS gel for the two subunits of formate dehydrogenase and cross-reacted with antibodies raised to purified formate dehydrogenase. The genes for the two formate dehydrogenase subunits overlap by 1 base pair and are preceded by DNA sequences similar to both eubacterial and archaebacterial promoters and ribosome-binding sites. The amino acid sequences deduced from the DNA sequence were analyzed, and the arrangement of putative iron-sulfur centers is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1612855301,"Mechanisms involved in stimulation of the synthesis of malic enzyme by insulin and triiodothyronine and in inhibition of synthesis by glucagon have been investigated by assessing levels and rates of synthesis of malic enzyme mRNA in chick embryo hepatocytes in culture. Insulin alone had no effect on the level of malic enzyme mRNA, whereas triiodothyronine by itself caused a 7-fold increase. Insulin plus triiodothyronine caused an 11-fold increase. Glucagon caused a 93% decrease in the accumulation of malic enzyme mRNA caused by insulin plus triiodothyronine. Although the relative changes in mRNA level are smaller in magnitude, they are qualitatively similar to the effects of these hormones on synthesis of malic enzyme, suggesting that control is exerted primarily at pretranslational steps. After addition of triiodothyronine, malic enzyme mRNA accumulated with sigmoidal kinetics, approaching a new steady state at 36-48 h after adding hormone. Puromycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the effect of triiodothyronine if added 30 min prior to the hormone and inhibited further accumulation of malic enzyme mRNA if added 24 h after triiodothyronine. However, puromycin had no effect on the level of beta-tubulin mRNA (t1/2 = 3-5 h), suggesting that the effect of triiodothyronine on malic enzyme mRNA required synthesis of a peptide. Triiodothyronine increased transcription of the malic enzyme gene by 2-fold and level of its mRNA by 11-14-fold, indicating regulation is primarily at a post-transcriptional step. Glucagon caused malic enzyme mRNA to decay with a half-life of 1.5 h, whereas alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D, inhibitors of transcription, caused the mRNA to decay with a half-life of 8-11 h. The effect of glucagon was entirely post-transcriptional because the hormone had no effect on transcription. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which triiodothyronine regulates production of a peptide that stabilizes malic enzyme transcripts in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus. Glucagon may inhibit activity of the peptide induced by triiodothyronine."
https://openalex.org/W1835872178,"The prothrombin activator from the venom of Oxyuranus scutellatus (Taipan snake) was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and ion-exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex. The activator is a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 300,000, which is composed of subunits of Mr 110,000 and 80,000 and two disulfide-linked polypeptides of Mr 30,000. One or both of these Mr 30,000 subunits contain the active site. The venom activator readily converts Factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrates and is also able to activate prothrombin (Km = 166 microM, Vmax = 2.5 mumol of prothrombin activated per min/mg of venom). Gel electrophoretic analysis of prothrombin activation indicates that the venom activator randomly cleaves the Arg274-Thr275 and Arg323-Ile324 bonds of prothrombin since both thrombin and meizothrombin are formed as reaction products. Venom-catalyzed prothrombin activation is not affected by bovine Factor Va but is greatly stimulated by phospholipids plus Ca2+ ions. This stimulatory effect is explained by a decrease of the Km for prothrombin. In the presence of 50 microM phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphatidylserine/75% phosphatidylcholine; mole/mole), the Km is 0.34 microM and the Vmax is 7.1 mumol of prothrombin activated per min/mg of venom. The purified venom activator contains gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues which presumably function in the interaction between the venom activator and phospholipids. Treatment of the activator with 0.8 M NaSCN strongly reduces its ability to activate prothrombin but has no effect on its amidolytic activity. The prothrombin-converting activity of the NaSCN-treated activator can be restored with bovine Factor Va. During prolonged gradient gel electrophoresis, the Mr 300,000 activator dissociates into smaller subunits. This causes a loss of the prothrombin-converting activity, while the amidolytic activity is recovered in a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 57,000. This protein can, however, rapidly activate prothrombin in the presence of Factor Va or in the presence of a protein component of Mr 220,000 that also migrates on the gel. These results suggest that the prothrombin activator from the O. scutellatus venom is a multimeric protein complex consisting of a Factor Xa-like enzyme and a Factor Va-like cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1634621704,"The selective binding of protein kinase C to nitrocellulose-immobilized polypeptides from rat brain and human erythrocytes was investigated. Bound enzyme was detected immunochemically with a monospecific protein kinase C antibody, or by using radiolabeled enzyme. Two polypeptides from erythrocyte membranes with Mr values of 110,000 and 115,000 bound protein kinase C in the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) and were highly enriched in the cytoskeletal fraction. A prominent protein kinase C-binding polypeptide at Mr about 115,000 was also evident in brain cytoplasm, postsynaptic densities, and nuclei. Overlays of electrophoretic blots with 14C-phospholipids revealed that the protein kinase C-binding polypeptides also bound PS but not other phospholipids. The binding of both protein kinase C and PS was markedly inhibited after phosphorylation of the Mr 110,000/115,000 polypeptides with the kinase itself. The relevance of the results to the binding of protein kinase C to membranes and to phospholipid-cytoskeletal interactions is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1584752941,"The complete primary structure of the functional site of erythrocyte protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations has been determined. The sequence of this domain, which contains 67 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 8045 daltons, has been obtained by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of an 8-kDa chymotryptic peptide, three endoproteinase lysine C-cleaved peptides and two peptides obtained by Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 cleavage. All peptides including the 8-kDa domain peptide were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Antibodies against two different synthetic peptides of the 8-kDa domain are able to inhibit the association between protein 4.1, spectrin, and F-actin, corroborating that the 8-kDa domain is responsible for the formation of a ternary complex. A computer search of the 8-kDa sequence with the National Biomedical Research Foundation database did not detect any significant homologies to known sequences. Protein 4.1 is not related to any known proteins and may represent a new protein superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1578435464,"A protein kinase that is stimulated from 2-10-fold by insulin and that phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 has been characterized in 3T3-L1 cells. The detection of this activity in the 100,000 X g supernatant is facilitated by the presence of beta-glycerol phosphate or vanadate in the homogenization buffer. The activity has been purified 55-fold by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. The resulting specific activity is 584 pmol/min/mg of protein. DEAE-cellulose chromatography followed by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA54 or by glycerol gradient centrifugation suggests that the protein has a molecular mass of 60,000-70,000 daltons. Mg2+, and to a lesser extent Mn2+, will support phosphorylation of S6 by the activity. No proteins tested other than ribosomal protein S6 are phosphorylated. Based on its chromatographic properties and substrate specificity, the enzyme appears to be distinct from several other protein kinases that are known to phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 in vitro. The complete characterization and purification of this enzyme may be essential to the elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of S6 phosphorylation by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1507353711,"To determine whether insulin activates protein kinase C in BC3H-1 myocytes, we evaluated changes in protein phosphorylation, protein kinase activities, and the intracellular translocation of protein kinase C activity in response to insulin and phorbol esters. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not insulin, stimulated the phosphorylation of an acidic Mr 80,000 protein which has been shown to be an apparently specific marker for protein kinase C activation. In addition, PMA, but not insulin, stimulated the rapid association of protein kinase C activity with a cellular particulate fraction. In contrast to these differences, both insulin and PMA stimulated the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and activated a ribosomal protein S6 kinase in cell-free extracts from cells exposed to these agents. In cells exposed to high concentrations of PMA for 16 h, protein kinase C activity and immunoreactivity were abolished, without changes in cellular morphology. Under these conditions, insulin, but not PMA, stimulated phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 in intact cells and activated the S6 kinase in cell-free extracts derived from insulin-treated intact cells. We conclude that: insulin does not appear to activate protein kinase C in BC3H-1 myocytes, at least as assessed by phosphorylation of the Mr 80,000 protein; both insulin and PMA activate an S6 protein kinase in these cells; and insulin can promote S6 phosphorylation and activate the S6 kinase normally in protein kinase C-deficient cells. Activation of the S6 kinase by insulin and PMA, although apparently proceeding through different mechanisms, may explain some of the similar biological actions of these compounds in BC3H-1 myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1496534678,"The influence of quaternary structure on glycosylation was evaluated in a macrophage-like cell line, P388D1. This cell line simultaneously synthesizes two structurally related glycoproteins, Mac-1 and LFA-1. Mac-1 and LFA-1 each contain two subunits in noncovalent association in an alpha 1 beta 1 structure. The beta-chain polypeptides of these two glycoproteins have identical primary structures while their alpha-chain polypeptides are distinct. For both Mac-1 and LFA-1, the association of the alpha- and beta-chains occurs prior to any Golgi-mediated processing of the oligosaccharide moieties on either one of the subunits. To evaluate the effects of differential subunit association on the site-specific glycosylation of the beta-chain, [3H]glucosamine-labeled oligosaccharides were isolated from the beta-chain of Mac-1 and LFA-1 and were compared by a variety of enzymatic and chromatographic techniques. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analyses of tryptic-chymotryptic glycopeptides suggest that each beta-chain has at least five glycosylation sites. Structural analysis of oligosaccharides from each corresponding glycopeptide fraction of the beta-chains of Mac-1 or LFA-1 (comparing their glycosidase sensitivities, behavior on serial lectin affinity chromatography, size heterogeneity, extent of sialylation, and branching) indicates that the LFA-1 beta-chain is glycosylated substantially differently on at least four of its sites, compared to the corresponding sites of the Mac-1 beta-chain, even though they are simultaneously synthesized in the same cells. Thus, these data demonstrate that quaternary structure can influence the site-specific glycosylation of a protein, even when the polypeptide structure and the cellular glycosylation machinery remain constant."
https://openalex.org/W1539899651,"Tropomyosin isoforms of the low Mr class were isolated from chicken intestinal epithelium and brain, and their physical and functional properties were characterized. Tropomyosin from each tissue contains four distinct polypeptides, all of about 32,000 daltons. In two-dimensional gels, brain tropomyosin contains two major and two minor polypeptides; the major epithelium isoforms coelectrophorese with the two minor brain isoforms. Conversely, only small amounts of the major brain isoforms are detected in the epithelium. Actin-binding properties of brain tropomyosin isoforms are distinct from those of the intestinal epithelium. At 2.5 mM MgCl2 and physiological ionic strength, the intestinal epithelial tropomyosin binds to filamentous actin with an apparent Ka of 8 X 10(6) M-1 whereas brain tropomyosin has an apparent Ka of 8 X 10(5) M-1. Tropomyosin from either tissue binds actin cooperatively with a Hill coefficient of 2.3 for intestinal epithelial cell and 1.95 for brain tropomyosin. Isoforms from both tissues exhibit reduced head-to-tail polymerizability as compared to muscle tropomyosin. The actin-binding properties of intestinal epithelial cell tropomyosin are therefore similar to those of the muscle tropomyosins even though the isoforms have lower molecular weight, a paracrystal structure, and reduced head-to-tail polymerizability typical of the other nonmuscle tropomyosins. These results indicate that a heterogeneity of functional properties may be expressed among the low Mr tropomyosin isoforms."

The purified recombinant TGF alpha was used to produce a monoclonal antibody that binds to active TGF alpha specifically. The antibody was coupled to Sepharose and used as an independent method for purifying active TGF alpha. The EGF receptor binding activity of antibody affinity purified TGF alpha is comparable to that of high performance liquid chromatography-purified active TGF alpha, and is 0.55 mg of EGF eq/mg of TGF alpha. The disulfide arrangement of the active TGF alpha was determined after digestion with thermolysin, and found to be analogous to the disulfide arrangement previously determined for EGF (Savage, C.

https://openalex.org/W1596934991,"Leader peptidase, an integral membrane protein of Escherichia coli, is made without a cleavable leader sequence. It has 323 amino acid residues and spans the plasma membrane with a small amino-terminal domain exposed to the cytoplasm and a large, carboxyl-terminal domain exposed to the periplasm. We have investigated which regions of leader peptidase are necessary for its assembly across the membrane. Deletions were made in the carboxyl-terminal domain of leader peptidase, removing residues 141-222, 142-323, or 222-323. Protease accessibility was used to determine whether the polar, carboxyl-terminal domains of these truncated leader peptidases were translocated across the membrane. The removal of either residues 222-323 (the extreme carboxyl terminus) or residues 141-222 does not prevent leader peptidase membrane assembly. However, leader peptidase lacking both regions, i.e. amino acid residues 142-323, cannot translocate the remaining portion of its carboxyl terminus across the membrane. Our data suggest that the polar, periplasmic domain of leader peptidase contains information which is needed for membrane assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1596670946,"Rat serosal mast cells, which synthesize only heparin proteoglycans as detected by intrinsic labeling with [35S]sulfate, were analyzed for the presence of intracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans by chemical and immunochemical means. Rat serosal mast cells of greater than 99% purity were treated with Zwittergent 3-12 and 4 M guanidine HCl, and the extracted nonradiolabeled proteoglycans were purified by density gradient centrifugation. As assessed by quantification of the unsaturated disaccharides released from the proteoglycans by chondroitinase ABC treatment, 10(6) rat serosal mast cells contained 2.4-4.5 micrograms of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Analysis of the chondroitinase ABC digests by high performance liquid chromatography revealed the unsaturated disaccharides delta Di-4S, delta Di-diSB, and delta Di-diSE which were derived from GlcA----GalNAc-4-SO4, iduronic acid-2-SO4----GalNAc-4-SO4, and GlcA----GalNAc-4,6-diSO4, respectively. The molar ratio of the monosulfated to disulfated disaccharides was approximately 2:1 with delta Di-diSE greater than delta Di-diSB. When analyzed with a mouse anti-chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibody and fluorescein-labeled F(ab')2 goat anti-mouse IgG, approximately 91% of permeabilized and chondroitinase ABC-treated cells in the mast cell preparations exhibited intracellular fluorescence, and the pattern of staining indicated that the chondroitin sulfate molecules were located in the secretory granules. The specificity of the monoclonal antibody for the unsaturated double bond created by chondroitinase ABC treatment of the proteoglycan in situ was established by the absence of fluorescence when the chondroitinase ABC step was omitted or when heparinase digestion was substituted for chondroitinase ABC. Furthermore, the ability of the anti-chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibody to mediate fluorescence in situ was markedly reduced by absorption with solid-phase chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that had been chondroitinase ABC-treated, but not by absorption with undigested proteoglycan or with solid-phase heparin. The highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of rat serosal mast cells are the same type synthesized by the rat mucosal mast cell subclass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1571503513,"The kinetics of the equilibrium exchange flux of 3-O-methylglucose (MeGlc) were examined in isolated rat adipocytes using a recently described technique (Whitesell, R.

When this technique was employed in the present study, the Km observed in basal adipocytes was 6.4 +/- 0.4 mM; insulin treatment did not affect this parameter (6.3 +/- 0.5 mM), although it increased the maximum velocity (phi max) 21-fold (from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 63.7 +/- 1.1 nmol X min-1 X microliter of intracellular water-1). The large discrepancy in the basal Km values observed in the previous (35 mM) and the present (6.4 mM) studies is shown to be associated with relatively minor differences in basal MeGlc flux; these minor differences may reflect insufficient mixing of labeled MeGlc in the flux measurements of the previous study. In addition, the active phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, at a concentration of 0.3 microM, caused a 2.8-fold elevation of phi max, with no modulation of Km. These results indicate that phi max, not Km, is the major kinetic parameter of hexose transport affected by insulin and phorbol esters, leading to enhancement of hexose uptake by the isolated rat adipocyte."

Enthalpies of reaction were measured as a function of ionic strength (0.05-0.66 mol kg-1), pH (6.4-8.8), and temperature (25-37 degrees C) in Tris/HCl buffer. The measured enthalpies were adjusted for the effects of proton ionization and metal ion binding, protonation and interaction with the Tris buffer, and ionic strength effects to obtain a value of delta H0 = -20.5 +/- 0.4 kJ mol-1 at 25 degrees C for the process, ATP4-(aq) + H2O(l) = ADP3-(aq) + HPO2-4(aq) + H+(aq) where aq is aqueous and l is liquid. Heat measurements carried out at different temperatures lead to a value of delta C0p = -237 +/- 30 J mol-1 K-1 for the above process."

https://openalex.org/W1493968530,"Two species of the elongation factor 1 (EF-1) differing in molecular weight, subunit composition, and isoelectric point have been isolated from cell-free extracts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ratio of these two forms of EF-1 activity (EF-1 alpha and EF-1H) seem to vary in different strains and upon the growth phase from which the cells have been isolated. The log phase cells of a protease negative yeast strain EJ101 show a distribution of EF-1 alpha and EF-1H in the ratio of 3:1. Another laboratory yeast strain, D-587-4B, shows a distribution pattern of 4:1. The two forms of EF-1 are completely separable by ion exchange, gel permeation, and hydrophobic and affinity chromatography. Yeast EF-1 alpha is a single polypeptide of molecular weight 50,000 and has an isoelectric point of 8.9. The newly identified form of the yeast EF-1 (EF-1H) has a molecular weight of 200,000. The isoelectric point of this protein is around 5.5. Electrophoresis of the partially purified EF-1H in polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates the presence of three nonidentical polypeptides having molecular weights of 50,000, 47,000, and 33,000. The three polypeptides are present in the ratio of 2:1:1. EF-1H is readily converted to EF-1 alpha and EF-1 beta gamma on anion exchange columns. The 50,000 dalton component of EF-1H immunologically cross-reacts with the antibody to EF-1 alpha. The other two polypeptides do not. On the basis of molecular weight, EF-1H is 2-3-fold more active than EF-1 alpha in poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis. EF-1H exchanges nucleotide (GDP----GTP) at a faster rate than EF-1 alpha. Both EF-1 alpha and EF-1H exhibit similar binding constants for GDP and GTP although the affinity of EF-1 alpha for guanine nucleotides is several-fold higher than that of EF-1H. The 33,000-dalton component of EF-1H appears to be functionally analogous to EF-1 beta (Ts) isolated from other eukaryotic sources. The function of EF-1 gamma is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1587747084,"The NH2-terminal sequence (25 residues) of amphiphilic single polypeptide chain maltase-glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.20) was determined by gas-phase sequencing. The result indicates that the NH2-terminal segment anchors the enzyme to the microvillar membrane. The single-chain form and the proteolytically processed two-chain form have two distinct active sites differing in heat stability. However, both sites are sensitive to chonduritol B-epoxide and have similar substrate specificity. The amphiphilic single-chain maltase-glucoamylase and the amphiphilic proteolytically processed form were inserted into liposomes and studied by electron microscopy. The results showed that the enzyme is predominantly present as a homodimeric complex in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1496060237,"In Escherichia coli, highly effective regulation controls the balanced synthesis of membrane phospholipids, important for optimal growth. Regulation is such that normally about 70% of a common pool of cytosine liponucleotide precursor is utilized by phosphatidylserine synthase and eventually converted to phosphatidylethanolamine, while about 30% is utilized by the competing enzyme phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase and converted to phosphatidylglycerol (25%) plus cardiolipin (5%). Although the ratio of phosphatidylglycerol to cardiolipin may vary with conditions of growth, the sum of these two lipids remains relatively constant at about 30% of the total. Alternative models, postulating coordinate regulation of the two competing enzymes, or independent feedback regulation are proposed. These models were tested in experiments in which phosphatidylglycerol was continuously removed from growing cells treated with arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-O-beta-D-glucoside), causing its conversion to arbutinphosphoglycerol (Bohin, J.-P., and Kennedy, E.P. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8388-8393.) The synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol was increased by a factor of 7 in cells treated with arbutin, with only small changes in phospholipid composition and with no significant change in the level of phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase. The synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine was not significantly increased, decisively eliminating the model that requires coordinate regulation of phosphatidylserine synthase and phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, and supporting the model of independent feedback inhibition, sensitive to very small changes in composition of cellular phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1581820157,"In the present studies we report that membrane-associated proteases in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli catalyze limited proteolysis of IIIGlcSlow. We have previously reported (Meadow, N. D., and Roseman, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14526-14537) the isolation of two electrophoretically distinguishable forms of IIIGlc, which is a phosphocarrier and regulatory protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. The two species of IIIGlc were designated IIIGlcFast and IIIGlcSlow; IIIGlcSlow is 7 amino acid residues longer than IIIGlcFast at its NH2 terminus. The majority of the protease activity is located in the outer membrane fraction from both species of bacteria, with the cytoplasmic fraction being devoid of activity. The site of cleavage is at the Lys-Ser bond located at residues 7-8 of IIIGlcSlow. The enzyme is an endopeptidase which liberates the expected heptapeptide (Gly-Leu-Phe-Asp-Lys-Leu-Lys). Both the large fragment of the limited proteolytic reaction, IIIGlcFast, and the small fragment, the heptapeptide, are stable to further proteolysis by membranes for more than 17 h at 37 degrees C. The activity in E. coli membranes has an absolute requirement for divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Ca2+) and is heat-resistant, whereas the activity in S. typhimurium membranes is stimulated by divalent metal ion and is heat-sensitive. These results suggest significant differences between the two enzymes. The physiological function of the limited proteolysis of IIIGlc is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1550983566,"We defined the amino acid sequence of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase isolated from human erythrocytes. Peptide fragments formed by cleavage at arginine, lysine, glutamic acid, and methionine were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced by manual Edman degradation. The complete primary structure of human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was established by sequence analysis of 19 peptide fragments. Presumed homology between the human and rodent enzymes was used to order fragments that had inadequate overlapping sequences. The enzyme has 179 residues with a calculated subunit molecular weight of 19,481. Mass spectrometry indicated that the NH2-terminal residue is acetylated. Human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase has sequence homology with xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase from Escherichia coli in 110-amino acid region encompassing the NH2-terminal section of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488627103,"The 4'-phosphopantetheine of chicken liver fatty acid synthase was specifically labeled with the fluorescent substrate analog coenzyme A 6-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]aminohexanoate at low salt concentrations. A serine at the active site of the thioesterase was specifically labeled with the fluorescent compounds 6-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]aminopentylmethylphosphono fluoridate and/or pyrenebutyl methylphosphonofluoridate. Dynamic anisotropy measurements indicate the thioesterase has considerable segmental flexibility, whereas the fluorescent labeled 4'-phosphopantetheine does not display detectable local or segmental flexibility. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements indicate that the distance between the fluorescent label at the end of the 4'-phosphopantetheine and NADPH bound to the beta-ketoacyl reductase or enoyl reductase site on the same polypeptide chain is essentially the same, approximately 38 A. The two types of reductases were distinguished by specifically blocking enoyl reductase with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. No significant energy transfer occurs between sites on different polypeptide chains so that the distances must be greater than 55 A. The distance between the serine on the thioesterase and the 4'-phosphopantetheine on the same polypeptide is 48 A; again no interpolypeptide chain energy transfer was observed. The distance between the serines of the two thioesterases within a fatty acid synthase molecule is greater than 56 A. The monomeric enzyme obtained at 1 degree C does not have beta-ketoacyl synthase and reductase activities. Also fluorescent titrations indicate NADPH is not bound to beta-ketoacyl reductase in monomeric enzyme. The addition of potassium phosphate to the monomers at 1 degree C rapidly dimerizes the enzyme and restores the beta-ketoacyl reductase activity. The beta-ketoacyl synthase activity is slowly restored when the dimer is raised to room temperature. The results obtained suggest that relatively large conformational changes may be part of the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1668047775,"In an effort to clarify the requirement for ATP in the recA protein-promoted renaturation of complementary DNA strands, we have analyzed the mutant recA1 protein which lacks single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity at pH 7.5. Like the wild type, the recA1 protein binds to single-stranded DNA with a stoichiometry of one monomer per approximately four nucleotides. However, unlike the wild type, the mutant protein is dissociated from single-stranded DNA in the presence of ATP or ADP. The ATP analogue adenosine 5'-O-3' (thiotriphosphate) appears to stabilize the binding of recA1 protein to single-stranded DNA but does not elicit the stoichiometry of 1 monomer/8 nucleotides or the formation of highly condensed protein-DNA networks that are characteristic of the wild type recA protein in the presence of this analogue. The recA1 protein does not catalyze DNA renaturation in the presence of ATP, consistent with the dissociation of recA1 protein from single-stranded DNA under these conditions. However, it does promote a pattern of Mg2+-dependent renaturation identical to that found for wild type recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1529146625,"Phycobiliproteins obtained by dissociation of phycobilisomes were reassociated in vitro with intact thylakoids or isolated photosystems I and II preparations obtained from cyanophytes (prokaryotes) or green algae (eukaryotes) to form bound phycobilisome complexes. Energy transfer from Fremyella diplosiphon phycobiliproteins to chlorophyll a of reaction centers I and II was measured in: complexes containing intact thylakoids of the cyanophytes F. diplosiphon or Anacystis nidulans and the eukaryotic algae Euglena gracilis and mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; complexes containing isolated photosystem II particles of A. nidulans or C. reinhardtii; and complexes containing reaction center I of F. diplosiphon or C. reinhardtii. Energy transfer from phycoerythrin to chlorophyll a of photosystem II could be demonstrated in complexes containing phycobilisomes bound to cyanophyte thylakoids or isolated photosystem II particles of A. nidulans or C. reinhardtii. Bound phycobilisomes did not transfer energy to photosystem II within green algae thylakoids containing altered forms of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex (LHC) II antenna, reduced amounts of LHC II, or chlorophyll b, or chlorophyll b-less mutants, nor to chlorophyll a of photosystem I of intact thylakoids or isolated reaction centers. We conclude that phycobilisomes can form a specific and functional association with photosystem II particles of both cyanophytes and eukaryotic thylakoids. This interaction appears to be hindered by the presence of LHC II antenna in the eukaryotic thylakoids."
https://openalex.org/W1604749834,"The aromatic H NMR spectrum of the kringle 1 domain from human plasminogen has been investigated by proton Overhauser experiments, acid-base titration, and two-dimensional chemical shift correlated spectroscopy. Spin-echo and pH response experiments lead to the identification of the N-terminal Tyr-3 phenol ring signals. The connectivities among the tryptophanyl aromatic protons have been established and sets of singlet-doublet-triplet resonances stemming from each of the two indole groups sorted according to their common side chain origin. Similarly, the four histidyl singlets have been identified and paired per imidazole group. From their pH responses, it is indicated that a histidyl (His31) and a tryptophanyl (Trp-II) residue are placed in the neighborhood of carboxyl groups. The high-field chemical shifts observed for proton resonances of the ligand epsilon-aminocaproic acid upon binding to kringle 1 indicate that the ligand-binding site is rich in aromatic components. Overhauser experiments reveal that Leu46 is surrounded by a cluster of interacting aromatic side chains, which includes Trp25, Phe36, His41, Trp62, and Tyr64, and define a hydrophobic region contiguous to the kringle lysine-binding site. Relative internuclear distances have been estimated for aromatic H-atoms in the vicinity of Leu46 by reference to one of the latter's CH3 sigma, sigma' groups. Some of the connectives have previously been found for Leu46 in kringle 4 which further supports the idea of a common structure for the homologous domains."
https://openalex.org/W1509298776,"To examine further the mechanism by which the synthesis of proteins translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is regulated in pancreatic beta-cells, the synthesis of growth hormone in islets from transgenic mice carrying the metallothionein-rat growth hormone gene fusion was studied. High glucose (17 mM) stimulated the synthesis and secretion of an apparently normally processed growth hormone. The stimulation of synthesis of growth hormone was less efficient than the stimulation of insulin synthesis in these islets, whereas the stimulation of release of labeled growth hormone paralleled that of insulin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that signal recognition particle-mediated mechanism(s) may be involved in regulating the translational efficiency of secreted proteins in isolated islets (Welsh, M., Scherberg, N., Gilmore, R., and Steiner, D. F. (1986) Biochem. J. 235, 459-467). Furthermore, in the beta-cells, growth hormone follows the normal regulated pathway of secretory granule transport and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W19230292,"Cell-free extracts from the wild type yeast strain (A364A) and from a group of noncomplementing mutants that are conditionally defective in translation were preincubated at a restrictive temperature prior to incubation at a permissive temperature for protein synthesis. Results of these experiments showed that upon exposure to the restrictive temperature (39 degrees C), all five of the noncomplementing mutants lost ability to incorporate amino acid into protein. The wild type parent strain retained better than 80% of the activity under identical conditions of heat treatment. Mutant extracts could be revived to incorporate amino acid by the addition of the purified yeast elongation factor 3. Factors 1 and 2 had no effect. The heat-treated extract from one mutant did not supplement the activity of the other mutant. Although all five of the mutants were inactivated by preincubation at 39 degrees C, each showed a variable rate and extent of thermolability. Heat-treated mutant extracts were fully active in polyphenylalanine synthesis with liver ribosomes but not with the yeast ribosomes. Since liver ribosomes do not require factor 3, this assay then confirms that factor 3 is the thermolabile component in this group of noncomplementing mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1555002267,"An oligonucleotide probe was used to isolate yeast genomic clones containing DNA sequences with repetitive elements consisting primarily of a tandemly arranged trinucleotide, CAT. Hybridization analyses estimate that the yeast genome contains 40-50 clusters, representing the first repetitive DNA sequence family found in yeast. Sequence analyses show short spacers between the repeats consisting of closely related trinucleotides, primarily CGT. Some of the clusters are located in longer repeating elements with lengths of 7 nucleotides or more. In one case a three-times-repeated 27-nucleotide sequence bears striking homology to the 21-base pair repeat region of the mammalian simian virus 40 promoter element. Hybridization studies further suggest that the CAT sequences may be widely dispersed in many diverse organisms including Escherichia coli, Drosophila, and man."
https://openalex.org/W1599122998,"Association of arginase and ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase) has been proposed to play an essential role in the regulation of arginine metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wiame, J.-M. (1971) Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 4, 1-39). In this report multienzyme complex formation is directly demonstrated in the presence of the active-site ligands for OTCase and arginase. Using equilibrium sedimentation, a dissociation constant for complex formation was determined to be 2.3 X 10(-8) M in the presence of ornithine and agmatine, active-site ligands for OTCase and arginase, respectively. A molecular stoichiometry in the complex of one molecule of OTCase to one molecule of arginase was verified using transmission electron microscopy. The dimensions of the complex were determined by negative staining and rotary and unidirectional shadowing techniques to be 102 A wide by 81 A high. These dimensions are quantitively consistent with dimensions of the individual enzymes (Duong, L. T., Eisenstein, E., Green, S. M., Ornberg, R. L., and Hensley, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12807-12813). The enzymatic activity of OTCase is virtually completely inhibited when associated with arginase, reflecting the dramatic modulation of enzyme activity as a consequence of the acquisition of quaternary structure in this multienzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W8551705,"Electron microscopic studies employing negative staining, rotary shadowing, and unidirectional shadowing have revealed the subunit architecture of ornithine transcarbamoylase and arginase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These techniques have confirmed the quaternary structure of these enzymes, and have permitted an estimate of the shape and dimensions of each of the individual enzymes as well as those of the corresponding subunits to be determined. Both enzymes are trimers exhibiting 3-fold rotational symmetry with subunits which are oblate ellipsoids of revolution. The overall dimensions determined for ornithine transcarbamoylase are a height of 39 A and a width of 102 A. The consequent subunit dimensions are 59 X 59 X 39 A, yielding a subunit axial ratio of 1.51. Arginase has a height of 42 A and a width of 97 A. The subunit dimensions are 56 X 56 X 42 A, yielding a subunit axial ratio of 1.33. The hydrodynamic behavior of the two enzymes is fully consistent with this molecular architecture, suggesting that the structures proposed here are similar to those of the proteins in aqueous solution."
