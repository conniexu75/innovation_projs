https://openalex.org/W2043819578,"Milk is the single source of nutrients for the newborn mammal. The composition of milk of different mammals has been adapted during evolution of the species to fulfill the needs of the offspring. Milk not only provides nutrients, but it also serves as a medium for transfer of host defense components to the offspring. The host defense proteins in the milk of different mammalian species are expected to reveal signatures of evolution. The aim of this study is therefore to study the difference in the host defense proteome of human and bovine milk. We analyzed human and bovine milk using a shot-gun proteomics approach focusing on host defense-related proteins. In total, 268 proteins in human milk and 269 proteins in bovine milk were identified. Of these, 44 from human milk and 51 from bovine milk are related to the host defense system. Of these proteins, 33 were found in both species but with significantly different quantities. High concentrations of proteins involved in the mucosal immune system, immunoglobulin A, CD14, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, were present in human milk. The human newborn is known to be deficient for at least two of these proteins (immunoglobulin A and CD14). On the other hand, antimicrobial proteins (5 cathelicidins and lactoperoxidase) were abundant in bovine milk. The high concentration of lactoperoxidase is probably linked to the high amount of thiocyanate in the plant-based diet of cows. This first detailed analysis of host defense proteins in human and bovine milk is an important step in understanding the function of milk in the development of the immune system of these two mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2171036736,"Background The dramatic mass mortalities amongst hibernating bats in Northeastern America caused by “white nose-syndrome” (WNS) continue to threaten populations of different bat species. The cold-loving fungus, Geomyces destructans, is the most likely causative agent leading to extensive destruction of the skin, particularly the wing membranes. Recent investigations in Europe confirmed the presence of the fungus G. destructans without associated mass mortality in hibernating bats in six countries but its distribution remains poorly known. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected data on the presence of bats with white fungal growth in 12 countries in Europe between 2003 and 2010 and conducted morphological and genetic analysis to confirm the identity of the fungus as Geomyces destructans. Our results demonstrate the presence of the fungus in eight countries spanning over 2000 km from West to East and provide compelling photographic evidence for its presence in another four countries including Romania, and Turkey. Furthermore, matching prevalence data of a hibernaculum monitored over two consecutive years with data from across Europe show that the temporal occurrence of the fungus, which first becomes visible around February, peaks in March but can still be seen in some torpid bats in May or June, is strikingly similar throughout Europe. Finally, we isolated and cultured G. destructans from a cave wall adjacent to a bat with fungal growth. Conclusions/Significance G. destructans is widely found over large areas of the European continent without associated mass mortalities in bats, suggesting that the fungus is native to Europe. The characterisation of the temporal variation in G. destructans growth on bats provides reference data for studying the spatio-temporal dynamic of the fungus. Finally, the presence of G. destructans spores on cave walls suggests that hibernacula could act as passive vectors and/or reservoirs for G. destructans and therefore, might play an important role in the transmission process."
https://openalex.org/W2143682170,"The universality of marriage in human societies around the world suggests a deep evolutionary history of institutionalized pair-bonding that stems back at least to early modern humans. However, marriage practices vary considerably from culture to culture, ranging from strict prescriptions and arranged marriages in some societies to mostly unregulated courtship in others, presence to absence of brideservice and brideprice, and polyandrous to polygynous unions. The ancestral state of early human marriage is not well known given the lack of conclusive archaeological evidence.Comparative phylogenetic analyses using data from contemporary hunter-gatherers around the world may allow for the reconstruction of ancestral human cultural traits. We attempt to reconstruct ancestral marriage practices using hunter-gatherer phylogenies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.Arranged marriages are inferred to go back at least to first modern human migrations out of Africa. Reconstructions are equivocal on whether or not earlier human marriages were arranged because several African hunter-gatherers have courtship marriages. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest that marriages in early ancestral human societies probably had low levels of polygyny (low reproductive skew) and reciprocal exchanges between the families of marital partners (i.e., brideservice or brideprice).Phylogenetic results suggest a deep history of regulated exchange of mates and resources among lineages that enhanced the complexity of human meta-group social structure with coalitions and alliances spanning across multiple residential communities."
https://openalex.org/W2037942095,"A barrier to water loss is vital to maintaining life on dry land. Formation of the mammalian skin barrier requires both the essential fatty acid linoleate and the two lipoxygenases 12R-lipoxygenase (12R-LOX) and epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX3), although their roles are poorly understood. Linoleate occurs in O-linoleoyl-ω-hydroxyceramide, which, after hydrolysis of the linoleate moiety, is covalently attached to protein via the free ω-hydroxyl of the ceramide, forming the corneocyte lipid envelope, a scaffold between lipid and protein that helps seal the barrier. Here we show using HPLC-UV, LC-MS, GC-MS, and (1)H NMR that O-linoleoyl-ω-hydroxyceramide is oxygenated in a regio- and stereospecific fashion by the consecutive actions of 12R-LOX and eLOX3 and that these products occur naturally in pig and mouse epidermis. 12R-LOX forms 9R-hydroperoxy-linoleoyl-ω-hydroxyceramide, further converted by eLOX3 to specific epoxyalcohol (9R,10R-trans-epoxy-11E-13R-hydroxy) and 9-keto-10E,12Z esters of the ceramide; an epoxy-ketone derivative (9R,10R-trans-epoxy-11E-13-keto) is the most prominent oxidized ceramide in mouse skin. These products are absent in 12R-LOX-deficient mice, which crucially display a near total absence of protein-bound ω-hydroxyceramides and of the corneocyte lipid envelope and die shortly after birth from transepidermal water loss. We conclude that oxygenation of O-linoleoyl-ω-hydroxyceramide is required to facilitate the ester hydrolysis and allow bonding of the ω-hydroxyceramide to protein, providing a coherent explanation for the roles of multiple components in epidermal barrier function. Our study uncovers a hitherto unknown biochemical pathway in which the enzymic oxygenation of ceramides is involved in building a crucial structure of the epidermal barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2071245858,"Although endosomal compartments have been suggested to play a role in unconventional protein secretion, there is scarce experimental evidence for such involvement. Here we report that recycling endosomes are essential for externalization of cytoplasmic secretory protein tissue transglutaminase (tTG). The de novo synthesized cytoplasmic tTG does not follow the classical ER/Golgi-dependent secretion pathway, but is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes, and is delivered inside these vesicles prior to externalization. On its route to the cell surface tTG interacts with internalized β1 integrins inside the recycling endosomes and is secreted as a complex with recycled β1 integrins. Inactivation of recycling endosomes, blocking endosome fusion with the plasma membrane, or downregulation of Rab11 GTPase that controls outbound trafficking of perinuclear recycling endosomes, all abrogate tTG secretion. The initial recruitment of cytoplasmic tTG to recycling endosomes and subsequent externalization depend on its binding to phosphoinositides on endosomal membranes. These findings begin to unravel the unconventional mechanism of tTG secretion which utilizes the long loop of endosomal recycling pathway and indicate involvement of endosomal trafficking in non-classical protein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1979468478,"Transposable elements (TE) usually take up a substantial portion of eukaryotic genome. Activities of TEs can cause genome instability or gene mutations that are harmful or even disastrous to the host. TEs also contribute to gene and genome evolution at many aspects. Part of miRNA genes in mammals have been found to derive from transposons while convincing evidences are absent for plants. We found that a considerable number of previously annotated plant miRNAs are identical or homologous to transposons (TE-MIR), which include a small number of bona fide miRNA genes that conform to generally accepted plant miRNA annotation rules, and hairpin derived siRNAs likely to be pre-evolved miRNAs. Analysis of these TE-MIRs indicate that transitions from the medium to high copy TEs into miRNA genes may undergo steps such as inverted repeat formation, sequence speciation and adaptation to miRNA biogenesis. We also identified initial target genes of the TE-MIRs, which contain homologous sequences in their CDS as consequence of cognate TE insertions. About one-third of the initial target mRNAs are supported by publicly available degradome sequencing data for TE-MIR sRNA induced cleavages. Targets of the TE-MIRs are biased to non-TE related genes indicating their penchant to acquire cellular functions during evolution. Interestingly, most of these TE insertions span boundaries between coding and non-coding sequences indicating their incorporation into CDS through alteration of splicing or translation start or stop signals. Taken together, our findings suggest that TEs in gene rich regions can form foldbacks in non-coding part of transcripts that may eventually evolve into miRNA genes or be integrated into protein coding sequences to form potential targets in a ""temperate"" manner. Thus, transposons may supply as resources for the evolution of miRNA-target interactions in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2002798380,"Calpain, an intracellular Ca²⁺-dependent cysteine protease, is known to play a role in a wide range of metabolic pathways through limited proteolysis of its substrates. However, only a limited number of these substrates are currently known, with the exact mechanism of substrate recognition and cleavage by calpain still largely unknown. While previous research has successfully applied standard machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict substrate cleavage by other similar types of proteases, their approach does not extend well to calpain, possibly due to its particular mode of proteolytic action and limited amount of experimental data. Through the use of Multiple Kernel Learning, a recent extension to the classic Support Vector Machine framework, we were able to train complex models based on rich, heterogeneous feature sets, leading to significantly improved prediction quality (6% over highest AUC score produced by state-of-the-art methods). In addition to producing a stronger machine-learning model for the prediction of calpain cleavage, we were able to highlight the importance and role of each feature of substrate sequences in defining specificity: primary sequence, secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Most notably, we showed there existed significant specificity differences across calpain sub-types, despite previous assumption to the contrary. Prediction accuracy was further successfully validated using, as an unbiased test set, mutated sequences of calpastatin (endogenous inhibitor of calpain) modified to no longer block calpain's proteolytic action. An online implementation of our prediction tool is available at http://calpain.org."
https://openalex.org/W2073470650,"Plumbagin, a quinonoid found in the plants of the Plumbaginaceae, possesses medicinal properties. In this study we investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity of plumbagin by using two human colonic cancer cell lines, HT29 and HCT15. IC50 of Plumbagin for HCT15 and HT29 cells (22.5 µM and 62.5 µM, respectively) were significantly different. To study the response of cancer cells during treatment strategies, cells were treated with two different concentrations, 15 µM, 30 µM for HCT15 and 50 µM, 75 µM for HT29 cells. Though activation of NFκB, Caspases-3, elevated levels of TNF-α, cytosolic Cytochrome C were seen in both HCT15 cells HT29 treated with plumbagin, aberrant apoptosis with decreased level of pEGFR, pAkt, pGsk-3β, PCNA and Cyclin D1was observed only in 15 µM and 30 µM plumbagin treated HCT15 and 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells. This suggests that plumbagin induces apoptosis in both HCT15 cells and HT29 treated, whereas, proliferation was inhibited only in 15 µM and 30 µM plumbagin treated HCT15 and 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells, but not in 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells. Expression of COX-2 was decreased in 75 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells when compared to 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells, whereas HCT15 cells lack COX. Hence the observed resistance to induction of apoptosis in 50 µM plumbagin treated HT29 cells are attributed to the expression of COX-2. In conclusion, plumbagin induces apoptosis in colonic cancer cells through TNF-α mediated pathway depending on expression of COX-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2013084840,"Several transgenic mice models solidly support the hypothesis that HER2 (ERBB2) overexpression or mutation promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, a HER2 splice variant lacking exon-16 (Δ16HER2) has been detected in human breast carcinomas. This alternative protein, a normal byproduct of HER2, has an increased transforming potency compared to wild-type (wt) HER2 receptors. To examine the ability of Δ16HER2 to transform mammary epithelium in vivo and to monitor Δ16HER2-driven tumorigenesis in live mice, we generated and characterized a mouse line that transgenically expresses both human Δ16HER2 and firefly luciferase under the transcriptional control of the MMTV promoter. All the transgenic females developed multifocal mammary tumors with a rapid onset and an average latency of 15.11 weeks. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the concurrent expression of luciferase and the human Δ16HER2 oncogene only in the mammary gland and in strict correlation with tumor development. Transgenic Δ16HER2 expressed on the tumor cell plasma membrane from spontaneous mammary adenocarcinomas formed constitutively active homodimers able to activate the oncogenic signal transduction pathway mediated through Src kinase. These new transgenic animals demonstrate the ability of the human Δ16HER2 isoform to transform “per se” mammary epithelium in vivo. The high tumor incidence as well as the short latency strongly suggests that the Δ16HER2 splice variant represents the transforming form of the HER2 oncoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2017867103,"The heterogeneity of symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has presented a significant challenge to genetic analyses. Even when associations with genetic variants have been identified, it has been difficult to associate them with a specific trait or characteristic of autism. Here, we report that quantitative trait analyses of ASD symptoms combined with case-control association analyses using distinct ASD subphenotypes identified on the basis of symptomatic profiles result in the identification of highly significant associations with 18 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The symptom categories included deficits in language usage, non-verbal communication, social development, and play skills, as well as insistence on sameness or ritualistic behaviors. Ten of the trait-associated SNPs, or quantitative trait loci (QTL), were associated with more than one subtype, providing partial replication of the identified QTL. Notably, none of the novel SNPs is located within an exonic region, suggesting that these hereditary components of ASDs are more likely related to gene regulatory processes (or gene expression) than to structural or functional changes in gene products. Seven of the QTL reside within intergenic chromosomal regions associated with rare copy number variants that have been previously reported in autistic samples. Pathway analyses of the genes associated with the QTL identified in this study implicate neurological functions and disorders associated with autism pathophysiology. This study underscores the advantage of incorporating both quantitative traits as well as subphenotypes into large-scale genome-wide analyses of complex disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2080495676,"Background Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a major cause of visual loss in developed countries. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), an eye-sight threatening complication of RRD surgery, resembles a wound-healing process with inflammation, scar tissue formation, and membrane contraction. This study was performed to determine the possible involvement of a wide range of cytokines in the future development of PVR, and to identify predictors of PVR and visual outcome. Methodology A multiplex immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection of 29 different cytokines in subretinal fluid samples from patients with primary RRD. Of 306 samples that were collected and stored in our BioBank between 2001 and 2008, 21 samples from patients who developed postoperative PVR were compared with 54 age-, sex-, and storage-time–matched RRD control patients who had an uncomplicated postoperative course during the overall follow-up period. Findings Levels of IL-1α, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, VEGF, and ICAM-1 were significantly higher (P<0.05) in patients who developed postoperative PVR after reattachment surgery than in patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course, whereas levels of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-25, IL-33, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IGF-1, bFGF, HGF, and NGF were not (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IL-3 (P = 0.001), IL-6 (P = 0.047), ICAM-1 (P = 0.010), and preoperative visual acuity (P = 0.026) were independent predictors of postoperative PVR. Linear regression analysis showed that ICAM-1 (P = 0.005) and preoperative logMAR visual acuity (P = 0.001) were predictive of final visual outcome after primary RRD repair. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that after RRD onset an exaggerated response of certain cytokines may predispose to PVR. Sampling at a time close to the onset of primary RRD may thus provide clues as to which biological events may initiate the development of PVR and, most importantly, may provide a means for therapeutic control."
https://openalex.org/W2136370295,"TP53 mutations have been associated with resistance to anthracyclines but not to taxanes in breast cancer patients. The MDM2 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T309G increases MDM2 activity and may reduce wild-type p53 protein activity. Here, we explored the predictive and prognostic value of TP53 and CHEK2 mutation status together with MDM2 SNP309 genotype in stage III breast cancer patients receiving paclitaxel or epirubicin monotherapy.Each patient was randomly assigned to treatment with epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) (n = 109) or paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) (n = 114) every 3rd week as monotherapy for 4-6 cycles. Patients obtaining a suboptimal response on first-line treatment requiring further chemotherapy received the opposite regimen. Time from last patient inclusion to follow-up censoring was 69 months. Each patient had snap-frozen tumor tissue specimens collected prior to commencing chemotherapy.While TP53 and CHEK2 mutations predicted resistance to epirubicin, MDM2 status did not. Neither TP53/CHEK2 mutations nor MDM2 status was associated with paclitaxel response. Remarkably, TP53 mutations (p = 0.007) but also MDM2 309TG/GG genotype status (p = 0.012) were associated with a poor disease-specific survival among patients having paclitaxel but not patients having epirubicin first-line. The effect of MDM2 status was observed among individuals harbouring wild-type TP53 (p = 0.039) but not among individuals with TP53 mutated tumors (p>0.5).TP53 and CHEK2 mutations were associated with lack of response to epirubicin monotherapy. In contrast, TP53 mutations and MDM2 309G allele status conferred poor disease-specific survival among patients treated with primary paclitaxel but not epirubicin monotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2163235726,"Previous studies have demonstrated that fetuin-A is related to insulin resistance among subjects with normal glucose tolerance but not patients with type 2 diabetes. There are limited data available concerning fetuin-A and insulin resistance in Chinese. We aimed to study the association of fetuin-A with insulin resistance among participants with or without type 2 diabetes in a large sample size of adults aged 40 and older.A community-based cross-sectional study was performed among 5,227 Chinese adults. The average age of our study was 61.5±9.9 years. Serum fetuin-A concentrations were not significantly different between male and female (296.9 vs. 292.9 mg/l, p = 0.11). Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of serum fetuin-A revealed a significant higher proportion of type 2 diabetic patients (34.8% vs. 27.3%, p<0.0001). In the multinomial logit models, the risk of type 2 diabetes was associated with each one quartile increase of serum fetuin-A concentrations when referenced not only to normal glucose tolerance (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43, p = 0.004) but also to impaired glucose regulation (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.44, p = 0.003, respectively), after adjustment for age, sex, community, current smoking, and current drinking. The logistic regression analysis showed that fetuin-A were associated with elevated HOMA-IR and fasting serum insulin both among the participants with or without type 2 diabetes in the full adjusted analysis. There was no significant association between elevated serum fetuin-A concentrations and impaired glucose regulation (all p≥0.12).Higher fetuin-A concentrations were associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in middle aged and elderly Chinese."

We tested the willingness of an online diabetes community to share data for public health research by providing members with a privacy-preserving social networking software application for rapid temporal-geographic surveillance of glycemic control.SN-mediated collection of cross-sectional, member-reported data from an international online diabetes SN entered into a software application we made available in a ""Facebook-like"" environment to enable reporting, charting and optional sharing of recent hemoglobin A1c values through a geographic display. Self-enrollment by 17% (n = 1,136) of n = 6,500 active members representing 32 countries and 50 US states. Data were current with 83.1% of most recent A1c values reported obtained within the past 90 days. Sharing was high with 81.4% of users permitting data donation to the community display. 34.1% of users also displayed their A1cs on their SN profile page. Users selecting the most permissive sharing options had a lower average A1c (6.8%) than users not sharing with the community (7.1%, p = .038). 95% of users permitted re-contact. Unadjusted aggregate A1c reported by US users closely resembled aggregate 2007-2008 NHANES estimates (respectively, 6.9% and 6.9%, p = 0.85).Success within an early adopter community demonstrates that online SNs may comprise efficient platforms for bidirectional communication with and data acquisition from disease populations. Advancing this model for cohort and translational science and for use as a complementary surveillance approach will require understanding of inherent selection and publication (sharing) biases in the data and a technology model that supports autonomy, anonymity and privacy."
https://openalex.org/W2048854265,"Background Canonical serine protease inhibitors commonly bind to their targets through a rigid loop stabilised by an internal hydrogen bond network and disulfide bond(s). The smallest of these is sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI-1), a potent and broad-range protease inhibitor. Recently, we re-engineered the contact β-sheet of SFTI-1 to produce a selective inhibitor of kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4), a protease associated with prostate cancer progression. However, modifications in the binding loop to achieve specificity may compromise structural rigidity and prevent re-engineered inhibitors from reaching optimal binding affinity. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, the effect of amino acid substitutions on the internal hydrogen bonding network of SFTI were investigated using an in silico screen of inhibitor variants in complex with KLK4 or trypsin. Substitutions favouring internal hydrogen bond formation directly correlated with increased potency of inhibition in vitro. This produced a second generation inhibitor (SFTI-FCQR Asn14) which displayed both a 125-fold increased capacity to inhibit KLK4 (Ki = 0.0386±0.0060 nM) and enhanced selectivity over off-target serine proteases. Further, SFTI-FCQR Asn14 was stable in cell culture and bioavailable in mice when administered by intraperitoneal perfusion. Conclusion/Significance These findings highlight the importance of conserving structural rigidity of the binding loop in addition to optimising protease/inhibitor contacts when re-engineering canonical serine protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2116966280,"DNA damage response is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing cancer by coordinating the activation of checkpoints and the repair of damaged DNA. Central to DNA damage response are the two checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR that phosphorylate a wide range of substrates. RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) was initially identified as a substrate of ATM/ATR from a proteomic screen. Subsequent studies showed that RFWD3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53 in vitro and positively regulates p53 levels in response to DNA damage. We report here that RFWD3 associates with replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays essential roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Binding of RPA to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is generated by DNA damage and repair, is essential for the recruitment of DNA repair factors to damaged sites and the activation of checkpoint signaling. We show that RFWD3 is physically associated with RPA and rapidly localizes to sites of DNA damage in a RPA-dependent manner. In vitro experiments suggest that the C terminus of RFWD3, which encompass the coiled-coil domain and the WD40 domain, is necessary for binding to RPA. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of RPA and RFWD3 is dependent upon each other. Consequently, loss of RFWD3 results in the persistent foci of DNA damage marker γH2AX and the repair protein Rad51 in damaged cells.

Originally identified from a proteomic screen for ATM/ATR substrates, RFWD3 was found phosphorylated at several conserved SQ sites in cells that were treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and replication blocking agents. Subsequent biochemical analysis revealed that RFWD3 can form a complex with MDM2 and p53 and is required for the maintenance of high levels of p53 upon DNA damage induction. The RFWD3 protein contains several well characterized functional domains as well as domains of unknown functions. The N-terminal RING finger domain is a conserved E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase domain. In vitro reactions demonstrate that RFWD3 exhibits robust E3 Ub ligase activity toward p53. In the presence of MDM2, a well characterized p53 E3 Ub ligase, RFWD3, appears to restrict MDM2 polyubiquitination activity, shifting the ubiquitination products to shorter ubiquitin chains, thus stabilizing p53. RFWD3 also contains two protein-protein interaction modules at its C terminus, namely a coiled-coil domain and three WD40 repeats. How RFWD3 participates in DDR, particularly in response to DNA replication arrest through these functional domains, is not clear. The replication protein A complex (RPA) has emerged as a central player in DDR (9Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Khanna K.K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

RPA is a heterotrimeric complex (70-kDa RPA1, 32-kDa RPA2, and 14-kDa RPA3) that is involved in many aspects of DNA metabolism in unstressed cells as well as in cells exposed to replication block and DNA-damaging agents (9Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Khanna K.K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 44: 98-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). RPA is involved in several steps of DNA replication, including origin recognition, initiation, and elongation. It also plays an important role in the early stages of DNA damage signaling cascade and is directly involved in DNA repair (11Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Zou Y. Liu Y. Wu X. Shell S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 208: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Binding of RPA to single-stranded regions of DNA is critical for the recruitment of two independent checkpoint complexes, ATR/ATRIP and Rad17-RFC2–5/Rad1/Hus1/Rad9, to sites of DNA damage, where checkpoint activation leads to the phosphorylation of Chk1 (11Zou L.

Depletion of RPA by siRNA knockdown impairs the recruitment of Rad51 to sites of DNA repair and increases sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (18Sleeth K.M. Sørensen C.S. Issaeva N. Dziegielewski J.

The phosphorylation of the 32-kDa subunit of RPA2 is well characterized in these processes. At least 10 phosphorylation sites (Ser-4, Ser-8, Ser-10, Ser-11, Ser-12, Thr-21, Ser-23, Ser-29, Ser-33, and Thr-98) and 4 kinases (ATM, ATR, DNA-PKcs, Cdk1, and Cdk2) have been suggested (25Niu H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 6028-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is shown that DNA damage-induced RPA hyperphosphorylation is critical for Rad51 recruitment and HR-mediated repair after replication block but is not essential for IR and I-Sce-I endonuclease-stimulated HR (28Shi W. Feng Z. Zhang J. Gonzalez-Suarez I. Vanderwaal R.P. Wu X. Powell S.N. Roti Roti J.L. Gonzalo S. Zhang J. Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies suggest that RPA dephosphorylation is also essential for Rad51-mediated HR and for cells to reenter the cell cycle during recovery from replication block (24Lee D.H. Pan Y. Kanner S. Sung P. Borowiec J.A. Chowdhury D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Feng J. Wakeman T. Yong S. Wu X. Kornbluth S. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5696-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), further highlighting the importance of regulating RPA2 phosphorylation in a coordinated manner. The RPA-mediated HR repair is also regulated by SUMOylation (34Dou H. Huang C. Singh M. Carpenter P.B. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 333-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa RPA1 associates with a Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease, SENP6, and is maintained in a hypoSUMOylated state during S-phase. Upon treatment with Camptothecin, an inducer of replication stress, RPA1 is modified by SUMO2/3, and this modification facilitates the recruitment of Rad51 to the damage foci to initiate DNA repair. Importantly, RPA was found as a binding partner of the annealing helicase SMARCAL1 (or HARP), a member of the SNF2 family that is mutated in Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (35Bansbach C.E. Bétous R. Lovejoy C.A. Glick G.G. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2405-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Postow L. Woo E.M. Chait B.T. Funabiki H. J. Biol.

Yokomori K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2400-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SMARCAL1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage in a RPA-dependent manner and is required for the stabilization and restart of the stalled replication fork. These new findings provide further evidence that RPA-mediated DNA repair plays a crucial role in genome maintenance. The promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are proteinaceous structures that are involved in a wide range of cellular functions including DDR. Many DDR and repair proteins including p53, MDM2, ATR, RPA, and BLM are found in PML-NBs and more frequently in cells that employ alternative telomere lengthening (40Dellaire G. Bazett-Jones D.P. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 963-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Important checkpoint proteins such as ATR and RPA that reside in PML in undamaged cells rapidly translocate to punctuate abundant nuclear foci, which represent sites of DNA damage and repair in cells that are treated with IR (41Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As both RPA and ATR function upstream in the DDR, defects in this localization are often associated with impaired checkpoint and DNA repair (4Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of RFWD3 in DNA damage checkpoint and repair. RFWD3 partially colocalizes to PML NBs during S/G2 phase and translocates to sites of DNA damage in a RPA-dependent manner. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that RFWD3 physically interacts with RPA, and the loss of RFWD3 results in attenuated RPA2 phosphorylation. Consequently, the loss of RFWD3 delays Rad51 focus formation in response to replication block and correlates with persistence of Rad51 and γH2AX foci during recovery from replication block, indicating defective DNA repair. HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in DMEM, and U2OS cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A media, all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell synchronization was performed by the double thymidine block method. The DNA sequence corresponding to the full-length protein of human RFWD3 was cloned as described in Fu et al. (8Fu X. Yucer N. Liu S. Li M. Yi P. Mu J.J. Yang T. Chu J. Jung S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Gu W. Qin J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The FLAG-RFWD3 domain deletion mutants were generated by subcloning RFWD3 into pSG5 vector (Stratagene). SFB-RPA1- and MBP-tagged RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3 construction were generous gifts from Dr. Junjie Chen (MD Anderson Cancer Center). DNA transfections were performed using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus). GST fusion proteins were purified using the glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Antibodies used are as follows: anti-RFWD3 (BL2378, Bethyl Laboratories) or Ab1 (generated and affinity-purified in-house against a recombinant fragment of amino acids 135–286 of human RFWD3), RPA1 (Ab-1, Calbiochem), RPA2 (Ab-2, Calbiochem), RPA3 (Ab-2, Calbiochem), RPA2-Ser(P)-4/8 (Bethyl Laboratories), RPA2-Thr(P)-21 (Abcam), RPA2-pS33 (Bethyl Laboratories), CHK1-pS317 (Bethyl Laboratories), γH2AX (Millipore), Rad51 (14B4, Abcam), γ-tubulin (Sigma), and FLAG (M2, Sigma). HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared from cycling or hydroxyurea (HU) (1 mm, 16 h)-treated cells. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis were carried out as described in Malovannaya et al. (42Malovannaya A. Li Y. Bulynko Y. Jung S.Y. Wang Y. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-RFWD3 (full-length or domain-deletion mutants) was incubated with SFB (S protein, FLAG, and streptavidin-binding peptide) triple-tagged-RPA1 bound to FLAG-M2 beads at 4 °C for 1 h in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After washing three times with NETN, bound protein was eluted by Laemmli buffer. MBP-tagged RPA1–3 were incubated with GST-RFWD3 on beads and analyzed in the same manner. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon or Invitrogen. The siRNA sequences for RFWD3 and RPA2 were described in Fu et al. (8Fu X. Yucer N. Liu S. Li M. Yi P. Mu J.J. Yang T. Chu J. Jung S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Gu W. Qin J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (43Wu X. Shell S.M. Zou Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), respectively. siRNA transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were washed with PBS followed by pre-extraction for 2 min in pre-extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (w/v) in PBS for 20 min. After three washes with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), cells were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in PBST. Cells were incubated with primary antibody in 2% BSA, PBST overnight and then with Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies in 2% BSA, PBST for 30 min and counterstained with 4′, 6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). GFP-RFWD3-expressing cells were cultured in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and were maintained at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled container in glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). Laser microirradiation was carried out with a pulsed nitrogen laser (Micropoint Ablation laser system; Photonic Instruments Inc.) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert200M microscope and focused through a Plan-Apochromat 63×/NA 1.40 oil immersion objective (44Uematsu N. Weterings E. Yano K. Morotomi-Yano K. Jakob B. Taucher-Scholz G. Mari P.O. van Gent D.C. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The output laser power was set at 75% of maximum, which creates double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (as confirmed by γH2AX staining) and induces accumulation of EGFP-tagged RFWD3 in living cells. Time-lapse images were acquired through an AxioCam HRm CCD camera. Previously we have shown that RFWD3 is phosphorylated by ATR/ATM in response to DNA damage, suggesting that RFWD3 is a component of DDR. To further explore the function of RFWD3 in DDR, we used a pair of U2OS-derived cell lines that stably express GFP-tagged wild-type RFWD3 or an E3-inactive RFWD3 (C315A) to monitor GFP-RFWD3 cellular localization when these cells were exposed to laser microirradiations. In untreated cells, GFP-RFWD3 localizes to both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments; upon laser microirradiation, GFP-RFWD3 rapidly accumulates to laser tracks and overlaps with DsRed-PCNA, a known component of DNA repair complex (Fig. 1A). Indirect immunofluorescence with phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX), a marker for DSB sites, confirmed that RFWD3 indeed accumulates at sites of DNA damage (Fig. 1A). Time-lapse experiments suggest that GFP-RFWD3 accumulates to laser tracks within 3 min, and the signal peaks around 10 min and gradually decreases (Fig. 1B). Similar accumulation to laser tracks was also observed for an E3 ligase-inactive mutant (GFP-RFWD3-CA), suggesting that RFWD3 E3 Ub ligase activity is not required for the translocation (supplemental Fig. 1A). Indirect immunofluorescence also revealed that in undamaged cells, a population of GFP-RFWD3 accumulates to a small number (2–20) of large, distinct nuclear bodies (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1B) that resemble the PML nuclear bodies. To confirm that the foci are indeed PML NBs, we co-stained GFP-RFWD3 with endogenous PML. Because RFWD3 levels appear to be elevated in the S-G2 phase (supplemental Fig. 1D), we enriched S-phase population by blocking cell cycle progression to G1/S transition with thymidine and examined RFWD3 localization at 4 h after cells were released to fresh media. To better observe the nuclear localization, we briefly pretreated the cells with detergent to extract the soluble proteins. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1B, the bright RFWD3 foci that were found in ∼20% of the cells colocalize with small fractions of PML NBs but not with γH2AX (supplemental Fig. 1C). Similar colocalization was also observed with co-transfected FLAG-tagged RFWD3 and Xpress-tagged PML in U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. 1F). The PML nuclear bodies have been proposed as a scaffold structure for many DDR and repair proteins (43Wu X. Shell S.M. Zou Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, these proteins such as ATR and RPA undergo dynamic translocation from PML NBs to nuclear foci that represent sites of DNA damage and repair. To determine whether RFWD3 also form DNA damage-induced foci, we treated U2OS cells with DNA-damaging agents that induce DSBs (e.g. IR and doxorubicin) or replication block (hydroxyurea) and monitored the subcellular localization of endogenous RFWD3 by indirect immunofluorescence. We co-stained RFWD3 with an antibody against the 34-kDa subunit of RPA2, as it is known to translocate from PML NBs to sites of DNA damage and regulates the recruitment of many repair proteins to these sites. As shown in Fig. 1C, RFWD3 partially colocalizes with RPA during S-phase progression in undamaged cells. In cells that are exposed to IR, RFWD3 are found in abundant nuclear foci that differ in size and number from those in undamaged cells, and these foci colocalize with RPA2 foci (Fig. 1C). In contrast, PML foci generally do not colocalize with damage-induced RFWD3 foci (supplemental Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the notion that PML NBs serve as storage sites for repair factors, which are released upon DNA damage induction (45Bernardi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Importantly, knockdown of RPA2 by siRNA abolished damage-induced RFWD3 focus formation, suggesting that RFWD3 localization to sites of DNA damage depends on RPA (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 1G). In contrast, depleting RFWD3 by RNAi does not appreciably affect the RPA foci (Fig. 1D), indicating that RFWD3 is a downstream effector that is recruited to damage sites in a RPA-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained in cells treated with HU that cause stalled replication forks (see below). Together these results strongly suggest that RFWD3 acts downstream of RPA in DNA damage signaling and repair. We are particularly intrigued with the colocalization of RFWD3 and RPA, as RFWD3 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and RPA is a key regulator of DNA checkpoint signaling and repair. We next determined whether RFWD3 physically interacts with RPA. We isolated endogenous RFWD3 complex from cycling and HU-treated HeLa cells and identified associated proteins by mass spectrometry (MS). All three subunits of RPA are among the RFWD3-associated proteins identified by MS (supplemental Fig. 2A). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting demonstrates that RFWD3 can also be reciprocally immunoprecipitated by RPA1, and the RPA-RFWD3 association is independent of DNA damage (Fig. 2A). The key functional domains of RFWD3 are the RING finger domain that possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the coiled-coil domain, and the C-terminal domain that contains three WD-40 repeats, the latter two of which are putative protein-protein interaction modules (Fig. 2B). In addition, sequence inspection reveals a cluster of SQ sites in the N terminus that is composed of three near perfect repeats of 17 amino acid residues (SSQ domain and see supplemental Fig. 2B). To map the domains of RFWD3 that mediate its interaction with RPA, we generated recombinant proteins of a series of RFWD3 domains fused with GST (Fig. 2B) and performed in vitro pulldown assays using an SFB triple tagged-RPA1 bound to FLAG-M2 beads. Domain mapping experiments show that RPA does not bind the N-terminal SSQ domain or the region encompassing the RING domain but binds strongly to the coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal WD40-containing domain (Fig. 2C). To test whether RFWD3 can directly interact with RPA, we incubated GST-RFWD3 with MBP-tagged RPA1, RPA2, or RPA3 and found that RFWD3 bound on beads is able to pull down RPA2 (Fig. 2D). Next we test which domains are necessary for HU-induced RFWD3 focus formation using a series of FLAG-tagged RFWD3 internal deletion mutants (Fig. 2B). Because RFWD3 has strong autoubiquitination activity that leads to its own degradation, we made a cysteine 315 to alanine (C315A) mutation on all fragments that contain the RING domain to ensure similar protein expression levels. We reasoned that because the full-length RFWD3-CA mutant is able to correctly localize to DNA damage sites, the increased stability as a result of the loss of E3 activity should provide a better means for visualizing RFWD3 foci. We transfected FLAG-tagged RFWD3 deletion mutants to U2OS cells and co-stained FLAG with endogenous RPA2 after cells were treated with HU (Fig. 2E). Deletion of either SSQ, Link, or RING domain has no effect on RFWD3 focus formation and its colocalization with RPA (supplemental Fig. 2C); however, deletion of the coiled-coil domain or the C terminus that contains the WD-40 repeats abolishes RFWD3 focus formation (Fig. 2E), and WD-40 alone is able to localize to RPA foci (supplemental Fig. 2C), suggesting that binding to RPA via the C terminus of RFWD3 is necessary for RFWD3 localization to sites of DNA damage. Together these results suggest that RFWD3 functions during normal S-phase progression and translocates to sites of DNA damage. RPA is the major ssDNA-binding protein in eukaryotic cells and plays essential roles in many aspects of DNA metabolism, including replication, recombination, and repair. Binding of RPA to the ssDNA region not only protects the DNA from nuclease degradation but is also critical for ATR-mediated checkpoint activation (9Richard D.J. Bolderson E. Khanna K.K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 44: 98-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the N terminus of RPA2 is extensively phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, RPA2 is hyperphosphorylated upon genotoxic stress, particularly in response to DNA replication block. This hyperphosphorylation leads to preferential interaction with DSB repair factors Rad51 and Rad52 (46Wu X. Yang Z. Liu Y. Zou Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and is necessary for the recruitment of repair factors at sites of DNA damage (28Shi W. Feng Z. Zhang J. Gonzalez-Suarez I.

https://openalex.org/W1990053148,"The protozoan parasite Leishmania is the causative agent of serious human infections worldwide. The parasites alternate between insect and vertebrate hosts and cause disease by invading macrophages, where they replicate. Parasites lacking the ferrous iron transporter LIT1 cannot grow intracellularly, indicating that a plasma membrane-associated mechanism for iron uptake is essential for the establishment of infections. Here, we identify and functionally characterize a second member of the Leishmania iron acquisition pathway, the ferric iron reductase LFR1. The LFR1 gene is up-regulated under iron deprivation and accounts for all the detectable ferric reductase activity exposed on the surface of Leishmania amazonensis. LFR1 null mutants grow normally as promastigote insect stages but are defective in differentiation into the vertebrate infective forms, metacyclic promastigotes and amastigotes. LFR1 overexpression partially restores the abnormal morphology of infective stages but markedly reduces parasite viability, precluding its ability to rescue LFR1 null replication in macrophages. However, LFR1 overexpression is not toxic for amastigotes lacking the ferrous iron transporter LIT1 and rescues their growth defect. In addition, the intracellular growth of both LFR1 and LIT1 null parasites is rescued in macrophages loaded with exogenous iron. This indicates that the Fe(3+) reductase LFR1 functions upstream of LIT1 and suggests that LFR1 overexpression results in excessive Fe(2+) production, which impairs parasite viability after intracellular transport by LIT1."
https://openalex.org/W2035551088,"We present experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of ion transport in agar gels during reversible electroporation (ECT) for conditions typical to many clinical studies found in the literature, revealing the presence of pH fronts emerging from both electrodes. These results suggest that pH fronts are immediate and substantial. Since they might give rise to tissue necrosis, an unwanted condition in clinical applications of ECT as well as in irreversible electroporation (IRE) and in electrogenetherapy (EGT), it is important to quantify their extent and evolution. Here, a tracking technique is used to follow the space-time evolution of these pH fronts. It is found that they scale in time as t(½), characteristic of a predominantly diffusive process. Comparing ECT pH fronts with those arising in electrotherapy (EChT), another treatment applying constant electric fields whose main goal is tissue necrosis, a striking result is observed: anodic acidification is larger in ECT than in EChT, suggesting that tissue necrosis could also be greater. Ways to minimize these adverse effects in ECT are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2049500929,"Enterococci are the third leading cause of hospital associated infections and have gained increased importance due to their fast adaptation to the clinical environment by acquisition of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity traits. Enterococcus faecalis harbours a pathogenicity island (PAI) of 153 kb containing several virulence factors including the enterococcal surface protein (esp). Until now only internal fragments of the PAI or larger chromosomal regions containing it have been transfered. Here we demonstrate precise excision, circularization and horizontal transfer of the entire PAI element from the chromosome of E. faecalis strain UW3114. This PAI (ca. 200 kb) contained some deletions and insertions as compared to the PAI of the reference strain MMH594, transferred precisely and integrated site-specifically into the chromosome of E. faecalis (intergenic region) and Enterococcus faecium (tRNAlys). The internal PAI structure was maintained after transfer. We assessed phenotypic changes accompanying acquisition of the PAI and expression of some of its determinants. The esp gene is expressed on the surface of donor and both transconjugants. Biofilm formation and cytolytic activity were enhanced in E. faecalis transconjugants after acquisition of the PAI. No differences in pathogenicity of E. faecalis were detected using a mouse bacteraemia and a mouse peritonitis models (tail vein and intraperitoneal injection). A 66 kb conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid encoding erm(B) (pLG2) that was transferred in parallel with the PAI was sequenced. pLG2 is a pheromone responsive plasmid that probably promotes the PAI horizontal transfer, encodes antibiotic resistance features and contains complete replication and conjugation modules of enterococcal origin in a mosaic-like composition. The E. faecalis PAI can undergo precise intra- and interspecies transfer probably with the help of conjugative elements like conjugative resistance plasmids, supporting the role of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic selective pressure in the successful establishment of certain enterococci as nosocomial pathogens."

To understand physiological roles of the three pinewood nematode AChEs (BxACE-1, BxACE-2, and BxACE-3), BxACE-3 in particular, their tissue distribution and inhibition profiles were investigated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that BxACE-1 and BxACE-2 were distributed in neuronal tissues. In contrast, BxACE-3 was detected from some specific tissues and extracted without the aid of detergent, suggesting its soluble nature unlike BxACE-1 and BxACE-2. When present together, BxAChE3 significantly reduced the inhibition of BxACE-1 and BxACE-2 by cholinesterase inhibitors. Knockdown of BxACE-3 by RNA interference significantly increased the toxicity of three nematicidal compounds, supporting the protective role of BxACE-3 against chemicals. In summary, BxACE-3 appears to have a non-neuronal function of chemical defense whereas both BxACE-1 and BxACE-2 have classical neuronal function of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2135130593,"Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized modern biology with their ability to report the presence of tagged proteins in living systems. Although several fluorescent proteins have been described in which the excitation and emission properties can be modulated by external triggers, no fluorescent proteins have been described that can be activated from a silent dark state to a bright fluorescent state directly by the activity of an enzyme. We have developed a version of GFP in which fluorescence is completely quenched by appendage of a hydrophobic quenching peptide that tetramerizes GFP and prevents maturation of the chromophore. The fluorescence can be fully restored by catalytic removal of the quenching peptide, making it a robust reporter of proteolysis. We have demonstrated the utility of this uniquely dark state of GFP as a genetically encoded apoptosis reporter that monitors the function of caspases, which catalyze the fate-determining step in programmed cell death. Caspase Activatable-GFP (CA-GFP) can be activated both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in up to a 45-fold increase in fluorescent signal in bacteria and a 3-fold increase in mammalian cells. We used CA-GFP successfully to monitor real-time apoptosis in mammalian cells. This dark state of GFP may ultimately serve as a useful platform for probes of other enzymatic processes.

The ever-growing palate of fluorescent proteins has arguably become the most widely used set of tools in cell and developmental biology. These fluorescent proteins act as markers for visualization of cellular processes, localization, gene expression patterns, and protein function. A spectrum of fluorescent proteins are now available, further expanding the multi-factorial imaging possibilities (for review see Ref. 1Shaner N.C. Steinbach P.A. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). The variously colored, split and photo-activatable fluorescent proteins (for review see Ref. 2Lukyanov K.A. Chudakov D.M. Lukyanov S. Verkhusha V.V. Nat. Reviews. 2005; 6: 885-891Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) are excellent tools for precise labeling and tracking of a variety of targets in living systems, but there is still a need for tools that can report on the functional state of the protein they interrogate. Many proteins are only activated by a post-translational event, so genetically encoded fluorophores that undergo a change in fluorescent properties in direct response to enzymatic action would meet this need. A dark-to-bright fluorescent reporter would be especially useful for reporting enzymatic activity, as the low intrinsic background would allow robust detection of even relatively rare events. Such a reporter could enable the same level of real-time, noninvasive, longitudinal studies of enzymatic activity as parent fluorescent proteins have enabled on expression and localization. In an effort to develop and characterize a dark-to-bright activatable GFP, we sought to apply our reporter to a complex biological pathway that would allow thorough characterization of the quenching mechanism and kinetics of activation both in vitro and in vivo. We ultimately selected apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is essential for embryonic patterning and vertebrate development at all stages and is causally involved in up to half of human diseases lacking suitable treatment (3Reed J.C. Tomaselli K.J. Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, methods for monitoring apoptosis longitudinally would provide a full temporal understanding of the contributions of apoptosis to tissue formation, remodeling, response to drug treatment, and disease progression. Apoptosis can be activated through an intrinsic caspase-9/apoptosome-dependent pathway or through an extrinsic, caspase-8/DISC complex-dependent pathway. Caspase-8 and -9 are apical initiators in the proteolytic cascade cleaving and thereby activating the downstream executioners, caspase-3 and -7. Cleavage of caspase-3 or -7 removes a prodomain and cuts an intersubunit linker, generating a small and a large subunit from each half of the dimer. Activated executioner caspases then cleave a select group of substrates (4Mahrus S. Trinidad J.C. Barkan D.T. Sali A. Burlingame A.L. Wells J.A. Cell. 2008; 134: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), sentencing the cell to death. Caspase activation is the fate-determining step in the irreversible onset of apoptotic cell death, so they offer the most accurate and sensitive enzymatic indicator of apoptosis. Caspases show exquisite specificity for cleaving after aspartic acid residues in well-defined recognition sequences. The recognition specificities of the executioner caspases have been extensively mapped in vitro (5Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3429-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The canonical and widely used recognition sequence comprising the amino acids DEVD remains an appropriate and selective sensor of executioner caspase activity (11Albeck J.G. Burke J.M. Aldridge B.B. Zhang M. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Executioner caspase activity can be quantified using fluorogenic peptide substrates containing a caspase-recognition sequence linked to a synthetic fluorophore, whose fluorescence is completely quenched prior to cleavage (12Berger A.B.

The synthetic nature of these peptide reporters clearly precludes their expression in living systems. A great deal of effort to date has focused on developing genetically encoded fluorescent apoptosis reporters based on cleavage by caspases. Because of the pervasive need for monitoring apoptotic cell death, several clever genetically encoded apoptosis reporters have been developed. The largest class of genetically encoded apoptosis reporters uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferCA-GFPcaspase activatable-GFPSTSstaurosporine. pairs separated by caspase cleavage sites. These reporters monitor a change in the FRET intensity upon caspase cleavage (13Chu J. Wang L. Luo Q.M. Zhang Z.H. P. Soc. Photo-Opt. Ins. 2008; 6857: R8570Google Scholar, 14Kawai H. Suzuki T.

The multimodality reporter uses copies of the caspase-recognition sequence to link a fluorescent protein, a bioluminescent protein, and a positron emission tomography reporter, which can each be more readily detected after caspase cleavage (16Ray P. De A. Patel M. Gambhir S.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 5801-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Apoliner and ApoAlertTM reporters use nuclear localization sequences to target a fluorescent protein to the nucleus following caspase cleavage (17Bardet P.L. Kolahgar G. Mynett A.

Clontech, Mountain View, CA2009Google Scholar). Apoptosis in these cells can be visualized based on changes in fluorescent protein localization. Another reporter relies on destruction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a tag for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, which can be proteolytically removed by active caspase (19Lee P. Beem E. Segal M.S. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (1289-1291): 1284-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The continued development of apoptosis reporters suggests that none to date have fully optimized brightness, sensitivity, and reporting mechanism. fluorescence resonance energy transfer caspase activatable-GFP staurosporine. An ideal apoptosis reporter would be genetically encodable, yet function in vitro, have very low background and high signal, consist of a single activatable fluorophore requiring no cofactors or additional biological processes, and be amenable to use in whole organisms, cells, microscopy, and flow cytometry. The caspase activatable-GFP we have developed meets all of these criteria. The dark-to-bright transition in direct response to enzymatic activation constitutes a new class of fluorescent reporter. The goals of this work are to develop a version of GFP in which fluorescence is fully quenched by a short peptide and characterize the mechanism of quenching and gain of fluorescence. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of quenching will not only enable use in the study of apoptosis but will also pave the way for other applications, including exploration of other enzymatic processes. The gene for dark GFP (S65T) (referred to as GFP from this point forward) was created by PCR amplifying the GFP gene using a reverse primer that also encoded the 27 amino acid quenching peptide derived from the transmembrane region of influenza M2. This PCR product was ligated into the XhoI and NdeI sites of pET21b (Novagen). A sequence encoding the linker (LEVLFQGP) was then inserted between the EGFP and M2 genes using the QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) approach. The newly inserted linker sequence was then mutated to encode the caspase-7 cleavage recognition site (DEVDFQGP). The final sequence of CA-GFP protein is GFP with the fusion of DEVDFQGPCNDSSDPLVVAASIIGILHLILWILDRL at the C terminus. This construct was used for expression and purification of CA-GFP. The CA-GFP gene was then amplified by PCR and ligated into NdeI and XhoI of the pBB75 vector (a gift from Adrien Batchelor), which has a p15 origin of replication, different than the pET family of vectors which have ColE1 origins of replication. This plasmid was used for co-expression of CA-GFP with caspase-7. The mammalian expression vectors pCA-GFP and pGFP-STOP were constructed by insertion of the CA-GFP or GFP, obtained by PCR into the NheI and EcoRI sites of pmKate2-C (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). CA-GFP from pCA-GFP was isolated and ligated into the NheI and EcoRI sites of pT-CD8-IRES-SCN2B (a kind gift from Dr. Alfred George, Vanderbilt University) to produce pT-CA-GFP-IRES-SCN2B. The resulting plasmid was cut with SalI and NotI and the coding sequence for mLumin (20Chu J. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Yang J. Qin L. Lu J. Huang Z.L. Zeng S. Luo Q. Biosens. Bioelectron. 2009; 25: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (mKate2-S158A) was inserted, generating pT-CA-GFP-IRES-mLumin. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. CA-GFP was co-transformed with either wild-type caspase-7 or the C186A caspase-7 mutant into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. 50-ml cultures were inoculated from a 5 ml dense overnight culture, allowed to grow to an A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 18 h at 25 °C. One ml of the culture was centrifuged using a tabletop centrifuge, the media was decanted and the pellet resuspended in 400 μl of a lysis buffer (0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 units DNase). The suspension was lysed by freeze-thaw and the lysate was then centrifuged using a tabletop centrifuge. 100 μl of the supernatant was analyzed on a Molecular Devices Spectramax M5 spectrophotometer, measuring fluorescence (Ex. 475 nm/Em. 512 nm) in a costar 96-well flat bottom black plate. Aliquots of the cultured and lysed CA-GFP/capase-7 expressing E. coli samples described above were reserved for immunoblotting analysis. SDS-loading buffer was added to lysate samples and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Three identical SDS-PAGE mini-gels were run. One gel was stained with Coomassie dye and imaged with a Gel Doc work station (Syngene). A second gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted using rat monoclonal anti-mouse caspase-7 antibody (Sigma) that is specific for the caspase-7 large subunit. The third gel was was also transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and and immunoblotted using a mouse IgG monoclonal anti-GFP primary antibody (Abgent). Gels immunoblotted with either anti-caspase-7 or anti-GFP primary antibodies were treated with anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase produced in goat (Sigma) and visualized using 1-StepTM NBT/BCIP (Thermo Scientific). To prepare samples of E. coli for imaging, 50 ml LB cultures of CA-GFP, CA-GFP co-transformed with inactive caspase-7, and CAGFP co-transformed with wild-type caspase-7 were inoculated from dense 5 ml overnight cultures and grown to an A600 of 0.6. They were induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown 16–18 h at 25 °C. From these cultures 1-ml aliquots were spun down for 1 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The media was decanted and the pellet was resuspended in PBS. Slides were prepared from these samples for DIC and fluorescence images taken using a Nikon Spot/E600 fluorescent microscope. All fluorescence images used the same exposure time of 150 ms. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson (BD) LSR II configured with a 488 nm blue laser and a 530 ± 30 nm bandpass filter. Samples were prepared by harvesting 300 μl of cultures expressing CA-GFP with or without wild-type or C186A caspase-7, induced overnight as described above. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended at a final concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. With BD FACS Diva Software, measurements were recorded for 10,000 cells analyzed at a rate of 200 events s−1. A gate was set to define a target population of fluorescent cells by including only events with a higher GFP intensity than cells expressing CA-GFP alone (uncleaved CA-GFP). NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutaMAX and 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals). Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. For transfection, cells were plated in 12-well plates or 35-mm dishes (70–80% confluence), cultured for 12 h and transfected with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA per 35 mm well using 6 μl Fugene HD (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For induction of apoptosis, cells were incubated with 1 μm staurosporine (STS, Ascent Scientific NJ) for a period of time as indicated in “Results.” Controls were treated with vehicle alone (0.05% DMSO). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors and treated with 1 μm staurosporine (STS) or left untreated. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and solubilized in loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 41.7 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). After being boiled for 5 min, proteins were resolved on a 5–20% gradient gel or 12% homogenous SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Primary antibodies against GFP (1:5000), caspase-3 (1:1000), and β-tubulin (1:5000) were applied. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (Clone 3F8.2) and anti-β-tubulin (Clone AA2) antibodies were purchased from Millipore, rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody from Cell Signaling (San Diego, CA) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs (West Grove, PA). Epifluorescence was performed on an inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope (TE2000; Nikon, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Qimaging, Canada) and a Plan Fluor 10×/0.30 objective using Elements imaging software (Nikon). GFP fluorescence was captured using a 515/30 filter. Time-lapse, confocal imaging was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope (Zeiss, Germany) over a 6-h period. GFP and mLumin (20Chu J. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Yang J. Qin L. Lu J. Huang Z.L. Zeng S. Luo Q. Biosens. Bioelectron. 2009; 25: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were excited at 488 nm and 543 nm, respectively, and fluorescence detected at 520/30 nm (for GFP) and 585LP nm (for mLumin) using a 40× (1.3 N.A.) oil immersion objective lens. The live cells were maintained in 12.5 mm Hepes buffered DMEM and kept at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere using heaters and a CO2 regulator. Images from the confocal microscope were manually focused and captured every 20 min using LSM 510 software (version 4.2; Zeiss). All fluorescence images were corrected by subtracting the background and analyzed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop 9.0. The ratio of green fluorescence intensity at each time point (IGt) was compared with the red fluorescence intensity (IRt) corrected for the initial intensity green:red ratio, IGt/IRt − IG0/IR0. The ratio was calculated based on the average pixel value for the whole cell, wherein IGt and IRt are the fluorescence intensities of GFP and mLumin at the indicated time point. As cells changed their morphology during imaging, the whole cell region was determined separately in each image. Manual cell counting was performed with ImageJ software using the Cell Counter plugin. More than 1000 cells were counted for both treatment and control groups. Statistics were calculated using Excel. Statistical significance was assessed by an unpaired Student two-tailed t test. Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. All GFP-based expression constructs described were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cleaved CA-GFP was obtained by co-expression of CA-GFP and wild-type full-length caspase-7 lacking the His6 tag. Flasks containing 1 liter of 2×YT media were inoculated with 1 ml of dense culture and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. The cultures were then induced using 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thioglalctopyranoside (IPTG) and the temperature reduced to 25 °C for three hours of expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by microfluidization. Clarified lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The GFP-based proteins were then purified using Co2+-affinity liquid chromatography (HiTrap Chelating HP, GE). The column was washed with a buffer composed of 50 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaH2PO4 pH 8.0. Proteins eluted using a buffer of 300 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaH2PO4 pH 8.0 and stored at 4 °C. Protein purity was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Proteins were estimated to be at least 95% pure. Wild-type caspase-7 was expressed from a plasmid comprising pET23b with full-length caspase-7 gene (21Riedl S.J. Renatus M. Schwarzenbacher R. Zhou Q. Sun C. Fesik S.W. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) (gift of Guy Salvesen). This plasmid was mutagenized by QuikChange (Stratagene) to introduce the C186A mutation. Wild-type or C186A caspase-7 were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG and allowed to proceed for 12–18 h at 14 °C. Wild-type caspase-7 was purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA superflow column (Qiagen) developed with a step gradient of 250 mm imidazole. Eluted caspases were further purified using ion exchange chromatography on a 5 ml High-Q column (Bio-Rad) with a linear gradient from 50 mm to 750 mm NaCl. The purity of all mutants was assessed by SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad) and found to be >95% pure. Samples containing 10 mm CA-GFP with or without 9 mm wild-type caspase-7 were prepared at time zero to assess the ability of caspase-7 to digest CA-GFP directly. At initiation of the reaction 100 μl aliquots of the digest and controls were added to a costar 96-well black plate, and the fluorescence was measured every 5 min (Ex. 475 nm/Em. 512 nm) for 15 h at 27 °C. The remainder of the sample was incubated at 27 °C in 15-μl aliquots to which SDS loading buffer was added at time points of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120 min, and at 15 h. These samples were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel to determine the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved CA-GFP. The percent of cleaved product was determined by quantification using GeneTools software (product version 4.00) on gels imaged with a Gel Doc work station (Syngene). To measure the absorbance spectra of the GFP chromophore, 100 ml of purified CA-GFP and GFP were buffer exchanged into a buffer containing 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7 using Millipore Ultra-free 5K NMWL membrane concentrators and diluted to a concentration of 10 μm. The absorbance spectra were collected on a Molecular Devices Spectramax M5 spectrophotometer measuring absorbance from 350–550 nm in a Costar UV, flatbottom 96-well plate (product number 3635). Purified CA-GFP and GFP samples were run on a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie stained. The bands of interest were excised and cut into 1 × 1 mm pieces and incubated in water for 1 h. The water was removed and 250 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added. For reduction the gel slices were incubated with 45 mm DTT at 50 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature the cysteines were then alkylated by incubation with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. The gel slices were washed twice with water, which was then removed and a 50:50 (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate: acetonitrile) mixture was placed in each tube, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was then removed and 200 μl of acetonitrile was added to each tube at, which point the gels slices turned opaque white. The acetonitrile was removed, and gel slices were further dried in a SpeedVac. The gel slices were then rehydrated in a 2 ng/μl solution of trypsin (Sigma) in 0.01% ProteaseMAX Surfactant (Promega): 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 21 h at 37 °C. The supernatant of each sample was then removed and placed in a separate 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Gel slices were further dehydrated with 60 ml of 80:20 (acetonitrile: 1% formic acid). The extract was combined with the previous supernatants of each sample and further purified using a micro Zip Tip (Millipore). The tryptic fragments were analyzed using matrix-assisted-laser desorption/ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) and subsequent MS/MS using a Shimadzu Biotech Axima TOF2 (Shimadzu Instruments) mass spectrometer to determine the maturity of the chromophore. The observed mass loss in GFP is due to oxidation of the Tyr-66 (loss of two daltons) and dehydration (loss of eighteen daltons) during the chromophore maturation process. Repeating structures such as α-helices and β-sheets rotate circularly polarized light differently such that the degree of protein secondary structure can be estimated from a circular dichroism spectra. Purified CA-GFP and GFP were prepared at a 10 μm concentration as described for absorbance measurements. CD spectra were measured on a J-715 circular dichroism spectrometer (Jasco) at 25 °C. The size of CA-GFP, GFP, and cleaved CA-GFP was determined by SEC using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The sample was run in a buffer of 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 8.0 and compared with molecular weight standards albumin, carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, and ribonuclease A with blue dextran 2000 used to determine the void volume of the column (Sigma product No. MW-GF-1000). Within the goal of developing a new dark-to-bright version of GFP, we sought an application area that would provide stringent activity requirements and a useful and interesting framework for characterization of the quenching and dark-to-bright transition both in vitro and intracellularly. We selected the proteolytically controlled pathway of apoptotic cell death as a first application for the dark-to-bright version of GFP. Fusion of a variety of proteins has been observed to silence GFP fluorescence (22Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nature Biotechnology. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) which led us to design a fluorescent reporter based on this quenching principle (Fig. 1A). We discovered that fluorescence of GFP (S65T) is quenched completely (0.9–1.5% of GFP fluorescence remained) when our first candidate, a 27-amino acid peptide derived from the tetrameric proton channel domain of influenza M2 protein, was fused to the GFP carboxy terminus (Fig. 1B). This full quenching proved to be an important component in maximizing sensitivity. To make a caspase activatable GFP (CA-GFP) the caspase recognition sequence (DEVD) was inserted between GFP and the quenching peptide (Fig. 1C). To assess the response of CA-GFP to active caspase, CA-GFP was expressed in bacterial cells in the presence or absence of full-length active caspase-7 or the catalytically inactive C186A mutant. Only co-expression with active caspase-7 resulted in a 45-fold increase in CA-GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1D), suggesting that caspase activity is responsible for the fluorescence increase. Fluorescence in cells and lysates was observed within 1 h and was bright after 18 h. In bacterial cells, zymogen activation of full-length procaspase-7 to mature (active, two-chain) caspase-7 occurs with similar kinetics (23Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), further supporting the conclusion that the increase in fluorescence is due to caspase proteolytic activity. The gain of GFP fluorescence in the presence of wild-type caspase-7 (Fig. 1E) correlated with cleavage of CA-GFP by caspase (Fig. 1F). Cleaved CA-GFP was only observed in the presence of active caspase-7. E. coli expressing CA-GFP alone or with caspase-7 (wild-type or C186A) were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing CA-GFP alone or with inactive caspase-7 showed no green fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas CA-GFP expressed with wild-type caspase-7 yielded cells that were visibly green (Fig. 2C). These populations are also distinguishable by flow cytometry. 90% of cells expressing CA-GFP with active caspase-7 are fluorescent, whereas fewer than 1% are green in the absence of caspase activity. While CA-GFP responds robustly to the activity of human caspase expressed heterologously in bacteria, perhaps the most significant application for CA-GFP is as a reporter of apoptosis in mammalian cells, where caspase activity governs apoptotic cell death. Treatment of CA-GFP-transfected NIH 3T3 cells with staurosporine (STS), a documented apoptosis inducer (24Belmokhtar C.A. Hillion J. Ségal-Bendirdjian E.

The mechanisms mediating these activations are dependent on the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to the intracellular region of the receptor. TNFR2 also induces TRAF2 degradation. We show that in addition to the well characterized TRAF2 binding motif 402-SKEE-405, the human receptor contains another sequence located at the C-terminal end (amino acids 425–439), which also recruits TRAF2 and activates NF-κB. In addition to that, human TNFR2 contains a conserved region (amino acids 338–379) which is responsible for TRAF2 degradation and therefore of terminating NF-κB signaling. TRAF2 degradation and the lack of NF-κB activation when both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are co-expressed results in an enhanced ability of TNFR1 to induce cell death, showing that the cross-talk between both receptors is of a great biological relevance. Induction of TRAF2 degradation appears to be independent of TRAF2 binding to the receptor. Amino acids 343-TGSSDSS-349 are essential for inducing TRAF2 degradation because deletion mutants of this region or point mutations at serine residues 345 and 346 or 348 and 349 obliterate the ability of TNFR2 to induce TRAF2 degradation.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) 5The abbreviations used are: TNFR2tumor necrosis factor receptor 2TRAF2TNF receptor-associated factor 2cIAPcellular inhibitor of apoptosisTRAKTNF receptor-associated kinase. is one of the two receptors known to bind TNF, this cytokine can be found as a transmembrane (mTNF) or a soluble (sTNF) form. Whereas both mTNF and sTNF activate TNFR1, TNFR2 is mainly activated by mTNF (1Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Löhden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K.

The fact that mTNF is the optimal activator of TNFR2 has implied serious limitations in the study of this receptor. Because the activation of TNFR2 depends on its aggregation, receptor activation can be forced by its overexpression or by the use of specific antibodies against the receptor (3Espevik T. Shalaby R.

TNFR2 lacks any intrinsic catalytic activity within its cytoplasmic tail, thus any signal emerging from the receptor depends on the recruitment of adaptor proteins. TNFR2 can bind directly TRAF2 and through this interaction signals for NF-κB and JNK activation, as the expression of a dominant negative form of the adaptor protein (TRAF2dn) can suppress both the activation of NF-κB and JNK (5Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Seven different TRAF proteins have been identified so far (6Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G.

All of them share a highly conserved TRAF domain at the protein C terminus and, with the exception of TRAF1, a N-terminal-RING finger domain followed by five to seven zinc-finger motifs (7Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 8Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). TRAF proteins were initially considered as adaptor proteins between TNFRs and the kinases implicated in the activation of JNK or IκB kinase IKK (9Häcker H. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). It was then described that TRAF proteins, because of their RING finger domain, might act as E3 ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination (10Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). In the case of TRAF2 this requires the interaction with cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) and 2 (cIAP2) (11Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that TRAF2 is by itself unable to act as a E3 ligase (12Yin Q. Lamothe B. Darnay B.G. Wu H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10558-10567Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that sphingosine 1-phosphate might act as a cofactor required for the E3 ligase activity associated to TRAF2 (13Alvarez S. Harikumar K. Hait N. Allegood J. Strub G. Kim E. Maceyka M. Jiang H. Luo C. Kordula T. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Nature. 2010; 465: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination. As for the interaction of TRAF2 and TNFR2, by using sequential truncations of the receptor cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 266–439), a sequence comprising amino acids 384 to 423 was proposed to be responsible of TRAF2 recruitment (14Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this sequence limited the TRAF2 binding motif to amino acids 402-SKEE-405 (15Boucher L.M. Marengère L.E. Lu Y. Thukral S. Mak T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). More recently, another TRAF2 binding site with a suggested negative regulatory role has been identified on the murine TNFR2 (17Grech A.P. Gardam S. Chan T. Quinn R. Gonzales R. Basten A. Brink R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31572-31581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This site comprises amino acids 433–437, and its sequence does not fit with any of the consensus motifs known for TRAF2 interaction with TNFRs. Recently it has been described that TNFR2 activation induces changes in TRAF2 subcellular localization (18Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Wu C.J. Conze D.B. Li X. Ying S.X. Hanover J.A. Ashwell J.D. EMBO. J. 2005; 24: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Upon TNFR2 stimulation, TRAF2 translocates to a Triton X-100 insoluble compartment (20Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Wicovsky A. Henkler F. Salzmann S. Scheurich P. Kneitz C. Wajant H. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1769-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) where the adaptor protein is K48-linked ubiquitinated and finally degraded by the proteasome (19Wu C.J. Conze D.B. Li X. Ying S.X. Hanover J.A. Ashwell J.D. EMBO. J. 2005; 24: 1886-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, cIAP1 interacts with the E2 protein Ubc6 thus leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TRAF2 (11Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Wu C.J. Conze D.B. Li X. Ying S.X. Hanover J.A. Ashwell J.D. EMBO.

As it has been previously mentioned, TNFR2 has no enzymatic activity within its cytoplasmic tail. Nevertheless it has been reported the activation of serine-threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases by TNFR2. Thus, it has been established the association between p80TRAK (p80 TNF receptor-associated kinase) and a region of TNFR2 comprising amino acids 354–397 (23Darnay B.G. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. FEBS. Lett. 1997; 406: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The role of this kinase in TNFR2 signaling remains to be investigated. The role of tyrosine kinases in TNFR2 signaling has not been clarified either. It has been described that TNFR2 can recruit the tyrosine kinase ETK, which interacts with the 15 C-terminal amino acids of TNFR2 (amino acids 425–439). Its activation seems to be independent of TRAF2, because overexpression of the mutant TRAF2dn does not affect ETK activation by the receptor (24Pan S. An P. Zhang R. He X. Yin G. Min W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our work has focused on the study of NF-κB signaling pathway considering both its triggering and its termination. We have found two regions within the receptor involved in NF-κB activation. Both of them recruit TRAF2 upon receptor activation. One of these regions contains the well characterized TRAF2 binding motif 402-SKEE-405. The second region identified is located on the C terminus, comprises amino acids 425–439 of the receptor and its sequence does not fit with known TRAF2 binding motifs. This region overlaps with the receptor's ETK binding site, pointing to a possible connection between tyrosine kinases and the new NF-κB activation site. We have also found that human TNFR2 contains a conserved region localized between amino acids 338 and 379 of the receptor in which amino acids 343–349 are essential for inducing TRAF2 degradation and therefore for terminating NF-κB signaling by TNFR2, also having important consequences in the signaling by TNFR1. This region contains several serine residues which are potential phosphorylation sites and partially overlaps with the p80TRAK binding region (amino acids 354–397), suggesting a possible connection between this kinase activity and the functions here assigned to the 338–379 region of TNFR2. Expression plasmids encoding human Myc-tagged TRAF2 and its mutant version Myc-TRAF2dn (lacking amino acids 1–87, corresponding to the Ring Finger) have been described elsewhere (25Darnay B.G. Haridas V. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The NF-κB reporter construct pNF-κB-SEAP encodes a thermoresistant secretable alkaline phosphatase under the control of a promoter where its minimal promoter region was complemented with four tandem copies of the NF-κB binding site (GGGGACTTTCCC) (26Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding NIK-mut, in which lysines 429 and 430 are both mutated to alanines, and plasmid encoding IκBαdn, lacking amino acids 1 to 36, were a gift from David Wallace (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Plasmid encoding TNFR1 was a gift from Bharat B. Aggarwal (MD Anderson, Houston, Texas). Expression plasmids encoding human FLAG-tagged TNFR2 (pCMV1-FLAG-TNFR2) and its deletion R2-Δ379 were a gift from B.B. Aggarwal (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas). Unless otherwise indicated, TNFR2 constructs used in this work were generated by PCR using standard methods and the primers indicated in supplemental Table S1. To generate point mutations by PCR mutagenesis, the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis kit of Stratagene was used together with the primers indicated in supplemental Table S1. The sequences of all plasmids generated in this work were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 0.13% bicarbonate, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin). For transient transfections, HEK 293 cells (2 × 105 cells/well on 6-well plates) were seeded and transfected with Lipofectamine Reagent Plus (Gibco BRL) following manufacturer's instructions. Cells and the conditioned supernatants were harvested 24–36 h after transfection. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-0.1% Tween and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (at 1:1.000 dilution in TBS-0.1% Tween) and the appropriate secondary antibody (at 1:10.000 dilution in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-0.1% Tween). Primary antibody to TRAF2 (c-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-FLAG (F3165) and anti-β-actin (A5441) from Sigma. Secondary antibodies anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG conjugated horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pCMV1-FLAG-TNFR2 or its deletions and/or mutants together with 0.3 μg of pRK-Myc-TRAF2. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of Lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/μl leupeptine, 1 μg/μl aprotinine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Two 20-μl fractions were collected as inputs for TRAF2 and TNFR2 or its variants as expression controls. The remaining 160 μl fraction was incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody at 4 °C in rotation for 1 h and then with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads in rotation at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with lysis buffer and an additional one with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl aprotinin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate), the immunoprecipitate was resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and subjected, together with inputs, to SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-TRAF2 (TRAF2) and anti-FLAG (TNFR2 and its variants). HEK 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg) and the expression plasmids specified in each case. 36 h after transfection, the conditioned medium was removed and assayed for SEAP activity as previously described (26Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The activity of SEAP was assayed on a 96-well fluorescent plate reader (Cytofluor TM 2350, Millipore). The average (± S.D.) number of relative fluorescent light units for each transfection was then determined and reported as fold activation with respect to control vector-transfected cells. The multiple sequence alignment of the intracellular region of TNFR2 from different species was generated using ClustalW (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). The alignment was edited using GENEDOC. Intracellular TNFR2 protein sequences were obtained from NCBI protein data base and corresponds to the following access numbers : gi 339758 gb AAA36755.1 (Homo sapiens); gi 55591327 ref XP_525188.1 (Pan troglodytes); gi 108997205 ref XP_001105753.1 (Macaca mulata); gi 199828 gb AAA39752.1 (Mus musculus); gi 27662550 ref XP_233644.1 (Rattus norvegicus); gi 281349276 gb EFB24860.1 (Ailuropoda melanoleuca); gi 76674315 ref XP_582626.2 (Bos taurus); gi 157427685 ref NP_001090910.2 (Sus scrofa); gi 194208037 ref XP_001489894.2 (Equus caballus); gi 73950773 ref XP_544562.2 (Canis familiaris). TNFR2 protein sequence was analyzed with NetPhos (28Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar) that produces neural network predictions for serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins. HEK293 cells were transfected with the plasmids of interest together with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-F, a plasmid expressing a farnesylated version of GFP used as a reporter of transfection. After 36 h, the cells were collected together with any floating cells in the culture media, washed with PBS first, and then with 500 μl of buffer H (20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl and 1 mm EGTA). After these washes the cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 500 μl of 0.04% digitonin in buffer H, pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer H with 200 μg/ml of RNase A and 10 μg/ml of propidium iodide for a final incubation of 30 min in the dark. The cells were analyzed in a Cytomics FC500 (Beckman Coulter) cytometer to quantify variations in the sub G0/G1 population of the transfected cells. Signaling via TNFR2 causes TRAF2 degradation (22Chan F.K. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 652-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between this phenomenon and the activation of NF-κB, we analyzed the activation of this transcription factor in several conditions in which the extent of TNFR2-induced TRAF2 degradation was controlled. Thus, increasing amounts of a mammalian expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged human TNFR2 was transfected into HEK 293 cells together with either a TRAF2 encoding plasmid or a NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (pNF-κB-SEAP). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, as the expression of the receptor increased there was a depletion of the adaptor protein so that at the highest dose assayed TRAF2 was undetectable. On the other hand, TRAF2 was easily detected in the absence of TNFR2. As for NF-κB, the highest activation was observed at low doses of the receptor, which correlates with elevated levels of TRAF2; then the extent of NF-κB activation decreased as the amount of expressed receptor increased (Fig. 1C) and again, this correlates with the lowering in the levels of the adaptor protein. With respect to receptor overexpression, two different molecular weight bands corresponding to TNFR2 were detected by Western blot. The different electrophoretic mobilities may be the consequence of post-translational modifications (N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation) experimented by the receptor (29Pennica D. Lam V.T. Weber R.F. Kohr W.J. Basa L.J. Spellman M.W. Ashkenazi A. Shire S.J. Goeddel D.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3131-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We wanted to test whether the abrogation of TRAF2 recruitment by the receptor had the same consequences in signaling than depletion of TRAF2. With this purpose we tested TNFR2 capability to activate NF-κB when the canonical 402-SKEE-405 TRAF2 binding site was abolished either by mutation (R2-SKAA) or by internal deletion (R2-Δ386–414). As shown in Fig. 2B, both the double point mutation and the deletion mutant were still able to mediate NF-κB activation although to a lower extent than the wild-type receptor. On the other hand the mutant receptor R2-Δ424 (lacking the 15 C-terminal amino acids but still carrying the intact SKEE TRAF2 binding motif) showed a reduced ability to activate NF-κB. Moreover, the mutant receptor R2-Δ403 (in which amino acids 403–439 were deleted) was the only one unable to activate NF-κB, indicating that the complete ability to activate NF-κB lies in the C-terminal half of the receptor (Fig. 2, A and B). All this led us to consider the possible existence of a novel region of the receptor capable of binding TRAF2. The results reported above raised the question of whether the R2-SKAA mutant or the R2-Δ386–414 deletion mutant were able of recruiting TRAF2 and whether these alterations were not sufficient to obliterate the binding of TRAF2 to the receptor, thus providing an explanation to the activation of NF-κB induced by the receptors carrying the double mutation or the deletion. For this purpose, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays of TRAF2 with TNFR2 and some receptor variants affecting the 402-SKEE-405 binding site (represented in Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, panel 1, TNFR2 and R2-Δ424 (both carrying an intact canonical 402-SKEE-405 TRAF2 binding motif) bound TRAF2. Mutant receptors R2-Δ386–414 and R2-SKAA, both with alterations in the canonical TRAF2 binding site, also bound TRAF2, indicating the existence of a novel TRAF2 binding site in the receptor. From the binding of TRAF2 to the mutant receptor R2-Δ386–414 and the lack of binding to the deletion mutant R2-Δ403 it can be inferred that an alternative TRAF2 binding module should be located in the region comprising the C-terminal amino acids 415–439. In this region, which sequence is 415-PETLLGSTEEKPLPLGVPDAGMKPS-439, it is included the sequence 421-STEE-424 that fits to the major TRAF2 binding consensus motif (P/S/T/A)X(Q/E)E (30Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To analyze the implication of this sequence in the novel TNFR2-TRAF2 interaction detected, we constructed and assayed the mutant receptor R2-SKAA-STAA (containing the sequences 402-SKAA-405 and 421-STAA-424). This receptor still bound TRAF2, (Fig. 3B, panel 2), indicating that the sequence 421-STEE-424 is not responsible for the novel interaction detected. Therefore, we ruled out that the sequence 421-STEE-424 within the C-terminal end of the receptor was responsible for binding TRAF2. We therefore focused our studies on the sequences 415-PETLLG-420 and 425-KPLPLGVPDAGMKPS-439. To test whether 415-PETLLG-420 was able to interact with TRAF2, we assayed R2-SKAA-Δ424, a receptor, which lacks amino acids 424–439 and carries the mutation 402-SKAA-405. This receptor did not bind TRAF2, (Fig. 3B, panel 3) indicating that the second TRAF2 binding site should be located within amino acids 425-KPLPLGVPDAGMKPS-439. To test the function of the most N-terminal amino acids of this sequence, we constructed the mutant R2-SKAA-AAA (which contains the mutations 402-SKAA-405 and 425-AAA-427) and to test the most C-terminal amino acids of the sequence we generated a mutant receptor containing the double mutation 402-SKAA-405 and deleted from amino acid A434 to the C-terminal residue (R2-SKAA-Δ434). As shown in Fig. 3B, panels 4 and 5, neither of these two mutant receptors bound TRAF2, indicating the implication of amino acids at both ends of this C-terminal sequence in the binding of the adaptor protein. We also carried out experiments studying the interaction between wild-type TNFR2 or key mutant receptors described above with endogenous TRAF2, rather than with the ectopically expressed adaptor protein. The results confirmed all the observations made with the ectopically expressed TRAF2 protein (Fig. 3B, panel 6). From our study it can be concluded the existence of a novel TRAF2 binding region in TNFR2, located at the 15 C-terminal amino acids of the receptor which fits neither the major (P/S/T/A)X(Q/E)E nor the minor PXQXT TRAF2 binding consensus motifs (30Ye H.

We next addressed the question of whether the new TRAF2 binding site was responsible for the activation of NF-κB detected in the absence of 402-SKEE-405 TRAF2 binding motif (see Fig. 2B). With this goal we transiently cotransfected TNFR2 (both TRAF2 binding sites intact), R2-SKAA (without a functional canonical TRAF2 binding site), R2-Δ424 (lacking the C-terminal TRAF2 binding site), R2-SKAA-Δ424 (with the canonical TRAF2 binding motif mutated and the C-terminal one deleted) and R2-Δ403 (with both TRAF2 binding sites deleted) either alone or together with a expression plasmid encoding mutant inactive versions of TRAF2 (TRAF2dn) and assayed them for the activation of NF-κB using the NF-κB dependent reporter plasmid pNF-κB-SEAP. As expected from our previous results (see Fig. 3), TNFR2, R2-SKAA and R2-Δ424, each one carrying at least one functional TRAF2 binding site, activated NF-κB whereas R2-SKAA-Δ424 and R2-Δ403, with no functional TRAF2 binding sites, were unable to activate the transcription factor (Fig. 4A), indicating again that TRAF2 recruitment by TNFR2 is a pre-requisite for the activation of NF-κB. This idea is further stressed because TRAF2dn abolished signaling from either TNFR2 region (Fig. 4A). It is remarkable that each region implicated in NF-κB activation signals with similar strength. The wild-type TNFR2, however, displayed an activation power that was not additive of those two components, indicating that both sites were not completely independent. We also wanted to test the functional implication of NIK and IκBα, two signal transducers classically related to NF-κB signaling pathway, in the activation of NF-κB by the C-terminal region of the receptor. For this purpose, we transiently cotransfected the expression plasmids encoding TNFR2, R2-SKAA, or R2-Δ424 with either a plasmid encoding a catalytically inactive version of NIK (NIK-mut) or a plasmid encoding a non degradable version of IκBα (IκBαdn) and assayed them for activation of NF-κB as described above. As shown in Fig, 4B, both NIK-mut and IκBαdn obliterated NF-κB activation induced by both TRAF2 binding regions in TNFR2. We therefore concluded that there are no differences between the two TRAF2 binding sites as for the pathways they use to activate NF-κB. It can also be concluded that TNFR2 activates NF-κB by both the classical and the alternative pathways. To explore the conservation status of the novel NF-κB activation/TRAF2 binding site, we made a multiple amino acid sequence alignment of TNFR2 intracellular regions from different species. The result indicates that the novel NF-κB activation/TRAF2 binding site, comprising amino acids 425 to 439 of the human receptor, is highly conserved among the species analyzed (supplemental Fig. S1). This comparison revealed another three modules which are highly conserved in addition to the NF-κB activation/TRAF2 binding sites. These three conserved modules comprise amino acids 266–285 (module I), amino acids 291–321 (module II) and amino acids 338–379 (module III). We therefore aimed at studying the possible implication of these modules in the degradation of TRAF2 triggered by TNFR2. The observations reported above led us to generate some new variants of TNFR2 with some internal deletions lacking amino acids 304–345 (R2-Δ304–345) in which module II has been partially eliminated or lacking amino acids 343–378 (R2-Δ343–378) in which module III has been eliminated, as well as others containing partial deletions from the C terminus (R2-Δ379 and R2-Δ343) as shown in Fig. 5A. We cotransfected the plasmids encoding such mutant receptors together with TRAF2 expression vector and examined their ability to trigger TRAF2 degradation. As shown in Fig. 5B, R2-Δ379 and R2-Δ304–345 were able to induce TRAF2 degradation. By contrast, R2-Δ343 and R2-Δ343–379 failed to induce TRAF2 degradation. These results indicate that the region comprised between amino acids 343 and 378 is involved in the induction of TRAF2 degradation. These amino acids are comprised within the conserved module III of the receptor mentioned above, which may therefore have an important role in TNFR2 signal transduction. As mentioned above, amino acids 343–378 of TNFR2 appear to be responsible for the degradation of TRAF2 induced by the receptor. We therefore focused on the search of the specific residues responsible of this activity. The region 343–378 of TNFR2 contains 11 serine residues (Fig. 6A) which were analyzed with the NetPhos software to predict possible phosphorylation sites. As shown in Fig. 6A, 7 of the 11 serine residues were predicted as phosphorylation sites with a score higher than 0.8. We therefore generated new mutant receptors (represented in supplemental Fig. S2A) with internal deletions within this region and also with the TRAF2 binding sites (402-SKEE-405 and 425-KPL-427) mutated (402-SKAA-405 and 425-AAA-427) so that they were unable to interact with the adaptor protein (and therefore named R2 BKO, from TRAF2 binding knock out). The analysis of their ability to induce TRAF2 degradation showed that the region comprising amino acids 343–349 is responsible of this activity (supplemental Fig. S2B). In this sequence of 6 amino acids, 4 of them are serines which are potent"
https://openalex.org/W2160596943,"Beaked whales, specifically Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) and Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), are known to feed in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. These whales can be reliably detected and often localized within the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) acoustic sensor system. The AUTEC range is a regularly spaced bottom mounted hydrophone array covering >350 nm2 providing a valuable network to record anthropogenic noise and marine mammal vocalizations. Assessments of the potential risks of noise exposure to beaked whales have historically occurred in the absence of information about the physical and biological environments in which these animals are distributed. In the fall of 2008, we used a downward looking 38 kHz SIMRAD EK60 echosounder to measure prey scattering layers concurrent with fine scale turbulence measurements from an autonomous turbulence profiler. Using an 8 km, 4-leaf clover sampling pattern, we completed a total of 7.5 repeat surveys with concurrently measured physical and biological oceanographic parameters, so as to examine the spatiotemporal scales and relationships among turbulence levels, biological scattering layers, and beaked whale foraging activity. We found a strong correlation among increased prey density and ocean vertical structure relative to increased click densities. Understanding the habitats of these whales and their utilization patterns will improve future models of beaked whale habitat as well as allowing more comprehensive assessments of exposure risk to anthropogenic sound."
https://openalex.org/W2080965109,"Methamphetamine (METH), an addictive psycho-stimulant drug exerts euphoric effects on users and abusers. It is also known to cause cognitive impairment and neurotoxicity. Here, we hypothesized that METH exposure impairs the glucose uptake and metabolism in human neurons and astrocytes. Deprivation of glucose is expected to cause neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration due to depletion of energy. We found that METH exposure inhibited the glucose uptake by neurons and astrocytes, in which neurons were more sensitive to METH than astrocytes in primary culture. Adaptability of these cells to fatty acid oxidation as an alternative source of energy during glucose limitation appeared to regulate this differential sensitivity. Decrease in neuronal glucose uptake by METH was associated with reduction of glucose transporter protein-3 (GLUT3). Surprisingly, METH exposure showed biphasic effects on astrocytic glucose uptake, in which 20 µM increased the uptake while 200 µM inhibited glucose uptake. Dual effects of METH on glucose uptake were paralleled to changes in the expression of astrocytic glucose transporter protein-1 (GLUT1). The adaptive nature of astrocyte to mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acid appeared to contribute the survival of astrocytes during METH-induced glucose deprivation. This differential adaptive nature of neurons and astrocytes also governed the differential sensitivity to the toxicity of METH in these brain cells. The effect of acetyl-L-carnitine for enhanced production of ATP from fatty oxidation in glucose-free culture condition validated the adaptive nature of neurons and astrocytes. These findings suggest that deprivation of glucose-derived energy may contribute to neurotoxicity of METH abusers."

Nevertheless, there have been only limited investigations into the enzymes that glycosylate wall teichoic acid.

Wall teichoic acids are anionic, phosphate-rich polymers that constitute a substantial portion of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Although the precise function of these polymers is unknown, they have been shown to play a role in critical cellular processes, namely cell shape determination in Bacillus subtilis (1D'Elia M.A. Millar K.E. Beveridge T.J. Brown E.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8313-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and pathogenesis in Staphylococcus aureus (2Weidenmaier C. Kokai-Kun J.F. Kristian S.A.

Of the Gram-positive organisms studied to date, most produce either a poly(glycerol phosphate) or poly(ribitol phosphate) polymer as the major wall teichoic acid (4Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The main chain hydroxyl groups on both of these polymers are subject to modification with d-alanine and glycosyl residues. The d-alanylation modification of teichoic acids has been extensively studied and has been shown to play an important role in modulating the properties of the bacterial cell envelope (e.g. in regulating resistance to certain antimicrobial molecules) (4Neuhaus F.C.

By contrast, there have been limited investigations into wall teichoic acid glycosylation, and its functional significance is unknown. The wall teichoic acid biosynthetic pathway has largely been elucidated in the Gram-positive model organism, B. subtilis 168. This organism produces a linear 1,3-linked poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer that is modified at position 2 of glycerol with d-alanine or glucose (4Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Classical genetic experiments in B. subtilis led to the isolation of the tag (teichoic acid glycerol phosphate) gene cluster for wall teichoic acid synthesis (7Mauël C. Young M. Margot P. Karamata D.

Glaser P. Minutello A. Strauch M.A. Leopold K. Fischer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15598-15606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as well as in other bacteria, such as S. aureus (5Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Together, these studies have begun to describe a model for wall teichoic acid biosynthesis and modification in B. subtilis 168. Synthesis occurs through the sequential action of several enzymes on the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane on an undecaprenyl phosphate molecule. TagO and TagA add N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate and N-acetylmannosamine residues, respectively. TagB primes the undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl disaccharide with a single unit of glycerol 3-phosphate to complete formation of the linkage unit. The polymerase, TagF, then catalyzes the addition of 30–50 units of glycerol 3-phosphate, a substrate that is provided by TagD in the activated form, CDP-glycerol. Once synthesis is complete, the polymer is exported by TagGH to the outside of the cell, where it is attached to the 6-hydroxyl of N-acetylmuramic acid of peptidoglycan by an unknown transferase and modified with cationic d-alanyl esters (Fig. 1) (4Neuhaus F.C. Baddiley J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 686-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 13Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Significant gaps still remain, however, in our understanding of wall teichoic acid synthesis, most notably in relation to wall teichoic acid glycosylation. The putative gene coding for the wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase in B. subtilis 168 was first identified using phage-resistant mutants. Mutations in tagE have been shown to be associated with resistance to bacteriophages ϕ25 and ϕ29, which recognize glucose residues on teichoic acid as a receptor (15Young F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58: 2377-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Young F.E. Smith C. Reilly B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Honeyman A.L. Stewart G.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A similar approach involving phage-resistant mutants was recently used to identify the wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase in S. aureus. An elegant transposon mutagenesis screen for resistance to phage 80 led to the isolation of tarM (18Xia G. Maier L. Sanchez-Carballo P. Li M. Otto M. Holst O. Peschel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13405-13415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Disruption of this gene led to wall teichoic acid that completely lacked N-acetylglucosamine. The wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase activity of TarM was subsequently confirmed by demonstration that crude extracts containing recombinant enzyme catalyzed the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine onto an uncharacterized membrane acceptor in vitro (18Xia G. Maier L. Sanchez-Carballo P. Li M. Otto M. Holst O. Peschel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13405-13415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Glaser and Burger (19Glaser L. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3187-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) conducted the first and only in vitro study of poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer glycosylation in B. subtilis nearly 50 years ago. This was a traditional study of multistep purification of glycosyltransferase activity from wild-type cells where the poly(glycerol phosphate) acceptor was provided in the form of membrane vesicles derived from B. subtilis. Thus, neither the enzyme nor the acceptor substrate was homogenous or unambiguously identified. Nevertheless, the TagE protein was later ascribed this activity following work using phage-resistant mutants that linked mutations in the encoding gene to the loss of glucose associated with the poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer (16Young F.E. Smith C. Reilly B.E. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 98: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have demonstrated that precise deletion of tagE results in the absence of α-glucose at the C-2 position along the poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer backbone. Furthermore, we have conducted the first biochemical study of purified, recombinant TagE with pure synthetic acceptor substrates and have shown that the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose onto a poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer acceptor at an appreciable rate in vitro. Using a robust HPLC-based assay to monitor wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase activity, we have explored the sugar donor and acceptor specificity of the enzyme and have investigated its steady state kinetic mechanism. TagE showed a strong kinetic preference for UDP-glucose as its sugar donor and utilized a sequential (ternary complex) kinetic mechanism to catalyze the addition of glucose onto acceptor substrates. This study unambiguously establishes TagE as the wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase in B. subtilis 168. Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this work are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli and B. subtilis strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.

The PCR products were purified and used as templates in a final reaction with primers tagE-a and tagE-d to create a product wherein a spectinomycin resistance cassette beginning at its translational start site and lacking a terminator was flanked by 1-kb regions surrounding the tagE locus. The 3-kb PCR product was transformed into EB6 to create a tagE deletion strain (EB2252). The resulting strain was confirmed by PCR with spectinomycin cassette-specific primers and primers designed to anneal to sequences outside the region of recombination. The ΔtagE strain was also examined for resistance to bacteriophage SPO1. A liquid culture of wild-type B. subtilis 168 and the ΔtagE strain was grown overnight at 30 °C in LB medium. An aliquot of both cultures was streaked onto an LB-agar plate to form a lawn using a sterile cotton swab, and then 10 μl of SPO1 bacteriophage was spotted onto the plate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and then examined for a clear zone of lysis. Strains were grown overnight in 100 ml of LB medium at 30 °C. Cell wall isolation and phosphate content determination were carried out as described previously (24Bhavsar A.P. Erdman L.K. Schertzer J.W. Brown E.D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7865-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Teichoic acid was released from peptidoglycan by treatment with 1% acetic acid (95 °C, 1 h). Subsequent purifications were carried out by size exclusion chromatography using a Bio-Gel P-6 column calibrated with blue dextran. The detection of carbohydrate material was accomplished using a phenol-sulfuric acid assay (25Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). One- and two-dimensional 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker NSC 600 spectrometer. The temperature was kept at 300 K in all experiments. Prior to performing the NMR experiments, the samples were lyophilized three times with D2O (99.9%). Trimethylsilyl propionate (δH 0.00, δC 0.0) in D2O was used as a reference for both 1H and 13C experiments. Orthophosphoric acid (δP 0.0) was used as the external reference for the 31P NMR experiments. The GatewayTM recombination-based cloning system and primers tagE-F and tagE-R were used to create a pDEST17-tagE vector for the expression of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged TagE. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(AI) cells (Invitrogen). The sequence of tagE inserted into pDEST17-tagE was confirmed by sequencing. E. coli BL21(AI) cells harboring pDEST17-tagE were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.8. The culture was then induced with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose and grown for 20 h at 16 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g for 15 min) and then washed with 0.85% NaCl. Cells were resuspended in purification buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) containing 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and Calbiochem Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by passage through a cell disruptor, and then the lysate was spun at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in purification buffer, and CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). The resuspended pellet was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and applied to a 5-ml Hi-Trap His column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in purification buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. TagE was eluted in a stepwise manner in purification buffer containing 25, 50, and 400 mm imidazole. Fractions were visualized by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, and pure fractions of TagE were pooled and dialyzed overnight in dialysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Following dialysis, the purified protein was separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Soluble lipid α, β, and ϕ.1 analogues were synthesized according to established methods (9Ginsberg C.

Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reactions for the synthesis of the lipid ϕ.40 analog contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm MgCl2, 100 nm TagF, and 39 equivalents of CDP-glycerol per lipid ϕ.1 analog. Lipid ϕ.n analogues ranging from 5 to 80 glycerol phosphate units were synthesized by varying the ratio of CDP-glycerol molecules to the lipid ϕ.1 analog. Reaction progress was determined by monitoring the conversion of CDP-glycerol to CMP at 271 nm by previously described methods (23Pereira M.P. Schertzer J.W. D'Elia M.A. Koteva K.P. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Brown E.D. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All reactions were allowed to proceed to near completion before being filtered through a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). A polymer containing only glycerol phosphate residues was synthesized as reported previously by incubating 4 mm CDP-glycerol with 100 nm TagF in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 30 mm MgCl2 at room temperature overnight (26Schertzer J.W. Brown E.D. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6940-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, and TagE (1–50 nm) with UDP-glucose as the sugar donor and the lipid ϕ.40 analog as the acceptor unless otherwise specified. Reactions were quenched by the addition of urea to a final concentration of 6 m. Substrates and products of the TagE reaction were separated by reversed phase chromatography on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (Canadian Life Sciences, Peterborough, Canada) with the ion pairing agent tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate. Each sample was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of buffer PicA (15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate) to PicB (15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, 30% (v/v) acetonitrile). UDP-glucose and UDP were detected by absorbance at 262 nm, and turnover was calculated on the basis of the ratio of the integrated peaks. For reactions containing UDP-[14C]glucose, substrates and products were separated on a Waters Shodex KW-803 column in buffer containing 0.1% ammonium hydrogen carbonate and 10% acetonitrile and detected by inline scintillation counting. All initial rate data were fitted by non-linear least squares regression to the equations in either SigmaPlot 8.0 or the Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970: 1-65Google Scholar). A 14C-lipid ϕ.5 analog was synthesized by incubating a lipid ϕ.1 analog (100 μm) with a mixture of CDP-glycerol (300 μm) and [14C]CDP-glycerol (100 μm at 0.01 μCi/μl) in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm MgCl2 and 100 nm TagF. Reactions were allowed to proceed to completion, and the 14C-lipid ϕ.5 analog (30 μm) was subsequently incubated with 4 mm UDP-glucose and 50 nm TagE for 3 h. Reaction progress was determined by paired ion chromatography-HPLC at 262 nm. The non-glycosylated and glycosylated 14C-lipid ϕ.5 analogues were filtered through a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then incubated with 4 mm unlabeled CDP-glycerol and 100 nm TagF for 5 h at room temperature. Reaction substrates and products were separated by size exclusion chromatography using a Waters Shodex KW-803 column in buffer containing 0.1% ammonium hydrogen carbonate and 10% acetonitrile at 0.5 ml/min. All injections contained 0.1 μCi of radiolabeled substrate, and reaction products were visualized by inline scintillation counting. To determine whether tagE codes for the wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase, we created a ΔtagE strain by allelic replacement of tagE with a spectinomycin resistance cassette. Given that tagDEF are encoded in an operon, we left the last 26 bp of the tagE coding sequence intact to ensure that the native ribosome binding site of tagF located in the 3′-end of tagE was not disrupted. Phosphate analysis showed that the ΔtagE strain contained wild-type levels of phosphate in its cell wall (Fig. 2A), confirming that there were no polar effects on tagF. Furthermore, the ΔtagE strain exhibited no major changes in morphology or growth kinetics compared with the wild-type parental strain (data not shown). We then tested both strains for resistance to bacteriophage SPO1, which recognizes glycosylated teichoic acid as a receptor (28Yasbin R.E. Maino V.C. Young F.E. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis 168 was susceptible to SPO1 phage, whereas the ΔtagE strain was resistant (Fig. 2B). This strongly suggests that deletion of tagE leads to the loss of glucose along the wall teichoic acid polymer. To confirm this, we isolated wall teichoic acid from B. subtilis 168 and the ΔtagE strain and analyzed the polymers by 1H NMR. As shown in Fig. 2C, the 1H NMR spectrum revealed an anomeric proton signal at δ5.07 (J1,2 2.1 Hz) that could be assigned to α-glucose at the C-2 position in wall teichoic acid isolated from wild-type B. subtilis 168. This finding is consistent with the previous stereochemical assignment of the glucose linkage (19Glaser L. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3187-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, this signal was absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of wall teichoic acid from the ΔtagE strain (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that tagE is involved in wall teichoic acid glycosylation in B. subtilis 168. Having confirmed a role for TagE in wall teichoic acid glycosylation, we sought to investigate the activity of the enzyme in vitro. The reaction catalyzed by TagE in our in vitro assay is depicted in Scheme 1. Recombinant TagE that had been purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S1) was incubated with the activated sugar donor UDP-glucose and a soluble analog of lipid ϕ.40, the product of the TagF reaction. The nomenclature of lipid-linked teichoic acid intermediates is summarized in Table 2 (29Pereira M.P. Brown E.D. Moran A.B. Hoist P. Itzstein O. Microbial Glycobiology: Structures, Relevance and Applications. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2008: 337-350Google Scholar). The lipid ϕ.40 analog consists of 40 glycerol phosphate units that are in a 1,3-linkage and attached to a lipid ϕ.1 analog. We chose to synthesize a poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer of this length given that wall teichoic acid polymers in the cell wall of B. subtilis 168 typically contain 30–50 units of glycerol phosphate (12Schertzer J.W. Brown E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose onto the lipid ϕ.40 analog was monitored using an HPLC-based assay that measures UDP production. Using radiolabeled UDP-[14C]glucose, we confirmed that the production of UDP in this assay was stoichiometric with the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose onto the acceptor (data not shown). We took great care to ensure that, under our assay conditions, the lipid ϕ.40 analog-dependent production of UDP was linear with both time and the amount of enzyme added (Fig. 3). By analyzing the dependence of the reaction velocity on enzyme concentration, we estimated a turnover of 16 s−1 for TagE under conditions where both substrates were saturating.TABLE 2Nomenclature for wall teichoic acid intermediates (29Pereira M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2138385666,"Archaeologists and anthropologists have long recognized that different cultural complexes may have distinct descent histories, but they have lacked analytical techniques capable of easily identifying such incongruence. Here, we show how bayesian phylogenetic analysis can be used to identify incongruent cultural histories. We employ the approach to investigate Iranian tribal textile traditions.We used bayes factor comparisons in a phylogenetic framework to test two models of cultural evolution: the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis and the multiple coherent units hypothesis. In the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis, a core tradition of characters evolves through descent with modification and characters peripheral to the core are exchanged among contemporaneous populations. In the multiple coherent units hypothesis, a core tradition does not exist. Rather, there are several cultural units consisting of sets of characters that have different histories of descent.For the Iranian textiles, the bayesian phylogenetic analyses supported the multiple coherent units hypothesis over the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis. Our analyses suggest that pile-weave designs represent a distinct cultural unit that has a different phylogenetic history compared to other textile characters.The results from the Iranian textiles are consistent with the available ethnographic evidence, which suggests that the commercial rug market has influenced pile-rug designs but not the techniques or designs incorporated in the other textiles produced by the tribes. We anticipate that bayesian phylogenetic tests for inferring cultural units will be of great value for researchers interested in studying the evolution of cultural traits including language, behavior, and material culture."
https://openalex.org/W2058578438,"The Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) affects mainly small cerebral arteries and leads to disability and dementia. The relationship between clinical expression of the disease and progression of the microvessel pathology is, however, uncertain as we lack tools for imaging brain vessels in vivo. Ophthalmoscopy is regarded as a window into the cerebral microcirculation. In this study we carried out an ophthalmoscopic examination in subjects with CADASIL. Specifically, we performed fractal analysis of digital retinal photographs. Data are expressed as mean fractal dimension (mean-D), a parameter that reflects complexity of the retinal vessel branching. Ten subjects with genetically confirmed diagnosis of CADASIL and 10 sex and age-matched control subjects were enrolled. Fractal analysis of retinal digital images was performed by means of a computer-based program, and the data expressed as mean-D. Brain MRI lesion volume in FLAIR and T1-weighted images was assessed using MIPAV software. Paired t-test was used to disclose differences in mean-D between CADASIL and control groups. Spearman rank analysis was performed to evaluate potential associations between mean-D values and both disease duration and disease severity, the latter expressed as brain MRI lesion volumes, in the subjects with CADASIL. The results showed that mean-D value of patients (1.42±0.05; mean±SD) was lower than control (1.50±0.04; p = 0.002). Mean-D did not correlate with disease duration nor with MRI lesion volumes of the subjects with CADASIL. The findings suggest that fractal analysis is a sensitive tool to assess changes of retinal vessel branching, likely reflecting early brain microvessel alterations, in CADASIL patients."
https://openalex.org/W2036190197,"Due to a problem of identification, how to estimate the distinct effects of age, time period and cohort has been a controversial issue in the analysis of trends in health outcomes in epidemiology. In this study, we propose a novel approach, partial least squares (PLS) analysis, to separate the effects of age, period, and cohort. Our example for illustration is taken from the Glasgow Alumni cohort. A total of 15,322 students (11,755 men and 3,567 women) received medical screening at the Glasgow University between 1948 and 1968. The aim is to investigate the secular trends in blood pressure over 1925 and 1950 while taking into account the year of examination and age at examination. We excluded students born before 1925 or aged over 25 years at examination and those with missing values in confounders from the analyses, resulting in 12,546 and 12,516 students for analysis of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. PLS analysis shows that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with students' age, and students born later had on average lower blood pressure (SBP: -0.17 mmHg/per year [95% confidence intervals: -0.19 to -0.15] for men and -0.25 [-0.28 to -0.22] for women; DBP: -0.14 [-0.15 to -0.13] for men; -0.09 [-0.11 to -0.07] for women). PLS also shows a decreasing trend in blood pressure over the examination period. As identification is not a problem for PLS, it provides a flexible modelling strategy for age-period-cohort analysis. More emphasis is then required to clarify the substantive and conceptual issues surrounding the definitions and interpretations of age, period and cohort effects."

This study further elucidates the involvement of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). Initially, we demonstrated a marked increase in nuclear C/EBPβ-liver-enriched activating protein* (LAP*)/liver-enriched activating protein (LAP) levels and LAP/liver-enriched inhibiting protein (LIP) ratios in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated differentiating THP-1 premonocytic cells accompanied by reduced proliferation. To directly study C/EBPβ effects on monocytic cells, we generated novel THP-1-derived (low endogenous C/EBPβ) cell lines stably overexpressing C/EBPβ isoforms. Most importantly, cells predominantly overexpressing LAP* (C/EBPβ-long), but not those overexpressing LIP (C/EBPβ-short), exhibited a reduced proliferation, with no effect on morphology. PMA-induced inhibition of proliferation was attenuated in C/EBPβ-short cells. In C/EBPβ(WT) macrophage-like cells (high endogenous C/EBPβ), we measured a reduced proliferation/cycling index compared with C/EBPβ(KO). The typical macrophage morphology was only observed in C/EBPβ(WT), whereas C/EBPβ(KO) stayed round. C/EBPα did not compensate for C/EBPβ effects on proliferation/morphology. Serum reduction, an independent approach known to inhibit proliferation, induced macrophage morphology in C/EBPβ(KO) macrophage-like cells but not THP-1. In PMA-treated THP-1 and C/EBPβ-long cells, a reduced phosphorylation of cell cycle repressor retinoblastoma was found. In addition, C/EBPβ-long cells showed reduced c-Myc expression accompanied by increased CDK inhibitor p27 and reduced cyclin D1 levels. Finally, C/EBPβ-long and C/EBPβ(WT) cells exhibited low E2F1 and cyclin E levels, and C/EBPβ overexpression was found to inhibit cyclin E1 promoter-dependent transcription. Our results suggest that C/EBPβ reduces monocytic proliferation by affecting the retinoblastoma/E2F/cyclin E pathway and that it may contribute to, but is not directly required for, macrophage morphology. Inhibition of proliferation by C/EBPβ may be important for coordinated monocytic differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1999794717,"Peak bone mass, attained by early adulthood, is influenced by genetic and life-style factors. Early infant feeding and duration of breastfeeding in particular, associate with several health-related parameters in childhood. The aim of this study was to examine whether the effects of early infant feeding extend to peak bone mass and other bone health characteristics at adult age.A cohort of 158 adults (76 males) born in Helsinki, Finland, 1975, prospectively followed up from birth, underwent physical examination and bone densitometry to study bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) at 32 years of age. Life-style factors relevant for bone health were recorded. For data analysis the cohort was divided into three equal-size groups according to the total duration of breastfeeding (BF): Short (≤3 months), Intermediate and Prolonged (≥7 months) BF groups. In males short BF is associated with higher bone area, BMC, and BMD compared to longer BF. Males in the Short BF group had on average 4.7% higher whole body BMD than males in the Prolonged BF group. In multivariate analysis, after controlling for multiple confounding factors, the influence of BF duration on adult bone characteristics persisted in males. Differences between the three feeding groups were observed in lumbar spine bone area and BMC, and whole body BMD (MANCOVA; p = 0.025, p = 0.013, and p = 0.048, respectively), favoring the Short BF group. In women no differences were observed.In men, early infant milk feeding may have a significant impact on adult bone health. A potential explanation is that the calcium and phosphate contents were strikingly higher in formula milk and commercial cow milk/cow milk dilutions as opposed to human milk. Our novel finding merits further studies to determine means to ensure optimal bone mass development in infants with prolonged breastfeeding."

Methodology/Principal Findings We identified a tag SNP for the CCL2/MCP-1 gene (rs4586 C/T). In order to understand whether this SNP may serve to evaluate the contribution of the CCL2 gene to the expression of TB disease, we further analysed distribution of its alleles and genotypes in 301 TB cases versus 338 non-infected controls (all BCG vaccinated) representing a high-risk pediatric population of North China. In the male TB subgroup, the C allele was identified in a higher rate (P = 0.045), and, acting dominantly, was found to be a risk factor for clinical TB (P = 0.029). Homozygous TT genotype was significantly associated with lower CSF mononuclear leukocyte (ML) counts in patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) (P = 0.001). Conclusions/Significance The present study found an association of the CCL2 tag SNP rs4586 C allele and pediatric TB disease in males, suggesting that gender may affect the susceptibility to TB even in children. The association of homozygous TT genotype with decreased CSF mononuclear leukocyte (ML) count not only suggests a clinical significance of this SNP, but indicates its potential to assist in the clinical assessment of suspected TBM, where delay is critical and diagnosis is difficult."

The association and clinical relevance of a combined assessment of Hcy and CRP levels in patients with PD and vascular parkinsonism (VP) are unknown.We performed a cross-sectional study of 88 Chinese patients with PD and VP using a clinical interview and the measurement of plasma Hcy and CRP to determine if Hcy and CRP levels in patients may predict the outcomes of the motor status, non-motor symptoms (NMS), disease severity, and cognitive declines. Each patient's NMS, cognitive deficit, disease severity, and motor status were assessed by the Nonmotor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the modified Hoehn and Yahr staging scale (H&Y), and the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale part III (UPDRS III), respectively. We found that 100% of patients with PD and VP presented with NMS. The UPDRS III significantly correlated with CRP (P = 0.011) and NMSS (P = 0.042) in PD patients. The H&Y was also correlated with Hcy (P = 0.002), CRP (P = 0.000), and NMSS (P = 0.023) in PD patients. In VP patients, the UPDRS III and H&Y were not significantly associated with NMSS, Hcy, CRP, or MMSE. Strong correlations were observed between Hcy and NMSS as well as between CRP and NMSS in PD and VP.Our findings support the hypothesis that Hcy and CRP play important roles in the pathogenesis of PD. The combination of Hcy and CRP may be used to assess the progression of PD and VP. Whether or not anti-inflammatory medication could be used in the management of PD and VP will produce an interesting topic for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2026482993,"Several areas of the brain are known to participate in temporal processing. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to contribute to perception of time intervals. However, it remains unclear whether the PFC itself can generate time intervals independently of external stimuli. Here we describe a group of PFC neurons in area 9 that became active when monkeys recognized a particular elapsed time within the range of 1–7 seconds. Another group of area 9 neurons became active only when subjects reproduced a specific interval without external cues. Both types of neurons were individually tuned to recognize or reproduce particular intervals. Moreover, the injection of muscimol, a GABA agonist, into this area bilaterally resulted in an increase in the error rate during time interval reproduction. These results suggest that area 9 may process multi-second intervals not only in perceptual recognition, but also in internal generation of time intervals."

However, such studies are scarce partly due to the lack of efficient tools.

Using flies fed on two different diets, full sugar-yeast and sugar-only diets, we report for the first time their behavioral changes throughout their lives at a high resolution. We have found that the daily activity peaks at the age of 15–20 days and then gradually declines with age for flies on both diets. However, the overall daily activity is higher for flies on sugar-only diet than those on the full diet. Flies on sugar-only diet show a stronger diurnal localization pattern with higher preference to staying on the top of the cage during the period of light-off when compared to flies on the full diet. Clustering analyses of age-specific behavior patterns reveal three distinct young, middle-aged and old clusters for flies on each of the two diets. The middle-aged groups for flies on sugar-only diet consist of much younger age groups when compared to flies on full diet. This technology provides research opportunities for using a behavioral informatics approach for understanding different ways in which behavior, movement, and aging in model organisms are mutually affecting."

Recent studies highlight the new devices and techniques for hEB formation and expansion, but are not involved in the passaging or subculture process. Here, we provide evidence that a simple periodic passaging markedly improved hEB culture condition and thus allowed the size-controlled, mass production of human embryoid bodies (hEBs) derived from both hESCs and hiPSCs. hEBs maintained in prolonged suspension culture without passaging (>2 weeks) showed a progressive decrease in the cell growth and proliferation and increase in the apoptosis compared to 7-day-old hEBs. However, when serially passaged in suspension, hEB cell populations were significantly increased in number while maintaining the normal rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis and the differentiation potential. Uniform-sized hEBs produced by manual passaging using a 1∶4 split ratio have been successfully maintained for over 20 continuous passages. The passaging culture method of hEBs, which is simple, readily expandable, and reproducible, could be a powerful tool for improving a robust and scalable in vitro differentiation system of human pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026465513,"The genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803 contains a single gene encoding an aquaporin, aqpZ. The AqpZ protein functioned as a water-permeable channel in the plasma membrane. However, the physiological importance of AqpZ in Synechocystis remains unclear. We found that growth in glucose-containing medium inhibited proper division of ΔaqpZ cells and led to cell death. Deletion of a gene encoding a glucose transporter in the ΔaqpZ background alleviated the glucose-mediated growth inhibition of the ΔaqpZ cells. The ΔaqpZ cells swelled more than the wild type after the addition of glucose, suggesting an increase in cytosolic osmolarity. This was accompanied by a down-regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and concurrent glycogen accumulation. Metabolite profiling by GC/TOF-MS of wild-type and ΔaqpZ cells revealed a relative decrease of intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and certain amino acids in the mutant. The changed levels of metabolites may have been the cause for the observed decrease in growth rate of the ΔaqpZ cells along with decreased PSII activity at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 8.5. A mutant in sll1961, encoding a putative transcription factor, and a Δhik31 mutant, lacking a putative glucose-sensing kinase, both exhibited higher glucose sensitivity than the ΔaqpZ cells. Examination of protein expression indicated that sll1961 functioned as a positive regulator of aqpZ gene expression but not as the only regulator. Overall, the ΔaqpZ cells showed defects in macronutrient metabolism, pH homeostasis, and cell division under photomixotrophic conditions, consistent with an essential role of AqpZ in glucose metabolism. The genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803 contains a single gene encoding an aquaporin, aqpZ. The AqpZ protein functioned as a water-permeable channel in the plasma membrane. However, the physiological importance of AqpZ in Synechocystis remains unclear. We found that growth in glucose-containing medium inhibited proper division of ΔaqpZ cells and led to cell death. Deletion of a gene encoding a glucose transporter in the ΔaqpZ background alleviated the glucose-mediated growth inhibition of the ΔaqpZ cells. The ΔaqpZ cells swelled more than the wild type after the addition of glucose, suggesting an increase in cytosolic osmolarity. This was accompanied by a down-regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and concurrent glycogen accumulation.

Since identification of the first aquaporin from red blood cells (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), genes encoding aquaporins have been found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In animals, abundant major intrinsic protein isoforms are involved in a number of diseases and are known to have a role in the regulation of water homeostasis (2Agre P. Kozono D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In plants, aquaporins regulate water permeability and transport in response to external changes in water supply (3Czempinski K. Frachisse J.M. Maurel C. Barbier-Brygoo H. Mueller-Roeber B. Plant J. 2002; 29: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The first aquaporin to be isolated from plant cells was the tonoplast intrinsic protein, γ-TIP (4Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This finding established that aquaporins reside not only in the plasma membrane but also in endomembranes, presumably to coordinate water transport inside the cell. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (henceforth referred to as Synechocystis) a single copy gene encoding an aquaporin homolog, aqpZ, is present in the genome. The functional characteristics of AqpZ and its subcellular localization in Synechocystis have not been determined, although microarray experiments have identified a list of genes induced by hyperosmotic stress in both the wild type (WT) and a ΔaqpZ strain (5Shapiguzov A. Lyukevich A.A. Allakhverdiev S.I. Sergeyenko T.V. Suzuki I. Murata N. Los D.A. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, loss of aquaporins in microorganisms in general does not result in growth defects under a range of environmental conditions (6Tanghe A. Van Dijck P. Thevelein J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, the question as to the physiological role of aquaporins in microbial cells remains open. In microorganisms, the best studied aquaporin is the AqpZ protein from Escherichia coli. The aqpZ null mutant forms smaller colonies and has reduced viability in medium with low osmolarity compared with the parental wild-type cells (7Calamita G. Kempf B. Bonhivers M. Bishai W.R. Bremer E. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3627-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, another study failed to detect any growth defects of an aqpZ disruption mutant under any condition tested (8Soupene E. King N. Lee H. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4304-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although wild-type E. coli cells have higher water permeability compared with an aqpZ null mutant, it has not been demonstrated that aquaporins are important for proper osmotic adjustment (9Delamarche C. Thomas D. Rolland J.P. Froger A. Gouranton J. Svelto M. Agre P. Calamita G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of E. coli AqpZ remains unclear, other functions of aquaporins that are related to specific ecological lifestyles or developmental stages have received increased attention (6Tanghe A. Van Dijck P. Thevelein J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Hill A.E. Shachar-Hill B. Shachar-Hill Y. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 197: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Some aquaporin isoforms mediate permeation of glycerol, H2O2, CO2, silicon, or boron in addition to water (11Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 12Maurel C. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2227-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The range of specificities of aquaporins implies that they are involved in processes as diverse as nutrient acquisition, control of development, and growth and defense responses against environmental stress. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are adapted to a regular cycle of light and dark periods, in which they are different from non-photosynthetic microorganisms. In most species of cyanobacteria, glycogen accumulated during the day serves as the predominant metabolic fuel at night. Glucose derived from glycogen or supplied exogenously is catabolized via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to the production of ATP and carbon skeletons. A glucose-tolerant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis has been isolated previously (13Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 776-778Google Scholar). These cells grow photoautotrophically under light conditions but are also capable of photomixotrophic growth or light-activated heterotrophic growth in glucose-supplemented media (14Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the membrane localization and investigated the physiological role of aquaporin AqpZ in Synechocystis. The addition of glucose to ΔaqpZ cells triggered structural aberrations and morphological abnormalities. Moreover, ΔaqpZ cells growing on medium containing glucose accumulated more glycogen, and their glucose catabolysis was down-regulated. These data suggest that AqpZ plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose metabolism under photomixotrophic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a physiological role of AqpZ in addition to its role in the osmotic stress response. The aqpZ coding region of Synechocystis slr2057 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using gene-specific primers (sense, 5′-CAGTAGATCTATGAAAAAGTACATTGCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGTGCTAGCTCACTCTGCTTCGGGTTCG-3′). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the BglII and NheI sites of pXβG-ev1 (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). To create Myc-tagged AqpZ, another set of primers (sense, 5′-CATGGAATTCCATGAAAAAGTACATTGCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGTGCTAGCTCACTCTGCTTCGGGTTCG-3′) was used to amplify the coding region of aqpZ from genomic DNA by PCR, and the resulting PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and NheI sites of pXβG-ev1, placing it in frame with the N-terminal Myc tag contained in the vector. The correct frame was verified by sequencing. Myc-Y69 (AQP-3) from C. elegans and the human aquaporin hAQP1 were used as controls (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitro from XbaI-linearized pXβG-ev1 plasmids using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 5 or 10 ng of cRNA or diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 15Uozumi N. Gassmann W. Cao Y. Schroeder J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24276-24281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated for 2–3 days at 18 °C in 200 mosm modified Barth's solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4). An oocyte swelling assay was used to determine the osmotic water permeability, Pf (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Oocytes were transferred to modified Barth's solution diluted to 70 mosm with distilled water, and the time course of volume increase was monitored at room temperature by video microscopy with an on-line computer (16Ma T. Frigeri A. Skach W. Verkman A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Chakrabarti N. Roux B. Pomès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 493-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The relative volume (V/V0) was calculated essentially as described by Preston et al. (1Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The relative volume (V/V0) was calculated from the area at the initial time (A0) and after a time interval (At): V/V0 = (At/A0) 32. The coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined from the initial slope of the time course (d(V/V0)/dt), initial oocyte volume (V0 = 9 × 10−4 cm3), initial oocyte surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), and the molar volume of water (Vw = 18 cm3/mol): Pf = (V0 × d(V/V0)/dt)/(S × Vw × (osMin − osMout)). Oocytes were incubated in fixing solution (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 4 h, transferred to methanol at −20 °C for 24 h, equilibrated in PBS (3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 2 h, incubated in PBS with 100 mm NaBH4 at room temperature for 24 h, and bisected with a razor blade (18Liu K. Kozono D. Kato Y. Agre P. Hazama A. Yasui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fixed oocytes were blocked in PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated at 4 °C with the anti-AqpZ antibody (see below) for 24 h followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 2% BSA for 24 h. Samples were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and visualized with a PerkinElmer UltraView LCI confocal laser-scanning microscope. For each sample, 10 oocytes were homogenized together by pipetting up and down in hypotonic lysis buffer (7.5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) (19Meetam M. Keren N. Ohad I. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The oocyte yolk was removed by discarding the pellet after a centrifugation at 735 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g, 4 °C, for 1 h. The pellet containing the oocyte membrane fraction was solubilized in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA-2Na, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 2% SDS). Total protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, probed with either anti-AqpZ antibody (see below) or anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the immunoreactive proteins by exposure to x-ray films. Thylakoid and plasma membrane fractions were prepared from Synechocystis cells as described previously (20Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Tsunekawa K. Shijuku T. Hayashimoto M. Kojima Y. Onai K. Morishita M. Ishiura M. Kuroda T. Nakamura T. Kobayashi H. Sato M.

An anti-AqpZ antibody was raised against two synthetic peptides with the sequences NH2-GSNPLATNGFGDHS-COOH and NH2-VLEDLGRPEPEAE-COOH (Operon, Tokyo, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies raised against the plasma membrane nitrate transporter NrtA (22Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or against the thylakoid membrane proteins NdhD3 and NdhF3 (23Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J.

Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3326-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were used to identify the Synechocystis plasma membrane, or thylakoid membrane fractions, respectively. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5 or 15% gel and then transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:2000 in blocking buffer), followed by incubation for 30 min with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences; 1:1000)) and subsequently developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Synechocystis cells grown to an OD730 of about 1.0 in BG11 medium were fixed with 50 mm phosphatase buffer containing 5% glutaraldehyde and 2% osmium tetroxide (pH 7.2). The samples were dehydrated through a graded acetone series and embedded in Spurr's resin and polymerized. Ultrathin sections were first labeled with AqpZ antiserum (1:20) in Tris-buffered saline and then with 12-nm colloidal gold particles coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG. IgG was purified from the serum using the MelonTM Gel IgG spin purification kit (Pierce). The sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate solution and examined with a transmission electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi). The GT (glucose tolerance) strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and its derivatives were grown at 30 °C in BG11 medium (25Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) buffered with 20 mm TES 2The abbreviations used are: TES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. -KOH (pH 8.0) under aerobic conditions. Solid medium consisted of BG11 buffered at pH 8.0, with 1.5% agar, and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate. To test the effects of pH on growth of Synechocystis cells, a range of BG11 media were prepared by replacing TES buffer with MES buffer for pH 6.5, TES buffer for pH 7.0–8.0, Bicine buffer for pH 8.5, and CHES buffer for pH 9.0–10.0. Continuous illumination was provided by white fluorescent lamps (50 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). For growth in the dark, culture vessels were wrapped with aluminum foil. For light-activated heterotrophic growth, BG11 plates supplemented with 5 mm glucose were incubated in the dark with a daily 15-min pulse of white light. Unless otherwise stated, cells were grown in volumes of 30 ml in flasks. In all experiments, cells grown in fresh BG11 media as precultures were transferred to BG11 (photoautotrophic growth condition) or BG11 containing 5 mm glucose (photomixotrophic growth condition) at an OD730 = 0.05. 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. In this study, several mutant strains (ΔglcP (sll0771), Δsll1961, and ΔaqpZ/ΔglcP) were generated by homologous recombination using plasmids described elsewhere (21Tsunekawa K. Shijuku T. Hayashimoto M. Kojima Y. Onai K. Morishita M. Ishiura M. Kuroda T. Nakamura T. Kobayashi H. Sato M. Toyooka K. Matsuoka K. Omata T. Uozumi N. J. Biol.

The plasmids for disruption of the glcP or sll1961 gene contained an insertion of a kanamycin (Kmr) resistance cassette in the middle of the respective coding sequence. For reintegration of the Synechocystis aqpZ (slr2057) gene into the genome of the ΔaqpZ cells, the full-length coding sequence of aqpZ was amplified by PCR using an NdeI site-containing forward primer 5′-CAGTCATATGATGAAAAAGTACATTGCTG-3′ and SalI site-containing reverse primer 5′-CAGTGTCGACTCACTCTGCTTCGGGTTCG-3′. The NdeI-SalI DNA fragment encoding AqpZ was inserted into the corresponding sites in p68TS4OxCm and integrated by homologous recombination into targeting site 4 of the chromosomal DNA of Synechocystis ΔaqpZ cells (21Tsunekawa K.

Cultures were grown to a cell density of OD730 = 1.0 and then transferred to fresh BG11 medium either with or without 5 mm glucose. The cells were lysed mechanically by vortexing with glass beads, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5 or 15% gels) and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-AqpZ antibody and anti-OpcA antibody (26Sundaram S. Karakaya H. Scanlan D.J. Mann N.H.

The membranes were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody (1:2000 in blocking buffer) and then incubated for 30 min with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000)) and subsequently subjected to chemiluminescence detection. Cells were collected at mid-exponential phase by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in BG11 supplemented with 5 mm glucose at an OD730 of 0.05. Glucose uptake was determined by measuring the concentration of glucose in the medium enzymatically using the d-glucose kit (Roche Applied Science, R-Biopharm), following the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (200 μl) of the cultures were harvested every 12 h and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 2 min, followed by the determination of glucose concentration in the supernatant. Optical microscopy was performed with a microscope (Axioskop FL, Carl Zeiss, Gottingen) equipped with a high definition image capture camera (HC-1000, Fujix, Tokyo) as described previously (21Tsunekawa K.

The cell size was analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and beads of a defined diameter (3.005 ± 0.027 μm) as size standards. Cells grown under either photoautotrophic or photomixotrophic conditions were harvested. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 50 mm cacodylate buffer. Samples were dehydrated through a graded methanol series, then embedded in Epon812 resin (28Toyooka K. Moriyasu Y. Goto Y. Takeuchi M. Fukuda H. Matsuoka K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate solution and examined with a 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at 80 kV (28Toyooka K. Moriyasu Y. Goto Y. Takeuchi M. Fukuda H. Matsuoka K. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cell size distribution was measured using a particle size distribution analyzer (CDA-1000X, Sysmex). Samples (100 μl) were taken from the cultures at the indicated intervals and diluted 100–500 times with modified physiological saline (0.45% sodium chloride, 144 mosm) prior to performing the measurements. Analysis of the intracellular glycogen content was performed as described elsewhere (29Osanai T. Kanesaki Y. Nakano T. Takahashi H. Asayama M. Shirai M. Kanehisa M. Suzuki I. Murata N. Tanaka K. J.

The glucose produced by acid hydrolysis was quantified using a colorimetric assay (30Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of chromosomal genes in E. coli was performed as described previously (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

E. coli MA02 (glpF::km) and E. coli MA03 (aqpZ::cm/glpF::km) were generated from the E. coli K-12 W3110 strain using the following primer sets: for aqpZ (JW0859) gene disruption, primers ΔEcAqpZ-PS1 (5′-CTATAAAACGACCATATTTTTCACAGGGTCAATTTTTAATTGTGGTGGATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and ΔEcAqpZ-PS2 (5′-AACAACATCTTAAAAAAAGGCCTGACATTACGCCAGGCCTTCTGCGTTAACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′); for glpF (JW3898) gene disruption, primers ΔEcGlpF-PS1 (5′-GTCCGTGACTTTCACGCATACAACAAACATTAACTCTTCAGGATCCGATTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and ΔEcGlpF-PS2 (5′-GCGCAACGATATATTTTTTTTCAGTCATGTTTAATTGTCCCGTAGTCATACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′). We removed the kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes from E. coli MA02 and E. coli MA03 to generate strains MA05 (glpF−) and MA06 (aqpZ−/glpF−) using the FLP-mediated recombination method (31Datsenko K.A.

Bacterial strains were routinely plated on LB or M9 agar medium containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. For overnight liquid cultures, bacterial strains were grown aerobically at 30 °C in M9 modified minimal medium with 0.2% casamino acids, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, and 10 mm maltose. Growth was monitored by measuring the A600 of the cultures in M9 modified medium supplemented with 2 mm glycerol (32Froger A. Rolland J.P. Bron P. Lagrée V. Le Cahérec F. Deschamps S. Hubert J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2072251569,"Background How does the brain estimate object stability? Objects fall over when the gravity-projected centre-of-mass lies outside the point or area of support. To estimate an object's stability visually, the brain must integrate information across the shape and compare its orientation to gravity. When observers lie on their sides, gravity is perceived as tilted toward body orientation, consistent with a representation of gravity derived from multisensory information. We exploited this to test whether vestibular and kinesthetic information affect this visual task or whether the brain estimates object stability solely from visual information. Methodology/Principal Findings In three body orientations, participants viewed images of objects close to a table edge. We measured the critical angle at which each object appeared equally likely to fall over or right itself. Perceived gravity was measured using the subjective visual vertical. The results show that the perceived critical angle was significantly biased in the same direction as the subjective visual vertical (i.e., towards the multisensory estimate of gravity). Conclusions/Significance Our results rule out a general explanation that the brain depends solely on visual heuristics and assumptions about object stability. Instead, they suggest that multisensory estimates of gravity govern the perceived stability of objects, resulting in objects appearing more stable than they are when the head is tilted in the same direction in which they fall."
https://openalex.org/W1998330305,"Dilute ethanol (EtOH) is a widely used agent to remove the corneal epithelium during the modern refractive surgery. The application of EtOH may cause the underlying corneal fibroblasts to undergo apoptosis. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect and potential mechanism of the respiratory chain coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an electron transporter of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and a ubiquitous free radical scavenger, against EtOH-induced apoptosis of corneal fibroblasts. Corneal fibroblasts were pretreated with CoQ10 (10 µM) for 2 h, followed by exposure to different concentrations of EtOH (0.4, 2, 4, and 20%) for 20 s. After indicated incubation period (2–12 h), MTT assay was used to examine cell viability. Treated cells were further assessed by flow cytometry to identify apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the change in mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate/2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA/DCF) assays and flow-cytometric analysis of JC-1 staining, respectively. The activity and expression of caspases 2, 3, 8, and 9 were evaluated with a colorimetric assay and western blot analysis. We found that EtOH treatment significantly decreased the viability of corneal fibroblasts characterized by a higher percentage of apoptotic cells. CoQ10 could antagonize the apoptosis inducing effect of EtOH. The inhibition of cell apoptosis by CoQ10 was significant at 8 and 12 h after EtOH exposure. In EtOH-exposed corneal fibroblasts, CoQ10 pretreatment significantly reduced mitochondrial depolarization and ROS production at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min and inhibited the activation and expression of caspases 2 and 3 at 2 h after EtOH exposure. In summary, pretreatment with CoQ10 can inhibit mitochondrial depolarization, caspase activation, and cell apoptosis. These findings support the proposition that CoQ10 plays an antiapoptotic role in corneal fibroblasts after ethanol exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2161662393,"Lipoxygenases have been implicated in cardiovascular disease. A rare single-nucleotide polymorphism causing T560M exchange has recently been described, and this mutation leads to a near null variant of the enzyme encoded for by the ALOX15 gene. When we inspected the three-dimensional structure of the rabbit ortholog, we localized Thr-560 outside the active site and identified a hydrogen bridge between its side chain and Gln-294. This interaction is part of a complex hydrogen bond network that appears to be conserved in other mammalian lipoxygenases. Gln-294 and Asn-287 are key amino acids in this network, and we hypothesized that disturbance of this hydrogen bond system causes the low activity of the T560M mutant. To test this hypothesis, we first mutated Thr-560 to amino acids not capable of forming side chain hydrogen bridges (T560M and T560A) and obtained enzyme variants with strongly reduced catalytic activity. In contrast, enzymatic activity was retained after T560S exchange. Enzyme variants with strongly reduced activity were also obtained when we mutated Gln-294 (binding partner of Thr-560) and Asn-287 (binding partner of Gln-294 and Met-418) to Leu. Basic kinetic characterization of the T560M mutant indicated that the enzyme lacks a kinetic lag phase but is rapidly inactivated. These data suggest that the low catalytic efficiency of the naturally occurring T560M mutant is caused by alterations of a hydrogen bond network interconnecting this residue with active site constituents. Disturbance of this bonding network increases the susceptibility of the enzyme for suicidal inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2021022369,"While identification and isolation of adult stem cells have potentially important implications, recent reports regarding dedifferentiation/reprogramming from differentiated cells have provided another clue to gain insight into source of tissue stem/progenitor cells. In this study, we developed a novel culture system to obtain dedifferentiated progenitor cells from normal human thyroid tissues. After enzymatic digestion, primary thyrocytes, expressing thyroglobulin, vimentin and cytokeratin-18, were cultured in a serum-free medium called SAGM. Although the vast majority of cells died, a small proportion (∼0.5%) survived and proliferated. During initial cell expansion, thyroglobulin/cytokeratin-18 expression was gradually declined in the proliferating cells. Moreover, sorted cells expressing thyroid peroxidase gave rise to proliferating clones in SAGM. These data suggest that those cells are derived from thyroid follicular cells or at least thyroid-committed cells. The SAGM-grown cells did not express any thyroid-specific genes. However, after four-week incubation with FBS and TSH, cytokeratin-18, thyroglobulin, TSH receptor, PAX8 and TTF1 expressions re-emerged. Moreover, surprisingly, the cells were capable of differentiating into neuronal or adipogenic lineage depending on differentiating conditions. In summary, we have developed a novel system to generate multilineage progenitor cells from normal human thyroid tissues. This seems to be achieved by dedifferentiation of thyroid follicular cells. The presently described culture system may be useful for regenerative medicine, but the primary importance will be as a tool to elucidate the mechanisms of thyroid diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2041332321,"Background Healthcare systems face the problem of insufficient resources to meet the needs of ageing populations and increasing demands for access to new treatments. It is unclear whether doctors and consumers agree on the main challenges to health system sustainability. Methodology We conducted a mail survey of Australian doctors (specialists and general practitioners) and a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) of consumers to determine their views on contributors to increasing health care costs, rationing of services and involvement in health resource allocation decisions. Differences in responses are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 2948 doctors, 1139 (38.6%) responded; 533 of 826 consumers responded (64.5% response). Doctors were more concerned than consumers with the effects of an ageing population (OR 3.0; 99% CI 1.7, 5.4), and costs of new drugs and technologies (OR 5.1; CI 3.3, 8.0), but less likely to consider pharmaceutical promotional activities as a cost driver (OR 0.29, CI 0.22, 0.39). Doctors were more likely than consumers to view ‘community demand’ for new technologies as a major cost driver, (OR 1.6; 1.2, 2.2), but less likely to attribute increased costs to patients failing to take responsibility for their own health (OR 0.35; 0.24, 0.49). Like doctors, the majority of consumers saw a need for public consultation in decisions about funding for new treatments. Conclusions Australian doctors and consumers hold different views on the sustainability of the healthcare system, and a number of key issues relating to costs, cost drivers, roles and responsibilities. Doctors recognise their dual responsibility to patients and society, see an important role for physicians in influencing resource allocation, and acknowledge their lack of skills in assessing treatments of marginal value. Consumers recognise cost pressures on the health system, but express willingness to be involved in health care decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2087432242,"Background Tissue response to irradiation is not easily recapitulated by cell culture studies. The objective of this investigation was to characterize, the transcriptional response and the onset of regenerative processes in mouse skin irradiated with different doses of fast neutrons. Methodology/Principal Findings To monitor general response to irradiation and individual animal to animal variation, we performed gene and protein expression analysis with both pooled and individual mouse samples. A high-throughput gene expression analysis, by DNA oligonucleotide microarray was done with three months old C57Bl/6 mice irradiated with 0.2 and 1 Gy of mono-energetic 14 MeV neutron compared to sham irradiated controls. The results on 440 irradiation modulated genes, partially validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR, showed a dose-dependent up-regulation of a sub-class of keratin and keratin associated proteins, and members of the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Immunohistochemistry confirmed mRNA expression data enabled mapping of protein expression. Interestingly, proteins up-regulated in thickening epidermis: keratin 6 and S100A8 showed the most significant up-regulation and the least mouse-to-mouse variation following 0.2 Gy irradiation, in a concerted effort toward skin tissue regeneration. Conversely, mice irradiated at 1 Gy showed most evidence of apoptosis (Caspase-3 and TUNEL staining) and most 8-oxo-G accumulation at 24 h post-irradiation. Moreover, no cell proliferation accompanied 1 Gy exposure as shown by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Conclusions/Significance The dose-dependent differential gene expression at the tissue level following in vivo exposure to neutron radiation is reminiscent of the onset of re-epithelialization and wound healing and depends on the proportion of cells carrying multiple chromosomal lesions in the entire tissue. Thus, this study presents in vivo evidence of a skin regenerative program exerted independently from DNA repair-associated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2011058933,"Background Previous studies have claimed that a precise split at the vertical midline of each fovea causes all words to the left and right of fixation to project to the opposite, contralateral hemisphere, and this division in hemispheric processing has considerable consequences for foveal word recognition. However, research in this area is dominated by the use of stimuli from Latinate languages, which may induce specific effects on performance. Consequently, we report two experiments using stimuli from a fundamentally different, non-Latinate language (Arabic) that offers an alternative way of revealing effects of split-foveal processing, if they exist. Methods and Findings Words (and pseudowords) were presented to the left or right of fixation, either close to fixation and entirely within foveal vision, or further from fixation and entirely within extrafoveal vision. Fixation location and stimulus presentations were carefully controlled using an eye-tracker linked to a fixation-contingent display. To assess word recognition, Experiment 1 used the Reicher-Wheeler task and Experiment 2 used the lexical decision task. Results Performance in both experiments indicated a functional division in hemispheric processing for words in extrafoveal locations (in recognition accuracy in Experiment 1 and in reaction times and error rates in Experiment 2) but no such division for words in foveal locations. Conclusions These findings from a non-Latinate language provide new evidence that although a functional division in hemispheric processing exists for word recognition outside the fovea, this division does not extend up to the point of fixation. Some implications for word recognition and reading are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2014703471,"Postural control in quiet stance although simple still requires some cognitive resources; dual cognitive tasks influence further postural control. The present study examines whether or not dyslexic teenagers experience postural instability when performing a Stroop dual task for which their performances are known to be poor. Fifteen dyslexics and twelve non-dyslexics (14 to 17 years old) were recruited from the same school. They were asked to perform three tasks: (1) fixate a target, (2) perform an interference Stroop test (naming the colour or the word rather than reading the word), (3) performing flexibility Stroop task: the subject performed the interference task as in (2) except when the word was in a box, in which case he had to read the word. Postural performances were measured with a force platform. The results showed a main task effect on the variance of speed of body sway only: such variance was higher in the flexibility task than for the other two tasks. No group effect was found for any of the parameters of posture (surface, mediolateral and anteroposterior sway, variance of speed). Further wavelet analysis in the time-frequency domain revealed an increase in the spectral power of the medium frequency range believed to be related to cerebellum control; an accompanying increase in the cancellation time of the high frequency band related to reflexive loops occurred for non-dyslexics only. These effects occurred for the flexibility task and could be due to its high cognitive difficulty. Dyslexics displayed shorter cancellation time for the medium frequency band for all tasks, suggesting less efficient cerebellar control, perhaps of eye fixation and attention influencing body sway. We conclude that there is no evidence for a primary posture deficit in 15 year old teenagers who come from the general population and who were recruited in schools."

Amino acid uptake provides a critical source of nitrogen, sulfur, and metabolic intermediates for many organisms. Amino acids are often transported into the cell in the form of short peptides to efficiently mediate their bulk uptake.

Like many proton-coupled transporters, the PTR family is a subdivision of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (3Chang A.B. Lin R. Keith Studley W. Tran C.V. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Membr.

Physiology. 2006; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The first such motif is found in the first predicted transmembrane helix, whereas the second is found in loop 2-3 and corresponds to the motif GXXX(D/E)(R/K)[X]G[X](R/K)(R/K), where [X] is either one or two amino acids, which is also found in many MFS transporters (5Henderson P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The third motif, the PTR signature motif FXXFYXXINXGS, is located in the fifth predicted transmembrane helix of PTR members, and mutation of these residues leads to reduced transport activity or changes in substrate selectivity (7Hauser M.

In addition, chimeric studies on human PTR members PEPT1 and PEPT2 have revealed that helices 2–5 as well as 7 contain residues that mediate substrate recognition (9Fei Y.J. Liu J.C. Fujita T. Liang R. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is supported by cysteine scanning mutagenesis of residues in helices 5 and 7 of PEPT1, which suggests that residues in these helices line the substrate translocation pathway (8Kulkarni A.A.

PTR family members possess a large number of possible substrates, including essentially all 400 possible di- or 8000 tripeptides. For human PEPT1 and PEPT2, the most well characterized PTRs, transport is stereoselective for the l-enantiomers of amino acids, although d-amino acids are accepted in the N-terminal position. Substrate affinity varies depending on the sequence of the particular di- or tripeptide (11Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9565-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these transporters are able to take up peptidomimetics such as β-lactam antibiotics, some angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and some antiviral pro-drugs, such as valaciclovir (12Brandsch M. Knütter I. Bosse-Doenecke E. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2008; 60: 543-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of PEPT1 in the brush-border membrane of the small intestine, and PEPT2 in the kidney and blood-brain barrier, these proteins significantly influence the systemic availability of these and other pharmacological compounds (12Brandsch M. Knütter I. Bosse-Doenecke E. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2008; 60: 543-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli PTR protein YdgR, also called DtpA, is one of the few prokaryotic PTR members to have been characterized and shows substrate selectivity similar to that of PEPT1 (13Harder D.

Recently, the crystal structure of another prokaryotic PTR family member from Shewanella oneidensis, referred to as PepTso, was determined and revealed a fold very similar to that of other MFS transporters, including LacY, GlpT, and EmrD (15Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N.

Science. 2006; 312: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The substrate binding cavity is lined with conserved residues, many of which were previously identified as critical for function (17Newstead S. Drew D. Cameron A.D. Postis V.L. Xia X. Fowler P.W. Ingram J.C. Carpenter E.P. Sansom M.S. McPherson M.J. Baldwin S.A. Iwata S. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, several functional residues, including His61 and Glu316, which are suggested to be essential for protonation and/or periplasmic gating, are not conserved between PepTso and other bacterial PTRs, including YdgR. To identify additional residues critical for the function of YdgR and its homologues, we have performed random mutagenesis on this transporter and utilized a high-throughput substrate uptake assay to identify mutants exhibiting loss-of-function phenotypes. The results of this assay combined with additional analysis allowed us to identify 15 mutations leading to a complete loss-of-function phenotype, and 12 further mutations showing partial loss-of-function. In addition, 6 mutations were identified that exhibit this phenotype only in one of the uptake assays. Mapping of these residues onto a homology model of YdgR based on the PepTso structure and additional comparison to the known structure of the lactose permease LacY (15Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) allows for prediction of the potential functions of several of these residues, including Glu56, Phe289, Met295, and Arg305. Further analysis of Glu56 and Arg305 reveals that these residues may function as periplasmic gating residues in YdgR and other close bacterial homologues. The full-length ydgR gene was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and cloned into the pCS19 vector (kind gift from Michael Ehrmann (19Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar)) using the NcoI and BglII restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described in Ref. 20Liu H. Naismith J.H. BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar. Random mutations were introduced into regions of the ydgR gene encompassing helices 2–4 (H2–4; base pairs 130–444) and helices 6–8 (H6–8; base pairs 535–1000) using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). To determine the mutation frequency in each library, the resulting PCR products were inserted into the pJET cloning vector using the GeneJET Cloning Kit (Fermentas). At least 10 different clones for each library were sequenced to estimate a mutation frequency of 0.35% for library H2–4 and 0.65% for library H6–8. The PCR products were then used as megaprimers with pCS19-YdgR as a template, to create two libraries of mutants in the pCS19 background. The mutant libraries were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and individual colonies were grown in 96-well plates under two conditions, one containing 200 μl of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium plus the antibiotic ampicillin, and one additionally containing 200 μg/ml of the antibiotic alafosfalin (Sigma). A600 was monitored 1 and 5 h after induction of ydgR expression. Clones exhibiting a growth advantage when compared with native YdgR, as determined by visual inspection of the growth curves, were sequenced within the entire open reading frame to identify the mutation(s). Several clones of each mutant identified in this manner were then re-tested in the growth assay to eliminate false positives. Cell pellets from 50-ml cultures of C43(DE3) cells transformed with mutant or control constructs were harvested and membranes were isolated as described in Ref. 21Surade S. Klein M.

Equal concentrations of membranes from each construct were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an α-His-HRP-conjugated antibody (Qiagen). The intensity of each band was quantified using the ImageJ software (22Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar).

Competition assays were carried out in the presence of 0 to 75 mm alafosfalin or alanyl-alanine (Bachem AG). IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the software program GraphPad Prism 5.0. The HHPred-generated alignment of YdgR with PepTso (PDB code 2XUT) was used as the basis for the alignment input into the program Modeller (9 version 8) (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

The first library, encompassing helices 2–4 (H2–4), spans amino acids 44–148 of the ydgR gene (base pairs 130–444), and the second library, encompassing helices 6–8 (H6–8), spans amino acids 179–334 (base pairs 535–1000) (supplemental Fig. S1). These two libraries were then tested for functionality based on the ability to transport the phosphonopeptide antibiotic alafosfalin, which is a specific substrate of prokaryotic PTRs, transport of which leads to inhibition of cell growth (25Gibson M.M. Price M. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 122-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth in the absence and presence of alafosfalin was monitored by measuring A600 at several time points after induction of ydgR expression (Fig. 1). Cells expressing transporters with mutations leading to a loss-of-function (LOF) phenotype are expected to grow normally in the presence of alafosfalin, whereas cells expressing the native transporter or transporters with mutations that do not affect transport ability will fail to survive, due to the toxic effect of the antibiotic. The Y156A mutant, which represents the homologous mutation of Tyr167 from PepT1 and results in a non-functional transporter (26Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H.

Representative data for 2 LOF mutants isolated in this assay, the native transporter and the Y156A mutant indicates that the mutants show a clear growth advantage as compared with the native transporter in the presence of alafosfalin (Fig. 1). Approximately 1600 mutants were screened in this assay, 600 from library H2–4 and 1000 from H6–8. From library H2–4, 101 LOF mutants were isolated. After sequencing the YdgR open reading frame, these consisted of 21 single amino acid mutations and 12 with double amino acid mutations. The remaining mutants contained single base pair deletions or insertions resulting in a frameshift, silent mutations, stop codons, or point mutations resulting in 3 or more amino acid changes. The mutant M154K lies outside of the mutagenized region, and therefore must have arisen independently during library generation. From library H6–8, 170 LOF mutants were identified. Initial sequencing revealed the frequent occurrence of mutants containing a long insertion rather than single point mutations, most likely occurring during the megaprimer amplification step. Therefore clones were pre-screened by colony PCR to eliminate clones containing the insertion. The remaining 118 mutants were sequenced within the YdgR open reading frame to identify mutations, and consisted of 27 single point mutants (22 unique) and 17 double point mutants. The mutants resulting in single amino acid changes were re-assayed to confirm their phenotype, resulting in the identification of 8 false positives. The remaining 35 single mutants and the 29 isolated double mutants are shown in Table 1. Comparison of A600 values of the native and mutant clones 4–5 h post-induction was used to calculate a numerical growth advantage for each of the 35 single mutants (Table 2).TABLE 1Mutants isolated in the primary screenSingle mutants, library H2–4Single mutants, library H6–8Double mutants, library H2–4Double mutants, library H6–8E56GM154KaMutation occurs outside of the mutagenized region.L52P, K130EL221R, V316LS59PL190VS64Y, A99EQ242H, F288LI60NN196KS67T, A68PG255D, N306KA68PF197IV70I, L80FI256F, I259FG78CV252EY71C, A75DE263D, E317GG86RA264PW79R, I91NM275L, F279IL98RK274IG86S, P133TE284G, A285VI100VA285VG89R, K130TF289I, E317GG101DF289LA95T, P133LV290A, Q320HI122NF289SA99V, K130IY292S, I331TA123VM295KY116C, M119KT297R, A315TG127DT297AM117I, S134PL299P, R305HL136RN300IL299R, L312ML137HN300YF302C, R305PF301IP308R, A371VA303GL312S, A405TR305CQ322L, A323PN306IQ320LL324VP326Qa Mutation occurs outside of the mutagenized region.

Open table in a new tab The 35 single mutants were then further characterized. To determine whether their phenotype is simply due to loss of protein expression or membrane insertion, membrane localization was determined by isolation of the membrane fraction from small-scale cultures and verification of the presence of protein in the membrane fraction by Western blot using an α-His antibody to detect the C-terminal His6 tag of the protein. This analysis revealed that two mutants, I100V and L137H, show no expression in the membrane fraction, whereas G127D is present in the membrane at very low levels, and K274I is expressed at only 55% as compared with native YdgR (Table 2, Fig. 2). All other mutants show expression levels of 60% or more, and interpretation of their transport phenotype is not affected by their expression level. To further analyze the transport activity of the individual mutants, their ability to take up the fluorescent substrate β-Ala-Lys(AMCA), a known substrate of YdgR (14Weitz D. Harder D. Casagrande F. Fotiadis D. Obrdlik P. Kelety B. Daniel H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2832-2839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was assessed and compared with that of the native transporter (Fig. 3). By compiling the data from the alafosfalin growth assay and the β-Ala-Lys(AMCA) uptake assay, the 35 mutants can be divided into four phenotypic categories (Table 2). The first category includes the two mutants that fail to localize to the membrane. The second and largest category comprises 15 mutants that show a 2-fold or greater growth advantage in the presence of alafosfalin, and less than 10% uptake activity as compared with the native transporter. Most of these mutants represent amino acid substitutions that dramatically alter the properties of the side chain, such as hydrophobic to charged or vice versa, or mutations to glycine or proline, which may significantly alter the protein structure. However, we have also identified more conservative mutations that lead to the same phenotype, including F289L, T297A, and F301I. The third category represents 12 mutants with a slight growth advantage in the presence of alafosfalin, and uptake activity ranging from ∼20 to 60% of the native transporter. The mutants G86R, R305C, and P326Q show very little transport in the β-Ala-Lys(AMCA) uptake assay, however, do retain some ability to take up alafosfalin, and have therefore been included in this category. Similarly, N300Y seems unable to transport alafosfalin, but still retains significant ability to transport β-Ala-Lys(AMCA), particularly when correcting for its reduced expression level. Again, many of these mutations represent substitution of one type of amino acid for another, however, they show milder phenotypes than the complete loss-of-function mutants. Most interesting, the G127D mutant maintains significant transport activity despite its low expression level (Table 2). A fourth intriguing group of mutants, which we refer to as selectivity mutants, are those that exhibit a loss-of-function phenotype in the alafosfalin growth assay, yet show uptake of β-Ala-Lys(AMCA) equivalent to or, in some cases, even greater than that of the native transporter (Table 2). This would suggest that these mutations do not affect the ability of the protein to transport substrates, but rather may affect substrate selectivity or affinity. Although the uptake assay is performed in minimal media with only one potential substrate present, the alafosfalin growth assay is performed in complex media (LB), which contains other potential di- and tripeptide substrates. Although the presence of competitors in complex media does not inhibit transport of alafosfalin by the native transporter, higher affinity interaction with competitors, and/or lower affinity interaction with alafosfalin, may prevent alafosfalin uptake in these mutants. To test the hypothesis that these mutants have a lower apparent affinity for alafosfalin than the native transporter, we determined the IC50 and Ki values for alafosfalin for these six mutants by performing the β-Ala-Lys(AMCA) uptake assay in the presence of increasing concentrations of alafosfalin (Fig. 4A, Table 3). This experiment reveals that mutants M154K, L190V, F197I, V252E, and L324V have Ki values 3.5–13.5-fold higher than the native transporter, indicating weaker interaction with alafosfalin. In contrast, the mutant K274I has a Ki value equal to that of the native transporter.TABLE 3Apparent affinities of the selectivity mutants for alafosfalin and alanyl-alanine (Ala-Ala)YdgR mutantAlafosfalinAla-AlaIC50aIC50 values represent averages from at least two experiments with error calculated as S.D.KibKi values were determined using the equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [substrate]/KD.

Open table in a new tab The structure of alafosfalin mimics that of the dipeptide alanyl-alanine, however, in alafosfalin (l-alanyl-l-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) the carboxyl group on the C-terminal moiety is replaced by phosphonic acid. To determine whether these mutants show lower apparent affinity for dipeptide substrates with an unmodified carboxyl terminus, the IC50 and Ki values for alanyl-alanine were also determined (Fig. 4B, Table 3). For alanyl-alanine, the Ki values for five mutants are within ±2-fold of that of the native transporter, and for one mutant, M154K, the apparent affinity is higher than that of the native transporter. This suggests that the lower apparent affinity for alafosfalin for 5 of these mutants is not a general property of substrate binding, but rather may be specific for the substrate alafosfalin. We conclude that the loss of apparent affinity for alafosfalin is related to the presence of the additional C-terminal charged hydroxyl, either through direct steric hindrance of binding or unfavorable charge-charge interactions. As the K274I mutant shows apparent affinities similar to those of the native transporter for both alafosfalin and alanyl-alanine, it is not clear from these experiments why this mutant shows a LOF phenotype in the alafosfalin growth assay. To attempt to correlate the phenotype of individual mutations with their location in the transporter, we generated a homology model of YdgR based on the structure of PepTso (17Newstead S. Drew D. Cameron A.D. Postis V.L. Xia X. Fowler P.W. Ingram J.C. Carpenter E.P. Sansom M.S. McPherson M.J. Baldwin S.A. Iwata S. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). PepTso shares 26% identity and 45% similarity with YdgR (supplemental Fig. S1). Almost all of the residues in the peptide binding site of PepTso are conserved in YdgR, and also localize to the substrate cavity in our model (supplemental Fig. S1, Fig. 5"
https://openalex.org/W2009768032,"Iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) controls the synthesis of many proteins involved in iron metabolism, and the level of IRP2 itself is regulated by varying the rate of its degradation. The proteasome is known to mediate degradation, with specificity conferred by an iron-sensing E3 ligase. Most studies on the degradation of IRP2 have employed cells overexpressing IRP2 and also rendered iron deficient to further increase IRP2 levels. We utilized a sensitive, quantitative assay for IRP2, which allowed study of endogenous IRP2 degradation in HEK293A cells under more physiologic conditions. We found that under these conditions, the proteasome plays only a minor role in the degradation of IRP2, with almost all the IRP2 being degraded by a nonproteasomal pathway. This new pathway is calcium-dependent but is not mediated by calpain. Elevating the cellular level of IRP2 by inducing iron deficiency or by transfection causes the proteasomal pathway to account for the major fraction of IRP2 degradation. We conclude that under physiological, iron-sufficient conditions, the steady-state level of IRP2 in HEK293A cells is regulated by the nonproteasomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2147295827,"Budding yeasts are highly suitable for aging studies, because the number of bud scars (stage) proportionally correlates with age. Its maximum stages are known to reach at 20-30 stages on an isolated agar medium. However, their stage dynamics in a liquid culture is virtually unknown. We investigate the population dynamics by counting scars in each cell. Here one cell division produces one new cell and one bud scar. This simple rule leads to a conservation law: ""The total number of bud scars is equal to the total number of cells."" We find a large discrepancy: extremely fewer cells with over 5 scars than expected. Almost all cells with 6 or more scars disappear within a short period of time in the late log phase (corresponds to the inflection point). This discrepancy is confirmed directly by the microscopic observations of broken cells. This finding implies apoptosis in older cells (6 scars or more)."
