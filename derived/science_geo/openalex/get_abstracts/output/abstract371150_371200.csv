This requirement is underscored by an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in copper-deficient animals; however, a molecular understanding of its importance in immune defense is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of proinflammatory agents on copper homeostasis in RAW264.7 macrophages. Interferon-γ was found to increase expression of the high affinity copper importer, CTR1, and stimulate copper uptake. This was accompanied by copper-stimulated trafficking of the ATP7A copper exporter from the Golgi to vesicles that partially overlapped with phagosomal compartments. Silencing of ATP7A expression attenuated bacterial killing, suggesting a role for ATP7A-dependent copper transport in the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Significantly, a copper-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli lacking the CopA copper-transporting ATPase was hypersensitive to killing by RAW264.7 macrophages, and this phenotype was dependent on ATP7A expression. Collectively, these data suggest that copper-transporting ATPases, CopA and ATP7A, in both bacteria and macrophage are unique determinants of bacteria survival and identify an unexpected role for copper at the host-pathogen interface.

A potential new target for autoinflammatory bone diseaseJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 11PreviewChronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disease mediated by the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Although IL-1β is known as the key driver of bone lesions in CRMO, the signaling events leading to pathogenic levels of the cytokine are not fully understood. Using a genetic mouse model of CRMO, Dasari et al. find a role for the nonreceptor spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in upstream signaling leading to IL-1β up-regulation. Their findings suggest that SYK may constitute a new therapeutic target for CRMO. Full-Text PDF Open Access Copper is an essential nutrient for aerobic organisms. Its ability to exchange electrons as it cycles between cuprous and cupric states has been harnessed by enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of biochemical processes (1.Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). However, this same redox activity also confers copper with toxic properties when it is present in the free ionic form. Free copper can participate in Fenton-like chemistry to produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (2.Kadiiska M.B. Mason R.P. Spectrochim. Acta A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc. 2002; 58: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3.Jiménez Del Río M. Vélez-Pardo C. Arch. Med. Res. 2004; 35: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4.Wardman P. Candeias L.P. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that organisms have evolved tightly regulated mechanisms for copper transport and intracellular distribution. Copper is among several micronutrients found to be important for both innate and adaptive immunity (5.Prohaska J.R. Lukasewycz O.A. Science. 1981; 213: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Failla M.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1443S-1447SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Copper deficiency decreases interleukin-2 secretion in T cells (7.Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and recent studies have demonstrated a direct role for copper in the secretion of interleukin 1-α and fibroblast growth factor-1 (8.Prudovsky I. Mandinova A. Soldi R. Bagala C. Graziani I. Landriscina M. Tarantini F. Duarte M. Bellum S. Doherty H. Maciag T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Various studies have shown that copper-deficient animals are susceptible to several pathogens, including Candida albicans (9.Jones D.G. Suttle N.F. Res. Vet. Sci. 1981; 31: 151-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Boyne R. Arthur J.R. J. Comp. Pathol. 1981; 91: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Pasteurella hemolytica (11.Jones D.G.

Other studies have shown that copper supplementation is protective against Escherichia coli-induced mastitis in dairy cattle (14.Scaletti R.W. Trammell D.S. Smith B.A. Harmon R.J. J. Dairy Sci. 2003; 86: 1240-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that copper deficiency impairs the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and macrophages (15.Babu U. Failla M.L. J.

Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that copper concentrations are markedly increased within the phagosomal compartment of macrophages activated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 3The abbreviations used are: IFN-γinterferon γLPSlipopolysaccharideRNAiRNA interferenceTTMtetrathiomolybdate. and Mycobacterium avium (18.Wagner D. Maser J. Lai B. Cai Z. Barry 3rd, C.E. Höner Zu Bentrup K. Russell D.G. Bermudez L.E. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although these studies provide indirect evidence of a role for copper in immune defense, an understanding of the underlying processes at a molecular level is lacking. interferon γ lipopolysaccharide RNA interference tetrathiomolybdate. Here we report dramatic changes in copper homeostasis triggered by proinflammatory agents in macrophages, a phagocytic cell type of the innate immune system. These changes include elevated expression of the CTR1 copper importer, increased copper uptake, and copper-stimulated trafficking of the ATP7A copper transporter from the Golgi to cytoplasmic vesicles that overlap with the phagosomal compartment. Significantly, silencing of ATP7A impaired bactericidal activity, suggesting that copper transport via ATP7A was required for bacterial killing. Consistent with this role, a copper-sensitive mutant of E. coli with a defect in copper export was significantly more sensitive to macrophage-mediated killing than wild type cells, and this sensitivity was dependent on ATP7A expression. These findings suggest that copper-transporting ATPases present within both macrophage and bacteria are novel determinants of this host-pathogen interaction. RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. ATP7A-silenced RAW264.7 cells were generated by stable transfection of a pRS vector harboring a 29-nucleotide short hairpin RNA against ATP7A (Origene, Rockville, MD) and selected in 25 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). Control cells were transfected with the same vector expressing short hairpin RNA against green fluorescent protein (Origene). The Rab7-Q67L plasmid was transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 64Cu uptake was assayed as described previously with minor modifications (19.Lee J. Peña M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 macrophage cells in triplicate 6-well trays were cultured overnight in 1 ml of serum-free medium with or without the indicated concentrations of IFN-γ (BD Biosciences) or LPS (Sigma). Cells were then incubated with serum-free medium containing 1 μm 64Cu for 5 min, washed extensively in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline. Radioactivity was measured using a γ counter, and counts were determined per total protein concentration. RAW264.7 cells alone or transfected with control RNAi or ATP7A RNAi plasmids were activated by overnight treatment in serum-free medium containing 25 ng/ml IFN-γ. Where indicated, either 20 μm CuCl2 or 50 μm ebselen was also added to the cells. Cells were then detached by scraping into ice-cold serum-free medium, washed twice, and resuspended in triplicate in serum-free medium. Wild type E. coli (strain W3110) or the copA deletion strain (DW3110) (20.Grass G. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2145-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21.Stoyanov J.V. Magnani D. Solioz M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were grown to stationary phase and added to the RAW264.7 macrophages at a macrophage/bacteria ratio of 1:10 or 1:1. Bacterial phagocytosis was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, and the extracellular bacteria were removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 12.5 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). One set of samples (uptake group) was lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 solution and plated onto LB-agar plates for colony counting to provide bacterial uptake values. The remaining set (kill group) was incubated for 1 or 2 h (as indicated) at 37 °C in serum-free medium to allow bacterial killing to occur, lysed, and then plated onto LB-agar. Colony numbers were normalized against the total protein content of each sample, and bacterial survival was determined by dividing the number of colonies in the killing group by those in the uptake group. The in vitro survival assay was performed as previously described (22.Elzanowska H. Wolcott R.G. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponential phase cultures of E. coli were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of assay buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm ascorbic acid to act as a reducing agent) in the presence or absence of 500 μm H2O2, 10 μm copper, or both, for 20 min at 37 °C. Serial dilutions of bacteria were plated, and bacterial survival rates were expressed as a percentage of the untreated group in assay buffer alone. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (23.Mao X. Kim B.E. Wang F. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6992-7000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells were activated by overnight treatment with 25 ng/ml IFN-γ and exposed to a 1:200 dilution of 3-μm latex beads (Sigma) for 90 min at 37 °C to allow phagocytosis to proceed. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular beads and fixed in paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence as above. In other experiments, bead-containing phagosomes were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (24.Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 filter tubes (Millipore), and ceruloplasmin activity was assayed as described previously (25.Sunderman Jr., F.W. Nomoto S. Clin. Chem. 1970; 16: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We began this study by testing whether copper supplementation to the growth medium of the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, might alter its bactericidal activity. Cells were stimulated overnight with the proinflammatory cytokine, IFN-γ, in the presence or absence of 20 μm copper, and their ability to kill E. coli was determined the following day. In the RAW264.7 macrophages pretreated with copper, bacterial survival was significantly reduced relative to untreated cells following either a 1- or 2-h incubation (Fig. 1A). There was no effect of copper on the uptake of bacteria by RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that copper can potentiate the bactericidal activity of RAW264.7 cells. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that bacteria are highly sensitive to low concentrations of Cu+ in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (22.Elzanowska H. Wolcott R.G. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and we confirmed these findings in our study (Fig. 1B). These data underscored the possibility that the enhanced bactericidal activity conferred by the copper treatment of macrophages may be dependent on reactive oxygen species. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that pretreating the RAW264.7 macrophage cells with ebselen, a cell-permeable glutathione peroxidase mimetic, prevented the copper-mediated increase in bactericidal activity (Fig. 1C). Ebselen treatments did not alter the rate of phagocytosis of E. coli compared with control RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that copper can promote the bactericidal activity of RAW264.7 macrophages in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Since copper was found to potentiate the bacteridical activity of RAW264.7 cells, we investigated whether copper homeostasis might be altered in these cells following stimulation with proinflammatory agents. Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with the proinflammatory agents, IFN-γ or LPS, stimulated copper uptake activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis indicated that these effects of IFN-γ and LPS were associated with a dose-dependent increase in the expression of the copper importer, CTR1 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings suggest that the inflammatory response of macrophages stimulates CTR1-mediated copper uptake. We then investigated the effect of proinflammatory agents on another copper transporter, ATP7A, a copper-transporting P-type ATPase responsible for delivering copper from the cytoplasm into secretory compartments. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that both IFN-γ and LPS treatments increased the expression of ATP7A protein in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). A closely related copper transporter to ATP7A, known as ATP7B, was not expressed in these cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the stimulation of macrophages by LPS or IFN-γ promotes copper uptake and increases expression of CTR1 and ATP7A proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that elevated intracellular copper levels stimulate the trafficking of the ATP7A protein from the trans-Golgi network to post-Golgi vesicles in a variety of cell types (26.Cobbold C. Ponnambalam S. Francis M.J. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27.Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 28.Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29.Monty J.F. Llanos R.M. Mercer J.F. Kramer D.R. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 2762-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given that IFN-γ or LPS stimulated copper uptake and increased cellular copper levels, we surmised that these proinflammatory agents might also stimulate ATP7A trafficking. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, the ATP7A protein was identified in the perinuclear region of untreated RAW264.7 macrophages, consistent with its location in the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 4, top panels). As expected, the addition of copper to the culture medium stimulated the trafficking of ATP7A to post-Golgi vesicles (Fig. 4, second from top panels). Interestingly, when RAW264.7 cells were exposed to IFN-γ or LPS without copper supplementation, the ATP7A protein was also distributed to post-Golgi vesicles, although these punctae were not as clearly associated with the cell periphery as in the case of copper treatment (Fig. 4, third and fourth from top panels). The location of the Golgi matrix marker protein, GM130, was not altered by IFN-γ or LPS, suggesting that the shift in ATP7A distribution was not the result of general Golgi disruption (Fig. 4). Because the trafficking of ATP7A is known to be responsive to copper, we examined whether these effects of IFN-γ could be inhibited using the membrane-permeable copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). The treatment of RAW264.7 cells with TTM blocked IFN-γ-stimulated trafficking of ATP7A, consistent with a role for copper in this trafficking process (Fig. 5A). Importantly, Western blot analysis of these same cells demonstrated that the increased expression of ATP7A in response to either IFN-γ or LPS was not blocked by TTM (Fig. 5B). This finding indicated that the inhibition of trafficking by TTM was not due to suppression of ATP7A expression. In support of this conclusion, ATP7A trafficking was apparent within 3 h of IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 6A), whereas the increases in ATP7A protein expression required a longer time period (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 5The trafficking of ATP7A in response to IFN-γ is copper-dependent. A, IFN-γ-induced trafficking of ATP7A is inhibited by the copper chelator TTM. RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of IFN-γ with or without 10 nm TTM. ATP7A protein was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy after cells were fixed, permeabilized, and probed with antibodies against ATP7A and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (green). B, tetrathiomolybdate does not inhibit the increase in ATP7A protein expression during inflammation. RAW264.7 were treated for 24 h with serum-free medium alone or the same medium containing 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 ng/ml IFN-γ in the presence or absence of 10 nm TTM.

The phagocytosis of latex beads was used to identify phagosomes in IFN-γ-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 7A, Bright field), and ATP7A was then detected in the same cells using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7B). There was clear labeling of ATP7A outlining the periphery of compartments that also contained the internalized beads, suggesting the presence of ATP7A within phagosomes in IFN-γ-treated cells (Fig. 7B). In separate experiments, phagosomal membranes were purified from IFN-γ-treated RAW264.7 cells by subcellular fractionation of membranes containing the internalized latex beads. Immunoblot analysis of this fraction demonstrated a marked enrichment of the phagolysosomal marker LAMP-1 relative to total cell lysates, as well as abundant levels of ATP7A protein (Fig. 7C). The phagosomal fraction lacked the Golgi marker protein, GM130, indicating that the detection of ATP7A in these fractions was not an artifact of Golgi contamination (Fig. 7C). Further studies investigated whether ATP7A partially colocalized with a constitutively active mutant of Rab7, a GTPase involved in late endosome fusion and required for lysosomal biogenesis (30.Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 31.Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 32.Méresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. Gorvel J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The constitutively active mutant Rab7-Q67L is useful for co-localization studies because it results in enlarged lysosomal structures (30.Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged Rab7-Q67L and then exposed for 24 h to basal medium or medium containing 25 ng/ml IFN-γ. As shown in Fig. 7, in untreated cells there was little overlap between the perinuclear location of ATP7A and Rab7-Q67L-containing compartments (Fig. 7D). However, in cells stimulated with IFN-γ, the ATP7A protein was found to partially overlap with Rab7-Q67L-containing compartments (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these studies suggest that IFN-γ activation of macrophages is associated with partial redistribution of ATP7A to the phagolysosomal compartment. The above findings highlight the possibility that ATP7A-dependent copper transport into the phagosome might be important for macrophage microbiocidal activity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of RNAi-mediated depletion of ATP7A on bacterial killing in RAW264.7 cells. Stable transfection of a 29-nucleotide short hairpin RNAi plasmid against ATP7A resulted in robust silencing of ATP7A gene expression (ATP7A RNAi cells), relative to control cells transfected with an irrelevant RNAi against green fluorescent protein (Fig. 8A). We then confirmed that ATP7A-dependent copper transport was suppressed in the ATP7A RNAi cells by testing the activity of copper-dependent enzyme, ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase whose expression is stimulated by IFN-γ. As expected, ceruloplasmin protein expression was stimulated by IFN-γ in both ATP7A RNAi and control cells (Fig. 8B). Because ceruloplasmin activity requires copper transport into secretory compartments, it can serve as a biomarker of ATP7A function. As shown in Fig. 8C, ceruloplasmin activity was markedly reduced in the ATP7A RNAi cells treated with IFN-γ, suggesting that the ATP7A-dependent copper delivery to ceruloplasmin was reduced in these cells. Control experiments confirmed this by showing that ceruloplasmin activity could be restored after the addition of excess exogenous copper to ATP7A RNAi cells to bypass ATP7A-mediated copper transport (Fig. 8C). Having confirmed a reduction in ATP7A-mediated copper transport activity in the ATP7A RNAi cells, we examined this effect on bacterial killing. E. coli killing experiments demonstrated a higher bacterial survival in ATP7A RNAi cells relative to control cells (Fig. 8D). This defect in bacterial killing was bypassed by pretreatment of ATP7A RNAi cells with excess exogenous copper, indicating that the reduced bacterial killing was attributable to a copper transport defect rather than an unrelated defect in the ATP7A-depleted cells (Fig. 8D). These findings support the hypothesis that ATP7A-dependent copper transport into the phagosome is important for the bactericidal activity of macrophages. We further explored the role of copper homeostasis in bactericidal killing by testing whether the ability of E. coli to export copper might influence its susceptibility to killing by RAW264.7 macrophages. The ΔcopA mutant strain of E. coli is hypersensitive to elevated copper concentrations due to the role of the CopA protein in the extrusion of copper from the cytoplasm (33.Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The CopA protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase belonging to the same subfamily as the ATP7A protein. The ΔcopA mutant was markedly more susceptible to killing by RAW264.7 macrophages compared with its parental wild type E. coli strain (Fig. 9A). Significantly, the susceptibility of the ΔcopA strain was dependent on ATP7A protein in the macrophage host because its survival was increased in ATP7A RNAi cells relative to control cells (Fig. 9B). Collectively, these data suggest that bacterial CopA and mammalian ATP7A are unique determinants of macrophage-dependent bacterial killing and identify an unexpected role for copper in host-pathogen interactions. Copper has long been recognized as a biocidal agent. Its modern day use in algaecides, fungicides, antimicrobial surfaces, and medical devices can be traced back to its early use in the treatment of wounds by ancient Egyptian and Roman civilizations (34.Dollwet H.H.A. Sorenson J.R.J. Trace Elem. Med. 1985; 2: 80-87Google Scholar). In this study, we identify for the first time that specific changes in macrophage copper homeostasis mediate bacterial killing. Macrophage activation by proinflammatory agents triggered increased copper uptake activity and a striking copper-dependent relocalization of the ATP7A protein to a vesicular distribution, which partially overlapped with the phagosomal compartment. In support of this trafficking event, a recent analysis of the macrophage phagosomal proteome identified ATP7A in this compartment (35.Shui W. Sheu L. Liu J. Smart B. Petzold C.J. Hsieh T.Y. Pitcher A. Keasling J.D. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16952-16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Significantly, macrophage-mediated bacterial killing was dependent on the expression of the ATP7A copper transporter, as evidenced by the attenuated bactericidal activity when ATP7A was silenced. These findings suggest that copper transport into the phagosome via the ATP7A protein is a novel determinant of bacterial killing by macrophages. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies using x-ray microprobe analysis have demonstrated that copper levels within the phagosome increase 10-fold to ∼180 μm in IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages exposed to M. avium (18.Wagner D. Maser J. Lai B. Cai Z. Barry 3rd, C.E. Höner Zu Bentrup K. Russell D.G. Bermudez L.E. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). How might this enrichment of copper promote bacterial killing by macrophages? One possibility is the copper-catalyzed production of the hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide via Fenton-like chemistry. Although hydrogen peroxide is generated spontaneously from superoxide created by the respiratory burst, it is only lethal to bacteria at supraphysiological millimolar concentrations (36.Liu X. Zweier J.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, physiological concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and cuprous ions are lethal to E. coli (22.Elzanowska H. Wolcott R.G. Hannum D.M. Hurst J.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Iron-mediated hydroxyl radical production is also toxic to bacteria in vitro (37.Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar); however, a role for iron in macrophage bactericidal activity is unlikely because iron accumulation in the phagosome is decreased in IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages, and iron treatment of macrophages reduces bactericidal activity (38.Nairz M. Fritsche G. Brunner P. Talasz H. Hantke K. Weiss G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 1923-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These findings, together with those of our study, suggest that a lethal combination of copper and hydrogen peroxide may be the underlying mechanism by which ATP7A-dependent copper transport into the phagosome promotes bacterial killing. An important finding of our study was that the copper-sensitive ΔcopA mutant of E. coli was more susceptible to macrophage-mediated killing than the wild type strain. Because the CopA protein functions in the extrusion of cytoplasmic copper across the plasma membrane (33.Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that copper export is a bacterial defense mechanism against macrophage-mediated killing. Consistent with this hypothesis, the susceptibility of the ΔcopA mutant to killing was ameliorated by depletion of ATP7A in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. These findings suggest that copper transport by both host and pathogen is a unique and mutually opposing tactic in the struggle for supremacy; i.e. ATP7A-mediated copper transport into the phagosome appears to be countered by copper extrusion by the bacterium. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that copper export might be a defense strategy that is generally applicable to other pathogenic bacteria. For example, the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice is severely decreased (20-fold) by mutations in the copper exporter, CueA (39.Schwan W.R. Warrener P. Keunz E. Stover C.K. Folger K.R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2005; 295: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additionally, the expression of several metal ion exporters, including two putative copper efflux transporters, CopA1 and CopA2, are induced in Legionella pneumophila upon phagocytosis by macrophages (40.Rankin S. Li Z. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3637-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasmids that increase the virulence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella sonnei harbor putative copper resistance genes (41.Jiang Y. Yang F. Zhang X. Yang J. Chen L. Yan Y. Nie H. Xiong Z. Wang J. Dong J. Xue Y. Xu X. Zhu Y. Chen S. Jin Q. Plasmid. 2005; 54: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42.Chen Y.T. Chang H.Y. Lai Y.C. Pan C.C. Tsai S.F. Peng H.L. Gene. 2004; 337: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In light of our findings, it is notable that bacterial infections, especially those of the respiratory tract, are commonly reported in infants with Menkes disease, in whom genetic mutations in the ATP7A gene give rise to copper deficiency (43.Kreuder J. Otten A. Fuder H. Tümer Z. Tønnesen T. Horn N. Dralle D. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 44.Gunn T.R. Macfarlane S. Phillips L.I. Clin. Pediatr.

Bruck I. Paola L. Silvado C.E. Werneck L.C. Arq. Neuropsiquiatr. 2007; 65: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether this susceptibility to infections arises from defects in ATP7A-dependent activities of macrophages or impairment of other copper-requiring processes. Deciphering the role of ATP7A in innate immunity in vivo will require myeloid-specific ATP7A knock-out mice, which we are currently generating. It is notable that changes in the serum concentration of micronutrients following infection are characteristic of the acute phase inflammatory response. Serum levels of iron, zinc, selenium, retinol, riboflavin, and pyridoxine are all reported to decrease following inflammatory insult (47.Prentice A.M. Ghattas H. Cox S.E. J. Nutr. 2007; 137: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The proposed physiological rationale for these changes is nutrient deprivation to limit proliferation of the invading microbe (47.Prentice A.M. Ghattas H. Cox S.E. J. Nutr. 2007; 137: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A well documented example is the contest between host and pathogen over limiting iron stores, which plays a critical role in determining the outcome of infection (48.Doherty C.P. J. Nutr. 2007; 137: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, systemic copper concentrations are widely reported to increase in response to acute and chronic inflammation (49.Auer D.E. Ng J.C. Thompson H.L. Inglis S. Seawright A.A. Vet.

Although the secreted copper-containing protein, ceruloplasmin, is partially responsible for this rise in serum copper (66.Fox P.L. Mukhopadhyay C. Ehrenwald E. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the non-protein-bound fraction of copper in the serum is also increased during inflammation (49.Auer D.E. Ng J.C. Thompson H.L. Inglis S. Seawright A.A. Vet. Rec. 1989; 124: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, radiotracer studies with 64Cu have demonstrated that copper accumulates at sites of inflammation (67.Beveridge S.J. Garrett I.R. Whitehouse M.W. Vernon-Roberts B. Brooks P.M. Agents Actions. 1985; 17: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and within the exudates of wounds and burns where there exists an abundance of macrophages (68.Voruganti V.S. Klein G.L.

Our findings underscore the possibility that these changes in systemic copper concentrations may provide localized reserves of copper for macrophage-mediated bactericidal activity.

Cellular responses may not only depend on the chemical composition or molecular properties of the amyloid fibrils, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effect of fragmentation on the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. In addition to the expected relationship between fragmentation and the ability to seed, we show a striking finding that fibril length correlates with the ability to disrupt membranes and to reduce cell viability. Thus, despite otherwise unchanged molecular architecture, shorter fibrillar samples show enhanced cytotoxic potential than their longer counterparts. The results highlight the importance of fibril length in amyloid disease, with fragmentation not only providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased but also creating fibrillar species of different dimensions that can endow new or enhanced biological properties such as amyloid cytotoxicity.

IntroductionAmyloid fibril deposits are associated with numerous disorders, including type II diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (1.Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). These proteinaceous fibrillar aggregates are commonly regarded as the self-assembly end products of peptides or proteins that form by nucleated polymerization (2.Ferrone F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Despite sharing a common cross-β molecular architecture, fibrils of different morphologies and/or superstructural features can be formed, even from the same starting material (3.Gosal W.S.

Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), typically accumulate during fibril formation. It has also been shown that mechanical stress can affect the products of fibril assembly, producing fibrils of different dimensions and/or molecular structure even under otherwise identical conditions (3.Gosal W.S.

Nature. 2008; 451: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The species involved in mediating the cytotoxicity associated with many amyloid disorders were initially assumed to be fibrils and fibril plaques that are abundant in diseased tissues (16.Campbell A.

Alzheimers Dis. 2004; 6: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, numerous recent reports have focused on soluble prefibrillar oligomers as the primary cytotoxic species (for example, Refs. 9.Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar, 10.Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Despite significant evidence supporting prefibrillar oligomeric species as toxic agents, examples of toxicity associated with fibrils persist (e.g. Refs. 13.Gharibyan A.L. Zamotin V. Yanamandra K.

This raises the possibility that the determinants of cytotoxicity may not always be associated with the same type of species, and for some amyloidogenic proteins, fibrils themselves or fibril-associated species may possess cytotoxic potential (19.Paravastu A.K. Qahwash I. Leapman R.D. Meredith S.C. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7443-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).

Salamon Z. Lindblom G. Gröbner G. Tollin G. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), result in the release of cytotoxic species (14.Martins I.C. Kuperstein I. Wilkinson H. Maes E. Vanbrabant M. Jonckheere W. Van Gelder P. Hartmann D. D'Hooge R. De Strooper B. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas the assembly process of islet amyloid polypeptide (also known as amylin) fibrils on lipid membranes results in liposome disruption, suggesting fibril-associated toxicity during the fibril growth process (21.Engel M.F. Khemtémourian L. Kleijer C.C. Meeldijk H.J. Jacobs J. Verkleij A.J. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Höppener J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6033-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that fibrils should perhaps not be dismissed as the inert products of amyloid assembly but might provide a further source of toxicity, either directly by interacting with membranes or indirectly by acting as a source of cytotoxic entities.How fibrils elicit a biological response may not only depend on their chemical composition or molecular properties, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles, as found for other nanoscale materials (22.Colvin V.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 23.Lynch I. Dawson K.A. Linse S. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: pe14PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we report here a detailed analysis of the relation between fibril length, quantified using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM), and the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. Using long straight (LS) fibrils formed from human β2-microglobulin (β2m) (3.Gosal W.S. Morten I.J. Hewitt E.W. Smith D.A. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 850-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we show that samples containing these fibrils can disrupt model liposome membranes and reduce cell viability, whereas prefibrillar oligomeric species formed in the lag phase of assembly and fibrillar aggregates with different structural properties (3.Gosal W.S. Morten I.J. Hewitt E.W. Smith D.A. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 850-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 7.Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) do not. Strikingly, we show that the cytotoxicity displayed by the LS fibril samples is enhanced by reducing fibril length, supporting the idea that the physical dimensions of fibrils can also modulate their cytotoxic potential. The same length-dependent effect is also observed with fibrils formed from lysozyme and α-synuclein, suggesting that reduction of fibril length by fragmentation presents a generic mechanism by which fibril-associated cytotoxicity, i.e. cytotoxicity caused by fibrils themselves or by species dynamically associated with fibrils through direct exchange, could be enhanced. These results not only demonstrate the cytotoxic potential associated with fibrillar samples, but more importantly, reveal that fibril breakage can enhance toxic responses in cells, even for fibrils that have identical molecular architecture. Fibril fragmentation therefore poses a double threat in amyloid disease, providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased, as well as a route by which amyloid cytotoxicity may be enhanced. The results may provide a rationale of the varied cellular responses to fibrils of apparently identical chemical composition and suggest that targeting amyloid fibril stability against breakage may be a powerful strategy for developing therapies against amyloid disease.

Despite significant evidence supporting prefibrillar oligomeric species as toxic agents, examples of toxicity associated with fibrils persist (e.g. Refs. 13.Gharibyan A.L. Zamotin V. Yanamandra K.

This raises the possibility that the determinants of cytotoxicity may not always be associated with the same type of species, and for some amyloidogenic proteins, fibrils themselves or fibril-associated species may possess cytotoxic potential (19.Paravastu A.K.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas the assembly process of islet amyloid polypeptide (also known as amylin) fibrils on lipid membranes results in liposome disruption, suggesting fibril-associated toxicity during the fibril growth process (21.Engel M.F.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6033-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that fibrils should perhaps not be dismissed as the inert products of amyloid assembly but might provide a further source of toxicity, either directly by interacting with membranes or indirectly by acting as a source of cytotoxic entities.How fibrils elicit a biological response may not only depend on their chemical composition or molecular properties, but their physical attributes such as length, width, or surface area may also play important roles, as found for other nanoscale materials (22.Colvin V.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 23.Lynch I. Dawson K.A. Linse S. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: pe14PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we report here a detailed analysis of the relation between fibril length, quantified using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM), and the structural and biological properties of amyloid fibrils. Using long straight (LS) fibrils formed from human β2-microglobulin (β2m) (3.Gosal W.S. Morten I.J. Hewitt E.W. Smith D.A. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 850-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we show that samples containing these fibrils can disrupt model liposome membranes and reduce cell viability, whereas prefibrillar oligomeric species formed in the lag phase of assembly and fibrillar aggregates with different structural properties (3.Gosal W.S.

Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) do not. Strikingly, we show that the cytotoxicity displayed by the LS fibril samples is enhanced by reducing fibril length, supporting the idea that the physical dimensions of fibrils can also modulate their cytotoxic potential. The same length-dependent effect is also observed with fibrils formed from lysozyme and α-synuclein, suggesting that reduction of fibril length by fragmentation presents a generic mechanism by which fibril-associated cytotoxicity, i.e. cytotoxicity caused by fibrils themselves or by species dynamically associated with fibrils through direct exchange, could be enhanced. These results not only demonstrate the cytotoxic potential associated with fibrillar samples, but more importantly, reveal that fibril breakage can enhance toxic responses in cells, even for fibrils that have identical molecular architecture. Fibril fragmentation therefore poses a double threat in amyloid disease, providing a mechanism by which fibril load can be rapidly increased, as well as a route by which amyloid cytotoxicity may be enhanced. The results may provide a rationale of the varied cellular responses to fibrils of apparently identical chemical composition and suggest that targeting amyloid fibril stability against breakage may be a powerful strategy for developing therapies against amyloid disease. Amyloid fibril deposits are associated with numerous disorders, including type II diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (1.Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). These proteinaceous fibrillar aggregates are commonly regarded as the self-assembly end products of peptides or proteins that form by nucleated polymerization (2.Ferrone F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Despite sharing a common cross-β molecular architecture, fibrils of different morphologies and/or superstructural features can be formed, even from the same starting material (3.Gosal W.S.

Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), typically accumulate during fibril formation. It has also been shown that mechanical stress can affect the products of fibril assembly, producing fibrils of different dimensions and/or molecular structure even under otherwise identical conditions (3.Gosal W.S.

Because of the enormous complexity and heterogeneity in the dynamic equilibrium between different species populated during amyloid formation, the identity of the culprits of cytotoxicity associated with amyloid disease remains far from clear despite a plethora of studies in recent years (for example, Refs. 9.Kayed R.

Yet, the specific targets of these enzymes are not clear, with marked discrepancies being reported in the literature. We demonstrate that NSD2 can exhibit disparate target preferences based on the nature of the substrate provided. The NSD2 complex purified from human cells and recombinant NSD2 both exhibit specific targeting of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) when provided with nucleosome substrates, but histone H4 lysine 44 is the primary target in the case of octamer substrates, irrespective of the histones being native or recombinant. This disparity is negated when NSD2 is presented with octamer targets in conjunction with short single- or double-stranded DNA. Although the octamers cannot form nucleosomes, the target is nonetheless nucleosome-specific as is the product, dimethylated H3K36. This study clarifies in part the previous discrepancies reported with respect to NSD targets. We propose that DNA acts as an allosteric effector of NSD2 such that H3K36 becomes the preferred target.

Among the array of posttranslational histone modifications that feature prominently in the regulation of chromatin structure and function is lysine methylation. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) 3The abbreviations used are: HKMThistone lysine methyltransferaseH3K36histone H3 lysine 36H4K44histone H4 lysine 44H3K4Me3trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4CBBCoomassie Brilliant Bluedsdouble-strandedoligooligonucleotideGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolABalkylation bufferMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightSAMS-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-l-methionineMSmass spectrometrysiRNAsmall interfering RNA. target specific histone residues, and depending on their substrate specificity and their catalytic properties, the resulting products are mono-, di-, or trimethylated versions of lysine residues. A large body of work has correlated the status of histone lysine methylation as well as the extent of such methylation (mono, di, or tri) with certain cellular processes that include transcriptional regulation. Recent genome-wide studies have mapped the level of transcription as a function of the presence and position of specific states of histone lysine methylation within genes. For example, the levels of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) were elevated surrounding the transcriptional start sites of genes and positively correlated with transcription, whereas H3K36me3 signals were sharply elevated downstream of the transcriptional start site, peaking at the 3′-end in active genes. On the other hand, the presence of H3K27me3 correlated with transcriptional repression (1.Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K. Cell. 2007; 129: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4937) Google Scholar). histone lysine methyltransferase histone H3 lysine 36 histone H4 lysine 44 trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 Coomassie Brilliant Blue double-stranded oligonucleotide glutathione S-transferase phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol alkylation buffer matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-l-methionine mass spectrometry small interfering RNA. Lysine 20 of histone H4 is also subject to methylation, but its outcome with respect to transcription is not predictable. Recent studies have demonstrated that monomethylation of this residue (H4K20me1) is important for chromosome organization and compaction (2.Oda H. Okamoto I. Murphy N. Chu J. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Torres-Padilla M.E. Heard E. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2278-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), yet this mark has also been detected on transcriptionally active genes. A likely explanation for these observations is that a histone modification in isolation might not necessarily be predictive of an outcome. Other modifications, such as methylation itself, acetylation, and/or phosphorylation of residues within the nucleosome(s) (or neighboring nucleosomes constituting a “chromatin domain”) likely contribute to the output of a specific histone modification. Although the extent of methylation serves as recognition sites for binding proteins containing specific domains (chromo, plant homeo domain fingers, malignant brain tumor repeats, Tudor, and others), the amino acids surrounding a specific lysine methylation site also confer specificity. Similarly, other modifications present on other residues in the nucleosome(s) can promote or prevent binding of factors to a specific modified lysine residue. Thus, the substrate specificity and resulting products of a given histone lysine methyltransferase, together with other modifications, are critical to fully understanding its role in chromatin-related functions. The mammalian NSD family of SET domain-containing methyltransferases includes NSD1, NSD2 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1/MMSET (multiple myeloma SET domain)), and NSD3 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 like). The SET domain of NSD proteins shares sequence similarity with SET2, the sole H3K36 methyltransferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SET2 binds to and migrates with elongating RNA polymerase II, catalyzing the formation of H3K36me3 along the coding region of actively transcribed genes (3.Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4974-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that Mes-4 is responsible for all H3K36me2 in early embryos (11.Bender L.B. Suh J.

Given these findings, the NSD methyltransferases would be expected to be H3K36-specific. Yet other reports indicated discrepancies in this regard. For example, NSD1 has been reported to dimethylate H3K36 and H4K20 (12.Huang N. vom Baur E. Garnier J.M. Lerouge T. Vonesch J.L. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R.

Of note, disruption of NSD protein integrity or of its proper expression in human cells has been linked to several diseases. Haploinsufficiency of NSD1 leads to Sotos syndrome, a childhood developmental disease characterized by overgrowth and mental retardation (18.Douglas J. Hanks S. Temple I.K. Davies S. Murray A.

Similarly, NSD2 is deleted in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome characterized by developmental defects and mental retardation (20.Stec I. Wright T.J. van Ommen G.J. de Boer P.A. van Haeringen A. Moorman A.F.

Additionally, chromosome translocation resulting in NUP98 fusion to NSD1 (22.Wang G.G. Cai L. Pasillas M.P. Kamps M.P. Nat.

Blood. 2008; 111: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, NSD3 is amplified in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast carcinomas (26.Angrand P.O. Apiou F. Stewart A.F. Dutrillaux B. Losson R. Chambon P. Genomics. 2001; 74: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Yet little is currently known regarding the mechanism of action and the functional role(s) of the NSD proteins. As a first step toward understanding the biological impact of NSD proteins, we characterized their methyltransferase activities. Using recombinant NSD1–3 SET domain-containing proteins, we find that NSD1–3 are highly specific H3K36 dimethylases when nucleosomes are used as substrates. However, in the case of histone octamers, multiple residues are targeted, and this phenomenon is suppressed by the presence of short DNA molecules such that the specificity observed with nucleosomes is rescued. A human complex containing full-length NSD2 and associated polypeptides recapitulates the activity observed with nucleosomes and the recombinant NSD2-SET domain protein. Antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-H3K36me1 (Upstate; antibody 07-548), anti-H3K36me2 (Cell Signaling; antibody 2901), anti-H3K36me3 (Abcam; ab9050), anti-H3K27me3 (Abcam; antibody ab6002), anti-H4K20me1 (Abcam; antibody ab9051), anti-H4K20me2 (Upstate; antibody 07-367), anti-H4K20me3 (Abcam; antibody ab9053), anti-NSD1 antibody (Bethyl; antibody BL715), and anti-β-tubulin (Abcam; antibody ab6046). Anti-NSD2 is a polyclonal antibody derived from rabbit immunized with recombinant NSD2 (NP_001035889; amino acids 310–540). IgG were purified by protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). cDNA of NSD1-SET (NP_071900; amino acids 1849–2094) was cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and cDNA of NSD2-SET (NP_001035889; amino acids 941–1240) and NSD3-SET (NP_001035889; amino acids 1021–1320) were cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA for SET2 (Q9BYW2; 1373–2564 amino acids) was cloned into the EcoRI site of pFastBac (Invitrogen). Point mutations of histones H3 and H4 were made based on the Xenopus laevis-like histone H3 expression vector pET3-H3 (AJ556872.1) and the X. laevis-like histone H4 expression vector pET3-H4 (AJ556873.1), respectively, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST-SET domain fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli after the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 17 °C overnight, and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.2 mm PMSF). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione beads (General Electric Healthcare) overnight and washed with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer plus 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). The eluates were analyzed by CBB staining. The eluates containing the protein of interest were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (General Electric Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The fusion proteins were pooled and dialyzed against BC100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT). SET2-C was expressed in baculovirus inset cells and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAR and RXR were coexpressed using baculovirus and purified by M2 anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) (27.Dilworth F.J. Fromental-Ramain C. Remboutsika E. Benecke A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recombinant histone octamers were prepared as described previously (28.Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J.

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus histones were expressed in E. coli individually and then pooled at an equal molar ratio in the denatured state and renatured by dialysis. Octamers were then purified from H3-H4 tetramers and H2A-H2B dimers via gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column. HeLa core histones were prepared as described previously (30.Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were assembled using pG5E4 plasmid and octamers by step salt dialysis as described (28.Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J.

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Histone H3 premethylated at lysine 36 was prepared by installing methyl-lysine analogs on recombinant histones by a chemical reaction as described previously (31.Simon M.D. Chu F. Racki L.R. de la Cruz C.C. Burlingame A.L. Panning B. Narlikar G.J. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2007; 128: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, H3K36C-C110A was generated by quick change PCR on a plasmid encoding histone H3 C110A. H3K36C-C110A was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS at 37 °C for 4 h (induction at A600 = 0.6 with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). Histone-containing inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. After exchanging guanidine hydrochloride for 7 m urea by dialysis, the histones were further purified by sequential anion and cation exchange column chromatography. The histone solutions were loaded onto a 5-ml Q and a SP Sepharose column assembled inline. The Q Sepharose column was then removed, and the protein was eluted from the SP Sepharose column using a linear gradient of NaCl from 100 to 500 mm in the urea buffer (7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Histone-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lyophilized. The lyophilized H3K36C-C110A to be modified (5–10 mg) was weighed into 1.5 ml of siliconized microcentrifuge tubes and 950 μl of alkylation buffer (AB) (4 m guanidinium chloride, 1 m Hepes, pH 7.8, and 10 mm d/l-methionine, pH 7.8; the solution was passed through a 0.22-micron filter and purged with argon prior to use) was added. When solubilization of the protein presented a problem, the protein mixture would be sonicated for 10–15 min in a Branson 1510 ultrasonic cleaning bath at ambient temperature. The resultant clear colorless solution was treated with 20 μl of a 1 m DTT solution in AB prepared just prior to use and agitated at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of this period the reactions were alkylated in the following manner. The histones were treated with the appropriate nitrogen mustard ((ϕK-Me1), 100 μl of a 1 m N-methylaminoethyl chloride hydrochloride solution in AB; (ϕK-Me2), 50 μl of a 1 m 2-(dimethylamine) ethyl chloride hydrochloride solution in AB; and (ϕK-Me3), 100 mg of (2-bromoethyl) trimethylammonium bromide as solid) and agitated in the absence of light at either 25 °C (ϕK-Me2) or 50 °C (ϕK-Me1, ϕK-Me3). After 2 h, the ϕK-Me2 reaction was treated with 10 μl of a 1 m solution of DTT. After 2.5 h, a second portion of alkylating reagent was added to the ϕK-Me2 reaction (50 μl), and a second portion of DTT (10 μl) was added to the ϕK-Me1 and ϕK-Me3 reactions. The mixtures were then agitated in the dark at their respective temperatures for an additional 2.5 h. At the end of this period the reactions were then quenched with 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μl), cooled to room temperature, diluted to 2.5 ml with AB, purified by gel filtration through a PD-10 column (equilibrated with 0.1% BME in 18 Ω water) according to the manufacturer's protocol for centrifugal isolation, and lyophilized. A portion of each (∼0.1 mg) was analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to ensure product identity and homogeneity. A typical methyltransferase assay was carried out in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.35 μm of histone octamers or nucleosomes, 0.15 μm of GST-SET domain fusion proteins, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 1 μl of S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-l-methionine ([3H[SAM, 50–85 Ci/mmol, 0.55 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 20 μm unlabeled SAM (Sigma), for 1 h at 30 °C. Synthesized short DNA was supplied in some assays at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends and text. The plus strand sequence of the 41-bp DNA was 5′-CTCTCTTTGAGGACACCAACCTGGCGGCCATCCACGCCAAG-3′. The NSD2 complex was used in place of the SET domain in some assays as indicated. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the reaction were products separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with CBB, sprayed with 3H-ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed by fluorography. In some assays, [3H]SAM was replaced with unlabeled SAM (final concentration, 200 μm), and standard Western blot was performed using the antibodies specified. The methyltransferase assay was carried out as described above using unlabeled SAM, and the reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB. The histones were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, destained, and then digested in-gel at 37 °C for 5 h with chymotrypsin (for H3; Roche Applied Science), Arg-C (for H4; Roche Applied Science), or Asp-N (for H4; Roche Applied Science) at 20 ng/μl. The digestion buffer for chymotrysin and Arg-C was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm CaCl2. The digestion buffer for Asp-N was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The resulting peptides were extracted and dried under vacuum. Reverse phase C18 ZipTip microcolumns (Millipore) were used to desalt the samples. 10–25% of the desalted digests were submitted for the MALDI-TOF MS or tandem MS analyses using either a Waters (Milford, MA) MALDI Q-TOF Ultima or a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer using standard operating parameters. The signals from 500 to 1000 laser shots were summed into each mass spectrum. HT1080 cells stably expressing FLAG- and Myc-tagged NSD2 (NP_001035889) were established with the murine stem cell virus retroviral system using puromycin selection. Nuclear extract from 1 × 109 cells was incubated overnight at 4 °C with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in the same buffer as nuclear extract (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture). The resin was washed with excess amounts of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 350 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm PMSF), and the bound proteins were eluted with wash buffer plus 0.2 mg/ml 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG or anti-NSD2 antibodies followed by silver staining. DNA oligos and proteins were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 100 mm NaCl in a total volume of 20 μl at 4 °C for 30 min. The products of the reaction were analyzed by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37.5:1) using 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm glycine. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) for DNA detection and then with CBB for protein detection. The 41-bp dsDNA and the NSD2-SET domain used in the HKMT assay were used for the gel shift assay. RAR/RXR and oligo containing the RAR-RXR-specific DNA-binding sequence were used as positive controls (27.Dilworth F.J. Fromental-Ramain C. Remboutsika E. Benecke A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The plus strand sequence for the RAR/RXR oligo is 5′-GCAATTAAAGATGAACTTTGGGTGAACTAATTTGTCTG-3′. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA oligos at a 10 nm final concentration by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and analyzed after 72 h. The upper strand sequences of the siRNA oligos against NSD2 (Qiagen) were as follows: 5′-AACGGCCAGAACAAGCUCUUA-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCGGAAGAGTCTTCAA-3′. The upper strand sequence of the control siRNA oligo was 5′-UAACGACGCGACGACGUAATT-3′. Nuclear extracts of the treated cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-NSD2 antibody. Histones were acid-extracted following the protocol from Abcam. The levels of histone modifications were analyzed by Western blot using the antibodies specified. Three highly related NSD proteins exist in human cells, and each contains a SET domain at the C terminus that is homologous to that of SET2 (Fig. 1A, left panel). Toward analyzing NSD substrate specificity, each SET domain was independently fused to GST, expressed in bacteria, purified (Fig. 1A, right panel, and see “Experimental Procedures”), and analyzed for HKMT activity. The well characterized HKMTs, SET2 and PR-Set7 that target H3K36me3 and H4K20me1, respectively, served as controls. With recombinant nucleosomes as substrate, the SET domains of NSD1–3 and SET2 targeted H3 (Fig. 1B). Of note, the lower signal detected in the NSD2 and SET2 HKMT assay performed with recombinant nucleosomes was not directed toward H4 but toward a slower migrating species that we have identified to be a proteolyzed form of H3 by Western blot (see below). In contrast to recombinant nucleosomes in which only H3 was targeted, when recombinant octamers were used as substrate the NSD1-SET domain targeted H3, H2A/H2B, and H4, whereas the NSD2-SET domain mainly targeted H4 with very weak activity on H3 (Fig. 1B). NSD3 and SET2 activity remained specific for H3. We then determined the exact lysine targeted by the different NSD-SET domain-containing proteins using recombinant nucleosomes reconstituted with H3 polypeptides carrying a single substitution at particular methylation sites. As controls, we included PR-Set7 and SET2. NSD-SET domain-containing proteins displayed activity toward nucleosomal H3 in the wild type case as did SET2, as expected (Fig. 1C, left panel). Although the specific activity varied among the different NSD polypeptides, none of the NSD-SET domain-containing proteins nor SET2 displayed activity in the case of nucleosomes carrying an H3K36 to A mutation (Fig. 1C). This substrate was successfully targeted for methylation by PR-SET7, however. Other lysine to alanine substitutions such as H3K4A, H3K9A, or H3K27A did not affect the activity of the NSD proteins (data not shown; see below). These results collectively suggest that the NSD-SET domain-containing proteins specifically methylate nucleosomal H3K36. However, with recombinant octamers as substrate, these SET domain-containing proteins exhibited disparate specificities. We next investigated whether the presence of DNA, a discriminating feature of nucleosomes versus octamers, influences the disparate catalysis/specificity exhibited by NSD1 and NSD2. We observed that different single- or double-stranded polynucleotides stimulated NSD1 and NSD2 activity when octamers were used as substrate (data not shown; see below). The observed stimulation appeared to be DNA sequence independent and was not due to the formation of nucleosomes, because the size of the DNA fragments utilized precluded this. We selected a double-stranded 41-bp DNA fragment for further studies. As shown above (Fig. 1B), using octamers in the absence of nucleic acid, NSD1 or NSD2 displayed activity toward H3, H2A/H2B, and H4 or primarily H4, respectively (Fig. 2A). Upon addition of increasing amounts of short DNA fragment, NSD1 and NSD2 activity toward H4 was eliminated, and that toward H3 was increased in a DNA-dose dependent manner (Fig. 2A). NSD1 activity toward H2A/H2B required higher DNA concentrations to be inhibited. We next analyzed the residue targeted by NSD2 as a function of the presence of DNA using octamers carrying independently an alanine substitution of H3K27, H3K36, or H4K20 as substrate (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the findings obtained above in the case of nucleosomes, NSD2 displayed activity toward octamers containing H3K36 in the presence of DNA (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, in the absence of DNA, NSD2 activity directed toward H4 in octamers was not affe"
https://openalex.org/W2143300823,"Intermediate filaments (IFs), in addition to microtubules and microfilaments, are one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells, playing a vital role in mechanotransduction and in providing mechanical stability to cells. Despite the importance of IF mechanics for cell biology and cell mechanics, the structural basis for their mechanical properties remains unknown. Specifically, our understanding of fundamental filament properties, such as the basis for their great extensibility, stiffening properties, and their exceptional mechanical resilience remains limited. This has prevented us from answering fundamental structure-function relationship questions related to the biomechanical role of intermediate filaments, which is crucial to link structure and function in the protein material's biological context. Here we utilize an atomistic-level model of the human vimentin dimer and tetramer to study their response to mechanical tensile stress, and describe a detailed analysis of the mechanical properties and associated deformation mechanisms. We observe a transition from alpha-helices to beta-sheets with subsequent interdimer sliding under mechanical deformation, which has been inferred previously from experimental results. By upscaling our results we report, for the first time, a quantitative comparison to experimental results of IF nanomechanics, showing good agreement. Through the identification of links between structures and deformation mechanisms at distinct hierarchical levels, we show that the multi-scale structure of IFs is crucial for their characteristic mechanical properties, in particular their ability to undergo severe deformation of ≈300% strain without breaking, facilitated by a cascaded activation of a distinct deformation mechanisms operating at different levels. This process enables IFs to combine disparate properties such as mechanosensitivity, strength and deformability. Our results enable a new paradigm in studying biological and mechanical properties of IFs from an atomistic perspective, and lay the foundation to understanding how properties of individual protein molecules can have profound effects at larger length-scales."
https://openalex.org/W1966976273,"Most apicomplexan parasites harbor a relict chloroplast, the apicoplast, that is critical for their survival. Whereas the apicoplast maintains a small genome, the bulk of its proteins are nuclear encoded and imported into the organelle. Several models have been proposed to explain how proteins might cross the four membranes that surround the apicoplast; however, experimental data discriminating these models are largely missing. Here we present genetic evidence that apicoplast protein import depends on elements derived from the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system of the endosymbiont. We identified two sets of ERAD components in Toxoplasma gondii, one associated with the ER and cytoplasm and one localized to the membranes of the apicoplast. We engineered a conditional null mutant in apicoplast Der1, the putative pore of the apicoplast ERAD complex, and found that loss of Der1(Ap) results in loss of apicoplast protein import and subsequent death of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2109621677,"Electrophilic fatty acid derivatives, including nitrolinoleic acid and nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2), can mediate anti-inflammatory and pro-survival signaling reactions. The transcription factor Nrf2, activated by electrophilic fatty acids, suppresses redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory gene expression and protects against vascular endothelial oxidative injury. It was therefore postulated that activation of Nrf2 by OA-NO2 accounts in part for its anti-inflammatory actions, motivating the characterization of Nrf2-dependent and -independent effects of OA-NO2 on gene expression using genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Control and Nrf2-small interfering RNA-transfected human endothelial cells were treated with vehicle, oleic acid, or OA-NO2, and differential gene expression profiles were determined. Although OA-NO2 significantly induced the expression of Nrf2-dependent genes, including heme oxygenase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, the majority of OA-NO2-regulated genes were regulated by Nrf2-independent pathways. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the heat shock response is the major pathway activated by OA-NO2, with robust induction of a number of heat shock genes regulated by the heat shock transcription factor. Inasmuch as the heat shock response mediates anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions, this mechanism is proposed to contribute to the protective cell signaling functions of nitro-fatty acids and other electrophilic fatty acid derivatives.

Inasmuch as the heat shock response mediates anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions, this mechanism is proposed to contribute to the protective cell signaling functions of nitro-fatty acids and other electrophilic fatty acid derivatives. Nitration products of unsaturated fatty acids are formed via NO-dependent oxidative reactions (1.Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Post-translational modification of signaling proteins by nitroalkenes mediates a component of observed anti-inflammatory actions. For example, LNO2 and OA-NO2 inhibit nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling via inhibiting p65 DNA binding and suppression of pro-inflammatory target gene expression in monocytes and human endothelial cells (7.Cui T. Schopfer F.J. Zhang J. Chen K. Ichikawa T. Baker P.R. Batthyany C. Chacko B.K. Feng X. Patel R.P. Agarwal A. Freeman B.A. Chen Y.E. J. Biol.

Inhibition of p65 also contributes to the protective actions of OA-NO2 in focal cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (3.Rudolph V. Rudolph T.K. Schopfer F.J. Bonacci G. Woodcock S.R. Cole M.P. Baker P.R.

NF-κB inhibition is a property shared by other electrophilic lipid oxidation products, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (8.Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H.

In addition to inhibiting inflammatory signaling, electrophilic lipid oxidation products such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 and 4-hydroxynonenal, as well as the nitroalkene LNO2, activate nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a member of the cap ‘n’ collar family of basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors and a mediator of antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzyme expression (10.Levonen A.L.

Upon electrophile exposure, Nrf2 protein stabilizes, translocates to the nucleus, heterodimerizes with other basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors (preferentially small Maf proteins), and binds to the antioxidant-response element (ARE), a common regulatory element found in the promoter regions of antioxidant and detoxication enzymes (12.Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). Activity of Nrf2 is tightly regulated by Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which binds to Nrf2 and directs it to Cullin-3-dependent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation under homeostatic conditions. Upon exposure to electrophiles, reactive Keap1 thiols are adducted, dissociating Nrf2 from ubiquitin E3 ligase complex and facilitating nuclear accumulation and downstream effects on gene transcription (12.Kensler T.W. Wakabayashi N. Biswal S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 89-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). Nrf2 regulation of antioxidant and phase II enzymes underscores a broader impact on the regulation of inflammatory processes. Nrf2-deficient mice display more pronounced inflammation in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema than wild type mice (13.Rangasamy T. Guo J. Mitzner W.A. Roman J. Singh A. Fryer A.D. Yamamoto M.

Moreover, Nrf2 is a critical regulator of innate immune response in sepsis (15.Thimmulappa R.K. Lee H. Rangasamy T. Reddy S.P. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Biswal S. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 attenuates acute inflammation in a carrageenan-induced pleurisy model in wild type, but not Nrf2-deficient, mice (16.Itoh K. Mochizuki M. Ishii Y.

From a cardiovascular perspective, vascular endothelial cell overexpression of Nrf2 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α-induced expression of the proinflammatory mediators VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) (17.Chen X.L.

Nrf2 is also activated by atheroprotective laminar flow (18.Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y. Thomas S. Cook C.K. Wasserman M.A. Medford R.M. Jaiswal A.K. Kunsch C. J. Biol.

Finally, in vivo gene transfer of Nrf2 reduces inflammation in the balloon-denuded rabbit artery (22.Levonen A.L. Inkala M. Heikura T. Jauhiainen S. Jyrkkänen H.K. Kansanen E. Määttä K. Romppanen E.

In addition to the ARE-regulated stress response, cells have other integrated stress-response pathways triggered by endogenous stimuli or environmental stresses. The heat shock response (HSR) is an ordered response to a wide array of acute and chronic stress conditions. HSR is regulated at the transcriptional level by heat shock factors (HSF). Upon activation, HSF undergoes multistep processing involving post-translational modifications, nuclear enrichment, trimerization, and binding to heat shock elements resulting in transcription of a large family of heat shock genes. Many of the proteins encoded by heat shock genes function as chaperones, proteases, or other proteins essential for protection of the cell against proteotoxic stress (23.Westerheide S.D. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33097-33100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The notion that both nitroalkene fatty acid derivatives and Nrf2 display anti-inflammatory effects motivated the hypothesis that the immune modulatory actions of nitro-fatty acids are largely attributable to Nrf2. We thus determined the gene expression profile of human endothelial cells exposed to OA-NO2, and we evaluated Nrf2-dependent and -independent effects by genome-wide transcriptional profiling of cells transfected with Nrf2-specific or control siRNA. The results reveal that Nrf2 plays only a minor role in the gene regulation mediated by OA-NO2, with the heat shock response being the major activated pathway. OA-NO2 was prepared as described previously (24.Baker P.R. Lin Y. Schopfer F.J. Woodcock S.R. Groeger A.L. Batthyany C. Sweeney S. Long M.H. Iles K.E. Baker L.M. Branchaud B.P. Chen Y.E. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42464-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The synthetic nitration product of OA-NO2 used in the study was an equimolar distribution of 9- and 10-nitro-octadeca-9-enoic acid (supplemental Fig. S1). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cords obtained from the maternity ward of the Kuopio University Hospital by the approval of the Kuopio University Hospital Ethics Committee. HUVECs were cultivated as described previously (10.Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides targeting Nrf2, HSF1, and a nonspecific RNA control were obtained from Invitrogen. Four specific siRNA sequences targeting Nrf2 and two HSF1 siRNAs were tested prior to experimentation. The sequences of the most efficient siRNAs were as follows: Nrf2, 5′-UGA CAG AAG UU GAC AAU UA-3′, and HSF1, 5′-GCT CAT TCA GTT CCT GAT CTT-3′. For the experiments, HUVECs were seeded on 6-well plates or 10-cm plates at the density of 150,000 or 900,000 cells/well, respectively, and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were transfected with 50 or 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cells were treated with OA-NO2 or OA for up to 48 h for quantitative real time PCR, Western blot, or Affymetrix analyses. HUVECs were collected and RNA extracted with TRI Reagent® (Sigma). For the cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was used using random hexamer primers (Promega) and Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes). The relative expression levels of Nrf2 (NFE2L2), HO-1 (HMOX1), GCLM, NQO1, HSPA1A, DNAJA4, HSPB8, HSPA6, and HSF1 mRNA in HUVECs were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol with quantitative real time PCR (ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detector, Applied Biosystems) using specific assays-on-demand (Applied Biosystems) target mixes. The expression levels were normalized to β2-microglobulin expression and presented as fold change in the expression versus control. Cells were lysed, and total protein concentration was measured with BCA assay (Pierce). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated with NE-PER cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction reagents (Pierce). For electrophoresis, 10 μg of protein was used. The proteins were electrophoresed on a Tris/glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The primary antibodies used for detection were rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 (Assay Designs), anti-GCLM (10.Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D.

Protein expression was quantified with ImageQuant TL 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (25.Jyrkkänen H.K. Kansanen E. Inkala M. Kivelä A.M. Hurttila H. Heinonen S.E. Goldsteins G. Jauhiainen S. Tiainen S. Makkonen H. Oskolkova O. Afonyushkin T. Koistinaho J. Yamamoto M. Bochkov V.N. Ylä-Herttuala S. Levonen A.L. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: e1-e9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation against HSF1, the anti-HSF1 antibody (Cell Signaling) was used. The forward and reverse primers used for PCR amplification were as follows: HSP70 forward, 5′-CCA TGG AGA CCA ACA CC CT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCC TGG GCT TTT ATA AGT CG-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-AAC TCT CCC TCC TCC TCT TCC TC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAG CCA TAA AAG GCA ACT TTC GG-3′. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism, and the data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc comparisons. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. For the microarray experiment, HUVECs pooled from three separate donors were transfected with 50 nm Nrf2-siRNA or a nonspecific control siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were treated with methanol (vehicle), 3 μm OA, or 3 μm OA-NO2 for 8 h. Triplicate samples were used. Total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent® (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amounts and purity of total RNAs were measured with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE). The probes for gene expression analysis were made according to the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, total RNA was reverse-transcribed to double strand cDNA. The double strand cDNA was purified and transcribed in vitro to biotin-labeled cRNA. Twenty micrograms of purified cRNA were fragmented, and the fragmentation was checked on agarose gel electrophoresis. The cRNA was hybridized to Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The chips were stained, washed (Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400), and scanned (Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray data were extracted from the scanned images by using MAS 5.1 software (Affymetrix). GeneChip operating software (Affymetrix) was used to generate CEL files. Quantile inter-array data normalization was carried out using CARMAweb (26.Rainer J. Sanchez-Cabo F. Stocker G. Sturn A. Trajanoski Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W498-W503Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Primary statistical comparisons were done by using a Bayesian one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey HSD (R/Bioconductor) (27.Long A.D. Mangalam H.J. Chan B.Y. Tolleri L. Hatfield G.W. Baldi P. J. Biol.

Yekutieli D. Benjamini Y. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Criteria for significance are as follows: false discovery rate (Benjamini/Hochberg) <5%; post hoc p value <0.05; and >1.5-fold intensity differences between different treatment groups.

LNO2 induces HO-1, a well characterized Nrf2 target gene, in endothelial cells (9.Wright M.M. Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R. Vidyasagar V. Powell P. Chumley P. Iles K.E. Freeman B.A. Agarwal A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine whether the more stable mono-unsaturated OA-NO2 also induces HO-1 as well as other ARE-regulated genes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), HUVECs were treated with 0–5 μm OA-NO2 for 8 h, and target gene expression was determined via quantitative real time PCR. OA-NO2 induced the mRNA expression of all three genes in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of GCLM and NQO1 by 3 μm OA-NO2 was not statistically significant (Fig. 1A). However, in another set of experiments, in which the time-dependent changes in gene expression was assessed, 3 μm OA-NO2 significantly induced all three genes after 8 h, with the induction of NQO1 occurring later and sustaining longer than the other two genes (Fig. 1B). The discrepancy is likely due to donor-specific differences in gene expression obtained from a single donor. OA-NO2 also induced HO-1, GCLM, and NQO1 protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The maximum induction was observed at 12 h for HO-1 and at 24 h for GCLM and NQO1 (Fig. 1D). Having established the optimal time and concentration for the induction of HO-1, GCLM, and NQO1 by OA-NO2, the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of these genes was examined using siRNA to inhibit Nrf2 expression. Optimal siRNA concentration and transfection times were established, and it was observed that transfection with 50 nm Nrf2-specific siRNA for 24 h resulted in 85% silencing of Nrf2 mRNA expression and 89% silencing at the protein level under basal conditions, with no further suppression at higher siRNA concentrations or longer transfection times. (Fig. 2, A and B, and results not shown). Moreover, control or Nrf2-specific siRNA did not cause an interferon response, assessed by 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS) and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) mRNA expression (results not shown). Both OA-NO2-inducible mRNA and protein expression of HO-1, GCLM, and NQO1 were significantly inhibited in cells transfected with Nrf2-siRNA (Fig. 2, A and C). To further validate that OA-NO2 activates ARE-dependent genes, the NQO1 ARE luciferase reporter vector and a vector in which the core ARE was mutated (25.Jyrkkänen H.K. Kansanen E. Inkala M. Kivelä A.M. Hurttila H. Heinonen S.E. Goldsteins G. Jauhiainen S. Tiainen S. Makkonen H. Oskolkova O. Afonyushkin T. Koistinaho J. Yamamoto M. Bochkov V.N. Ylä-Herttuala S. Levonen A.L. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: e1-e9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were transfected into HUVECs, and luciferase activity was assessed. OA-NO2, but not OA, activated the ARE of the NQO1 gene (supplemental Fig. S2A). Luciferase expression was abolished when the core ARE was mutated (supplemental S2A). Chromatin immunoprecipitation supported the binding of Nrf2 to the NQO1 and HO-1 promoters. Treatment with OA-NO2 increased Nrf2 binding to the NQO1 promoter area 477 bp upstream of the transcription start site-containing canonical ARE site (31.Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) as well as the distal enhancer region of HO-1 gene that contains multiple antioxidant-response-like elements (supplemental Fig. S2B) (32.Banning A. Deubel S. Kluth D. Zhou Z. Brigelius-Flohé R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4914-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the effect of OA-NO2 on the global gene expression profile in human endothelial cells and to more incisively define the role of Nrf2 in mediating these effects, we employed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of cells transfected with either control or Nrf2-specific siRNA and then exposed to vehicle, 3 μm OA, or OA-NO2 for 8 h. Under all conditions, no differences in cell injury or morphology were detected (data not shown). Initial transcriptome analyses comparing OA-NO2-treated cells with OA-treated and untreated cells revealed that mRNA expression levels were altered by OA-NO2 treatment with a high degree of significance (supplemental Table S1). Of these genes, 363 genes were up-regulated and 103 were down-regulated by OA-NO2. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the mRNA expression (Fig. 3A) illustrated that OA-NO2 specifically altered the expression of these genes, whereas OA had no effect. Of significance, within a sub-cluster of 50 genes with an elevated mRNA expression after OA-NO2 treatment (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S1), eight of the genes with the greatest induction were heat shock proteins. To assess the role of Nrf2 in gene expression changes evoked by OA-NO2, differential gene expression of OA-NO2-induced versus siNrf2-silenced HUVECs was compared (Fig. 4). In all treatment groups combined, silencing of Nrf2 by siRNA resulted in 78% down-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S3). Of the two datasets, only 43 genes were overlapping, 31 of which were up-regulated by OA-NO2 and repressed by siNrf2 (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S1). This gene subset contained several previously characterized Nrf2 target genes, including ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), and glutathione reductase (GSR), but the overall low number of genes indicates that other Nrf2-independent pathways play a significant role in mediating OA-NO2-dependent gene transcription. To define other transcriptional pathways important for OA-NO2-dependent gene regulation, transcriptomes were analyzed by GSEA to assess whether certain transcription factor-binding sites are over-represented within the promoter regions of the genes elevated by OA-NO2 in comparison with OA-treated and -untreated cells, respectively. In addition to Nrf2 and highly homologous MafG-binding sites, GSEA revealed binding sites for cell stress-related transcription factors, specifically HSF1, HSF2, and AP1 (activator protein 1), which were highly represented among OA-NO2-induced genes (supplemental Table S2). In this analysis, 50% of enriched transcription factor-binding sites were HSF-binding sites, indicating that the HSR pathway is the most pronounced response pathway in endothelial cells exposed to OA-NO2. Detailed analysis revealed a large number of HSF1/2 target genes within the OA-NO2-induced transcriptome, including such well characterized HSF target genes as HSPA6 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 6, also known as HSP70B′), HSPA1A (heat shock 70-kDa protein 1A, also known as HSP72, HSPA1, HSP70I, HSPA1B, HSP70-1, and HSP70-1A), and DNJA4 (DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily A, member 4) (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table S3). Of note, with the exception of HO-1, which has previously been shown to be regulated by HSF1 on exposure to cadmium (33.Koizumi S. Gong P. Suzuki K. Murata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8715-8723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), silencing of Nrf2 had no impact on basal or inducible expression of HSF1 and HSF2 target genes (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B), indicating that the OA-NO2-mediated HSR is independent of Nrf2. Quantitative real time PCR was utilized to select for and validate HSP genes showing the greatest induction by OA-NO2. Incubation with 3 μm OA-NO2 induced HSPA1A, DNAJA4, HSPB8, and HSPA6 mRNA in a time-dependent manner, with maximum induction occurring at 4–8 h (Fig. 6A). Inasmuch as HSPA1A (inducible HSP70) is the HSP most often used as an indicator of HSR, HSP70 expression was also evaluated at the protein level. OA-NO2 increased HSP70 protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and C). Moreover, OA-NO2 treatment of control or HSF1 siRNA-transfected HUVECs revealed that HSF1-siRNA decreased HSF1 mRNA by 77% and HSF1 protein by 76%, quantified by densitometry (Fig. 7, A and B). The silencing of HSF1 caused a reduction of HSP70 expression at both mRNA (77%) and protein (64%) levels, affirming HSF-dependent regulation (Fig. 7, A and B).

Similarly to OA-NO2, heat shock also induced HSP70 mRNA and protein significantly, and the expressions were reduced in HSF1 siRNA-transfected cells by 85 and 81%, respectively.FIGURE 7OA-NO2 induces HSP70 expression via HSF1.

Innate immunity is thus essential to defend the lungs against these pathogens. This defense is mediated in part through the recognition of specific microbial ligands by Toll-like receptors (TLR) of which there are at least 10 in humans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main pathogen that infects the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Based on whole animal experiments, using TLR knockout mice, the control of this bacterium is believed to occur by the recognition of LPS and flagellin by TLRs 2,4 and 5, respectively.In the present study, we investigated in vitro the role of these same TLR and ligands, in alveolar macrophage (AM) and epithelial cell (EC) activation. Cellular responses to P. aeruginosa was evaluated by measuring KC, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and G-CSF secretion, four different markers of the innate immune response. AM and EC from WT and TLR2, 4, 5 and MyD88 knockout mice for were stimulated with the wild-type P. aeruginosa or with a mutant devoid of flagellin production.The results clearly demonstrate that only two ligand/receptor pairs are necessary for the induction of KC, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 synthesis by P. aeruginosa-activated cells, i.e. TLR2,4/LPS and TLR5/flagellin. Either ligand/receptor pair is sufficient to sense the bacterium and to trigger cell activation, and when both are missing lung EC and AM are unable to produce such a response as were cells from MyD88(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2145781865,"A wide array of fluorescent proteins (FP) is present in anthozoans, although their biochemical characteristics and function in host tissue remain to be determined. Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses.The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H(2)O(2) scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H(2)O(2) scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H(2)O(2) with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts.Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H(2)O(2) scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color. This study documents H(2)O(2) scavenging of scleractinian FPs, a novel biochemical characteristic, both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins. These data support a role for FPs in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi-functionality of these conspicuous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2050154888,"Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxins are used worldwide as insecticides in agriculture, in forestry, and in the control of disease transmission vectors. In the lepidopteran Manduca sexta, cadherin (Bt-R(1)) and aminopeptidase-N (APN) function as Cry1A toxin receptors. The interaction with Bt-R(1) promotes cleavage of the amino-terminal end, including helix alpha-1 and formation of prepore oligomer that binds to APN, leading to membrane insertion and pore formation. Loops of domain II of Cry1Ab toxin are involved in receptor interaction. Here we show that Cry1Ab mutants located in domain II loop 3 are affected in binding to both receptors and toxicity against Manduca sexta larvae. Interaction with both receptors depends on the oligomeric state of the toxin. Monomers of loop 3 mutants were affected in binding to APN and to a cadherin fragment corresponding to cadherin repeat 12 but not with a fragment comprising cadherin repeats 7-12. In contrast, the oligomers of loop 3 mutants were affected in binding to both Bt-R(1) fragments but not to APN. Toxicity assays showed that either monomeric or oligomeric structures of Cry1Ab loop 3 mutations were severely affected in insecticidal activity. These data suggest that loop 3 is differentially involved in the binding with both receptor molecules, depending on the oligomeric state of the toxin and also that possibly a ""ping pong"" binding mechanism with both receptors is involved in toxin action."

The mechanism by which the bacterium colonizes the gut during infection is poorly understood but undoubtedly involves protein components within the surface layer (S-layer), which play a role in adhesion. In C. difficile, the S-layer is composed of two principal components, the high and low molecular weight S-layer proteins, which are formed from the post-translational cleavage of a single precursor, SlpA. In the present study, we demonstrate that a recently characterized cysteine protease, Cwp84 plays a role in maturation of SlpA. Using a gene knock-out approach, we show that inactivation of the Cwp84 gene in C. difficile 630ΔErm results in a bacterial phenotype in which only immature, single chain SlpA comprises the S-layer. The Cwp84 knock-out mutants (CDΔCwp84) displayed significantly different colony morphology compared with the wild-type strain and grew more slowly in liquid medium. SlpA extracted from CDΔCwp84 was readily cleaved into its mature subunits by trypsin treatment. Addition of trypsin to the growth medium also cleaved SlpA on CDΔCwp84 and increased the growth rate of the bacterium in a dose-dependent manner. Using the hamster model for C. difficile infection, CDΔCwp84 was found to be competent at causing disease with a similar pathology to the wild-type strain. The data show that whereas Cwp84 plays a role in the cleavage of SlpA, it is not an essential virulence factor and that bacteria expressing immature SlpA are able to cause disease.

https://openalex.org/W2043749435,"Background Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a common childhood disorder that encompasses a range of sleep-related upper airway obstruction. Children with SDB demonstrate significant neurocognitive deficits. Adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for SDB and whilst this improves respiratory disturbance, it remains to be established whether neurocognitive gains also result. Methods A total of 44 healthy snoring children aged 3–12 years awaiting adenotonsillectomy (SDB group), and 48 age and gender matched non-snoring controls from the general community, completed the study. All children underwent polysomnography and neurocognitive assessment at baseline and after a 6-month follow-up (after surgery in the snoring group). Our primary aim was to determine whether neurocognitive deficits in snoring children were significantly improved following adenotonsillectomy. Results Wide ranging neurocognitive deficits were found at baseline in SDB children compared to controls, most notably a 10 point IQ difference (P<.001) and similar deficits in language and executive function. Whilst adenotonsillectomy improved respiratory parameters and snoring frequency at 6 months post surgery, neurocognitive performance did not improve relative to controls. Conclusion Adenotonsillectomy successfully treated the respiratory effects of SDB in children. However, neurocognitive deficits did not improve 6-months post-operatively."

Methodology/Principal Findings We have characterized the regional expression profiles of miRNAs in five distinct regions of the adult rat brain: amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and substantia nigra. Microarray profiling uncovered 48 miRNAs displaying more than three-fold enrichment between two or more brain regions. Notably, we found reciprocal expression profiles for a subset of the miRNAs predominantly found (> ten times) in either the cerebellum (miR-206 and miR-497) or the forebrain regions (miR-132, miR-212, miR-221 and miR-222). Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that some miRNAs could be important for area-specific functions in the brain. Our data, combined with previous studies in mice, provides additional guidance for future investigations of miRNA functions in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2028993817,"Background Therapeutic potential was evaluated in a rat model of myocardial infarction using nanofiber-expanded human cord blood derived hematopoietic stem cells (CD133+/CD34+) genetically modified with VEGF plus PDGF genes (VIP). Methods and Findings Myocardial function was monitored every two weeks up to six weeks after therapy. Echocardiography revealed time dependent improvement of left ventricular function evaluated by M-mode, fractional shortening, anterior wall tissue velocity, wall motion score index, strain and strain rate in animals treated with VEGF plus PDGF overexpressed stem cells (VIP) compared to nanofiber expanded cells (Exp), freshly isolated cells (FCB) or media control (Media). Improvement observed was as follows: VIP>Exp> FCB>media. Similar trend was noticed in the exercise capacity of rats on a treadmill. These findings correlated with significantly increased neovascularization in ischemic tissue and markedly reduced infarct area in animals in the VIP group. Stem cells in addition to their usual homing sites such as lung, spleen, bone marrow and liver, also migrated to sites of myocardial ischemia. The improvement of cardiac function correlated with expression of heart tissue connexin 43, a gap junctional protein, and heart tissue angiogenesis related protein molecules like VEGF, pNOS3, NOS2 and GSK3. There was no evidence of upregulation in the molecules of oncogenic potential in genetically modified or other stem cell therapy groups. Conclusion Regenerative therapy using nanofiber-expanded hematopoietic stem cells with overexpression of VEGF and PDGF has a favorable impact on the improvement of rat myocardial function accompanied by upregulation of tissue connexin 43 and pro-angiogenic molecules after infarction."

Virus-induced steatosis is a cytopathic effect of HCV replication. The goal of this study was to examine the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced lipid metabolic defects in a transgenic mouse model expressing the full HCV protein repertoire at levels corresponding to natural human infection. In this model, expression of the HCV full-length open reading frame was associated with hepatocellular steatosis and reduced plasma triglyceride levels. Triglyceride secretion was impaired, whereas lipogenesis was activated. Increased lipogenic enzyme transcription was observed, resulting from maturational activation and nuclear translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c).

In conclusion, transgenic mice expressing the HCV full-length polyprotein at low levels have decreased plasma triglyceride levels and develop hepatocellular steatosis in the same way as HCV-infected patients.

Approximately 20% of patients develop cirrhosis, with a subsequent risk of lethal complications such as end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (1.The NIH Consensus Development PanelHepatology. 2002; 36: S3-S20PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic HCV infection is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in industrialized countries. Chronic hepatitis C is curable in about 50% of cases with a combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (1.The NIH Consensus Development PanelHepatology. 2002; 36: S3-S20PubMed Google Scholar). New drugs, and particularly specific inhibitors of HCV functions, are in preclinical and clinical development (2.Pawlotsky J.M. Chevaliez S. McHutchison J.G.

Chronic HCV infection is also associated with altered lipid metabolism, resulting in low serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and betalipoprotein levels (3.Serfaty L. Andreani T. Giral P. Carbonell N.

Hepatocellular steatosis, i.e. excessive triglyceride accumulation within lipid droplets in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, is frequent in chronic hepatitis C (6.Bach N. Thung S.N. Schaffner F. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Steatosis may be due to metabolic disorders in overweight patients or those with diabetes, dyslipidemia, and/or chronic alcohol consumption (metabolic steatosis). It may also be directly related to virus replication (virus-induced steatosis), and both forms may be present together. Metabolic steatosis behaves in a similar way as in non-HCV-infected patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or alcoholic liver disease and appears to influence the outcome of chronic liver disease and undermine the effectiveness of antiviral therapy (7.Castéra L. Hézode C. Roudot-Thoraval F. Bastie A. Zafrani E.S. Pawlotsky J.M. Dhumeaux D. Gut. 2003; 52: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8.Serfaty L. Mathurin P. Cadranel J.F. Tran A. Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. 2007; 31: 4S40-4S43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus-induced steatosis is a cytopathic effect of HCV replication, but the precise underlying mechanisms are controversial. The influence of virus-induced steatosis on the outcome of liver disease and the response to therapy is unclear. Although HCV-induced steatosis is mostly seen in patients with HCV genotype 3a infection, in whom it correlates directly with the level of viral replication, cases have been reported in patients infected with other genotypes (9.Castera L. Chouteau P. Hezode C. Zafrani E.S. Dhumeaux D. Pawlotsky J.M. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 100: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10.Hezode C. Roudot-Thoraval F. Zafrani E.S. Dhumeaux D. Pawlotsky J.M. J. Viral Hepatitis. 2004; 11: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reasons for these genotype differences are unclear. The level of virus expression required for excessive triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes may be lower in genotype 3 HCV infection. Viral interaction with host lipid metabolism appears to be essential for the HCV cell cycle. Indeed, HCV replication occurs in association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes and lipid droplets, and localization of the HCV core and nonstructural 5A (NS5A) proteins to lipid storage organelles plays an important role (11.Boulant S. Targett-Adams P. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 2204-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12.Miyanari Y. Atsuzawa K. Usuda N. Watashi K. Hishiki T. Zayas M. Bartenschlager R.

Bartenschlager R. PLoS Pathogens. 2008; 4: e1000035Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We recently showed that HCV core protein alters lipid droplet morphology (15.Piodi A. Chouteau P. Lerat H. Hézode C. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Whether or not these effects play a role in hepatocellular steatosis is unclear. However, HCV protein expression has been shown to induce steatosis in transgenic mice. In particular, we have previously shown that expression of the full HCV open reading frame at physiological levels triggers hepatocellular steatosis in C57BL6 mice (16.Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J. Yang Y. Okuda M. Gosert R. Xiao S.Y. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 352-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). HCV protein expression thus appears sufficient to induce hepatocellular steatosis in the absence of infectious virus production. HCV protein expression might: (i) induce de novo triglyceride synthesis; (ii) reduce cellular triglyceride excretion; (iii) alter triglyceride oxidation; and/or (iv) increase triglyceride uptake from serum. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. They are synthesized as precursor proteins bound to the ER. The SREBP1c isoform is predominant in the liver and enhances the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Foreign protein synthesis inside host cells creates nonspecific stress that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). During the UPR, SREBP1c is matured by two successive cleavage steps, and its transcription factor domain relocates to the nucleus, where it up-regulates numerous genes involved in lipid synthesis and maturation. However, the effect of HCV proteins on these processes is largely unknown. The goal of this study was to examine the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced lipid metabolic defects in a transgenic mouse model expressing the full HCV protein repertoire at levels corresponding to chronic human infection. Animal housing was conducted in accordance with the Direction des Services Vétérinaires, Ministère de l'Agriculture of France, with European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC and with the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations for the health monitoring recommendations. Eight- to nine-month-old C57BL6 male mice transgenic for the HCV full-length open reading frame (FL-N/35 lineage) (16.Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J. Yang Y. Okuda M. Gosert R.

Age-matched wild type male littermates were used as controls. The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had free access to water and a regular diet (D04 from SAFE, Augy, France: 6.1% carbohydrate, 3.1% fat, and 15.8% protein). All of the procedures conformed to official French guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. After sacrifice by CO2 intoxication, the liver tissue fragments were either immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for analysis or fixed overnight (∼16 h) in neutral buffered formalin before transfer to 70% ethanol and embedding in paraffin. Sections 4–5 μm thick were deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. Frozen tissue sections were stained with Oil-Red-O dye to identify neutral lipids. As previously described (17.Perlemuter G. Sabile A. Letteron P. Vona G. Topilco A. Chrétien Y. Koike K. Pessayre D. Chapman J. Barba G. Bréchot C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), serum triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (apoB) were quantified immediately before and 4 h after intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg of Triton WR 1339 (Tyloxapol; Sigma) in 24 h fasted mice by using the Trinder Enzymatic method for triglycerides (Biotrol, Earth City, MO) and kit 357 for apoB (Sigma). Microsomal triglyceride transfer (MTP) protein activity was measured with a fluorometric assay (MTP kit; Roar Biomedical, New York, NY) that detects MTP-mediated transfer of neutral lipids in cell lysates or tissue homogenates, following the manufacturer's instructions. The liver samples were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), benzamidine (1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml). MTP assay was performed by incubating 100 μg of liver protein homogenate (MTP source) with donor and acceptor solutions for 4 h at 37 °C. MTP activity was determined by measuring fluorescence at 465 nm (excitation) and 538 nm (emission). Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers as previously described (18.Hegarty B.D. Bobard A.

RNA quality and quantity were determined using a 2100 Bioanalyser and RNA Nano Chips (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA integrity number was calculated using the Agilent software, and samples displaying a RNA integrity number below 6 were discarded (see supplemental Table S1). One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript IITM enzyme (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative PCR was performed with 25 ng of cDNA and 250 nm sense and antisense primers (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl, using the qPCR Core Kit (Eurogentec) and the MyiQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Specific primers were designed with Primer Express software (Table 1).

The PCR conditions are described in the Ron lab website. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from livers of wild type and transgenic mice by using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (Pierce), following the manufacturer's instructions. For microsomal extracts, mouse liver was homogenized in sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2 protease inhibitors). The homogenate was centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Isolated microsomes were resuspended in microsomal extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl2,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors). The protein concentration was measured in the extracts by means of the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins (20–70 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibodies against SREBP1 clone 2A4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (Imgenex, San Diego, CA), and X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) (Prosci Inc., Poway, CA); rat polyclonal antibodies against immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphoprotein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and phospho-(Ser51)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), total Akt/protein kinase B, and eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Labeled antibodies were detected with the ECL Plus or Advance detection kits (GE Healthcare). A polyclonal mouse lamin A/C antibody (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), calnexin, and β-actin were used as loading controls for nuclear extracts, microsomal fractions, and total lysates, respectively. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. The Fisher-Yates Terry or Mann-Whitney nonparametric rank tests were used, as appropriate. Quantitative results are presented as box plots (median and 95th percentiles). Steatosis was scored after hematoxylin-eosin and Oil-Red-O staining of liver tissues. Steatosis was considered absent, mild, moderate, and severe when 0, <30, 30–60, and >60%, respectively, of hepatocytes were positively stained. Although C57Bl6 mice have a natural propensity to develop liver steatosis (19.Blake W.L. Ulrich R.G. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1257-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), moderate to severe hepatocellular steatosis was more frequent in FL-N/35 transgenic mice than in controls (78% versus 29%, p < 0.01). This finding confirmed that the colony housed and fed as described above developed the same phenotype as initially reported (16.Lerat H. Honda M. Beard M.R. Loesch K. Sun J. Yang Y. Okuda M. Gosert R. Xiao S.Y. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 352-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In addition, plasma triglyceride levels were moderately but significantly lower in transgenic mice than in controls (0.77 ± 0.04 versus 0.86 ± 0.04 g/liter, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A, left panel). Triglycerides are secreted from liver cells as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. Hepatic VLDL secretion was assessed in fasted mice by measuring the increase in plasma triglyceride and apoB levels after lipoprotein lipase inhibition by Triton WR 1339. As shown in Fig. 1A, Triton treatment substantially increased the plasma triglyceride level. Plasma triglyceride levels were ∼30% lower in FL-N/35 transgenic mice than in controls (7.7 ± 0.4 versus 10.0 ± 0.5 g/liter, p < 0.002), pointing to defective VLDL secretion (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by the significantly lower plasma level of apoB (a protein mainly present in VLDL and LDL) in transgenic mice than in controls after Triton treatment (2.5 ± 0.2 versus 3.7 ± 0.3 g/L, p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). MTP plays a key role in cotranslocational lipidation of apoB as it enters the ER lumen (thus preventing apoB degradation) and participates in the conversion of a precursor particle to VLDL by the addition of bulk triglycerides. As shown in Fig. 1B, MTP activity was significantly lower in crude liver extracts from FL-N/35 transgenic mice than from controls (p < 0.05), confirming the impaired triglyceride excretion. To determine whether the lipogenic pathway is activated in HCV transgenic mice, hepatic transcriptional levels of genes coding for various enzymes involved in lipogenesis were compared with values in nontransgenic controls. These genes included ATP citrate-lyase, fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme, and hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1. Transcript levels of all these enzymes were higher in transgenic mice than in controls, as measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2A). The difference was statistically significant for ATP citrate-lyase, FAS, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (fold increase compared with the mean values in nontransgenic animals: 2.2 ± 0.6, p = 0.01; 2.9 ± 0.7, p = 0.02; and 2.0 ± 0.4, p = 0.02 respectively), whereas a consistent but nonsignificant trend was observed for acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malic enzyme. FAS protein expression, quantified by Western blotting of mouse liver extracts, was significantly higher in the liver of FL-N/35 transgenic mice than in controls (Fig. 2B). Together, these results suggest that the lipogenic pathway is activated in the liver of transgenic mice expressing the HCV full-length open reading frame. In the liver, lipogenic enzymes are transcriptionally regulated by insulin and glucose via the actions of two transcription factors: SREBP1c and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). To assess SREBP1c expression, nuclear and microsomal protein fractions were purified from liver extracts of transgenic and nontransgenic animals and were analyzed by Western blotting. Lamin A/C and calnexin served as loading controls for the nuclei and microsomes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, microsomal fractions from transgenic and nontransgenic animals contained similar amounts of SREBP1c precursor. In contrast, mature cleaved SREBP1c was substantially more abundant in nuclear extracts from transgenic animals than from controls (Fig. 3A), suggesting that increased lipogenic enzyme transcription in HCV transgenic mice resulted from activation and nuclear translocation of SREBP1c. The expression of ChREBP, a transcription factor involved in the activation of glycolytic and lipogenic genes, was not modulated by the HCV transgene (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, the level of SREBP1c mRNA was slightly but not significantly higher in the liver of transgenic mice than in controls (fold increase compared with the mean control value: 1.3 ± 0.2 versus 1.0 ± 0.1, p = 0.39), suggesting that SREBP1c activation by HCV proteins occurs during protein maturation rather than through increased transcription. Similarly, the expression of ChREBP transcripts was not modulated by the HCV transgene (Fig. 3B). Eukaryotic cells respond to the accumulation of misfolded, unfolded or foreign proteins (including viral proteins) in the ER by activating a signaling pathway known as the UPR. Because HCV proteins are synthesized on ER membranes and remain closely associated with ER-derived membranous webs, we examined whether HCV protein expression could trigger an unfolded protein response in HCV transgenic mice. We first measured GRP78 mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 4A, no significant difference was found between transgenic and nontransgenic mice. IRE1 release from GRP78 activates IRE1 RNase activity and initiates mRNA splicing of XBP1, thus generating a spliced mRNA encoding a transcription factor that activates UPR target genes. We screened total RNA extracts from transgenic and nontransgenic livers for spliced XBP1 mRNA by means of RT-PCR and observed no modulation of XBP1 splicing by the HCV transgene (Fig. 4B). PERK release from GRP78 induces PERK autophosphorylation and activation. Activated PERK in turn phosphorylates eIF2α, thereby reducing mRNA translation initiation. We measured phosphorylated PERK and eIF2α by Western blotting with specific antibodies, normalizing the results to the respective total amounts of the two proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), respectively, we found no difference in the levels of phosphorylated PERK and eIF2α between transgenic and nontransgenic animals. Protein-disulfide isomerase is another chaperone involved in the ER-associated degradation pathway. ER degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like (EDEM) proteins target UPR-inducing proteins and trigger their degradation. As shown in Fig. 4E, quantitative RT-PCR revealed no significant differences in EDEM or protein-disulfide isomerase mRNA levels between HCV transgenic and nontransgenic mice. C/EBP (CCAAT- enhancer-binding protein) homologous protein (CHOP), also known as GADD153 (growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153), is a component of the ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathway. TRB3 is induced by ER stress downstream of CHOP and was recently identified as a potential pro-apoptotic protein that can modulate the Akt/protein kinase B-dependent signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 4F, CHOP and TRB3 expression levels did not differ between HCV transgenic and nontransgenic mice, although there was a trend toward higher expression of CHOP transcripts in transgenic mice (p < 0.06). Thus, none of the ER stress markers tested here was expressed at significantly higher levels in HCV transgenic mice than in their wild type counterparts. This suggests that SREBP1c proteolytic cleavage in transgenic mice expressing the HCV full-length open reading frame is independent of ER stress. The mechanisms by which chronic HCV infection perturbs lipid metabolism are poorly understood. Intracellular virion production appears to use metabolic pathways involved in lipid metabolism (11.Boulant S. Targett-Adams P. McLauchlan J. J. Gen.

A direct role of HCV is supported by the disappearance of these abnormalities when infection is cured by antiviral therapy and by their reappearance after HCV infection of the donor liver in HCV-infected transplant recipients (23.Poynard T.

https://openalex.org/W1981214091,"Background The purposes of this study were to determine the validity and reliability of high resolution accelerometers (HRA) relative to VO2 and speed, and compare putative differences in HRA signal between trained (T) and untrained (UT) runners during treadmill locomotion. Methodology Runners performed 2 incremental VO2max trials while wearing HRA. RMS of high frequency signal from three axes (VT, ML, AP) and the Euclidean resultant (RES) were compared to VO2 to determine validity and reliability. Additionally, axial rms relative to speed, and ratio of axial accelerations to RES were compared between T and UT to determine if differences in running mechanics could be identified between the two groups. Principal Findings Regression of RES was strongly related to VO2, but T was different than UT (r = 0.96 vs 0.92; p<.001) for walking and running. During walking, only the ratio of ML and AP to RES were different between groups. For running, nearly all acceleration parameters were lower for T than UT, the exception being ratio of VT to RES, which was higher in T than UT. All of these differences during running were despite higher VO2, O2 cost, and lower RER in T vs UT, which resulted in no significant difference in energy expenditure between groups. Conclusions/Signficance These results indicate that HRA can accurately and reliably estimate VO2 during treadmill locomotion, but differences exist between T and UT that should be considered when estimating energy expenditure. Differences in running mechanics between T and UT were identified, yet the importance of these differences remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2093864265,"Cellular prion-related protein (PrP(c)) is a cell-surface protein that is ubiquitously expressed in the human body. The multifunctionality of PrP(c), and presence of an exposed cationic and heparin-binding N-terminus, a feature characterizing many antimicrobial peptides, made us hypothesize that PrP(c) could exert antimicrobial activity.Intact recombinant PrP exerted antibacterial and antifungal effects at normal and low pH. Studies employing recombinant PrP and N- and C-terminally truncated variants, as well as overlapping peptide 20mers, demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity is mediated by the unstructured N-terminal part of the protein. Synthetic peptides of the N-terminus of PrP killed the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fungus Candida parapsilosis. Fluorescence studies of peptide-treated bacteria, paired with analysis of peptide effects on liposomes, showed that the peptides exerted membrane-breaking effects similar to those seen after treatment with the ""classical"" human antimicrobial peptide LL-37. In contrast to LL-37, however, no marked helix induction was detected for the PrP-derived peptides in presence of negatively charged (bacteria-mimicking) liposomes. PrP furthermore showed an inducible expression during wounding of human skin ex vivo and in vivo, as well as stimulation of keratinocytes with TGF-alpha in vitro.The demonstration of an antimicrobial activity of PrP, localisation of its activity to the N-terminal and heparin-binding region, combined with results showing an increased expression of PrP during wounding, indicate that PrPs could have a previously undisclosed role in host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2021623167,"Background In Vietnam, malaria remains a problem in some remote areas located along its international borders and in the central highlands, partly due to the bionomics of the local vector, mainly found in forested areas and less vulnerable to standard control measures. Long Lasting Insecticidal Hammocks (LLIH), a tailored and user-friendly tool for forest workers, may further contribute in reducing the malaria burden. Their effectiveness was tested in a large community-based intervention trial carried out in Ninh Thuan province in Central Vietnam. Methods and Findings Thirty villages (population 18,646) were assembled in 20 clusters (1,000 individuals per cluster) that were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group (no LLIH) after stratification according to the pre-intervention P. falciparum antibody prevalence (<30%; ≥30%). LLIH were distributed to the intervention group in December 2004. For the following 2 years, the incidence of clinical malaria and the prevalence of infection were determined by passive case detection at community level and by bi-annual malariometric surveys. A 2-fold larger effect on malaria incidence in the intervention as compared to the control group was observed. Similarly, malaria prevalence decreased more substantially in the intervention (1.6-fold greater reduction) than in the control group. Both for incidence and prevalence, a stronger and earlier effect of the intervention was observed in the high endemicity stratum. The number of malaria cases and infections averted by the intervention overall was estimated at 10.5 per 1,000 persons and 5.6/100 individuals, respectively, for the last half of 2006. In the high endemicity stratum, the impact was much higher, i.e. 29/1000 malaria cases and 15.7 infections/100 individuals averted. Conclusions LLIH reduced malaria incidence and prevalence in this remote and forested area of Central Vietnam. As the targets of the newly-launched Global Malaria Action Plan include the 75% reduction of the global malaria cases by 2015 and eventually the elimination/eradication of malaria in the long term, LLIH may represent an additional tool for reaching such objectives, particularly in high endemicity areas where standard control tools have a modest impact, such as in remote and forested areas of Southeast Asia and possibly South America.

https://openalex.org/W2078689410,"Sirt-1 is a NAD+-dependent nuclear deacetylase of 747 residues that in mammals is involved in various important metabolic pathways, such as glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, and often works on many different metabolic substrates as a multifunctional protein. Sirt-1 down-regulates p53 activity, rising lifespan, and cell survival; it also deacetylases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and its coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), promoting lipid mobilization, positively regulating insulin secretion, and increasing mitochondrial dimension and number. Therefore, it has been implicated in diseases such as diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and, also, in the mechanisms of longevity induced by calorie restriction. Its whole structure is not yet experimentally determined and the structural features of its allosteric site are unknown, and no information is known about the structural changes determined by the binding of its allosteric effectors.In this study, we modelled the whole three-dimensional structure of Sirt-1 and that of its endogenous activator, the nuclear protein AROS. Moreover, we modelled the Sirt-1/AROS complex in order to study the structural basis of its activation and regulation.Amazingly, the structural data show that Sirt-1 is an unordered protein with a globular core and two large unordered structural regions at both termini, which play an important role in the protein-protein interaction. Moreover, we have found on Sirt-1 a conserved pharmacophore pocket of which we have discussed the implication."

The results show that, whereas MutSα specifically recognizes both types of nucleosomal heteroduplexes, the protein bound the mismatch within a nucleosome with much lower efficiency than a naked heteroduplex or a heterology free of histone proteins but between two nucleosomes. Additionally, MutSα displays reduced ATPase- and ADP-binding activity when interacting with nucleosomal heteroduplexes. Interestingly, nucleosomes block ATP-induced MutSα sliding along the DNA helix when the mismatch is in between two nucleosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2142717577,"Although the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is essential in almost all aerobic organisms, its precise modulation and integration in global cellular metabolism is not fully understood. Here, we report on an alternative TCA cycle uniquely aimed at generating ATP and oxalate, two metabolites critical for the survival of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The upregulation of isocitrate lyase (ICL) and acylating glyoxylate dehydrogenase (AGODH) led to the enhanced synthesis of oxalate, a dicarboxylic acid involved in the immobilization of aluminum (Al). The increased activity of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) and oxalate CoA-transferase (OCT) in the Al-stressed cells afforded an effective route to ATP synthesis from oxalyl-CoA via substrate level phosphorylation. This modified TCA cycle with diminished efficacy in NADH production and decreased CO(2)-evolving capacity, orchestrates the synthesis of oxalate, NADPH, and ATP, ingredients pivotal to the survival of P. fluorescens in an Al environment. The channeling of succinyl-CoA towards ATP formation may be an important function of the TCA cycle during anaerobiosis, Fe starvation and O(2)-limited conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1978075293,"Major genetic factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have recently been identified as susceptibility risk factors, including variants in the CFH gene and the ARMS2 LOC387715/HTRA1locus. Our purpose was to perform a case-control study in two populations among individuals who did not carry risk variants for CFHY402H and LOC387715 A69S (ARMS2), called ""study"" individuals, in order to identify new genetic risk factors. Based on a candidate gene approach, we analyzed SNP rs5888 of the SCARB1 gene, coding for SRBI, which is involved in the lipid and lutein pathways. This study was conducted in a French series of 1241 AMD patients and 297 controls, and in a North American series of 1257 patients with advanced AMD and 1732 controls. Among these individuals, we identified 61 French patients, 77 French controls, 85 North American patients and 338 North American controls who did not carry the CFH nor ARMS2 polymorphisms. An association between AMD and the SCARB1 gene was seen among the study subjects. The genotypic distribution of the rs5888 polymorphism was significantly different between cases and controls in the French population (p<0.006). Heterozygosity at the rs5888 SNP increased risk of AMD compared to the CC genotypes in the French study population (odds ratio (OR) = 3.5, CI95%: 1.4-8.9, p<0.01) and after pooling the 2 populations (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.3, p<0.002). Subgroup analysis in exudative forms of AMD revealed a pooled OR of 3.6 for individuals heterozygous for rs5888 (95% CI: 1.7-7.6, p<0.0015). These results suggest the possible contribution of SCARB1, a new genetic factor in AMD, and implicate a role for cholesterol and antioxidant micronutrient (lutein and vitamin E) metabolism in AMD."

Voltage-gated sodium channels control rhythmic firing in excitable cells by driving the rapid upstroke of the action potential. These channels are composed of four homologous domains (DI–DIV), each housing six α-helical transmembrane segments that form the voltage sensor (S1–S4) and the pore-forming (S5-S6) modules. Within a few milliseconds of opening, channels enter a non-conducting, inactivated state from which they must recover before subsequent opening. Sodium channels may also enter this inactivated state directly from the resting state in a voltage-dependent manner (1.Horn R. Patlak J. Stevens C.F.

Although the precise mechanistic details of this modulation remain speculative, the C-terminal region contains EF-hand like domains and an IQ motif that dynamically bind Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM, respectively, and mutations in these regions affect both calcium sensitivity and inactivation gating (6.Tan H.L.

Additionally, recent evidence suggests that CaM can bind directly to the DIII-DIV linker, a possibility that has been suggested previously in the context of an “inactivation complex” (14.Kim J. Ghosh S. Liu H. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. Pitt G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45004-45012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17.Motoike H.K. Liu H. Glaaser I.W. Yang A.S.

Chagot B. Anghelescu M. Viswanathan P.C. Stepanovic S.Z. Kupershmidt S. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8846-8854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, introduced mutations into the putative Ca2+/CaM binding regions in the DIII-IV linker or the IQ motif do not explicitly interfere with calcium modulation of channel inactivation (16.Biswas S. DiSilvestre D. Tian Y. Halperin V.L. Tomaselli G.F. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18.Potet F. Chagot B. Anghelescu M. Viswanathan P.C. Stepanovic S.Z.

Alternatively, it is possible that CaM binding plays a central role in calcium regulation of inactivation through yet undetermined binding scenarios. Inherited and acquired dysfunctions of sodium channels can affect the inactivation process and channel modulation by intracellular calcium, respectively (19.George Jr., A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The DIII-IV linker and the C terminus of the channel are “hot spot” regions for gain of function mutations that contribute to electrical instability through the generation of a “late” or persistent sodium current that arises when channels fail to completely inactivate (7.Kass R.S. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2006; 17: S21-S25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20.Viswanathan P.C. Balser J.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM has been demonstrated to be a contributing factor in cardiomyopathic calcium dysregulation associated with the emergence of late sodium current that underlies life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia (21.Wagner S. Dybkova N. Rasenack E.C. Jacobshagen C. Fabritz L. Kirchhof P. Maier S.K. Zhang T. Hasenfuss G. Brown J.H. Bers D.M. Maier L.S. J. Clin.

Physiol. 2008; 294: H1597-H1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of sodium channel inactivation and its modulation by calcium is of interest for the management of hyperexcitability disorders and for the general understanding of the basic events that underlie ion channel gating. Here we employ isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to confirm that the sodium channel DIII-IV linker binds CaM with high affinity and show that CaM binding to calcium is required for the interaction, thus adding a novel molecular determinant to calcium regulation of cardiac sodium channels. An alanine scan of the DIII-IV linker shows that aromatic residues support CaM binding, with Tyr1494 and Tyr1495 being central to the interaction with the calmodulin C-lobe. The biophysical implications of CaM binding to the DIII-IV linker were investigated by patch-clamping tsA201 cells transfected with wild type and DIII-IV mutant channels in high and low calcium. The mutations are well tolerated and generate channels with little or no alteration in their voltage dependence of gating. The results show that the single Y1494A channel mutant is insensitive to cytosolic calcium, whereas mutation of other DIII-IV aromatics produced channels that display calcium-dependent inactivation gating effects. These observations add another mechanistic layer to calcium regulation of the cardiac sodium channel and suggest that Ca2+/CaM binding to the DIII-IV linker is an essential determinant of the regulatory process. All recombinant proteins were derived from cDNA from humans. The DIII-IV (Asp1471–Phe1522) was cloned into a modified Pet28 (Novagen) vector. For purification, all constructs included an N-terminal tag of His6, maltose-binding protein, and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site denoted as an “HMT” tag. Human CaM wild type, N-lobe (residues 1–78), C-lobe (residues 79–148), and CaM1234 (a CaM quadruple Ca2+ binding knock-out mutant) were generated previously (23.Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in 2× YT media at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After centrifugation, pellets were lysed in buffer A (250 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) plus 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and were sonicated and then centrifuged. Filtered cell lysate was loaded onto a Talon (Clontech) column, washed with buffer A, and eluted with buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. Fractions were then run on an amylose column in buffer A and were eluted with buffer A plus 10 mm maltose. His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease was used to cleave the tag for ∼12 h. To remove the HMT tag and tobacco etch virus protease, protein solution was run again on the Talon and amylose, in which case the flow-through was collected. To completely remove trace amounts of the HMT tag, a final ion exchange column (Resource Q) was used, using buffer C (10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.8) and D (1 m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.8), going from 0 to 40% buffer D over 12 column volumes. Protein integrity and identity were confirmed by both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization with a quadrupole mass analyzer). ITC experiments were performed with an ITC-200 (MicroCal) with concentrated, purified protein after dialysis for at least 17 h in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and either 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, or 10 mm EDTA at 25 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Edelhoch method (24.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar), where in the case of the N terminus of the CaM N-lobe, which lacks an endogenous aromatic, an engineered tryptophan was used. CaM constructs were used at a 10-fold molar excess when titrated against DIII-IV linker peptides. ITC experiments were repeated with different preparations to confirm thermodynamic parameters and stoichiometry values. Binding of wild type CaM to DIII-IV in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ yielded the same affinity as for 1 mm Ca2+. All other ITC experiments were performed in 1 mm Ca2+. The binding isotherms were analyzed using a single site binding model using the Microcal Origin version 7.0 software package, yielding binding enthalpy (ΔH), stoichiometry (n), entropy (ΔS), and association constant (Ka). Due to the low affinity of the N-lobe interaction, very high concentrations were used (6 mm N-lobe was titrated in 600 μm DIII-IV). Human NaV1.5 (NM_ 198056 (25.Gellens M.E. George Jr., A.L. Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar)) and DIII-IV linker alanine mutations were generated using standard methods and were verified by DNA sequencing. The calcium phosphate method (Invitrogen) was used to transiently co-transfect tSA201 cells with channel DNA and a bicistronic vector expressing calmodulin and the CD8 marker protein to minimize the possibility that overexpression of sodium channels could exhaust the endogenous population of CaM molecules. Transfected cells were identified by binding the anti-CD8-coated beads (Invitrogen). Voltage-gated sodium currents were recorded as described previously (10.Ahern C.A. Zhang J.F. Wookalis M.J. Horn R. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, all data were collected between 10 and 15 min after the establishment of the whole cell configuration to avoid the documented leftward shift in the steady-state inactivation gating. In this time window, no voltage-dependent drift was seen with either wild type or mutant sodium channels. Electrode resistance was in the range of 1–1.5 megaohms, and the voltage errors due to series resistance were always <3 mV after compensation. Liquid junction potentials between the bath and the pipette solution were corrected. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The patch pipette contained the following for “zero” calcium: 10 mmol/liter NaF, 100 mmol/liter CsF, 20 mmol/liter CsCl2, 20 mmol/liter BAPTA, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.35). For 10 μm calcium, it contained the following: 10 mmol/liter NaF, 100 mmol/liter CsF, 20 mmol/liter CsCl2, 1 mmol/liter BAPTA, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.35). The bath contained 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4). In order to better understand how intracellular calcium affects sodium channel inactivation gating, we investigated via ITC the interaction between recombinant CaM and the NaV1.5 DIII-IV linker. This experimental approach is particularly advantageous because ITC provides a full cadre of thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy, ΔG, Kapp) that contribute to the binding of two proteins. Wild type and mutant DIII-IV linker and CaM proteins were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were verified for integrity and purity by mass spectrometry before and after titrations (data not shown). Fig. 1A represents the transmembrane orientation and topology of the domain III pore region in blue (S5-S6) and the domain IV voltage sensor composed of S1–S4 in gray (S1–S3) and red (S4). The model was based on potassium channel structures and solution NMR data of the DIII-IV linker (26.Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar, 27.Rohl C.A. Boeckman F.A. Baker C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The DIII-IV linker aromatic residues investigated in this study are highlighted. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1B, where CaM is titrated against the sodium channel inactivation gate composed of residues Asp1471–Phe1522. The data are fit with a standard binding equation yielding the thermodynamic parameters for the interaction in Table 1. In the presence of Ca2+, CaM binds with a ∼3 μm Kd, an interaction driven by both enthalpic and entropic contributions, confirming a previous report that CaM can bind the sodium channel DIII-IV linker with high affinity (18.Potet F. Chagot B. Anghelescu M. Viswanathan P.C. Stepanovic S.Z. Kupershmidt S. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. J. Biol.

Alternatively, if the binding between the inactivation gate and CaM was independent of local calcium levels, such an interaction could support calcium regulation by stabilizing the channel in a conformation that is “permissive” to regulation by calcium through other channel domains. To distinguish these possibilities in terms of CaM/DIII-IV binding, the calcium dependence of the interaction was explored directly by removing calcium from the buffer used in the binding experiment. Under these conditions, we were unable to detect a significant interaction between CaM and the DIII-IV linker (Fig. 1C). In addition, CaM1234, a CaM mutant that cannot bind calcium in either lobes, also fails to show significant heat signals (Fig. 1D), showing that Ca2+ binding to CaM is strictly required for association with the DIII-IV linker. Each CaM molecule contains two functional binding units in the N- and C-terminal lobes, and each is capable of interacting with target proteins. Fig. 1, E and F, shows the contribution of the isolated CaM lobes to DIII-IV linker binding. In Fig. 1F, 6 mm CaM N-lobe was titrated against the DIII-IV linker, and the interaction, although energetically significant, is considerably weaker (Kd > 500 μm) than full-length CaM (Kd ∼3 μm). Conversely, the relatively robust interaction between the CaM C-lobe and the DIII-IV linker (Kd ∼19 μm) is evidenced in both the quantity of released heat and the pronounced curvature of the integrated heats. The overall result demonstrates that the interaction between CaM and the sodium channel inactivation gate is strongly dependent on calcium, and this binding relies primarily on the C-lobe of CaM. The stoichiometry value for the N-lobe is close to 2, suggesting that there are two N-lobe binding sites in the DIII-IV linker. However, it is commonly observed that the N-lobe can associate with a C-lobe binding site in the absence of a C-lobe (23.Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Upon binding four calcium ions, CaM undergoes a conformational rearrangement that exposes hydrophobic pockets into which aromatic/hydrophobic side chains on a target protein may favorably interact. In order to determine the direct contribution of the aromatic residues shown in Fig. 1A, each was individually mutated to alanine, and the resulting recombinant alanine mutant DIII-IV linker peptides were assayed for their ability to bind CaM, as measured by ITC analysis. The first residue, Phe1473, connects the distal pore-lining S6 segment in domain III and the amino terminus of the III-IV linker. The data in Fig. 2A show that the Ala mutation lowers affinity for CaM by a relatively modest ∼3-fold compared with wild type. We then investigated the role of Phe1486, a residue in the inactivation particle or “IFM motif” that is essential for normal inactivation gating (3.West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10910-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that the F1486A substitution has little effect on either entropic or enthalpic contribution to CaM binding, suggesting that although this site is essential for proper inactivation gating, it does not play a direct role in CaM binding to the DIII-IV linker. A pair of aromatic residues in the cardiac sodium channel DIII-IV linker, Tyr1494 and Tyr1495, have been implicated previously in the coupling of activation and inactivation (28.O'Leary M.E. Chen L.Q. Kallen R.G. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and as sites of phosphorylation by the tyrosine kinase Fyn (10.Ahern C.A. Zhang J.F. Wookalis M.J. Horn R. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that Ala replacement at these sites drastically affects the CaM/DIII-IV interaction. Due to the very low heat signals, attempts to fit the data for the Y1494A substitution were unsuccessful, showing clearly that Tyr1494 is involved in CaM binding. Alanine mutation at the adjacent site, Tyr1495, (Fig. 2D) reduces the binding affinity by almost 3-fold in addition to a 2-fold loss in the ΔH of the interaction. Taken together, the data suggest that this double Tyr motif, with Tyr1494 in particular, contributes substantial binding energy to the interaction of the DIII-IV linker with CaM, and the energetic basis for this effect is investigated in detail below with an isolated CaM C-lobe. Recent work has suggested that the distal C terminus of the III-IV linker, in particular an “FIF” motif, is also a molecular determinant for the interaction with CaM (18.Potet F. Chagot B. Anghelescu M. Viswanathan P.C. Stepanovic S.Z. Kupershmidt S. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8846-8854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the contribution of these side chains to CaM binding with a single F1520A or double F1520A/F1522A mutation. The results in Fig. 2, E and F, show that the effect on CaM binding of either the single or double mutation is surprisingly modest, suggesting that these sites play, at most, supporting roles in the interaction. In the presence of Ca2+, CaM interacts with target proteins through the collective binding energy provided by the N- and C-terminal lobes. Although it would be mechanistically revealing to measure the contribution of each CaM lobe to DIII-IV linker binding, the data in Fig. 1F show that N-lobe binding is relatively weak (Kd = 595 μm), a characteristic that would preclude a complete study of alanine mutants that further lower the affinity. We therefore chose to study the interaction between an isolated C-lobe and DIII-IV linker alanine mutants, which, together with the CaM binding data, indirectly reports on the N-lobe binding. The results of the alanine scan are presented in Fig. 3, A–F, and show that although each mutation subtly affects the binding parameters, only the Y1494A and Y1495A substitutions have drastic effects. In both instances, the reactions become endothermic, with positive ΔH values of 2.74 and 1.08 kcal/mol, respectively. Surprisingly, the overall affinity is not significantly altered, thanks to a more favorable entropic contribution. This can be explained by a positive correlation, or compensation, due to a change in entropy (29.Dunitz J.D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 709-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). As the enthalpic contribution of the interaction becomes weaker (−1.74 kcal/mol to 2.74 kcal/mol for wild type and Y1494A, respectively), the entropy increases (15.7 cal/mol/degree to 30.8 cal/mol/degree for wild type and Y1494A, respectively) due to the relaxation of the interaction. This enthalpy/entropy compensation has also been observed for CaM C-lobe binding to a mutant of the CaV1.2 IQ domain (23.Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The endothermic binding now explains the low heat signals obtained for full-length CaM to the same mutants; the endothermic C-lobe binding and exothermic N-lobe binding cancel each other out. In conclusion, although both Tyr1494 and Tyr1495 form clear C-lobe anchoring sites, their individual mutations to Ala do not significantly alter the C-lobe and CaM affinities for DIII-IV, a result that would have probably been missed by traditional co-immunoprecipitation approaches. If the interaction between CaM and the DIII-IV linker represents a bona fide regulatory mechanism by which channel function is controlled through local calcium levels, then mutations that affect CaM binding to the DIII-IV linker should also alter the effect of calcium on channel inactivation gating. A hallmark of calcium regulation of sodium channels can be seen in the inactivation gating, where increasing cytosolic calcium causes a rightward (depolarizing) shift in the steady state availability curve (6.Tan H.L. Kupershmidt S. Zhang R. Stepanovic S. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Anderson M.E. Balser J.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11.Young K.A. Caldwell J.H. J.

The physiological consequence of this modulation is an increase in cellular excitability due to enhanced channel availability at resting membrane potentials. An example is shown in Fig. 4A, where sodium currents were recorded with a pipette solution containing either 10 μm free Ca2+ or a zero Ca2+ solution containing 20 mm BAPTA. A steady-state inactivation protocol was used (see inset), where a 200-ms prepulse from a holding potential of −140 mV to voltages from −160 to −40 mV was followed by a brief, 15-ms test pulse to −20mV to ascertain the number of channels not inactivated by the prepulse. Representative data used to generate the steady-state inactivation curves are shown as insets in Fig. 4, where the"

https://openalex.org/W1975212002,"Proteins containing defined recognition modules mediate readout and translation of histone modifications. These factors are thought to initiate downstream signaling events regulating chromatin structure and function. We identified CDYL1 as an interaction partner of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3). CDYL1 belongs to a family of chromodomain factors found in vertebrates. We show that three different splicing variants of CDYL1, a, b, and c, are differentially expressed in various tissues with CDYL1b being the most abundant variant. Although all three splicing variants share a common C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain, only CDYL1b contains a functional chromodomain implicated in H3K9me3 binding. A splicing event introducing an N-terminal extension right at the beginning of the chromodomain of CDYL1a inactivates its chromodomain. CDYL1c does not contain a chromodomain at all. Although CDYL1b displays binding affinity to methyl-lysine residues in different sequence context similar to chromodomains in other chromatin factors, we demonstrate that the CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction is necessary but not sufficient for association of the factor with heterochromatin. Indeed, multimerization of the protein via the enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain is essential for H3K9me3 chromatin binding in vitro and heterochromatin localization in vivo. In agreement, overexpression of CDYL1c that can multimerize, but does not interact with H3K9me3 can displace CDYL1b from heterochromatin. Our results imply that multimeric binding to H3K9me3 by CDYL1b homomeric complexes is essential for efficient chromatin targeting. We suggest that similar multivalent binding stably anchors other histone modification binding factors on their target chromatin regions. Proteins containing defined recognition modules mediate readout and translation of histone modifications. These factors are thought to initiate downstream signaling events regulating chromatin structure and function. We identified CDYL1 as an interaction partner of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3). CDYL1 belongs to a family of chromodomain factors found in vertebrates. We show that three different splicing variants of CDYL1, a, b, and c, are differentially expressed in various tissues with CDYL1b being the most abundant variant. Although all three splicing variants share a common C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain, only CDYL1b contains a functional chromodomain implicated in H3K9me3 binding. A splicing event introducing an N-terminal extension right at the beginning of the chromodomain of CDYL1a inactivates its chromodomain. CDYL1c does not contain a chromodomain at all. Although CDYL1b displays binding affinity to methyl-lysine residues in different sequence context similar to chromodomains in other chromatin factors, we demonstrate that the CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction is necessary but not sufficient for association of the factor with heterochromatin. Indeed, multimerization of the protein via the enoyl-CoA hydratase-like domain is essential for H3K9me3 chromatin binding in vitro and heterochromatin localization in vivo. In agreement, overexpression of CDYL1c that can multimerize, but does not interact with H3K9me3 can displace CDYL1b from heterochromatin. Our results imply that multimeric binding to H3K9me3 by CDYL1b homomeric complexes is essential for efficient chromatin targeting. We suggest that similar multivalent binding stably anchors other histone modification binding factors on their target chromatin regions. IntroductionFor packaging the chromosomes of an eukaryotic cell into the nucleus the negatively charged DNA is wrapped around a positively charged octamer of histone proteins consisting of two H2A–H2B dimers and one (H3–H4)2 tetramer. 147 bp of DNA are wound around one histone octamer forming the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. N- and C-terminal tails of the histones are protruding out of this structural entity.Histones are subject to a plethora of post-translational modifications (1.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Among these methylation of lysine residues plays a special role. Specific sites of lysine methylation as well as distinct stages of lysine methylation are associated with different nuclear processes (4.Lachner M. Sengupta R. Schotta G. Jenuwein T.

For example, trimethylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is found in euchromatic structures, which are open for transcription and are early replicating during S-phase. In contrast trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me3) is accumulated at heterochromatic regions. These are densely packed, mostly transcriptional silent and late replicating in S-phase (6.Elgin S.C. Grewal S.I. Curr.

Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These factors are thought to read-out and translate the effects of individual histone modifications or combinations thereof. Different proteins containing chromodomains have been implicated in binding methylated histone lysine residues preferentially when in higher (tri- and dimethylated) states. For example, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) 4The abbreviations used are: HP1heterochromatin protein 1CDYLchromodomain on the Y chromosomeWTwild typeMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastNLSnuclear localization signalaaamino acidECHenoyl-CoA hydrataseHAhemagglutininMSmass spectrometryYFPyellow fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePDBProtein data bankHEKhuman embryonic kidney. was shown to recognize H3K9me, whereas Polycomb binds H3K27me (12.Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of a number of binding domains has identified aromatic cages of at least three residues as central elements in histone methyl-lysine binding (10.Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Although the interaction of different protein domains with histone modifications has been well studied in vitro using isolated histone tail peptides, the exact parameters by which these proteins are recruited to their target sites on chromatin have not been worked out.Recently, a new chromodomain containing group of proteins was described (13.Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Science. 1997; 278: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The cdy (chromodomain on the Y) family represents a set of related genes in higher eukaryotes. In humans the CDY family comprises two autosomal genes, namely CDYL1 and CDYL2 as well as multiple gene copies of CDY on the Y chromosome (14.Dorus S. Gilbert S.L. Forster M.L. Barndt R.J. Lahn B.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Evolutionary, a common ancestor of the cdyl gene appeared first in deuteriostomia. This predecessor was later duplicated to yield the cdyl1 and cdyl2 genes. A very recent multiplication of the cdyl1 gene in the primate lineage lead to multiple cdy copies on the Y chromosome (14.Dorus S. Gilbert S.L. Forster M.L. Barndt R.J. Lahn B.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15.Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16.Bhowmick B.K. Takahata N. Watanabe M. Satta Y. Genet. Mol. Res. 2006; 5: 696-712PubMed Google Scholar).CDY family proteins have a N-terminal chromodomain, a central hinge region, and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase-like (ECH) domain in common (see Fig. 1A). Recently, we could show that the chromodomains of CDY and CDYL2, which have high sequence similarities with HP1 and Polycomb chromodomains, can recognize di- or trimethylated histone and non-histone lysine residues. The strongest interaction was found for the H3K9me3 modification (17.Fischle W. Franz H. Jacobs S.A. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19626-19635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, CDYL1 was not able to recognize H3K9me3 because of subtle sequence differences at the very beginning of the chromodomain affecting the first of three aromatic cage residues. Mutagenesis of a few residues at the N terminus of the CDYL1 chromodomain lead to restored binding activity to H3K9me3 peptides in vitro and partial relocalization to heterochromatic regions in vivo. Other studies indicated that CDYL1 binding to H3K9me3 might be increased after methylation by the histone methyltransferase G9a (18.Rathert P. Dhayalan A. Murakami M. Zhang X. Tamas R. Jurkowska R. Komatsu Y. Shinkai Y. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, biochemical pull-down experiments identified CDYL1 as the binding protein of automethylated G9a (19.Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N. Mecklenbräuker I. Viale A. Rudensky E. Zhou M.M. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 596-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The exact reasons for the different methyl-lysine binding behavior of CDYL1 are not understood.Biochemically, CDYL1 was found in the CoREST complex where it bridges the repressor REST and the histone methyltransferase G9a (20.Lakowski B. Roelens I. Jacob S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21.Kuppuswamy M. Vijayalingam S. Zhao L.J. Zhou Y. Subramanian T. Ryerse J. Chinnadurai G. Mol.

Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 718-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ECH-like domain of CDYL1 was shown to interact with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 likely via CoREST association thereby acting as corepressor during transcriptional repression (23.Caron C. Pivot-Pajot C. van Grunsven L.A. Col E. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Conflicting results have suggested that the ECH-like domain of CDY and CDYL1 might constitute a histone acetyltransferase activity in elongating spermatids during hyperacetylation and replacement of histones (24.Lahn B.T. Tang Z.L. Zhou J. Barndt R.J. Parvinen M. Allis C.D. Page D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8707-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In peroxisomes and mitochondria, trimeric enoyl-CoA hydratases accomplish the hydration of the double bond of fatty acids during β-oxidation (25.Kim J.J. Battaile K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26.Hamed R.B. Batchelar E.T. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2507-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The functional impact of putative multimerization of ECH-like domains onto the CDY family protein function has not yet been investigated.In this study we present results that clarify the different binding abilities reported for CDYL1 to methylated lysine residues. CDYL1 exists in three different splicing variants, a, b, and c. The b form is not only the most abundant splicing variant but is also exclusively able to recognize H3K9me3 in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that the chromodomain of CDYL1 alone is not sufficient to stably bind to H3K9me3 chromatin in vitro and to mediate localization to DNA-dense heterochromatic regions in vivo. Besides a functional chromodomain multimerization of the ECH-like domain is necessary to bring CDYL1b to heterochromatin.DISCUSSIONOur detailed analysis of CDYL1 function in the context of H3K9me binding has the following implications: (i) different splicing variants a, b, and c of CDYL1 bind differentially to methylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins. (ii) CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction is not sufficient for association of the factor with heterochromatin. (iii) Multimerization of CDYL1b is necessary for stable H3K9me3 chromatin association in vitro and for H3K9 heterochromatin localization in vivo.The originally described CDYL1 polypeptide corresponds to the less abundant CDYL1a splicing variant (15.Lahn B.T. Page D.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33.Li X. Liang J. Yu H. Su B. Xiao C. Shang Y. Wang W. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 427-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CDYL1 was identified and described in different experiments interacting with methylated lysine residues in histones and G9a (18.Rathert P. Dhayalan A. Murakami M. Zhang X. Tamas R. Jurkowska R. Komatsu Y. Shinkai Y. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19.Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N.

Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although the CDYL1 splicing variant was not specified, interaction in the case of methylated G9a could not be verified using recombinant proteins (19.Sampath S.C. Marazzi I. Yap K.L. Sampath S.C. Krutchinsky A.N. Mecklenbräuker I. Viale A. Rudensky E. Zhou M.M. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 596-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We think that it is likely that CDYL1a and not CDYL1b was used in these studies. Indeed, the chromodomains of both CDYL1b and CDYL1a after restoration of the aromatic cage by mutagenesis bind a methylated G9a peptide with affinity comparable with methylated histone peptides in vitro (this study and see Ref. 17.Fischle W. Franz H. Jacobs S.A. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19626-19635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear whether the N-terminal extension of CDYL1a compared with CDYL1b brings additional functionality to the protein, potentially establishing a different role for the methyl-lysine binding deficient chromodomain.Biochemical evidence has been provided that places CDYL1 as a bridge between G9a and REST in a WIZ and histone modifying enzymes containing corepressor complex (21.Kuppuswamy M. Vijayalingam S. Zhao L.J. Zhou Y. Subramanian T. Ryerse J. Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Mulligan P. Westbrook T.F. Ottinger M. Pavlova N. Chang B. Macia E. Shi Y.J. Barretina J. Liu J. Howley P.M. Elledge S.J. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 718-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although direct interaction of CDYL1 and G9a could be demonstrated using recombinant proteins, it is tempting to speculate that this interaction is in vivo further controlled by G9a automethylation and CDYL1b chromodomain binding. Methylation of CDYL1 might also play a role because in vitro G9a can target CDYL1 for methylation at a lysine residue C-terminal to the chromodomain. It has been suggested that this post-translational modification might negatively regulate the CDYL1/H3K9me3 interaction (18.Rathert P. Dhayalan A. Murakami M. Zhang X. Tamas R. Jurkowska R. Komatsu Y. Shinkai Y. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, as the observed effect was only 2-fold and as CDYL1a was used for these studies, the exact relation of G9a, CDYL1, and their methylation within the REST-CoREST complex needs further investigation. In any case, it has to be noted that a large fraction of CDYL1b exists outside of the REST-CoREST complex, likely targeting other methyl-lysine residues (see Ref. 22.Mulligan P. Westbrook T.F. Ottinger M. Pavlova N. Chang B. Macia E. Shi Y.J. Barretina J. Liu J. Howley P.M. Elledge S.J. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 718-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 5H. Franz and W. Fischle, unpublished observations. Besides the chromodomain the ECH-like domain is likely central to CDYL1 and CDY protein family function. These regions show a very high degree of conservation, whereas the linking hinge region is more variable. It was originally suggested that the ECH-like domain of CDY and CDYL1 might have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (24.Lahn B.T. Tang Z.L. Zhou J. Barndt R.J. Parvinen M. Allis C.D. Page D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8707-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, structural analysis and modeling makes it unlikely that acetyl-CoA is indeed a substrate of the CDYL1 ECH-like domain (49.Wu H. Min J. Antoshenko T. Plotnikov A.N. Proteins. 2009; 76: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have failed to reproduce histone acetyltransferase activity of CDY family proteins.5 Nevertheless, it was found that the CDYL1 ECH-like domain interacts with CoA. Although CoA can indeed be modeled onto the structure of CDYL1 it remains to be determined whether CoA is a substrate, substrate carrier, or possibly an allosteric regulator.Our studies indicate that a major function of the ECH-like domain resides in multimerization. Indeed, only CDYL1 that can interact with itself is directed to H3K9me3 heterochromatin, but a functional chromodomain on itself is not capable of this targeting. Although the CDYL1b chromodomain/H3K9me3 interaction at 2 μm is comparable with other chromodomain methylhistone peptide interactions (12.Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 34.Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), it is nevertheless, weak. We hypothesize that CDYL1b protein multimerization generates a multivalent binding mode that significantly enhances interaction (46.Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Similar behavior has been suggested for HP1, which dimerizes via a C-terminal chromoshadow domain. Mutations that affect HP1 dimerization as well as overexpression of the chromoshadow domain alone cause dissociation of HP1 from heterochromatin (50.Mateos-Langerak J. Brink M.C. Luijsterburg M.S. van der Kraan I. van Driel R. Verschure P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1464-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 51.Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Okuwaki M. Lyon D. Nielsen P.R. Hirshberg M. Verreault A. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to directly analyze and quantify the impact of ECH-like domain multimerization onto CDYL1b/H3K9me3 chromatin binding.Our results also show that multimerization of CDYL1 might not be limited to the ECH-like domain, but could also be mediated by additional regions of the protein. Although it is currently unclear how many CDYL1 polypeptides do associate to form chromatin binding complexes, structural analysis of the homologous CDY has found evidence for hexamerization beyond trimerization (PDB 2fw2) (49.Wu H. Min J. Antoshenko T. Plotnikov A.N. Proteins. 2009; 76: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Obviously, stronger chromatin interaction will result from the presence of extra H3K9me3 binding sites if additional associations are sterically possible. Indeed, multiple histone modification binding domains in complexes or multimerization of individual chromatin readout factors could be key in reading and translating histone modifications by establishing robust interaction. Enhancement of binding via multimerization could possibly explain the obvious strong targeting of CDYL1b to sites of H3K9me3 in vivo compared with not much weaker binding to H3K27me3 in vitro.Another aspect of CDYL1b multimerization besides generating binding strength could be affecting chromatin structure and behavior by binding multiple regions simultaneously. Although multivalent binding of chromatin factors to histone modifications has not yet been demonstrated and whereas effects of multiple binding events have not been analyzed, we wonder whether such interaction could be involved in establishing or maintaining higher order chromatin structures. In this sense CDYL1 might act as a chromatin architectural protein enhancing the transition of 10-nm fibers to 30-nm structures and higher order chromatin arrangements (52.McBryant S.J. Adams V.H. Hansen J.C. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

Lysophosphatidic acid acts on specific G protein-coupled receptors, thereby regulating cell growth, migration, and survival. Previous studies have revealed that Enpp2−/− mouse embryos die at about embryonic day (E) 9.5 because of angiogenic defects in the yolk sac. However, what cellular defects occur in Enpp2−/− embryos and what intracellular signaling pathways are involved in the phenotype manifestation remain unknown. Here, we show that Enpp2 is required to form distinctive large lysosomes in the yolk sac visceral endoderm cells. From E7.5 to E9.5, Enpp2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the visceral endoderm cells. In Enpp2−/− mouse embryos, lysosomes in the visceral endoderm cells are fragmented. By using a whole embryo culture system combined with specific pharmacological inhibitors for intracellular signaling molecules, we show that lysophosphatidic acid receptors and the Rho-Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)-LIM kinase pathway are required to form large lysosomes. In addition, electroporation of dominant negative forms of Rho, ROCK, or LIM kinase also leads to the size reduction of lysosomes in wild-type visceral endoderm cells. In Enpp2−/− visceral endoderm cells, the steady-state levels of cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization are reduced. In addition, perturbations of actin turnover dynamics by actin inhibitors cytochalasin B and jasplakinolide result in the defect in lysosome formation. These results suggest that constitutive activation of the Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase pathway by extracellular production of lysophosphatidic acid by the action of autotaxin is required to maintain the large size of lysosomes in visceral endoderm cells.

The extraembryonic visceral yolk sac is the first place where hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis occur in the mouse. It is composed of two layers, the visceral endoderm (VE) and the underlying mesoderm layers. VE cells play a critical role in the maternofetal exchange of nutrients prior to the establishment of a chorioallantoic placenta (∼E9). They endocytose maternal proteins vigorously, hydrolyze the proteins in lysosomes, and supply the resultant products to the developing embryo (11.Bielinska M. Narita N. Wilson D.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 183-205PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Reflecting high endocytic and digestive activity, VE cells are endowed with distinctively large lysosomes (known as amorphous vacuoles in electron microscopy) (11.Bielinska M. Narita N. Wilson D.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 183-205PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Jollie W.P. Teratology. 1990; 41: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Blockade of VE cell functions using chemicals, antibodies, or gene disruption caused fetal malformation (11.Bielinska M. Narita N. Wilson D.B. Int. J. Dev.

Teratology. 1990; 41: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting the functional importance of VE cells in rodent development. Lysosomes are dynamic membrane-bound organelles that receive and degrade macromolecules from endocytic, phagocytic, and autophagic pathways (14.Luzio J.P. Pryor P.R. Bright N.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 15.Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). They undergo dynamic fusion/fission, and yet cells maintain a relatively constant size and number of lysosomes (14.Luzio J.P. Pryor P.R. Bright N.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Genetic studies in yeast and Drosophila as well as cell biological studies in mammalian cells have identified many intracellular components involved in the biogenesis of lysosomes and vacuoles (yeast homologs of lysosomes) and elucidated their functions (14.Luzio J.P.

BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether lysosome biogenesis is regulated by extracellular signals and which signaling pathway(s), if any, regulate the process. In this study, we show that Enpp2 mRNA is highly expressed in the yolk sac VE cells from E7.5 to E9.5. In the VE cells of Enpp2−/− embryos, distinctive large lysosomes are fragmented. When embryos are cultured in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors for the LPA receptors, Rho, ROCK/Rho kinase, or LIM kinase (LIMK), these drugs induce lysosomal defects similar to those observed in Enpp2−/− VE cells. In addition, inhibition of Rho, ROCK, or LIMK by electroporating their dominant negative forms or activation of cofilin by electroporating its constitutively active form into wild-type embryos induces the size reduction of lysosomes in VE cells. In Enpp2−/− VE cells, the steady-state levels of cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization are reduced. Moreover, perturbations of actin turnover dynamics by cytochalasin B or jasplakinolide result in the defect in lysosome formation in VE cells. These findings suggest that the control of actin turnover dynamics through the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway by way of autotaxin-LPA signaling is required for the regulatory processes of lysosome biogenesis. All the experiments using animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tsukuba and performed under its guidelines. Noon of the day on which a vaginal plug was observed was taken as embryonic day 0.5. Timed pregnant ICR mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, and Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were used for pharmacological experiments and electroporation. A gene-targeting vector was constructed by inserting the mouse genomic DNA fragments flanking exons 6 and 7 of the Enpp2 gene into a TC3 vector (a gift from Dr. Ryoichiro Kageyama, Kyoto University, Japan), which contained a cassette of stop-IRES-lacZ-poly(A), a neomycin-resistant gene, and a diphtheria toxin A fragment gene. The linearized vector was electroporated into mouse embryonic stem cells (E14 clone derived from 129/Ola), and neomycin-resistant colonies were selected by PCR. Whether homologous recombination occurred correctly in the selected clones was confirmed using Southern blotting with 3′ and 5′ probes. Chimeric mice, obtained by injecting the embryonic stem cells into C57BL/6J blastocysts, were mated with wild-type C57BL/6N mice. Offspring generated by intercrosses of heterozygotes (F1 generation) were used. Mice were genotyped by duplex PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTGCTGAAACTTAATGCACTGGAC-3′ (Enpp2 forward) and 5′-TGTGTAAGTCAGGGAACAACTCTG-3′ (Enpp2 reverse), and 5′-TGCTCCAGACTGCCTTGGGAAAAG-3′ (neo). Fragments of 473 and 336 bp were amplified from the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively. ECF was aspirated by using a fine-tip glass needle; about 1 μl of ECF was obtained from one E8.5 embryo. ECF collected from 3 to 5 mouse embryos was used for Western blotting with anti-autotaxin ATX-N1 (1:1,000; TransGenic, Kumamoto, Japan; described previously in Ref. 16.Koike S. Keino-Masu K. Ohto T.

The signal was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) and ECL PLUS Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (16.Koike S. Keino-Masu K. Ohto T. Masu M.

The secondary antibodies used were Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:1,000; Invitrogen), and Cy3-labeled anti-rat IgG (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Fluorescent images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from yolk sacs of E7.0 to E12.5 mice using Sepasol I (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Reverse transcription and PCR were performed using oligo(dT)12–18, Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR primers used were as follows: 5′-GGTCAATAGCATGCAGACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAGTTGGTCAGGTGTTCTG-3′ (reverse) for Enpp2 and 5′-CAGGGCTGCCATTTGCAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGGTCTCGCTCCTGGAAG-3′ (reverse) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. E8.5 mouse embryos were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Tissues were postfixed in buffered osmium tetroxide and embedded in epoxy according to standard procedures. Ultrathin sections, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, were examined using a transmission electron microscope (H7000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 75 kV. Whole embryos with intact yolk sacs, dissected at E8.5 or cultured for 1 day from E7.5, were incubated with 100 nm LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 5 min. Whole embryos were then mounted on a glass-bottom dish (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan), allowing observation of the yolk sac using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510; Zeiss) at room temperature. The areas of lysosomes were measured using ImageJ software. The average size of lysosomes was obtained from each embryo and compared and statistically analyzed between different experimental conditions. Whole embryo culture was performed as described previously (17.Osumi-Yamashita N. Ninomiya Y. Doi H. Eto K. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 18.Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, embryos were dissected at E7.5 and cultured in 100% rat serum (Charles River, Yokohama, Japan) supplemented with 2 mg/ml glucose in a culture bottle placed in a rotation drum culture system (Ikemoto Rika, Tokyo, Japan) in 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 at 37 °C for 24 h.

For phalloidin staining, embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 15 min. Whole embryos or cryostat sections were incubated with 0.2 unit/ml Alexa488- or Alexa546-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 60 min. To compare fluorescence signal intensity, confocal images of yolk sacs in cryostat sections were collected with all laser settings constant. Fluorescence signal intensity was obtained using Zeiss LSM510 software and analyzed statistically using the t test. Whole embryos were dissected at E7.5 and transferred to Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) kept at 37 °C. One embryo was inserted into a small hole of an agarose mold (2% agarose/phosphate-buffered saline, 7-mm square) placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The solution bathing the embryos was then replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2 mg/ml DNA. Three square electric pulses (30 V, 50 ms duration, 1-pulse/s) were delivered to the agarose mold using an electroporator (CUY21; Nepa Gene, Chiba, Japan) and a 10-mm electrode (CUY650P10; Nepa Gene). After electroporation, the embryo was rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and cultured as described above.

To elucidate the roles of Enpp2 in early development, its expression before E9.5 was examined. Enpp2 mRNA was first detectable in the embryonic ectoderm at the late cylinder and primitive streak stages (E6.0 to E6.5) (Fig. 2A). From E7.5 to E8.5, strong signals were detected in the yolk sac, especially in VE cells (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR indicated that Enpp2 mRNA was highly expressed in the yolk sac between E7.5 and E9.5 (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Enpp2 mRNA is highly expressed in yolk sac VE cells. A, in situ hybridization of Enpp2. Strong expression was observed in the embryonic ectoderm (ect) at E6.0 to E6.5, in the yolk sac (ys) at E7.5 to E8.5, and in the head fold (hf) and somites (arrowheads) at E8.5.

While searching for possible defects using immunohistochemistry, we noticed intriguing changes in the intracellular vesicles in Enpp2−/− VE cells. Because VE cells vigorously take up maternal proteins, including IgG from the apical surface, endocytic vesicles can be visualized simply by immunostaining for mouse IgG. Control VE cells had large IgG-containing vesicles, whereas Enpp2−/− VE cells had smaller punctate vesicles (Fig. 3A, top). Electron microscopy demonstrated that control VE cells had a few large vesicles in the apical portion, whereas Enpp2−/− VE cells had numerous smaller vesicles (Fig. 3A, middle). To examine lysosomes in VE cells, we stained whole embryos with LysoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye that selectively accumulates in acidic organelles, and observed lysosomes in VE cells using a confocal microscope. This analysis revealed that lysosomes became significantly smaller, and the number of lysosomes significantly increased in Enpp2−/− VE cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, immunostaining with a lysosome marker, LAMP1, also revealed that lysosomes were smaller in Enpp2−/− VE cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These findings indicate that Enpp2−/− embryos had defects in the formation of large lysosomes, which are one of the distinctive features of VE cells. We next examined the downstream signaling pathways of autotaxin using an ex vivo whole embryo culture system. Whole embryo culture is a well established system that has been proved to be useful for studying normal development as well as assessing teratogenicity and gene functions (17.Osumi-Yamashita N. Ninomiya Y. Doi H. Eto K. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 18.Tam P.P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). When E7.5 wild-type embryos were cultured for 1 day, the appearances of the yolk sac and embryos were indistinguishable from those of the in utero-grown E8.5 wild-type embryos (supplemental Fig. S2A). In addition, when E7.5 Enpp2−/− embryos were cultured for 1 day, head cavity was formed as seen in the in utero-grown E8.5 Enpp2−/− embryos (supplemental Fig. S2A). Furthermore, the lysosome size in VE cells was reduced in the cultured Enpp2−/− embryos compared with that in the cultured wild-type embryos, in the same way and to the same extent that the lysosome size in VE cells was reduced in the Enpp2−/− embryos in vivo (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). These results indicate that a whole embryo culture system faithfully mimics in vivo development of wild-type and Enpp2−/− embryos, thus providing a feasible tool to test the effects of pharmacological manipulation of VE cells. We thus set out to test the effects of the inhibitors of the LPA signaling pathway. In this study, we used subtoxic concentrations of drugs, which were carefully predetermined in preliminary tests as not inducing developmental retardation or cardiac arrest (data not shown). First, LPA and S1P receptor antagonists were tested. When E7.5 wild-type embryos were cultured for 1 day with 10 μm Ki16425, an LPA1/LPA3 antagonist (24.Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A. Malchinkhuu E. Kon J. Kimura T. Tobo M. Yamazaki Y. Watanabe T. Yagi M. Sato M. Suzuki R. Murooka H. Sakai T. Nishitoba T. Im D.S. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Tomura H. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), lysosomes became significantly smaller (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, 10 μm VPC23019, an S1P1/S1P3 antagonist (25.Davis M.D. Clemens J.J. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), did not induce size reduction of lysosomes (Fig. 4, A and B), although the drug must have effectively acted on the yolk sac because it induced angiogenic defects (data not shown). These findings indicate that LPA receptor signaling is required to form large lysosomes in VE cells. LPA receptors are coupled to several signaling pathways through distinct G proteins; the major pathways include G12/13-Rho-ROCK, Gi-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Rac, Gi-Ras-MAPK, and Gq-phospholipase C (4.van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 5.Anliker B. Chun J. Semin. Cell Dev.

To determine which pathway is required downstream of autotaxin, we tested selective inhibitors for each pathway. Treatment of embryos with either a Rho inhibitor, Clostridium C3 exoenzyme (20 μg/ml), or a ROCK inhibitor, H1152 (0.1 μm), resulted in a significant size reduction of lysosomes (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S3A). Other ROCK inhibitors, hydroxyfasudil (1–10 μm) and Y-27632 (1 μm), were also effective (supplemental Fig. S4). In contrast, none of the inhibitors of Gi (pertussis toxin, 0.5 μg/ml), phospholipase C (U-73122, 10 μm), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002, 10 μm), or MAPK (PD98059, 10 μm) had any effect on the size of lysosomes (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S3A). These findings indicate that the Rho-ROCK pathway plays an important role downstream of autotaxin-LPA signaling in the formation of large lysosomes in VE cells. The main downstream targets of ROCK are LIMK and myosin light chain. ROCK phosphorylates and activates LIMK, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin, a protein that stimulates actin filament disassembly (23.Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A.

https://openalex.org/W2124029290,"Albatrosses fly many hundreds of kilometers across the open ocean to find and feed upon their prey. Despite the growing number of studies concerning their foraging behaviour, relatively little is known about how albatrosses actually locate their prey. Here, we present our results from the first deployments of a combined animal-borne camera and depth data logger on free-ranging black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys). The still images recorded from these cameras showed that some albatrosses actively followed a killer whale (Orcinus orca), possibly to feed on food scraps left by this diving predator. The camera images together with the depth profiles showed that the birds dived only occasionally, but that they actively dived when other birds or the killer whale were present. This association with diving predators or other birds may partially explain how albatrosses find their prey more efficiently in the apparently ‘featureless’ ocean, with a minimal requirement for energetically costly diving or landing activities."

https://openalex.org/W2012778355,"Background A new investigation of the sedimentology and ichnology of the Early Jurassic Moyeni tracksite in Lesotho, southern Africa has yielded new insights into the behavior and locomotor dynamics of early dinosaurs. Methodology/Principal Findings The tracksite is an ancient point bar preserving a heterogeneous substrate of varied consistency and inclination that includes a ripple-marked riverbed, a bar slope, and a stable algal-matted bar top surface. Several basal ornithischian dinosaurs and a single theropod dinosaur crossed its surface within days or perhaps weeks of one another, but responded to substrate heterogeneity differently. Whereas the theropod trackmaker accommodated sloping and slippery surfaces by gripping the substrate with its pedal claws, the basal ornithischian trackmakers adjusted to the terrain by changing between quadrupedal and bipedal stance, wide and narrow gauge limb support (abduction range = 31°), and plantigrade and digitigrade foot posture. Conclusions/Significance The locomotor adjustments coincide with changes in substrate consistency along the trackway and appear to reflect ‘real time’ responses to a complex terrain. It is proposed that these responses foreshadow important locomotor transformations characterizing the later evolution of the two main dinosaur lineages. Ornithischians, which shifted from bipedal to quadrupedal posture at least three times in their evolutionary history, are shown to have been capable of adopting both postures early in their evolutionary history. The substrate-gripping behavior demonstrated by the early theropod, in turn, is consistent with the hypothesized function of pedal claws in bird ancestors."
https://openalex.org/W2116301707,"Context Development of optimal medicinal treatments of uterine leiomyomas represents a significant challenge. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME) is an endogenous estrogen metabolite formed by sequential action of CYP450s and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Our previous study demonstrated that 2ME is a potent antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and collagen synthesis inhibitor in human leiomyomas cells (huLM). Objectives Our objectives were to investigate whether COMT expression, by the virtue of 2ME formation, affects the growth of huLM, and to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby COMT expression or treatment with 2ME affect these cells. Results Our data demonstrated that E2-induced proliferation was less pronounced in cells over-expressing COMT or treated with 2ME (500 nM). This effect on cell proliferation was associated with microtubules stabilization and diminution of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) transcriptional activities, due to shifts in their subcellular localization and sequestration in the cytoplasm. In addition, COMT over expression or treatment with 2ME reduced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor -1α (HIF-1 α) and the basal level as well as TNF-α-induced aromatase (CYP19) expression. Conclusions COMT over expression or treatment with 2ME stabilize microtubules, ameliorates E2-induced proliferation, inhibits ERα and PR signaling, and reduces HIF-1 α and CYP19 expression in human uterine leiomyoma cells. Thus, microtubules are a candidate target for treatment of uterine leiomyomas. In addition, the naturally occurring microtubule-targeting agent 2ME represents a potential new therapeutic for uterine leiomyomas."

They are composed of a steroid structure and are primarily made in the liver by the oxidation of cholesterol. Cholesterol is also highly abundant in the human ovarian follicle, where it is used in the formation of the sex steroids. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe for the first time evidence that all aspects of the bile acid synthesis pathway are present in the human ovarian follicle, including the enzymes in both the classical and alternative pathways, the nuclear receptors known to regulate the pathway, and the end product bile acids. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence that bile acids are produced by the human follicular granulosa cells in response to cholesterol presence in the culture media. Conclusions/Significance These findings establish a novel pathway present in the human ovarian follicle that has the capacity to compete directly with sex steroid synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2089412829,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a 110-kDa metalloendopeptidase, hydrolyzes several physiologically relevant peptides, including insulin and amyloid-beta (Abeta). Human IDE has 13 cysteines and is inhibited by hydrogen peroxide and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), donors of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively. Here, we report that the oxidative burst of BV-2 microglial cells leads to oxidation or nitrosylation of secreted IDE, leading to the reduced activity. Hydrogen peroxide and GSNO treatment of IDE reduces the V(max) for Abeta degradation, increases IDE oligomerization, and decreases IDE thermostability. Additionally, this inhibitory response of IDE is substrate-dependent, biphasic for Abeta degradation but monophasic for a shorter bradykinin-mimetic substrate. Our mutational analysis of IDE and peptide mass fingerprinting of GSNO-treated IDE using Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer reveal a surprising interplay of Cys-178 with Cys-110 and Cys-819 for catalytic activity and with Cys-789 and Cys-966 for oligomerization. Cys-110 is near the zinc-binding catalytic center and is normally buried. The oxidation and nitrosylation of Cys-819 allow Cys-110 to be oxidized or nitrosylated, leading to complete inactivation of IDE. Cys-789 is spatially adjacent to Cys-966, and their nitrosylation and oxidation together trigger the oligomerization and inhibition of IDE. Interestingly, the Cys-178 modification buffers the inhibition caused by Cys-819 modification and prevents the oxidation or nitrosylation of Cys-110. The Cys-178 modification can also prevent the oligomerization-mediated inhibition. Thus, IDE can be intricately regulated by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species. The structure of IDE reveals the molecular basis for the long distance interactions of these cysteines and how they regulate IDE function."

https://openalex.org/W2169743816,"The great success of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies has fueled research toward mimicry of their binding sites and the development of new strategies for peptide-based mimetics production. Here, we describe a new combinatorial approach for the production of peptidomimetics using the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from gastrin17 (pyroEGPWLEEEEEAYGWMDF-NH(2)) antibodies as starting material for cyclic peptide synthesis in a microarray format. Gastrin17 is a trophic factor in gastrointestinal tumors, including pancreatic cancer, which makes it an interesting target for development of therapeutic antibodies. Screening of microarrays containing bicyclic peptidomimetics identified a high number of gastrin binders. A strong correlation was observed between gastrin binding and overall charge of the peptidomimetic. Most of the best gastrin binders proceeded from CDRs containing charged residues. In contrast, CDRs from high affinity antibodies containing mostly neutral residues failed to yield good binders. Our experiments revealed essential differences in the mode of antigen binding between CDR-derived peptidomimetics (K(d) values in micromolar range) and the parental monoclonal antibodies (K(d) values in nanomolar range). However, chemically derived peptidomimetics from gastrin binders were very effective in gastrin neutralization studies using cell-based assays, yielding a neutralizing activity in pancreatic tumoral cell lines comparable with that of gastrin-specific monoclonal antibodies. These data support the use of combinatorial CDR-peptide microarrays as a tool for the development of a new generation of chemically synthesized cyclic peptidomimetics with functional activity."

In this study we transmitted the disease from a series of 12 French atypical scrapie isolates in a transgenic mouse model (TgOvPrP4) overexpressing in the brain approximately 0.25, 1.5 or 6x the levels of the PrP(ARQ) ovine prion protein under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. We used an approach based on serum PrP(c) measurements that appeared to reflect the different PrP(c) expression levels in the central nervous system. We found that transmission of atypical scrapie, much more than in classical scrapie or BSE, was strongly influenced by the PrP(c) expression levels of TgOvPrP4 inoculated mice. Whereas TgOvPrP4 mice overexpressing approximately 6x the normal PrP(c) level died after a survival periods of 400 days, those with approximately 1.5x the normal PrP(c) level died at around 700 days. The transmission of atypical scrapie in TgOvPrP4 mouse line was also strongly influenced by the prnp genotypes of the animal source of atypical scrapie. Isolates carrying the AF(141)RQ or AHQ alleles, associated with increased disease susceptibility in the natural host, showed a higher transmissibility in TgOvPrP4 mice. The biochemical analysis of PrP(res) in TgOvPrP4 mouse brains showed a fully conserved pattern, compared to that in the natural host, with three distinct PrP(res) products. Our results throw light on the transmission features of atypical scrapie and suggest that the risk of transmission is intrinsically lower than that of classical scrapie or BSE, especially in relation to the expression level of the prion protein."

Prostaglandins biosynthesis depends on the sequential action of upstream cyclooxygenases (COX) and terminal synthases but no PGF(2alpha) synthases (PGFS) were functionally identified in mammalian cells. In vitro, the most efficient mammalian PGFS belong to aldo-keto reductase 1B (AKR1B) family. The adrenal gland is a major site of AKR1B expression in both human (AKR1B1) and mouse (AKR1B3, AKR1B7). Thus, we examined the PGF(2alpha) biosynthetic pathway and its functional impact on both cortical and medullary zones. Both compartments produced PGF(2alpha) but expressed different biosynthetic isozymes. In chromaffin cells, PGF(2alpha) secretion appeared constitutive and correlated to continuous expression of COX1 and AKR1B3. In steroidogenic cells, PGF(2alpha) secretion was stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and correlated to ACTH-responsiveness of both COX2 and AKR1B7/B1. The pivotal role of AKR1B7 in ACTH-induced PGF(2alpha) release and functional coupling with COX2 was demonstrated using over- and down-expression in cell lines. PGF(2alpha) receptor was only detected in chromaffin cells, making medulla the primary target of PGF(2alpha) action. By comparing PGF(2alpha)-responsiveness of isolated cells and whole adrenal cultures, we demonstrated that PGF(2alpha) repressed glucocorticoid secretion by an indirect mechanism involving a decrease in catecholamine release which in turn decreased adrenal steroidogenesis. PGF(2alpha) may be regarded as a negative autocrine/paracrine regulator within a novel intra-adrenal feedback loop. The coordinated cell-specific regulation of COX2 and AKR1B7 ensures the generation of this stress-induced corticostatic signal."
https://openalex.org/W2027369288,"Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1.To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011).These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2045942034,"The microtubule assembly process has been extensively studied, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. The structure of an artificially generated sheet polymer that alternates two types of lateral contacts and that directly converts into microtubules, has been proposed to correspond to the intermediate sheet structure observed during microtubule assembly. We have studied the self-assembly process of GMPCPP tubulins into sheet and microtubule structures using thermodynamic analysis and stochastic simulations. With the novel assumptions that tubulins can laterally interact in two different forms, and allosterically affect neighboring lateral interactions, we can explain existing experimental observations. At low temperature, the allosteric effect results in the observed sheet structure with alternating lateral interactions as the thermodynamically most stable form. At normal microtubule assembly temperature, our work indicates that a class of sheet structures resembling those observed at low temperature is transiently trapped as an intermediate during the assembly process. This work may shed light on the tubulin molecular interactions, and the role of sheet formation during microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1967040338,"Earlier studies have demonstrated interaction of the murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule K(d) with amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), a ubiquitously expressed member of the amyloid precursor protein family. Our current findings indicate that APLP2 is internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner, as shown by utilization of inhibitors of the clathrin pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that APLP2 and K(d) bind at the cell surface and are internalized together. The APLP2 cytoplasmic tail contains two overlapping consensus motifs for binding to the adaptor protein-2 complex, and mutation of a tyrosine shared by both motifs severely impaired APLP2 internalization and ability to promote K(d) endocytosis. Upon increased expression of wild type APLP2, K(d) molecules were predominantly directed to the lysosomes rather than recycled to the plasma membrane. These findings suggest a model in which APLP2 binds K(d) at the plasma membrane, facilitates uptake of K(d) in a clathrin-dependent manner, and routes the endocytosed K(d) to the lysosomal degradation pathway. Thus, APLP2 has a multistep trafficking function that influences the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2078971224,"While considerable scientific effort has been devoted to studying how birds navigate over long distances, relatively little is known about how targets are detected, obstacles are avoided and smooth landings are orchestrated. Here we examine how visual features in the environment, such as contrasting edges, determine where a bird will land.Landing in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) was investigated by training them to fly from a perch to a feeder, and video-filming their landings. The feeder was placed on a grey disc that produced a contrasting edge against a uniformly blue background. We found that the birds tended to land primarily at the edge of the disc and walk to the feeder, even though the feeder was in the middle of the disc. This suggests that the birds were using the visual contrast at the boundary of the disc to target their landings. When the grey level of the disc was varied systematically, whilst keeping the blue background constant, there was one intermediate grey level at which the budgerigar's preference for the disc boundary disappeared. The budgerigars then landed randomly all over the test surface. Even though this disc is (for humans) clearly distinguishable from the blue background, it offers very little contrast against the background, in the red and green regions of the spectrum.We conclude that budgerigars use visual edges to target and guide landings. Calculations of photoreceptor excitation reveal that edge detection in landing budgerigars is performed by a color-blind luminance channel that sums the signals from the red and green photoreceptors, or, alternatively, receives input from the red double-cones. This finding has close parallels to vision in honeybees and primates, where edge detection and motion perception are also largely color-blind."
https://openalex.org/W1965676885,"We have previously reported that the epithelial cell-specific actin-binding protein villin directly associates with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) through three binding sites that overlap with actin-binding sites in villin. As a result, association of villin with PIP(2) inhibits actin depolymerization and enhances actin cross-linking by villin. In this study, we demonstrate that these three PIP(2)-binding sites also bind the more hydrophilic phospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) but with a higher affinity than PIP(2) (dissociation constant (K(d)) of 22 mum versus 39.5 mum for PIP(2)). More interestingly, unlike PIP(2), the association of villin with LPA inhibits all actin regulatory functions of villin. In addition, unlike PIP(2), LPA dramatically stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of villin by c-Src kinase. These studies suggest that in cells, selective interaction of villin with either PIP(2) or LPA could have dramatically different outcomes on actin reorganization as well as phospholipid-regulated cell signaling. These studies provide a novel regulatory mechanism for phospholipid-induced changes in the microfilament structure and cell function and suggest that LPA could be an intracellular regulator of the actin cytoskeleton."

Exposure to a Cl− channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (50–300 μm) stimulated a 5–100-fold increase in extracellular ATP levels within minutes of the exposure. This rapid response was not a result of changes in cell viability or Cl− channel activity. NPPB also potently stimulated ATP release in HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells expressing a rat P2X7 receptor indicating that P2X7 receptors are not involved in stimulation of ATP release by NPPB. In all cells studied, NPPB rapidly stimulated vesicular exocytosis that persisted many minutes after the exposure. The kinetics of NPPB-evoked exocytosis and ATP release were similar. Furthermore, the magnitudes of NPPB-evoked exocytosis and ATP release were correlated (correlation coefficient 0.77), indicating that NPPB may stimulate exocytosis of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles. These findings provide further support for the concept that vesicular exocytosis plays an important role in cellular ATP release and suggest that NPPB can be used as a biochemical tool to specifically stimulate ATP release through exocytic mechanisms. Cells release ATP in response to physiologic stimuli. Extracellular ATP regulates a broad range of important cellular functions by activation of the purinergic receptors in the plasma membrane. The purpose of these studies was to assess the role of vesicular exocytosis in cellular ATP release. FM1-43 fluorescence was used to measure exocytosis and bioluminescence to measure ATP release in HTC rat hepatoma and Mz-Cha-1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Exposure to a Cl− channel inhibitor 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) (50–300 μm) stimulated a 5–100-fold increase in extracellular ATP levels within minutes of the exposure.

Extracellular ATP acts as a potent signaling molecule in many different tissues including the immune system, neurons, endothelial cells, and secretory epithelia by activation of purinergic receptors in the plasma membrane (1.Burnstock G.

One mechanism for ATP release involves movement of ATP through transporters or channel proteins in the plasma membrane. There is evidence for ATP release through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, connexin and pannexin hemichannels, P2X7-pannexin1 receptor-channel complex, and multiple Cl− channels (6.Sabirov R.Z.

In addition, there is evidence for exocytic vesicular release of ATP (4.Orriss I.R. Knight G.E. Utting J.C. Taylor S.E. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. J. Cell Physiol. 2009; 220: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12.Pankratov Y. Lalo U. Verkhratsky A. North R.A. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, the concentration of ATP in extracellular medium is in the low nanomolar range. Vesicles store ATP in the millimolar range, and exocytosis of these ATP-enriched vesicles increases local ATP concentrations. It has been difficult to study the contribution of exocytosis in ATP release because many cells are capable of releasing ATP through more than one mechanism. For example, ATP release from astrocytes is mediated by both vesicular exocytosis and transport proteins (8.Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C.

Thus, the role of vesicular exocytosis in ATP release is still poorly understood. 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) 2The abbreviations used are: NPPB5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acidHEK293human embryonic kidneyEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorideFM1-43N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino)styryl)pyridinium dibromideDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidCOXcyclooxygenaseCBXcarbenoxoloneMFQmefloquine. is widely used as an inhibitor of many different Cl− channels and has been reported to inhibit ATP release mediated by Cl− channels (16.Sauer H.

In some cells, NPPB also inhibits ATP release mediated by mechanosensitive and pannexin1 channels, and other channels that have not been defined (2.Boudreault F. Grygorczyk R. J.

Thus, NPPB is an inhibitor of channel-mediated ATP release. 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid human embryonic kidney enhanced green fluorescent protein 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino)styryl)pyridinium dibromide 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid cyclooxygenase carbenoxolone mefloquine. The purpose of these studies was to assess the role of vesicular exocytosis in cellular ATP release. Using FM1-43 fluorescence to measure exocytosis and bioluminescence assay to measure ATP release in real time, we found that exposure to NPPB under basal conditions potently stimulates ATP release. These previously unknown effects of NPPB appear to be mediated through stimulation of exocytosis of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles. Studies of ATP release were performed in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. Both cell lines have been utilized as models for cellular ATP release, degradation, and purinergic signaling in secretory epithelia (7.Roman R.M. Wang Y. Lidofsky S.D. Feranchak A.P. Lomri N.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G1391-G1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HTC cells are derived from rat hepatoma, and Mz-Cha-1 cells are derived from human adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder. The procedures for culturing these cells have been previously described (21.Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were used within 48 h after plating. Cellular release of ATP was measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay as previously described (23.Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L. Gruenert D.C. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Roman R.M. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm Petri dishes. Prior to study, cells were gently washed twice with 1 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and then 800 μl of OptiMEM containing 2 mg/ml firefly luciferin-luciferase (Sigma cat. num. FLAAM-5VL) was added to the dish. The dish was placed in a modified TD 20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs), and the intensity of emitted light (luminescence) was measured every 10 s in real time using a 5-s integration interval. Luminescence was expressed as counts in luminometer readings. Luminescence measured under cell-free conditions (dishes plus OptiMEM) was about 0.05% of basal cellular luminescence, indicating that ATP detected in extracellular medium is derived from cells. The effect of NPPB on ATP release was determined by adding 5 μl of stock solution to the edge of a dish and then gently swirling to allow drugs to equilibrate within the dish. Identical volumes of isotonic media were added in control studies to dissociate the effects of NPPB from mechanical stimulation of ATP release. These effects were typically about 5% of basal luminescence. At the concentrations used, d-luciferin was present in excess and not rate limiting, so that the reagent was available to react with ATP molecules released from cells into extracellular medium. All imaging experiments were performed after washing culture medium with a standard physiologic solution that contained 142 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm d-glucose. The pH was 7.25, and osmolarity was 295–305 mosmol/kg. All compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). For imaging experiments, cells were plated on coverslips in the recording chambers and incubated overnight in the culture medium as described above. Cells were washed with a standard physiologic solution, and visualized through a 40× oil immersion objective (NA = 1.35) and an Olympus IX71 microscope. The images were acquired with a Sensicam QE camera controlled by a SlideBook 3.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). The cellular fluorescence was measured by drawing a region of interest over the entire cell and subtracting background fluorescence. The background fluorescence was measured from the regions with no cells. Cell viability was determined by measuring calcein fluorescence. Calcein AM permeates cell membranes, and once inside the cell, this nonfluorescent substrate is converted by cellular esterases into fluorescent negatively charged calcein that is retained by cells with intact plasma membranes. In contrast, calcein rapidly leaks from dead or damaged cells with compromised membranes. For these experiments, cells were incubated with 1 μm calcein AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) dissolved in DMSO for 10–30 min at 37 °C. Prior to measurements, the dye was removed from the extracellular solution. The fluorescence was excited through an excitation filter (peak 480 nm) and collected with an emission filter (peak 535 nm). Calcein fluorescence (F) was measured every 20 s using exposures of 15 ms and expressed as F/F0 where F0 is the initial fluorescence at t = 0 min. In the absence of calcein, no signal was detected in HEK293 or HEK293 cells overexpressing a rat P2X7 receptor tagged with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (HEK293-P2X7). The fluorescence of calcein was about 20-fold larger than the fluorescence of EGFP. This feature permitted the measurement of cell viability in HEK293-P2X7 cells. Cellular localization of the P2X7 receptors in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells was performed using immunofluorescence. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Briefly, cells were plated on the coverslips, fixed, and permeabilized with PBS containing 10% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% Tween 20 for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with primary P2X7 ectoAb (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) at 1:100 in (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibody (Alexa-Fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Invitrogen) at 1:100 in (PBS/0.1% BSA) for 1 h. To visualize cell nucleus, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Invitrogen) for 5 min. Cells were imaged using a confocal microscope Leica TCS SP5 and an oil immersion objective (63×, NA = 1.4). The P2X7 ectoAb staining was detected with an excitation/emission filter (561/610 nm), and an excitation/emission filter (405/452 nm) was used for detection of DAPI nuclear staining. Detection of P2X7 receptors using the P2X7 ectoAb is cell specific (25.Sim J.A. Young M.T. Sung H.Y. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6307-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To determine whether this antibody also binds to other proteins in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells, control experiments were performed by incubating cells with a purified nonspecific isotype IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs, West Grove, PA) and secondary fluorescent antibody. HEK293 cells were used for overexpression of P2X7 receptors, and were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing EGFP expression vector (pIRES2-EGFP) and a rat P2X7 receptor (kindly provided by S. Stojilkovic). Transfection was conducted 24 h after plating the cells using 2 μg of DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 10 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM. After 4.5–6 h of incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced with normal culture medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 24–48 h. Transfected cells were mechanically dispersed and re-cultured with Geneticin G418 sulfate (Invitrogen) for 24–48 h. After selection, transfected cells were cultured in 35-mm Petri dishes for studies of ATP release and recording chambers for imaging experiments. To account for the variability in the number of cells among individual dishes, the total cellular protein content was determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay as described previously (26.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). The BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by measuring absorbances of the samples at 562 nm after incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The concentration of protein in the sample (in μg/ml) was determined using the standard curve of absorbance versus bovine serum albumin protein sample concentration. The magnitude of exocytosis was measured using a fluorescent dye N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(4-(dibutylamino)styryl)pyridinium dibromide (FM1-43) as previously described (27.Kilic G. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FM1-43 binds to membranes but does not permeate through lipid bilayers. The dye is not fluorescent in solution, but it becomes fluorescent upon binding to the biological membranes (28.Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the presence of FM1-43 in the extracellular solution, exocytic insertion of vesicles into the plasma membrane results in staining of the vesicle membrane and an increase in FM1-43 fluorescence. Thus, the overall change in FM1-43 fluorescence provides in real time a measure of the sum of all exocytic events (29.Smith C.B. Betz W.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30.Kilic G. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For these experiments, cells were stained with 4 μm FM1-43 (Invitrogen). The fluorescence was excited with an excitation filter (peak 480 nm) and collected with an emission filter (peak 535 nm). FM1-43 fluorescence was measured every 30 s using exposures of 200 ms. The initial staining of the plasma membrane was used to determine a baseline fluorescence (100%). The magnitude of exocytosis (ΔF) was determined as a change from baseline fluorescence (in percent) 10 min after exposure to NPPB. FM1-43 has a broad excitation and emission spectra, and the changes in FM1-43 fluorescence can be also measured using an excitation filter (peak 535 nm) and an emission filter (peak 610 nm). This approach was used to measure exocytosis in HEK293-P2X7 cells. Initially, the P2X7-positive cells were identified using a 480/535 nm excitation/emission filter. Subsequently, FM1-43 fluorescence was measured from these cells using a 535/610 nm excitation/emission filter. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Results were compared using a two-tailed Student's t test on paired and unpaired data, and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To assess the effects of NPPB on ATP release, the amount of ATP in the medium was measured using luminescence in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. Representative recordings in Fig. 1A illustrates that exposure to NPPB rapidly increased luminescence in both cells by about 5–20-fold, and this stimulatory effect persisted many minutes after the exposure. To determine whether NPPB has an effect on luciferin-luciferase assay, luminescence of ATP standard solution in the absence of cells was measured in response to different concentrations of NPPB. Consistent with previous reports, increasing concentrations of NPPB progressively decreased the sensitivity of luciferin-luciferase to ATP (Fig. 1B) (2.Boudreault F. Grygorczyk R. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulatory effects of NPPB in Fig. 1A are not related to the modulation of luciferin-luciferase assay, but rather they result from stimulation of cellular ATP release. Fig. 1C shows that NPPB-stimulated ATP release in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Because of a substantial loss of sensitivity at higher concentrations, it was not possible to determine the EC50. Furthermore, because NPPB was dissolved in DMSO, the effect of DMSO on ATP release was evaluated. DMSO had no effect on the luciferin-luciferase assay (not shown) or ATP release in both cells (triangles, Fig. 1C). These results indicate that NPPB stimulates ATP release from HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. To assess whether ATP release evoked by NPPB was caused by disruption of the plasma membrane and a leakage of ATP into extracellular solution, cell viability was measured using calcein fluorescence. Fig. 2 shows that NPPB had no effect on calcein fluorescence in HTC cells. When the plasma membrane was ruptured by exposing cells to water, the fluorescence decreased to zero as a result of calcein leakage out of the cell (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in Mz-Cha-1 cells (not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that NPPB-evoked ATP release is mediated by changes in cell viability. NPPB is a potent inhibitor of Cl− channels in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells (21.Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Bodily K. Wang Y. Roman R. Sostman A. Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To assess whether inhibition of Cl− channels is involved in NPPB-evoked ATP release, cells were exposed to another Cl− channel inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS). Similar to NPPB, exposures to DIDS decreased the sensitivity of luciferin-luciferase to ATP in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown). However, DIDS (100 μm) decreased relative luminescence to 0.95 ± 0.10 (n = 4 dishes) and 0.65 ± 0.10 (n = 2 dishes) in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells, respectively. NPPB has been also reported to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) (32.Breuer W. Skorecki K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To assess the potential role of COX, ATP release was measured after addition of indomethacin. Indomethacin (100 μm) did not affect the sensitivity of luciferin-luciferase to ATP (not shown), but decreased relative luminescence to 0.90 ± 0.04 (n = 4 dishes) and 0.70 ± 0.04 (n = 2 dishes) in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells, respectively. These data suggest that stimulation of ATP release by NPPB can be dissociated from inhibition of Cl− channels or COX activity. To assess whether P2X7 receptors are involved in NPPB-evoked ATP release, we looked for the presence of P2X7 receptors using immunofluorescence. Representative images in Fig. 3 illustrate that P2X7 receptors are present in both HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. However, because P2X7 receptors have not been functionally characterized in these cells and many P2X7 antagonists have other non-P2X7 receptor-mediated effects, we used a different strategy to assess the role of P2X7 receptors (33.Qiu F. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C250-C255Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34.Donnelly-Roberts D.L. Jarvis M.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). ATP release was measured in HEK293 cells that overexpress a rat P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptors were tagged with EGFP, and following transfection, EGFP fluorescence was detected in ∼80% of cells (Fig. 4A, left panels). Exposure to a P2X7 agonist BzATP induced the formation of membrane blebs in HEK293-P2X7 cells but not in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A, middle and right panels), indicating that the plasma membrane P2X7 receptors are functional, consistent with previous reports using the same plasmid (35.He M.L. Zemkova H. Koshimizu T.A. Tomić M. Stojilkovic S.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C467-C479Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36.Yan Z. Li S. Liang Z. Tomić M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Basal ATP levels in HEK293-P2X7 cells (547,546 ± 12,724 counts, n = 23 dishes) were significantly larger than in HEK293 cells (333,730 ± 7,584 counts, n = 37 dishes, p < 0.001). To assess whether this increase was caused by differences in the number of cells, the total protein content in the dish was measured. The total protein content in HEK293-P2X7 cells (0.68 ± 0.04 μg/ml, n = 19 dishes) was significantly lower than in HEK293 cells (0.98 ± 0.12 μg/ml, n = 17 dishes, p < 0.02). Thus, overexpression of P2X7 receptors induces a cellular phenotype with the increased capacity for ATP release under basal conditions. Fig. 4B shows that NPPB evoked a large and sustained ATP release in both HEK293 and HEK293-P2X7 cells. Furthermore, the dose dependence of NPPB-evoked ATP release in both cells was similar (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that P2X7 receptors are not required for stimulation of ATP release by NPPB. To assess the role of pannexin1, ATP release was measured after inhibition of pannexin1 channels with carbenoxolone (CBX). The peak of relative luminescence evoked by 100 μm NPPB was not different in the absence or presence of 100 μm CBX in HEK293 cells (p > 0.58, n = 4) and HEK293-P2X7 cells (p > 0.48, n = 4). These results suggest that pannexin1 channels and/or a P2X7-pannexin1 receptor channel complex are not involved in NPPB-evoked ATP release. To assess whether NPPB has an effect on viability of HEK293 cells, calcein fluorescence was measured after exposure to NPPB. Fig. 5A shows that NPPB had no effect on calcein fluorescence in HEK293 or HEK293-P2X7 cells, indicating that NPPB does not increase extracellular ATP concentration by disrupting the plasma membrane. Further experiments revealed an interesting property of calcein. BzATP had no effect on calcein fluorescence in HEK293 cells, but slowly decreased calcein fluorescence in HEK293-P2X7 cells (Fig. 5B). Because stimulation of P2X7 receptors is associated with activation of a dye-permeable pathway that allows passage of large molecules across the plasma membrane, it is likely that calcein (molecular mass, ∼620 Da) permeates through a P2X7 receptor-activated pore (37.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. Purinergic Signal. 2009; 5: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Pharmacological studies have indicated that slow permeation of calcein through a P2X7 receptor-activated pore is independent of activation of pannexin1 channels. Probenecid increased BzATP-evoked loss of calcein (Fig. 5, B and C). Other inhibitors of pannexin1 channels, mefloquine (MFQ), CBX, and NPPB did not significantly change calcein loss in response to BzATP (Fig. 5C). Recent studies have described a slow pannexin1-independent dye-permeable pathway in HEK293-P2X7 cells (38.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2386-2394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, calcein may be potentially useful to measure activation of this slow pathway. To assess whether NPPB stimulates vesicular exocytosis, FM1-43 fluorescence was measured after exposure to NPPB. Representative images in Fig. 6A illustrate that NPPB markedly increased FM1-43 fluorescence in both HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. If NPPB stimulates the fluorescence of membrane-bound FM1-43, then it would increase FM1-43 fluorescence transiently, and no further increase would be observed in the absence of exocytosis. Quantitative analysis in Fig. 6, B and C shows that NPPB stimulated a slow gradual increase in FM1-43 fluorescence that persisted many minutes after the exposure. Thus, it is unlikely that NPPB stimulates the fluorescence of membrane-bound FM1-43. A gradual increase in FM1-43 fluorescence suggests that NPPB stimulates continuous vesicular exocytosis. To further examine the effect of NPPB, the dye and NPPB were washed from the extracellular solution. After the dye was removed from the plasma membrane, substantial FM1-43 fluorescence was detected in the cytosol (right panels in Fig. 6A). In contrast to NPPB, FM1-43 is not membrane permeable, and the residual fluorescence comes from the dye trapped through endocytosis in the intracellular compartments. Moreover, an increase in FM1-43 fluorescence that occurred in the presence of NPPB was not different from the fluorescence that remained after washing in HTC cells (p > 0.31, n = 5 cells) and Mz-Cha-1 cells, (p > 0.12, n = 5 cells). These data indicate that NPPB stimulates vesicular exocytosis, which is followed by compensatory endocytosis, and this activity persists many minutes after exposure to NPPB. The data in Fig. 6, B and C show that DMSO also increased FM1-43 fluorescence. However, these changes were about 10–20% in 10 min, which correspond to the rates of exocytosis of 1–2% per min that have been previously found in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells and result from constitutive exocytosis under basal conditions (27.Kilic G. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39.Doctor R.B. Dahl R. Fouassier L. Kilic G. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1042-C1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 6D shows that the magnitude of NPPB-evoked exocytosis was concentration dependent in both HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. To assess whether NPPB stimulates exocytosis through mechanisms involving P2X7 receptors, FM1-43 fluorescence was measured in HEK293-P2X7 cells. Exposure to NPPB potently increased FM1-43 fluorescence in both HEK293 and HEK293-P2X7 cells, and the rates of FM1-43 fluorescence remained elevated many minutes after exposure (Fig. 7, A and B). Fig. 7C shows that dose-response curves of NPPB-evoked exocytosis in HEK293 and HEK293-P2X7 cells were similar. Thus, stimulation of exocytosis by NPPB does not require signaling through P2X7 receptors. Collectively, these data indicate that NPPB stimulates both vesicular exocytosis and ATP release with similar kinetics and dose dependence in all cells studied (compare Figs. 1 and 6, also Figs. 4 and 7). When the magnitude of exocytosis was plotted versus relative luminescence obtained from all cells with NPPB (50–200 μm), the larger exocytic responses were associated with larger ATP release (correlation coefficient: 0.77, Fig. 8). The magnitude of exocytosis was not correlated with ATP release for 300 μm NPPB (inset in Fig. 8). These results suggest that NPPB may stimulate cellular ATP release in part by exocytosis of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles. NPPB is widely used as a potent inhibitor of many different Cl− channels. Consequently, NPPB inhibits Cl− channel-mediated ATP release. The major finding of these studies is that NPPB is also able to stimulate cellular ATP release through mechanisms that are independent of the activity of Cl− channels. These novel effects of NPPB appear to be mediated in part by exocytosis of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles. Thus, NPPB may be used as a biochemical tool to specifically stimulate ATP release through vesicular exocytosis. The effects of NPPB on ATP release were studied in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells. These cells have been used as models for ATP release and purinergic signaling in liver and biliary epithelia, respectively (22.Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40.Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Doctor R.B. Salter K.D. Toker A. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30979-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Exposure to NPPB rapidly evoked a 5–100-fold increase in ATP release that persisted many minutes after the exposure. Two important findings suggest that Cl− channels are not likely to be involved in these effects of NPPB. First, it has been demonstrated that movement of ATP through Cl− channels contributes to ATP release (41.Okada S.F. O'Neal W.K. Huang P. Nicholas R.A. Ostrowski L.E. Craigen W.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 42.Bell P.D. Lapointe J.Y. Sabirov R. Hayashi S. Peti-Peterdi J. Manabe K. Kovacs G. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4322-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 43.Sabirov R.Z. Dutta A.K. Okada Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, if NPPB inhibits Cl− channels, it would be anticipated to inhibit ATP release. Consistent with this idea, DIDS, another nonselective inhibitor of Cl− channels, inhibited basal ATP release by 5–35% in HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells, respectively. Similar to DIDS, NPPB may have inhibited basal ATP release, but this small decrease may have been masked by massive ATP release through Cl− channel-independent mechanism(s). Second, it is also possible that inhibition of Cl− channels by NPPB may activate other mechanisms of ATP release. However, the dose response of NPPB-evoked ATP release does not support this hypothesis. Whereas NPPB concentrations required to stimulate ATP release were >50 μm, NPPB potently inhibits Cl− channels at low micromolar concentrations (44.Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). At these concentrations, NPPB had almost no effect on ATP release in all cells studied here (see Figs. 1C and 4C). These results provide strong evidence that Cl− channels are not involved in stimulation of ATP release by NPPB. Exposure to NPBB potently stimulated vesicular exocytosis within minutes of exposure, and this exocytic activity persisted many minutes after the exposure in each cell type tested. Notably, the kinetics of NPPB-evoked exocytosis and ATP release were similar, and stimulation of exocytosis also required NPPB concentrations of >50 μm. These findings provide support for the concept that NPPB may act by mobilizing a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles and sustained exocytosis of these vesicles may mediate ATP release. The data in Fig. 8 provide support for this concept by showing that the magnitudes of exocytosis, and ATP release were correlated. However, at the highest concentration of NPPB tested (300 μm), the correlation was lost. The reasons for this discrepancy are not known for certain. One explanation may be that NPPB stimulates ATP release through mechanisms other than exocytosis, and these mechanisms become dominant only at high concentrations. Another explanation may be that a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles is limited. Thus, if exocytic vesicles stained with FM1-43 are endocytosed and refilled with ATP and subsequently undergo the next round of exocytosis, then ATP release from these vesicles would not further increase FM1-43 fluorescence. Indeed, exposures to 300 μm NPPB stimulated massive 50–200-fold increase in ATP release (see inset in Fig. 8). Consistent with this explanation, when the dye was removed from the plasma membrane, NPPB-evoked increases in FM1-43 fluorescence were detected in the cytosol (see Fig. 6A). These results are indicative of ongoing endocytosis and suggest that NPPB may stimulate trafficking of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles. Assuming that constitutive membrane trafficking of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles contributes to ATP release under basal conditions; then NPPB may act to rapidly recruit new vesicles into this pool and/or mobilize these vesicles to undergo fusion with the plasma membrane. Assuming that vesicular exocytosis is important for NPPB-evoked ATP release, several important points merit emphasis. First, NPPB may also stimulate insertion of ATP transport proteins into the plasma membrane and/or activate these proteins already present in the cell membrane. We used HEK293 transfected with a rat P2X7 receptor to assess the potential contribution of P2X7 receptors. These proteins were selected because they contribute to membrane ATP permeability and regulate a broad range of membrane-trafficking responses (14.Suadicani S.O. Brosnan C.F. Scemes E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 45.Qu Y. Dubyak G.R. Purinergic Signal. 2009; 5: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46.Kochukov M.Y. Ritchie A.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C992-C1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As expected, BzATP induced the formation of membrane blebs in HEK293-P2X7 cells and not in HEK293 cells. However, a population of HEK293-P2X7 cells with the highest expression level exhibited a decrease in the number of membrane blebs (see Fig. 4A). The reasons for this discrepancy are not known. One possible explanation may be that high expression levels of P2X7 receptors in the cytosol decrease the number of P2X7 receptors in the plasma membrane. Another explanation may be that P2X7 receptor crowding in the plasma membrane stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a heat shock protein 90 within the P2X7 receptor complex. This phosphorylation has been shown to inhibit the P2X7 receptor function (47.Adinolfi E. Kim M. Young M.T. Di Virgilio F. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37344-37351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In any case, previous studies have demonstrated that P2X7 receptors contribute to ATP release in HEK293-P2X7 cells under basal conditions (48.Pellegatti P. Falzoni S. Pinton P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We also found that HEK293-P2X7 cells released more ATP than HEK293 cells under basal conditions. However, the effects of NPPB were observed in both HEK293 and HEK293-P2X7 cells, indicating that P2X7 receptors are not required for stimulation of ATP release or vesicular exocytosis by NPPB. Second, it has been proposed that permeation of large molecules through P2X7 receptors requires the presence of pannexin1 (9.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that pannexin1 per se forms an ion channel permeable to ATP (49.Bao L. Locovei S. Dahl G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 50.Ransford G.A. Fregien N. Qiu F. Dahl G. Conner G.E. Salathe M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 41: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Whereas HEK293 cells express pannexin1, it is not known whether HTC and Mz-Cha-1 cells express pannexin1 (9.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). In any case, it is unlikely that NPPB-evoked ATP release is mediated through pannexin1 channels, because CBX had no effect on NPPB-evoked ATP release in both HEK293 and HEK293-P2X7 cells. Finally, the cellular mechanisms responsible for exocytosis of ATP-enriched vesicles by NPPB are not known. Because NPPB is membrane permeable, it not known whether NPPB acts from the extracellular and/or intracellular site. We have previously demonstrated that insulin stimulates exocytosis of Cl− channel-containing vesicles, and this response leads to an increase in membrane Cl− permeability in HTC cells (27.Kilic G. Doctor R.B. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, insulin had no effect on ATP release in HTC cells. 3G. Kilic, unpublished data. Thus, it is attractive to speculate that multiple vesicle pools exist, and exocytosis of these vesicles may be important for shaping the cellular response to different physiologic stimuli. In summary, these findings provide further support for the concept that vesicular exocytosis plays a key role in the regulation of cellular ATP release and suggest that NPPB may be used as a biochemical tool to specifically stimulate ATP release through exocytosis of a pool of ATP-enriched vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2017949518,"Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is an arachidonic acid metabolite that counters transforming growth factor-beta-induced fibroblast activation via E prostanoid 2 (EP2) receptor binding. Phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a lipid phosphatase that, by antagonizing the phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, also inhibits fibroblast activation. Here, we show that PTEN directly regulates PGE(2) inhibition of fibroblast activation by augmenting EP2 receptor expression. The increase in collagen production and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression observed in fibroblasts in which PTEN is deficient was resistant to the usual suppressive effects of PGE(2). This was due to marked down-regulation of EP2, a G(s) protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the inhibitory actions of this prostanoid via cAMP. pten(-/-) or PTEN-inhibited fibroblasts in which the PI3K pathway was blocked demonstrated a restoration of EP2 receptor expression, due to augmented gene transcription and mRNA instability. Importantly, restoration of the balance between PI3K and PTEN reestablished the inhibitory effect of PGE(2) on fibroblast activation. No such influence of PTEN was observed on alternative E prostanoid GPCRs. Moreover, our studies identified a positive feedback loop in which cAMP signaling enhanced EP2 receptor expression, independent of PTEN. Therefore, our findings indicate that PTEN regulates the antifibrotic effects of PGE(2) by a specific and permissive effect on EP2 receptor expression. Further, our data imply that cAMP signaling circumvents EP2 down-regulation in pten-deficient cells to restore EP2 receptor expression. This is the first description, to our knowledge, of PI3K/PTEN balance directing GPCR expression, and provides a novel mechanism for cellular effects of PTEN."

Mdr transporters exist in many families of transport proteins that utilize various transport mechanisms (1.Higgins C.F. Nature. 2007; 446: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 2.Saier Jr., M.H. Paulsen I.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Mdr transporters from different families share many similar mechanistic features (3.Fluman N. Bibi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4.Venter H. Shahi S. Balakrishnan L. Velamakanni S. Bapna A. Woebking B. van Veen H.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that certain aspects of multispecific transport by transporters having different structures and families are similar. The research of recent years has shed light on the major biochemical properties of Mdr transporters. These transporters contain large substrate-binding pockets and can extract their substrates from the cytoplasm and/or the membrane. Additionally, it appears that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions underlie multispecific drug binding (reviewed in Ref. 3.Fluman N. Bibi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying transport and coupling remains to be elucidated. Transporters function by alternating between conformational states; for efficient coupling the transporter must be able to conformationally respond to substrate binding. In the case of Mdr transporters, this situation is intriguing because they should be able to produce one or more transport-competent conformational responses that fit a variety of chemically and structurally unrelated substrates. Do all substrates induce the same conformational change? Or do dissimilar substrates induce different conformational changes, all of which facilitate transport? Although it was shown that substrate binding indeed induces conformational changes in Mdr transporters (5.Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is not understood how a single transporter can be “conformationally responsive” to the binding of a diverse group of compounds, such that all of them induce structural rearrangements in the protein that facilitate transport. Here we studied this question by utilizing several approaches for detecting conformational changes in the Escherichia coli Mdr transporter MdfA, which serves as a model of secondary Mdr transport (7.Sigal N. Cohen-Karni D. Siemion S. Bibi E. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 11: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MdfA is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, which constitutes the largest family of transporters (8.Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jähn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar) and is the most prominent family of bacterial drug transporters, many of which function as drug/H+ antiporters (3.Fluman N. Bibi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The study reported here suggests that dissimilar substrates indeed induce similar conformational changes in MdfA. Additionally, we show that even nonsubstrate compounds can induce related conformational changes, provided that they are forced to bind at the putative Mdr recognition pocket of MdfA. Thus, the conformational changes are generated promiscuously. We conclude that MdfA has a sensitive conformational switch that can be triggered either by substrate binding or by attaching unrelated agents inside the pocket. Plasmids for overexpression of MdfA or various single cysteine mutants have been previously described (6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9.Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pT7–5/Para/mdfA6HIS encoding the single cysteine mutant G410C was generated utilizing a standard PCR method with mutagenic oligonucleotide primers and a plasmid encoding Cys-less MdfA as a template. The plasmid was sequenced to verify that only the desired mutation was inserted. T&GE. coli cells harboring plasmid pUC18/Para/mdfA6HIS or pT7–5/Para/mdfA6HIS were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Overnight cultures were diluted to 0.07 A600 units and grown to 1.0 A600 units, and the culture was then induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1 h. A typical 10-liter culture yielded ∼15 g (wet weight) of cells. Cell pellets were washed once in 150 ml of 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.3) supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, and collected by centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g). Next, the cells were suspended in 90 ml of the same buffer containing 10 μg/ml DNase and 1 mm PMSF and passed three times through a liquidizer (Emulsiflex-C5; Avestin) (10,000 p.s.i.) for disruption. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 8,000 × g), and the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g). The membranes were homogenized in 27 ml of urea buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 m urea, 10% glycerol, 28 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and collected by ultracentrifugation (2.5 h, 100,000 × g). The membranes were washed with 27 ml of membrane buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Finally, the membranes were suspended by homogenization in 7 ml of the same buffer, and aliquots of 1 ml were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The membranes were thawed quickly at 37 °C and transferred to ice, collected by ultracentrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g), resuspended, and homogenized in an equal volume of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol). Sulfhydryl reagents (final concentration, 2 mm) were added, and the suspension was sonicated (twice for 10 s using a probe sonicator) to allow distribution of the reagent on both sides of the membrane. The reaction was completed overnight by tilting at 4 °C. When light-sensitive reagents were used, the reaction and subsequent steps of the experiments were done in the dark to minimize bleaching. The membranes were diluted to 2.7 ml in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% β-dodecyl maltopyranoside (DDM), 5 mm imidazole) and solubilized by the addition of 0.33 ml of 10% DDM (final concentration, 1.1%). Insoluble material was discarded by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 100,000 × g), and the soluble fraction was mixed with solubilization buffer-equilibrated Talon beads (Clontech) (0.25 ml). Next, the mixture was agitated for 3 h at 4 °C, and the suspension was poured into a column. The column was then washed (2 × 2 ml of solubilization buffer). MdfA was eluted in 0.75 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.12 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 100 mm imidazole) after initial discard of 0.125 ml. The protein was then dialyzed overnight against dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.12 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% DDM) at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring A280. The proteins were denatured by 1% SDS to assist the exposure of cysteine residues. To test the degree of free cysteines, the protein was allowed to react with Mal-PEG (5000 kDa) for 2–3 h at room temperature. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%), followed by Coomassie staining. The Mal-PEG-MdfA adduct appeared ∼20 kDa heavier than MdfA or MdfA modified by any of the test sulfhydryl reagents. The binding assays were performed essentially as described (9.Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Purified protein (typically 30 μg) was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (150 μl) in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% DDM) and gently agitated for 30 min at 4 °C. The unbound material (supernatant) was discarded by brief centrifugation (2 min, 700 × g). The beads were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% DDM), divided into 100-μl aliquots, and mixed with 100 μl of substrate containing solutions (in buffer C) to yield a final concentration of 10 nm [3H]TPP (2 Ci/mmol) either in the presence or absence of 1 mm cold TPP or 0.5 mm chloramphenicol (Cm). The mixture was incubated by tilting for 10 min at 4 °C. 180 μl of the resin was then transferred to a Promega Wizard minicolumn on top of a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 s. Unbound (flow-through) material was discarded, and the resin was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C containing 350 mm imidazole. The radioactivity of this suspension was measured by liquid scintillation. The amount of [3H]TPP bound to the resin in the absence of MdfA was subtracted from all measurements. The amount of bead-bound protein was determined for each of the differently modified proteins for comparison, by analyzing the eluates by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and densitometry. For spectra measurements, MdfA was diluted to 1 μm in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.12 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM), transferred to a quartz cuvette, and preheated to 30 °C in the fluorimeter (Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer). The emission spectra were recorded using excitation wavelengths of 280 or 375 nm for tryptophan or mBBr fluorescence, respectively, in the presence or absence of 50 μm TPP. The inner filter effect introduced by the slight absorption of TPP was corrected as described (10.Kubista M. Sjoback R. Eriksson S. Albinsson B. Analyst. 1994; 119: 417-419Crossref Google Scholar). For TPP binding experiments, MdfA was diluted in binding buffer to 0.1–0.25 μm. A prewarmed MdfA sample (2 ml at 30 °C) was continuously stirred in a quartz cuvette throughout the experiment. The fluorescence was measured continuously, and the sample was titrated by the addition of 10-μl TPP aliquots (in binding buffer) to yield the indicated final concentrations and incubated with TPP for 1 min, and the fluorescence was measured. Excitation/emission wavelengths for tryptophan and mBBr fluorescence were 280/340 and 375/460 nm, respectively. The TPP-induced inner filter effect was corrected in the tryptophan fluorescence measurements as described (10.Kubista M. Sjoback R. Eriksson S. Albinsson B. Analyst. 1994; 119: 417-419Crossref Google Scholar). The concentration of Cm was kept tightly constant to avoid correcting for Cm light absorption. The measurements were done in triplicate, and fluorescence of buffer/TPP solutions containing no MdfA was subtracted. The results were fitted to the following binding function using the nonlinear regression software LABfitTM, %ΔF=%ΔFmax×[TPP]kd+[TPP](Eq. 1) where %ΔF is the percentage of fluorescence change (quenching or increase), %ΔFmax represents %ΔF in a saturating TPP concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. 20 μl of MdfA (0.15 μg/ml in binding buffer) were mixed with 3 μl of the substrate to yield 50 μm TPP or 1 mm in the case of other substrates/compounds. To initiate proteolysis, 3 μl of 5 mg/ml PK (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2) were added and mixed. Proteolysis was typically allowed to proceed for 10 min or several hours at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 μl of 200 mm PMSF followed by incubation at room temperature (10 min). The cleaved protein was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. We have previously employed a genetic screen to study how MdfA interacts with its substrates (6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This assay identified residues that potentially participate in Mdr recognition. When viewed on a three-dimensional model of the transporter (11.Sigal N. Vardy E. Molshanski-Mor S. Eitan A. Pilpel Y. Schuldiner S. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14870-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), most of the genetically identified residues appear to line a central pathway in MdfA, proposed to constitute an Mdr recognition pocket (Fig. 1). Several of the genetically identified sites have been studied in more detail, and residue Ala147 was found important for interaction of the transporter with Cm (6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate substrate binding further, we labeled the putative pocket by a fluorescence probe covalently bound at position 147, utilizing a functional Cys-less mutant with a single cysteine inserted at this position (MdfA-A147C). To this end, we used the cysteine-reactive fluorescent compound mBBr (12.Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which also proved useful for studying integral membrane proteins (13.Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Labeling was accomplished by incubating isolated membranes with mBBr, and the mBBr-MdfA adduct was purified (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of mBBr labeling was analyzed using a second sulfhydryl reagent, Mal-PEG, which increases the mass of the protein upon covalent binding. When mixed with the unlabeled MdfA-A147C mutant, Mal-PEG reacted with the protein and generated a single, higher molecular weight adduct, consistent with the presence of one reactive cysteine in the protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In contrast, when MdfA-A147C was prelabeled by mBBr, the reaction with Mal-PEG was blocked (Fig. 2A, lane 4), suggesting that the cysteine at position 147 was already occupied by mBBr. Thus, a large fraction of MdfA-A147C appears to be labeled by mBBr. To determine whether the modified protein is functional, we compared the substrate binding capabilities of the purified labeled and unlabeled MdfA-A147C. Surprisingly, we observed that the mBBr-labeled transporter binds more TPP (an MdfA substrate) than the unlabeled protein (Fig. 2B, gray bars). Because MdfA in our experiments is nearly pure (Fig. 2A), this indicates that the modification by mBBr stimulated TPP binding by MdfA.FIGURE 2Purification and TPP binding activity of mBBr-labeled MdfA-A147C. A, membranes from cells overexpressing MdfA-A147C were incubated in the presence or absence of mBBr. MdfA was purified to homogeneity and treated as described under “Materials and Methods” with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) Mal-PEG, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained by Coomassie. Mal-PEG adduct is indicated by an arrow.

Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test the potential relevance to our results with the mBBr-labeled protein, we measured the effect of Cm on TPP binding by the purified, labeled, and unlabeled MdfA-A147C proteins. Indeed, as observed previously with wild-type MdfA, Cm also stimulated the binding of TPP to MdfA-A147C but to a lesser extent, possibly because cysteine in this position slightly impairs the interaction with chloramphenicol (6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, Cm had merely a minor effect on TPP binding to the mBBr-labeled protein (Fig. 2B). This slight effect might reflect stimulation of a small fraction of the protein that was not labeled by mBBr. The diminished effect of Cm on TPP binding indicates that the stimulatory potential of Cm had been exploited by mBBr labeling at this site. In addition, it is also likely that Cm binding was blocked by the covalently bound mBBr. Notably, the effects of mBBr and Cm were quantitatively similar (Fig. 2B), suggesting that mBBr labeling and Cm binding affect the transporter similarly (see below). As demonstrated previously, the stimulatory effect of Cm on TPP binding is due to an increased affinity of the binary complex MdfA-Cm for TPP (9.Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To further characterize and compare the effects of Cm and mBBr on MdfA-A147C, we measured the affinity for TPP by utilizing two fluorimetric assays. With the unlabeled MdfA-A147C, we used intrinsic fluorescence measurements, based on a reduction (of ∼10%) in fluorescence upon TPP binding (Fig. 3A). With the mBBr-labeled transporter, we utilized mBBr fluorescence, which increases (by ∼30%) upon TPP binding (Fig. 3C). Notably, by measuring mBBr fluorescence, we could specifically examine the labeled protein molecules because unlabeled molecules are invisible. The results of these studies show that both Cm binding and mBBr labeling increase the affinity for TPP by ∼2.5-fold and that Cm has no influence on the mBBr-labeled protein (Fig. 3, B and D), consistent with the results of direct binding experiments (Fig. 2B). Thus, affinity measurements imply that mBBr labeling affects MdfA by a mechanism similar to that of Cm binding. Because mBBr and Cm are structurally dissimilar (see Fig. 5A), it seems unlikely that the stimulation is mediated through direct interaction of Cm or mBBr with TPP. Instead, the increased TPP affinity probably results from a conformational change in MdfA that is induced by Cm binding or mBBr labeling.FIGURE 5Effects of various sulfhydryl reagents on Cys-less MdfA or MdfA-A147C.

Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because this mutant does not contain cysteines, it cannot be labeled by mBBr. Fig. 3E shows that free mBBr did not stimulate TPP binding to Cys-less MdfA. In contrast, the free compound inhibited TPP binding, suggesting that mBBr and TPP might compete. Direct binding competition experiments revealed a kI of ∼34 μm for mBBr (Fig. 3E). Thus, for mBBr-induced stimulation of TPP binding to occur, mBBr must be covalently attached to residue A147C. Moreover, saturating the transporter with free mBBr did not prevent Cm from stimulating TPP binding to Cys-less MdfA (Fig. 3F), indicating that free mBBr interacts with a site that differs from position 147. Therefore, we conclude that the Cm-mimicking effect (Fig. 2B) is forced by covalent attachment of mBBr at position 147. Previous studies (9.Lewinson O. Bibi E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12612-12618Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and those presented above suggest that MdfA responds to Cm or covalently bound mBBr by changing its conformation. To examine this notion further, we utilized a limited proteolysis approach in which detergent-solubilized MdfA was proteolyzed by PK in the absence or presence of substrates or covalent modifications. The PMSF-sensitive cleavage of Cys-less MdfA by PK proceeded through several steps (Fig. 4A). The initial cleavage was relatively rapid (completed by <10 min) and resulted in a ∼10% shorter protein, as judged by its mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A, lane 3). This product was designated CF1 (cleavage fragment 1) (Fig. 4A). The cleavage event that followed was slower (hours) and generated a shorter proteolytic product, designated CF2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–11). The addition of the substrate TPP changed the proteolysis pattern by significantly increasing the amount of CF2, with no effect on the amount of CF1 (Fig. 4A, lane 5), indicating that TPP affects the availability of proteolytic sites for PK in CF2. This effect most likely results from a substrate-induced conformational change in MdfA (see “Discussion”). Kinetic trials showed that TPP increased the accumulation of CF2 without affecting the rate of CF1 degradation (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1–7 with lanes 8–14), implying that TPP binding stabilizes CF2 against cleavage by PK. Notably, although both CF1 and CF2 were sometimes affected by substrates and chemical modifications, we focused on the behavior of CF2 because the appearance and disappearance of CF1 were less reproducible. To assess the specificity of this phenomenon, we tested how other substrates affect the proteolysis of MdfA by PK (Fig. 4A). The results show that Cm, ethidium, and tetracycline had similar but more moderate effects on the proteolysis compared with TPP (lanes 6–8). In contrast, compounds that are not substrates, such as lactose, spectinomycin, and nalidixic acid, did not have any effect compared with the control sample with no addition (compare lanes 9–11 with lane 4). Thus, the apparent stabilization of CF2 is mediated by various substrates that may influence the conformation of MdfA similarly. Next, we tested the impact of TPP and Cm on the PK-catalyzed cleavage of mutant MdfA-A147C and a similar picture emerged, with both substrates stabilizing the CF2 form: TPP strongly and Cm moderately (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2). Interestingly, however, when MdfA-A147C was labeled by mBBr, the covalent modification per se influenced CF2 cleavage just like substrates (Fig. 4C, lane 6), reinforcing the notion that mBBr labeling affects MdfA by inducing a substrate-like conformational change. The addition of Cm or TPP to mBBr-MdfA-A147C did not significantly improve the stability of CF2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 6–8). Notably, the effect of mBBr on the proteolysis was more similar to the effect of TPP compared with Cm. Taking into account the results of the TPP binding experiments (Figs. 2 and 3), we suggest that both Cm binding and the covalent attachment of mBBr at position 147 induce a high TPP affinity conformation in MdfA. The PK cleavage experiments suggest that the effect of Cm on MdfA-A147C is moderate compared with that of TPP or covalently bound mBBr, possibly reflecting a reduced affinity or response of this mutant to Cm. This finding is also in line with the reduced stimulation imposed by Cm on TPP binding to this mutant as compared with Cys-less MdfA (compare Fig. 2B with Fig. 3F), suggesting, as noted above, that the A147C mutation itself partially disrupts the interaction of MdfA with Cm (6.Adler J. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8957-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In direct binding assays, we observed that free mBBr has an inhibitory effect on TPP binding to Cys-less MdfA (Fig. 3E), indicating that it might be a substrate and that in its free form it occupies a site that differs from 147. To test this notion further, we studied the effect of free mBBr on the proteolysis of the nonreactive Cys-less transporter. The results indicate that free mBBr also stabilizes the CF2 fragment against PK (Fig. 4D), lending support to the suggestion that it is a true substrate of MdfA. Our results suggest that forced attachment of mBBr in the putative Cm-binding site triggers a substrate-induced conformational change in MdfA. Can this effect also be reproduced with other reagents? To address this question, we characterized the conformation of MdfA-A147C after modification by various cysteine-reactive compounds. We chose six structurally diverse sulfhydryl reagents that do not resemble known MdfA substrates (Fig. 5A). None of the reagents significantly affected the TPP binding activity of the nonreactive Cys-less MdfA (Fig. 5B). Similarly, although the PK-produced fragment CF2 of Cys-less MdfA is slightly more stable than that of MdfA-A147C, no further stabilization was induced by the free sulfhydryl reagents compared with TPP- or the Cm-induced CF2 stabilization (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 4–9 with lanes 2 and 3). Next, the reagents were covalently bound to MdfA-A147C (Fig. 5D), and various effects of the modifications on TPP binding were clearly evident (Fig. 5E). NEM induced a Cm-like stimulation of [3H]TPP binding, demonstrating that such a conformational response to modifications at position 147 is not unique to mBBr, despite the structural difference between mBBr and NEM. In contrast, four of the other reagents (AMS, MTSES, MTSEA, an"

https://openalex.org/W2121935972,"Background Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are recently identified lentiviruses that cause progressive immune decline and ultimately death in infected cats and humans. It is of great interest to understand how to prevent immune system collapse caused by these lentiviruses. We recently described that disease caused by a virulent FIV strain in cats can be attenuated if animals are first infected with a feline immunodeficiency virus derived from a wild cougar. The detailed temporal tracking of cat immunological parameters in response to two viral infections resulted in high-dimensional datasets containing variables that exhibit strong co-variation. Initial analyses of these complex data using univariate statistical techniques did not account for interactions among immunological response variables and therefore potentially obscured significant effects between infection state and immunological parameters. Methodology and Principal Findings Here, we apply a suite of multivariate statistical tools, including Principal Component Analysis, MANOVA and Linear Discriminant Analysis, to temporal immunological data resulting from FIV superinfection in domestic cats. We investigated the co-variation among immunological responses, the differences in immune parameters among four groups of five cats each (uninfected, single and dual infected animals), and the “immune profiles” that discriminate among them over the first four weeks following superinfection. Dual infected cats mount an immune response by 24 days post superinfection that is characterized by elevated levels of CD8 and CD25 cells and increased expression of IL4 and IFNγ, and FAS. This profile discriminates dual infected cats from cats infected with FIV alone, which show high IL-10 and lower numbers of CD8 and CD25 cells. Conclusions Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate both the dynamic nature of the immune response to FIV single and dual infection and the development of a unique immunological profile in dual infected cats, which are protected from immune decline."
https://openalex.org/W2134946618,"DNase II enzymes are acidic endonucleases that have been implicated in mediating apoptotic DNA degradation, a critical cell death execution event. C. elegans genome contains three DNase II homologues, NUC-1, CRN-6, and CRN-7, but their expression patterns, acting sites, and roles in apoptotic DNA degradation and development are unclear. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of three C. elegans DNase II genes and found that nuc-1 plays a major role, crn-6 plays an auxiliary role, and crn-7 plays a negligible role in resolving 3′ OH DNA breaks generated in apoptotic cells. Promoter swapping experiments suggest that crn-6 but not crn-7 can partially substitute for nuc-1 in mediating apoptotic DNA degradation and both fail to replace nuc-1 in degrading bacterial DNA in intestine. Despite of their restricted and largely non-overlapping expression patterns, both CRN-6 and NUC-1 can mediate apoptotic DNA degradation in many cells, suggesting that they are likely secreted nucleases that are retaken up by other cells to exert DNA degradation functions. Removal or disruption of NUC-1 secretion signal eliminates NUC-1's ability to mediate DNA degradation across its expression border. Furthermore, blocking cell corpse engulfment does not affect apoptotic DNA degradation mediated by nuc-1, suggesting that NUC-1 acts in apoptotic cells rather than in phagocytes to resolve 3′ OH DNA breaks. Our study illustrates how multiple DNase II nucleases play differential roles in apoptotic DNA degradation and development and reveals an unexpected mode of DNase II action in mediating DNA degradation."

Forty MALT strains (19 cagPAI (−) and 21 cagPAI (+)) and 39 cagPAI frequency-matched gastritis strains (17 cagPAI (−) and 22 cagPAI (+)) were included in this study. The lipopolyssacharide for each strain was extracted using a hot phenol method and the expression of Lex and Ley were investigated using Western Blot. The data were analyzed according to the strains' cagPAI status and vacA genotype. Lex was identified in 21 (52.5%) MALT strains and 29 (74.3%) gastritis strains. Ley was identified in 30 (75%) MALT strains and 31 (79.5%) gastritis strains. There was an association between cagPAI positivity and Lex expression among MALT strains (p<0.0001), but not in gastritis strains (p = 0.64). Among cagPAI (−) strains, isolates expressing solely Ley were associated with MALT with an odds ratio of 64.2 (95% CI 4.9–841.0) when compared to strains expressing both Lex and Ley. vacA genotypes did not modify the association between Lewis antigen expression and disease status. In conclusion, cagPAI (−) MALT strains have a particular Lewis antigen profile which could represent an adaptive mechanism to the host response or participate in MALT lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062234207,"Previously, we reported that the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAc) binds to the active p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) (Chaturvedi, D., Poppleton, H. M., Stringfield, T., Barbier, A., and Patel, T. B. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol. 26, 4586–4600). Herein, by overexpressing hemagglutinin-tagged RSK1 fragments in HeLa cells we have identified the region of RSK1 that is responsible for the interaction with PKAc. PKAc bound to the last 13 amino acids of RSK1, which overlaps the Erk1/2 docking site. This interaction between PKAc and RSK1 required the phosphorylation of Ser-732 in the C terminus of RSK1. Depending upon its phosphorylation status, RSK1 switched interactions between Erk1/2 and PKAc. In addition, a peptide corresponding to the last 13 amino acids of RSK1 with substitution of Ser-732 with Glu (peptide E), but not Ala (peptide A), decreased interactions between endogenous active RSK1 and PKAc. RSK1 attenuated the ability of cAMP to activate PKA in vitro and this modulation was abrogated by peptide E, but not by peptide A. Similarly, in intact cells, cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter on Ser-115, the PKA site, was reduced when RSK1 was activated by epidermal growth factor, and this effect was blocked by peptide E, but not by peptide A.

PKA is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic subunits (PKAc) bound to a dimer of regulatory subunits. To date four catalytic (PKAc-α to PKAc-δ) and four regulatory subunit isoforms (PKARIα, PKARIβ, PKARIIα, and PKARIIβ) have been described (1.Døskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Depending upon the type of regulatory subunit (PKARI or PKARII) that the catalytic subunits are bound to, the PKA holoenzyme is referred to either as type I or type II (1.Døskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The different isoforms are differentially expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner (2.Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d331-d342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Besides binding to the regulatory subunits, PKAc has also been shown to bind a number of proteins. For instance, akin to the binding with regulatory subunits, binding of PKAc to the inhibitory protein of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB), IκB-α, inhibits PKAc catalytic activity (3.Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Upon degradation of IκB-α during NFκB activation, PKAc is released and activated in a cAMP-independent manner (3.Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Likewise, the small GTP-binding protein Rab13 binds with and inhibits PKAc activity during tight junction formation (4.Köhler K. Louvard D. Zahraoui A. J. Cell. Biol. 2004; 165: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

Among the four members in this family, RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 share considerable sequence homology with RSK4 being larger and also functionally distinct (5.Carriere A. Ray H. Blenis J. Roux P.P. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4258-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6.Dümmler B.A. Hauge C. Silber J. Yntema H.G. Kruse L.S. Kofoed B. Hemmings B.A. Alessi D.R. Frödin M. J. Biol.

Thus, despite the normal overlapping expression patterns of RSK1 and RSK3 in brains of patients with Coffin-Lowry syndrome where RSK2 is mutated, the functions of the mutant RSK2 are not taken over by the other isoforms (8.Jacquot S.

Likewise, RSK1, but not RSK2, causes differentiation of PC12 cells (9.Silverman E. Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10573-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the inactive form of RSK1 interacts with the PKARIα subunit of PKA, whereas the activated RSK1 interacts with PKAc (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The indirect association of RSK1 with PKA anchoring proteins (AKAPs), via PKA subunits, determines the cellular localization of activated RSK1 and its ability to increase cell survival (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Notably, RSK1, but not RSK2 or RSK3, interacts with the PKA subunits (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interactions of RSK1 with PKA subunits and PKA anchoring proteins bring the RSK1 in proximity to PP2Ac, which then regulates the activation of RSK1 (11.Chaturvedi D. Cohen M.S. Taunton J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23670-23681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the role of the interactions of RSK1 with the subunits of PKA on regulation of PKA activity has not been extensively studied. Likewise, regions on RSK1 involved in the interactions with PKAc or PKARIα are unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that the extreme C-terminal 13 residues of active RSK1 form the PKAc binding site. PKAc binds this region on RSK1 when the Ser-732 is phosphorylated. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2, which initiate the activation of RSK1, bind to the same region when Ser-732 is not phosphorylated. Thus, the phosphorylation state of Ser-732 on RSK1 serves as a switch for binding either Erk1/2 or PKAc. We also show that the binding of RSK1 to PKAc decreases the ability of cAMP to stimulate PKA activity both in vitro and in intact cells. These findings provide a new mechanism for regulation of PKA activity. Anti-RSK1, anti-PKAc polyclonal, and anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-PKARIα and anti-PKAc monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). The anti-Erk1/2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-phospho-RSK1 (S380) was from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). Anti-phospho-RSK (T573), anti-phospho-BAD (S112), and anti-phospho-BAD (S155) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN), and the anti-HA polyclonal antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Purified PKAc and PKARIα proteins were provided by Dr. Susan Taylor (University of California, San Diego). PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI) was from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Peptides corresponding to RSK1 amino acid residues 723–735 with or without substitution of Ser corresponding to Ser-732 on RSK1 to Ala or Glu were synthesized by New England Peptide (Gardner, MA). These RSK1 peptides were palmitoylated at the N terminus to facilitate cell membrane permeation. Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Both B82L cells (mouse lung fibroblasts) and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Methotrexate was added to the above medium at the concentration of 5 μg/ml for maintenance of B82L cells. HeLa cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at 4 × 105/dish. On the next day, cells were transfected with plasmids using a TransIT-HeLaMONSTER® Transfection kit (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) and by following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA sequences corresponding to the different regions of RSK1 were PCR-synthesized using the plasmid containing full-length rat RSK1 as template (provided by Dr. Warner Greene, University of California, San Francisco) and primers with EcoRI or NotI restriction enzyme sequences. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and NotI and then inserted in vector pHM6 to express the HA-tagged RSK1 polypeptides. B82L cells (1.5 × 105/dish) were plated on 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with control siRNA or two siRNAs against mouse RSK1. The first siRNA sequence was: sense, GGA CCA AGA UGG AGA GAG ACA UCC T; antisense, AGG AUG UCU CUC UCC AUC UUG GUC CGA. The second siRNA sequence was: sense, CCU CUA UGU GGA UGA GUC UGG GAA C; antisense, GUU CCC AGA CUC AUC CAC AUA GAG GAU. Transit TKO reagent (Mirus) was used for siRNA transfection as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 8 μl of transit TKO reagent was incubated with 200 μl of Opti-MEM for 12 min followed by addition of 25 or 50 pmol of siRNA and another 12-min incubation. The mixture was added to the cells cultured in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with serum. After 56 h, cells were deprived of serum overnight and then used for experiments. HeLa cells were serum-starved overnight and then were treated with or without 100 nm EGF for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-PKAc or 0.4 μg of anti-RSK1 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) together with 15 μl of protein G-conjugated agarose beads to immunoprecipitate PKAc, PKARIα, RSK1, HA-RSK1, or fragments of RSK1. After three thorough washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for Western analyses. Purified PKAc (0.5 pmol) and PKARIα (10 pmol) were incubated in an assay solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 8 mm MnCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.125 mm ATP at room temperature for 3 h. The mixture was then incubated with or without 20 μm RSK1 peptides for 5 min at room temperature followed by addition of 1 pmol of purified active RSK1 or buffer, and incubated for another 5 min. Kinase activity reactions (50-μl final volume) were started by addition of 0.2 mm Kemptide, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and different concentrations of cAMP to the mixture described above. Wherever indicated, PKI (20 μm) was also added to the assay mixture. Reactions were terminated after 15-min incubation at room temperature by the addition of equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation (20,000 × g for 5 min), aliquots of the supernatant were applied to P81 Whatman filters that were air-dried, washed extensively in 0.5% phosphoric acid, and counted in scintillation counter. With the overall objective to determine how interactions between active RSK1 and PKAc regulate the activity of PKA, the initial goal of our investigations was to identify the site on RSK1 that interacts with PKAc. Toward this end, we utilized HA-tagged constructs of full-length RSK1 as well as its different domains shown in Fig. 1A to transfect HeLa cells. Lysates from cells treated with or without EGF were then supplemented with cAMP to dissociate the PKA subunits and, following immunoprecipitation of PKAc, the presence of full-length and deleted versions of HA-tagged RSK1 in the immunoprecipitates were monitored. As shown before for endogenous RSK1 (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the full-length HA-RSK1 co-immunoprecipitated with PKAc in an EGF-dependent manner (Fig. 1B); note that because cAMP was added to the cell lysates to dissociate the PKA subunits, the PKARIα subunit was not present in the immunocomplex (Fig. 1B). Having ascertained the EGF-dependent interaction between PKAc and HA-tagged full-length RSK1, similar experiments with lysates from EGF-treated cells were performed using HA-tagged N-terminal regions of RSK1. As shown in Fig. 1C, none of the N-terminal constructs of RSK1 containing the N-terminal kinase with (aa 1–418) or without (aa 1–317) the linker region were present in the immunocomplexes of PKAc. On the other hand, RSK1 constructs comprising the linker plus the C-terminal kinase domain (CTK) plus the C-terminal tail (aa 317–735) or the CTK plus C terminus (aa 418–735) were present in the PKAc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1D). These findings suggested that the PKAc binding site was located in the C-terminal half of RSK1. That the interaction of the C-terminal region of RSK1 (aa 418–735) with PKAc was dependent upon activation of cells by EGF is shown in Fig. 2A.FIGURE 2The extreme C-terminal 14 amino acids of RSK1 are necessary for its interaction with PKAc, and this interaction is independent of phosphorylation of Thr-573. HeLa cells were transfected to express either wild-type or mutant forms of RSK1 polypeptides. After serum starvation (16 h), cells were treated with or without 100 nm EGF for 10 min and lysed in the buffer containing 5 mm cAMP. PKAc was immunoprecipitated and the presence of HA (A and C)- or GFP (B)-tagged RSK1 polypeptides was monitored using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibodies. A, substitution of Thr-573 in the CTK domain of RSK1 with non-phosphorylatable (Ala) or phosho-mimic (Asp) residues does not affect the interaction with PKAc. B, the CTK domain of RSK1 is not required for interaction with PKAc. A fusion protein of GFP and the last 64 amino acids of RSK1 was transfected into HeLa cells, and its presence in the PKAc immunoprecipitates was monitored. The GFP-RSK1 aa 672–735 fusion protein interacted with PKAc in an EGF-dependent manner. C, HeLa cells were transfected with the C-terminal region of RSK1 (aa 418–735) harboring either a deletion of the last 14 residues (418–721) or in which the last 14 residues of RSK1 were replaced with the last 14 amino acids from RSK2 (418–735: RSK1/RSK2). Cells were treated with EGF prior to immunoprecipitation of PKAc. For all panels, the experiments shown are representatives of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following stimulation of cells with growth factors such as EGF, the initial step in the activation of RSK1 is phosphorylation of Thr-573 in the activation loop of the CTK by Erk1/2 (12.Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Because the association of PKAc with RSK1 is EGF-dependent, we investigated whether the phosphorylation of Thr-573 modulated interactions of the C-terminal of RSK1 (aa 418–735) with PKAc. As shown in Fig. 2A substitution of Thr-573 with either Ala that cannot be phosphorylated or Asp to mimic phospho-Thr (13.Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frödin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) did not alter the EGF-dependent interactions between PKAc and the C terminus of RSK1. Thus, the phosphorylation status of Thr-573 on RSK1 does not appear to determine binding to PKAc. To further narrow down the region on the C-terminal of RSK1 that interacts with PKAc, a GFP fusion of the C-terminal tail (aa 672–735) of RSK1 was used. GFP-RSK1 (672–735) co-immunoprecipitated with PKAc in an EGF-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Additionally, a construct in which the last 14 amino acids of RSK1 were deleted (aa 418–721) did not co-immunoprecipitate with PKAc (Fig. 2C, compare aa 418–735 and 418–721). Furthermore, when the last 14 residues of RSK1 were substituted with the last 14 amino acids of RSK2, the C-terminal construct (418–735 RSK1/RSK2) did not co-immunoprecipitate with PKAc (Fig. 2C). Together, these data demonstrate that PKAc binds to the extreme C terminus of RSK1 and that the last 14 aa of RSK1 contribute to its binding with PKAc. The latter finding is consistent with our previous demonstration that RSK1 but not RSK2 or RSK3 interacts with PKAc (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The last 14 residues of RSK1 contain Ser-732. This Ser residue is autophosphorylated by the NTK of RSK1 when the kinase is fully active (14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because active RSK1 binds to PKAc, we reasoned that the phosphorylation of Ser-732 may determine whether RSK1 binds PKAc or not. Therefore, next, we investigated the ability of PKAc to interact with the C terminus of RSK1 in which Ser-732 had been substituted with Ala, Asp, or Glu. The Asp and Glu substitutions were included to mimic the phospho-Ser at this position. As shown in Fig. 3A, although the wild-type sequence of the C-terminal region (418–735) of RSK1 bound to PKAc in an EGF-dependent manner, the S732A and S732D substitutions in this region markedly decreased association with PKAc, and whatever little interaction that was observed was not EGF-dependent. On the other hand, substitution of Ser-732 with Glu increased the association of the C-terminal region of RSK1 even in the absence of growth factor and EGF could not further enhance this association (Fig. 3A). Note that the expression of the different C-terminal regions of RSK1 was the same. These findings suggest that the binding of RSK1 to PKAc is dependent upon phosphorylation of Ser-732 and that the substitution of this residue with Glu, but not Asp, mimics phosphorylation at this position. This explains the constitutive (EGF-independent) association of PKAc with RSK1 C-terminal harboring the Glu substitution of Ser-732. Having mapped the PKAc binding site to the C-terminal 14 residues (aa 721–735) on RSK1 and having identified Glu, but not Asp, as a phospho-mimic residue that can substitute phospho-Ser-732, we next investigated whether peptides corresponding to the last 13 amino acids of RSK1 would compete for association between endogenous RSK1 and PKAc. HeLa cells were incubated for 15 min with cell-permeable, palmitoylated peptides corresponding to the last 13 residues of RSK1 that contained either the wild-type (peptide wt) sequence or in which the equivalent of Ser-732 had been substituted by either Ala (peptide A) or Glu (peptide E). Cells were then treated with EGF for 10 min, and PKAc was immunoprecipitated. The association between PKAc and endogenous RSK1 was slightly decreased by the peptide wt, but the interactions between RSK1 and PKAc were not affected by peptide A (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, peptide E, in which the Ser-732 equivalent residue had been substituted with Glu, competed for the interaction of endogenous RSK1 with PKAc. These findings lend further credence to the notion that PKAc binds to the extreme C-terminal 13 amino acid region of RSK1 and that this binding is dependent upon phosphorylation of Ser-732, the NTK phosphorylation site (14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 14 residues of RSK1 also form the Erk1/2 binding site (14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Erk1/2 bind to this region of the inactive RSK1, and the initial step in the activation of RSK1 is Erk1/2-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-573, Ser-359, and Ser-363 (12.Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 15.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Following complete activation of RSK1 that also involves CTK- mediated autophosphorylation of Ser-380, docking of PDK1 to this phospho-Ser-380 region and phosphorylation by PDK1 of Ser-221, the NTK phosphorylates RSK1 on Ser-732 (14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This autophosphorylation on Ser-732 results in the dissociation of Erk1/2 from the active RSK1 (14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In light of these previous findings, our data would suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser-732 acts as a switch whereby RSK1 dissociates from Erk1/2 but now associates with PKAc. To verify this, HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged RSK1 were treated with or without EGF, and either the PKAc or RSK1 were immunoprecipitated and the presence of Erk1/2, PKAc, and RSK1 in the immunocomplex was monitored. As shown in Fig. 3C, immunoprecipitates of PKAc contained RSK1 when EGF was present but did not contain Erk1/2. On the other hand, in the absence of EGF, immunoprecipitates of RSK1 contained Erk1/2 but no PKAc. When activated by EGF, RSK1 immunoprecipitates contained PKAc, but not Erk1/2; the activation of RSK1 by EGF is evident by the slower migration of RSK1 on gels. Given that the binding sites for Erk1/2 and PKAc on RSK1 are essentially the same and phosphorylation-dependent (Ref. 14.Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar and this report), the data in Fig. 3C show that, upon phosphorylation of Ser-732, RSK1 dissociates from Erk1/2 and binds PKAc. Next, we investigated the functional significance of the interactions between RSK1 and PKAc. Our strategy in these experiments was to utilize the 13-amino acid-long peptides corresponding to the C-terminal of RSK1 that either do (peptide E) or do not (peptide A) compete for the interactions between RSK1 and PKAc. As a prelude to using these peptides, first, we investigated whether peptides A or E altered the activities of purified PKAc or RSK1. As shown in Fig. 4A none of the peptides altered the activities of either PKAc or RSK1. Moreover, none of the peptides altered the ability of cAMP to activate the PKA holoenzyme reconstituted in vitro from purified PKAc and PKARIα (supplemental Fig. S1). Previously, we reported that the binding of active RSK1 to PKAc increases the binding of PKAc with PKARIα (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed as shown in Fig. 4B, the dose-response curve for cAMP-mediated stimulation of PKA holoenzyme, reconstituted with purified PKAc and PKARIα, was shifted to the right in the presence of active RSK1. These findings are consistent with our previously reported data (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and support the notion that PKAc/PKARIα interactions are elevated by RSK1 and, therefore, the need for higher cAMP concentrations to elevate PKA activity. Notably, using purified proteins we have not observed phosphorylation of RSK1 by PKAc or phosphorylation of PKAc by RSK1. 3H. M. Poppleton and T. B. Patel, unpublished data. Therefore, next we determined if the association of PKAc with RSK1 is necessary for the decreased sensitivity of PKA to cAMP. In these experiments, PKA was stimulated with a submaximal concentration (30 μm) of cAMP that showed the biggest difference in PKA activation with and without RSK1 (Fig. 4B), and the ability of peptides A and E to reverse the actions of RSK1 was determined. As expected, RSK1 decreased the activation of PKA holoenzyme by 30 μm cAMP, and peptide A did not affect the ability of RSK1 to attenuate the ability of cAMP to activate PKA (Fig. 4C). In contrast, peptide E, which effectively competes for the association of RSK1 with PKAc (Fig. 3B), obliterated the ability of RSK1 to inhibit the ability of cAMP to activate PKA (Fig. 4C). Thus, binding of RSK1 via its C-terminal 13 residues to PKAc is necessary for the observed decreased ability of cAMP to activate PKA. To determine the functional significance of the interactions between active RSK1 and PKAc in intact cells, the experiments depicted in Fig. 5 were performed in B82L cells. These cells express PKARIα and RSK1, and the interactions among these proteins are similar to those in HeLa cells (10.Chaturvedi D. Poppleton H.M. Stringfield T. Barbier A. Patel T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4586-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PKA activity in these experiments was monitored by 8CPT-cAMP (the non-hydrolyzable analog of cAMP)-mediated phosphorylation of BAD on Ser-155, the PKAc site (16.Virdee K. Parone P.A. Tolkovsky A.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17.Lizcano J.M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The activation of RSK1 in the same experiments was monitored by EGF-elicited phosphorylation of BAD on Ser-112, the RSK1 site (18.Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The initial experiments determined whether activation of PKA in B82L cells was modulate"
https://openalex.org/W2093728183,"Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) measurements yielded the binding constants during complex formation of light-inducible histidine kinases (HK) and their cognate CheY-type response regulators (RR). HK-RR interactions represent the core function of the bacterial two-component system, which is also present in many bacterial phytochromes. Here, we have studied the recombinant forms of phytochromes CphA and CphB from the cyanobacterium Tolypothrix PCC7601 and their cognate RRs RcpA and RcpB. The interaction between the two reaction partners (HK and RR) was studied in the presence and absence of ATP. A complex formation was observable in the presence of ATP, but specific interactions were only found when a non-hydrolyzable ATP derivative was added to the mixture. Also, the incubation of the HK domain alone (expressed as a recombinant protein) with the RR did not yield specific interactions, indicating that the HK domain is only active as a component of the full-length phytochrome. Considering also previous studies on the same proteins (Hübschmann, T., Jorissen, H. J. M. M., Börner, T., Gärtner, W., and de Marsac, N. (2001) Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 3383-3389) we now conclude that the HK domains of these phytochromes are active only when the chromophore domain is in its Pr form. The formerly documented phosphate transfer between the HK domain and the RR takes place via a transiently formed protein-protein complex, which becomes detectable by ITC in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP derivative. This finding is of interest also in relation to the function of some (blue light-sensitive) photoreceptors that carry the HK domain and the RR fused together in one single protein."
