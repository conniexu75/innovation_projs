https://openalex.org/W2028918948,"The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed."

Researchers can now assemble helical nanowires out of cubic magnetite nanocrystals by tuning interactions that bind or separate them. Singh et al. floated the nanocrystals on a liquid and aligned them with a magnetic field. After the liquid evaporated, different twisted nanowires remained. The helices varied according to the concentration of nanocrystals, their shape, and the strength of the magnetic field. Competition between weak forces drives this self-assembly and can lead to arrays with the same twist direction. Science , this issue p. 1149"

Rohr et al. devised a conceptual approach to study interactions between species that emphasizes the role of network structure (see the Perspective by Pawar). Using the example of mutualistic networks of communities of plants and their pollinator species, they show how the structure of networks can determine the persistence of the interactions. Network structures and architectures observed in nature intrinsically match the most stable solution. This approach has promise for application to questions of ecological community stability under global change. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.1253497 ; see also p. 383"

Ishimura et al. find that mutant mice whose brain cells start to die rapidly soon after birth have lost the function of two vital cellular components (see the Perspective by Darnell). The first is a protein that releases stalled ribosomes stuck on messenger RNA (mRNA); the second is a transfer RNA (tRNA), which reads the code for arginine in the mRNA. This tRNA is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system. The lack of the tRNA leads to increased ribosomal stalling at arginine codons, which, when left uncorrected, blocks protein synthesis and proves fatal. Science , this issue p. 455 ; see also p. 378"

A magnitude 8.2 earthquake (Iquique) occurred in one such zone off the coast of northern Chile on 1 April 2014, in a seismic gap that had not experienced a large earthquake since the 9.0 one in 1877. Ruiz et al. analyzed continuous GPS data to monitor the movement of plates over time in this region, including before and after major earthquakes. The most recent large quake was preceded by an extended series of smaller earthquakes and creeping westward movement of the coastline. Science , this issue p. 1165"

https://openalex.org/W2015749520,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is vital for the internalization of most cell-surface proteins. In CME, plasma membrane-binding clathrin adaptors recruit and polymerize clathrin to form clathrin-coated pits into which cargo is sorted. Assembly polypeptide 2 (AP2) is the most abundant adaptor and is pivotal to CME. Here, we determined a structure of AP2 that includes the clathrin-binding β2 hinge and developed an AP2-dependent budding assay. Our findings suggest that an autoinhibitory mechanism prevents clathrin recruitment by cytosolic AP2. A large-scale conformational change driven by the plasma membrane phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and cargo relieves this autoinhibition, triggering clathrin recruitment and hence clathrin-coated bud formation. This molecular switching mechanism can couple AP2's membrane recruitment to its key functions of cargo and clathrin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2033541023,"Despite advances in surgery, imaging, chemotherapy, and radiation, patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common histological subtype of glioma, have an especially dismal prognosis; >70% of GBM patients die within 2 years of diagnosis. In many human cancers, the microRNA miR-21 is overexpressed, and accumulating evidence indicates that it functions as an oncogene. Here, we report that miR-21 is overexpressed in human GBM cell lines and tumor tissue. Moreover, miR-21 expression in GBM patient samples is inversely correlated with patient survival. Knockdown of miR-21 in GBM cells inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and markedly inhibited tumor formation in vivo. A number of known miR-21 targets have been identified previously. By microarray analysis, we identified and validated insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) as a novel miR-21 target gene. Overexpression of IGFBP3 in glioma cells inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited tumor formation of glioma xenografts in vivo. The critical role that IGFBP3 plays in miR-21-mediated actions was demonstrated by a rescue experiment, in which IGFBP3 knockdown in miR-21KD glioblastoma cells restored tumorigenesis. Examination of tumors from GBM patients showed that there was an inverse relationship between IGFBP3 and miR-21 expression and that increased IGFBP3 expression correlated with better patient survival. Our results identify IGFBP3 as a novel miR-21 target gene in glioblastoma and suggest that the oncogenic miRNA miR-21 down-regulates the expression of IGFBP3, which acts as a tumor suppressor in human glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2086456394,"NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii (CbFDH) has been widely used in various CO2-reduction systems but its practical applications are often impeded due to low CO2-reducing activity. In this study, we demonstrated superior CO2-reducing properties of FDH from Thiobacillus sp. KNK65MA (TsFDH) for production of formate from CO2 gas. To discover more efficient CO2-reducing FDHs than a reference enzyme, i.e. CbFDH, five FDHs were selected with biochemical properties and then, their CO2-reducing activities were evaluated. All FDHs including CbFDH showed better CO2-reducing activities at acidic pHs than at neutral pHs and four FDHs were more active than CbFDH in the CO2 reduction reaction. In particular, the FDH from Thiobacillus sp. KNK65MA (TsFDH) exhibited the highest CO2-reducing activity and had a dramatic preference for the reduction reaction, i.e., a 84.2-fold higher ratio of CO2 reduction to formate oxidation in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KB) compared to CbFDH. Formate was produced from CO2 gas using TsFDH and CbFDH, and TsFDH showed a 5.8-fold higher formate production rate than CbFDH. A sequence and structural comparison showed that FDHs with relatively high CO2-reducing activities had elongated N- and C-terminal loops. The experimental results demonstrate that TsFDH can be an alternative to CbFDH as a biocatalyst in CO2 reduction systems."

https://openalex.org/W2022917194,"Cyanobacteria have unique photoreceptors, cyanobacteriochromes, that show diverse spectral properties to sense near-UV/visible lights. Certain cyanobacteriochromes have been shown to regulate cellular phototaxis or chromatic acclimation of photosynthetic pigments. Some cyanobacteriochromes have output domains involved in bacterial signaling using a second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP), but its role in cyanobacteria remains elusive. Here, we characterize the recombinant Tlr0924 from a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, which was expressed in a cyanobacterial system. The protein reversibly photoconverts between blue- and green-absorbing forms, which is consistent with the protein prepared from Escherichia coli, and has diguanylate cyclase activity, which is enhanced 38-fold by blue light compared with green light. Therefore, Tlr0924 is a blue light-activated diguanylate cyclase. The protein's relatively low affinity (10.5 mM) for Mg(2+), which is essential for diguanylate cyclase activity, suggests that Mg(2+) might also regulate c-di-GMP signaling. Finally, we show that blue light irradiation under low temperature is responsible for Thermosynechococcus vulcanus cell aggregation, which is abolished when tlr0924 is disrupted, suggesting that Tlr0924 mediates blue light-induced cell aggregation by producing c-di-GMP. Given our results, we propose the name ""sesA (sessility-A)"" for tlr0924. This is the first report for cyanobacteriochrome-dependent regulation of a sessile/planktonic lifestyle in cyanobacteria via c-di-GMP."

Actin filaments have a characteristic polarized architecture with a so-called barbed end and a pointed end—so described because of how the filaments look under the electron microscope when they are coated with tropomyosin. Rao et al. describe crystal structures of a protein that uniquely binds and caps the pointed end of actin filaments. This protein, tropomodulin, binds to several actin subunits and to a couple of tropomyosin molecules, which generates a high-affinity specific cap to the filaments by combining low-affinity interactions.

The climate system can be highly nonlinear, meaning that small changes in one part can lead to much larger changes elsewhere. This type of behavior is especially evident during transitions from glacial to interglacial conditions, when climate is affected by a wide variety of time-varying influences and is relatively unstable. Praetorius and Mix present a record of North Pacific climate over the past 18,000 years. When the climates of the more local high-latitude Pacific and Atlantic sectors varied in parallel, large, abrupt climate fluctuations occurred on a more global scale. Science , this issue p. 444"

However, only five antagonists or bitter blockers are known. In this study, using molecular modeling guided site-directed mutagenesis, we elucidated the ligand-binding pocket of T2R4. We found seven amino acids located in the extracellular side of transmembrane 3 (TM3), TM4, extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), and ECL3 to be involved in T2R4 binding to its agonist quinine. ECL2 residues Asn-173 and Thr-174 are essential for quinine binding. Guided by a molecular model of T2R4, a number of amino acid derivatives were screened for their ability to bind to T2R4. These predictions were tested by calcium imaging assays that led to identification of γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA) and Nα,Nα-bis(carboxymethyl)-l-lysine (BCML) as competitive inhibitors of quinine-activated T2R4 with an IC50 of 3.2 ± 0.3 μm and 59 ± 18 nm, respectively. Interestingly, pharmacological characterization using a constitutively active mutant of T2R4 reveals that GABA acts as an antagonist, whereas BCML acts as an inverse agonist on T2R4. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms that the two novel bitter blockers share the same orthosteric site as the agonist quinine. The signature residues Ala-90 and Lys-270 play important roles in interacting with BCML and GABA, respectively. This is the first report to characterize a T2R endogenous antagonist and an inverse agonist.

Recently, evidence demonstrated that both NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondria are involved in the chronic kidney disease progression. The present study was undertaken to examine the role of NLRP3 inflammasome/mitochondria axis in albumin-induced renal tubular injury. In patients with proteinuria, NLRP3 was significantly up-regulated in tubular epithelial cells and was positively correlated with the severity of proteinuria. In agreement with these results, albumin remarkably activated NLRP3 inflammasome in both in vitro renal tubular cells and in vivo kidneys in parallel with significant epithelial cell phenotypic alteration and cell apoptosis. Genetic disruption of NLRP3 inflammasome remarkably attenuated albumin-induced cell apoptosis and phenotypic changes under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. In addition, albumin treatment resulted in a significant mitochondrial abnormality as evidenced by the impaired function and morphology, which was markedly reversed by invalidation of NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, protection of mitochondria function by Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) or cyclosporin A (CsA) robustly attenuated albumin-induced injury in mouse proximal tubular cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrated a pathogenic role of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1/mitochondria axis in mediating albumin-induced renal tubular injury.

https://openalex.org/W2142952385,"Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4′-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4′-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway."

Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Among the multiple folds in globular proteins that stabilize α-helices, the coiled-coil motif has been extensively characterized and in general is the most predictable form of tertiary protein structure (2.Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In the coiled-coil motif, two or more α-helices are individually stabilized by sequence-specific packing at consensus hydrophobic patches. Extensive studies have elicited general sequence and structure rules that govern coiled-coil interactions. Briefly, the amino acid sequence of each α-helix in a coiled-coil is divided into heptads (7 residues) that form nearly two complete α-helical turns and span 1.05 nm along the helical axis. Each amino acid in the heptad is described by its relative position, moving from the N to C terminus, using the nomenclature abcdefg. In canonical dimeric coiled-coils, the a and d positions radiate away from the core of the α-helix, 60° apart and offset by 0.45 nm along the helix length, and are typically occupied by aliphatic hydrophobic residues, whereas polar residues comprise the rest of the positions. As the heptad is repeated, it forms a continuous hydrophobic patch located along a single face of the α-helix compatible with a tight intermolecular interaction between polypeptides with the same or similar heptad pattern (2.Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, often polar or charged residues occupy the a and d positions, leading to local destabilization of the coiled-coil motif (2.Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 3.Sunitha M.S. Nair A.G. Charya A. Jadhav K. Mukhopadhyay S.

By extension, when most or all of the a and d sites in consecutive heptads are occupied by polar residues, individual α-helices cannot be mutually stabilized through hydrophobic packing. In this event, the polypeptide either will exist as a monomeric random coil or in some cases will form an SAH domain.

This study highlighted the inherent helix-forming potential of alanine in the absence of electrostatic interactions between side chains. In a separate study, Marqusee and Baldwin (7.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Helix stabilization by Glu−…Lys+ salt bridges in short peptides of de novo design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) synthesized peptides containing 16 residues with three pairs of a Glu and a Lys separated by either 3 (i, i + 3) or 4 (i, i + 4) alanines. These peptides were synthesized, in part, to characterize the influence of electrostatic interactions between Glu and Lys on α-helix formation. Both peptides were soluble and monomeric in aqueous solution and had detectable helical content as determined by CD. However, the (i, i + 4) (i.e. (EAAAK)3) spacing yielded significantly higher helicity when compared with (i, i + 3), presumably due to the preferred rotamer configurations of the Glu and Lys side chains. Interestingly, the measured helicity was preserved at extremes of pH (from 2 to 12) and at high concentrations of NaCl, suggesting that the electrostatic interactions were primarily derived from salt bridges (H-bonded ionic interactions) rather than direct ionic interactions. The helix-stabilizing effects of E-K interactions on an alanine backbone were subsequently extended to D-K, E-R, and D-R pairs (10.Huyghues-Despointes B.M. Scholtz J.M. Baldwin R.L. Helical peptides with three pairs of Asp-Arg and Glu-Arg residues in different orientations and spacings.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A subsequent study with alanine-based peptides also defined the role of capping residues at the N and C termini in stabilizing isolated α-helices. In general, α-helix formation is aided by negatively charged residues at the N terminus and positively charged residues at the C terminus (11.Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. N- and C-capping preferences for all 20 amino acids in α-helical peptides.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with an interaction of appropriately charged capping residues with the dipole moment of the protein α-helix, which is directed from its C to N terminus. Further, in the context of peptides, the charged residues at the ends can also undergo stabilizing electrostatic interactions with the free NH2 and COOH groups (11.Doig A.J. Baldwin R.L. N- and C-capping preferences for all 20 amino acids in α-helical peptides.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These studies of synthetic alanine-based peptides provided precedence and laid the groundwork for identifying and predicting the stability of isolated α-helices. The (EAAAK)n motif was subsequently incorporated into various synthetically engineered polypeptides. Arai et al. (12.Arai R. Ueda H. Kitayama A. Kamiya N. Nagamune T. Design of the linkers which effectively separate domains of a bifunctional fusion protein.Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) evaluated the utility of (EAAAK)n (n = 2–5) motifs as rigid spacing linkers between a pair of green fluorescent protein variants (EBFP and EGFP). The linkers did not interfere with EBFP and EGFP folding as evaluated from their fluorescence spectra. FRET between EBFP and EGFP decreased, whereas helicity increased with linker length, suggesting that stabilization of the α-helix increased the spacing between the fluorescent proteins fused to the ends of the linker. In a subsequent study, the conformations of the (EAAAK)n linkers were evaluated by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Short linkers (n ≤ 3) showed multimerization, whereas longer linkers (n ≥ 4) remain monomeric even at high concentrations (>25 μm). The radius of gyration increased with linker length and is higher than flexible unstructured linkers (GGGGS)n of the same length (13.Arai R. Wriggers W. Nishikawa Y. Nagamune T. Fujisawa T. Conformations of variably linked chimeric proteins evaluated by synchrotron X-ray small-angle scattering.Proteins. 2004; 57: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Together, these studies support the use of the EAAAK linkers as extended spacers between polypeptides. Utilizing this structural property, the EAAAK linker has been employed to increase expression (14.Amet N. Lee H.F. Shen W.C. Insertion of the designed helical linker led to increased expression of Tf-based fusion proteins.Pharm. Res. 2009; 26: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and bioactivity (15.Bai Y. Shen W.C. Improving the oral efficacy of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and transferrin fusion protein by spacer optimization.Pharm. Res. 2006; 23: 2116-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) of fusion proteins. However, of concern for the use of tethering generic peptides with this particular linker, the EAAAK motif has been reported to have autocleavage properties at pH 6–7 (16.Wu Y.J. Fan C.Y. Li Y.K. Protein purification involving a unique auto-cleavage feature of a repeated EAAAK peptide.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2009; 877: 4015-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Regardless, this SAH domain both demonstrates the feasibility and the highlights potential utility of a modular genetic element to control intramolecular spacing between protein domains. In a parallel vein, helix formation through E-K interactions, independent of alanine, was examined by Lyu et al. (17.Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. Energetic contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs to α-helix structure.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) with 18-amino acid peptides with either (E2K2)4 or (E4K4)4 repeats. Although the composition was exactly the same for both peptides, CD and 1H NMR data showed that the E4K4 peptide has 65% helical content, whereas the E2K2 peptide is essentially a random coil. This is consistent with studies in alanine peptides discussed earlier, wherein (i, i + 4) interactions, as in E4K4, stabilize the helical conformation, whereas the (i, i + 2) spacing in E2K2 cannot facilitate these ionic interactions (Fig. 1, b and c). These results were independent of peptide concentration in a range of 20–250 μm, indicating that oligomerization was not a factor in augmenting helicity. Additionally, pH and salt titrations showed that both direct ionic (E-K) and salt bridge interactions (H-bonded) likely contribute to the stability of E4K4 helices. This is in contrast to (EAAAK)n, which appears to be primarily stabilized by salt bridge interactions (7.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Helix stabilization by Glu−…Lys+ salt bridges in short peptides of de novo design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Free energy calculations yielded 0.5 kcal/mol stabilization for each (i, i + 4) interaction in E4K4, and the contribution from each interaction is proposed to stabilize the isolated α-helical conformation. The mechanisms that underlie the stability of E4K4 helices are also evident in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Sivaramakrishnan et al. (18.Sivaramakrishnan S. Spink B.J. Sim A.Y. Doniach S. Spudich J.A. Dynamic charge interactions create surprising rigidity in the ER/K α-helical protein motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13356-13361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) performed a replica exchange MD simulation on a (E4K4)2 peptide (Fig. 1c). Starting from either a random coil or a fully formed α-helix, both simulations converged on an α-helix. Thermal melting curves derived from the MD simulations matched previous experimentally measured helicities of this peptide (17.Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. Energetic contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs to α-helix structure.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The simulations revealed dynamic and continuous interactions between side chains, with preferential i − 4 and i + 3 interactions centered on E(i) residues and i − 3 and i + 4 interactions centered on K(i) residues (Fig. 1c). These computations parallel experimental measurements by Olson et al. (19.Olson C.A. Spek E.J. Shi Z. Vologodskii A. Kallenbach N.R. Cooperative helix stabilization by complex Arg-Glu salt bridges.Proteins. 2001; 44: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), who measured the influence of E-R side chain spacing on helicity. Monitoring the distances between the side chains in MD simulations, it was estimated that 45% of the time, direct ionic interactions occur between Glu and Lys, whereas solvent-separated salt bridges occur 37% of the time. This observation is consistent with the presence of both ionic and salt bridge interactions in E4K4 inferred from the pH dependence of helicity (17.Lyu P.C. Gans P.J. Kallenbach N.R. Energetic contribution of solvent-exposed ion pairs to α-helix structure.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was observed that the bulky side chains were able to partially shield backbone hydrogen bonds from the polar solvent. Thus, the stability of the α-helical core appears to arise from both shielded backbone hydrogen bonds and ER/K side chain interactions. In this regard, the ER/K motif has been likened to a tensegrity structure that is stabilized by the juxtaposition of “contractile” (backbone hydrogen bonds) and “tensile” (side chain) interactions (20.Spudich J.A. Sivaramakrishnan S. Myosin VI: an innovative motor that challenged the swinging lever arm hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Overall, the observations in synthetic ER/K peptides have important structural implications in natural proteins as discussed in the next section. Although the (EAAAK)n motif was the first identified to form SAH domains, SAH domains identified in natural proteins to date more closely resemble the ER/K motif (i.e. (E4(R/K)4)n). Smooth muscle caldesmon contains an ∼150-residue stretch in its central region that is essentially repeating segments of KAEEEKKAAEEK (21.Bryan J. Imai M. Lee R. Moore P. Cook R.G. Lin W.G. Cloning and expression of a smooth muscle caldesmon.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13873-13879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wang et al. (22.Wang C.L. Chalovich J.M. Graceffa P. Lu R.C. Mabuchi K. Stafford W.F. A long helix from the central region of smooth muscle caldesmon.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) extensively characterized a 285-residue fragment of caldesmon that encompasses this ER/K stretch. CD revealed ∼55% helicity, which is consistent with a near continuous 150-amino acid α-helical region. The sedimentation profile of this polypeptide in ultracentrifugation experiments suggests a monomeric species over a wide range of protein concentrations (0.1–3.5 mg/ml). Rotary shadowed EMs revealed rods with an average length of 35 nm that is near the predicted length of an extended 150-residue α-helix. The rod thickness in EMs was significantly less than coiled-coils from tropomyosin or the myosin rod segment, again suggesting a single extended α-helix. In addition to stabilizing the α-helix, Wang et al. (22.Wang C.L. Chalovich J.M. Graceffa P. Lu R.C. Mabuchi K. Stafford W.F. A long helix from the central region of smooth muscle caldesmon.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the regularly spaced salt bridges may protect this α-helix from proteolytic cleavage. Caldesmon interacts with both actin and myosin through distinct domains located at the ends of its SAH domain. Although muscle caldesmon serves to inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosins, it does not inhibit the actin-myosin interaction (23.Lash J.A. Sellers J.R. Hathaway D.R. The effects of caldesmon on smooth muscle heavy actomeromyosin ATPase activity and binding of heavy meromyosin to actin.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16155-16160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the extended single α-helix in caldesmon likely serves as a spacer to allosterically modify this interaction. However, not all SAH domains identified are expected to function solely as spacers, for example the human programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) protein. The N-terminal 26-amino acid fragment (GSADEELEALRRQRLAELQAKHGDPG) of PDCD5 was demonstrated by Liu et al. (24.Liu D. Yao H. Chen Y. Feng Y. Chen Y. Wang J. The N-terminal 26-residue fragment of human programmed cell death 5 protein can form a stable α-helix having unique electrostatic potential character.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to form a single α-helix by both CD and NMR spectroscopic measurements (Fig. 2c). Deletion of the N-terminal α-helix of PDCD5 significantly attenuated the apoptosis-promoting effects triggered by serum withdrawal. Based on the differential nuclear translocation of full-length and truncated PDCD5, Liu et al. (24.Liu D. Yao H. Chen Y. Feng Y. Chen Y. Wang J. The N-terminal 26-residue fragment of human programmed cell death 5 protein can form a stable α-helix having unique electrostatic potential character.Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) propose a role for this SAH domain in the nuclear targeting of PDCD5. The first high resolution structure of an SAH domain was revealed in a crystal structure of the Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal protein L9 (25.Hoffman D.W. Davies C. Gerchman S.E. Kycia J.H. Porter S.J. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Crystal structure of prokaryotic ribosomal protein L9: a bi-lobed RNA-binding protein.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 205-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein contained a rigid and fully extended 34-amino acid linker region between two compact globular domains (Fig. 2d). A subsequent study synthesized the corresponding peptide and found that the peptide was primarily monomeric at concentrations up to 1 mm in analytical ultracentrifugation studies and primarily (∼70%) α-helical as determined by CD spectroscopy, a much higher degree of helicity than was expected based on its primary sequence (PANLKALEAQKQKEQRQAAEELANAKKLKEQLEK) (26.Kuhlman B. Yang H.Y. Boice J.A. Fairman R. Raleigh D.P. An exceptionally stable helix from the ribosomal protein L9: implications for protein folding and stability.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Further, they found that the helicity of the peptide could be disrupted by moderate salt concentrations (<500 mm NaCl), indicative of ionic side chain interactions contributing to the net stability of the α-helix. Although this peptide is far from the ideal E4K4 motif, it does have several predicted (i, i + 4) electrostatic interactions. The single α-helix was postulated to act as a rigid spacer between two globular domains of the L9 ribosomal protein such that they are properly positioned to bind RNA. In addition to its structural role in the intact proteins, the authors also suggest that the folding of the α-helix may initiate and stabilize the folding of the two domains at its ends. Specifically, if the α-helix does initiate the folding process, then the folding of the two domains at the ends will be interdependent. The most extensively characterized SAH domains to date are the ER/K α-helices found in myosin X and VI. A study by Knight et al. (1.Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M. The predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin 10 forms a novel elongated domain that lengthens the head.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) investigated a putative coiled-coil motif in murine myosin X that was highly enriched in charged residues in the a and d positions of the heptad repeats. The authors identified this as a peptide that did not conform with typical coiled-coil motifs and coined the term SAH to describe an isolated stable single α-helix (Fig. 2a). The 36-residue peptide studied (RQLLAEKRELEEKKRREEEKKREEEERERERAQR) resembles an ideal ER/K motif. Using 1H NMR, they found that the N-terminal 6 residues form a random coil, whereas all other residues in the peptide are α-helical. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, they determined the peptide to be monomeric at concentrations up to 700 μm. Surprisingly, they found that the α-helical content, as determined by CD, is less sensitive to higher salt concentrations than a synthetic 19-amino acid E4K4 peptide, presumably due to more stable electrostatic interactions. The study also investigated the SAH domain in the context of a nearly intact myosin X, which included a directly N-terminal putative coiled-coil region (120 amino acids total), by rotary shadowing and negative stain EM (Fig. 2a). They found that 90% of the peptide was monomeric, whereas 10% appeared dimerized. Further, in the dimeric population, only a small portion of the α-helical region appeared to be interacting. The “head” region of the entire myosin was 15 nm longer than expected (34.7 nm versus an expected 18.4 nm), corresponding to the expected length of 18 nm if the entire 120-amino acid region were in an extended α-helix. Finally, this study made predictions for two additional SAH domains in regions putatively described as coiled-coil regions in myosin VI and MyoM (Dictyostelium myosin) based on the ER/K motif in their primary amino acid sequence, both of which were subsequently confirmed. Spink et al. (27.Spink B.J. Sivaramakrishnan S. Lipfert J. Doniach S. Spudich J.A. Long single α-helical tail domains bridge the gap between structure and function of myosin VI.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an ER/K motif was necessary for the large (36-nm) step size of dimeric myosin VI. The myosin VI medial tail was previously proposed to form a coiled-coil (28.Rock R.S. Ramamurthy B. Dunn A.R. Beccafico S. Rami B.R. Morris C. Spink B.J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. A flexible domain is essential for the large step size and processivity of myosin VI.Mol.

Doniach S. Spudich J.A. Long single α-helical tail domains bridge the gap between structure and function of myosin VI.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that a polypeptide derived from the medial tail failed to demonstrate a cooperative melting profile characteristic of coiled-coil domains. Using a combination of spectroscopic approaches, the medial tail was found to be monomeric even at high concentrations (>200 μm). SAXS reconstructions revealed an extended conformation (∼10 nm) consistent with the medial tail as an ER/K motif (Fig. 2b). Forced dimerization of the medial tail, by insertion of a canonical coiled-coil at its N terminus, substantially diminished the step size and processivity of myosin VI. The rigidity of this ER/K α-helix is evident in its ability to extend the mechanical stroke of myosin VI as it resists an external force applied by optical tweezers (29.Sivaramakrishnan S. Sung J. Ali M. Doniach S. Flyvbjerg H. Spudich J.A.

By pairing SAXS and optical trapping measurements of this and another naturally occurring ER/K motif (10 and 30 nm), the persistence length of the ER/K motif based on an ideal worm-like chain was estimated to be 15 nm (29.Sivaramakrishnan S. Sung J. Ali M. Doniach S. Flyvbjerg H. Spudich J.A.

Until recently, the identification of the SAH domain was limited to the handful of natural proteins where it had been biochemically characterized. Searching specifically for the minimal ER/K motif (E4(R/K)4)2, Sivaramakrishnan et al. (18.Sivaramakrishnan S. Spink B.J. Sim A.Y. Doniach S. Spudich J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2050574321,"The significance of G-quadruplexes and the helicases that resolve G4 structures in prokaryotes is poorly understood. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome is GC-rich and contains >10,000 sequences that have the potential to form G4 structures. In Escherichia coli, RecQ helicase unwinds G4 structures. However, RecQ is absent in M. tuberculosis, and the helicase that participates in G4 resolution in M. tuberculosis is obscure. Here, we show that M. tuberculosis DinG (MtDinG) exhibits high affinity for ssDNA and ssDNA translocation with a 5' → 3' polarity. Interestingly, MtDinG unwinds overhangs, flap structures, and forked duplexes but fails to unwind linear duplex DNA. Our data with DNase I footprinting provide mechanistic insights and suggest that MtDinG is a 5' → 3' polarity helicase. Notably, in contrast to E. coli DinG, MtDinG catalyzes unwinding of replication fork and Holliday junction structures. Strikingly, we find that MtDinG resolves intermolecular G4 structures. These data suggest that MtDinG is a multifunctional structure-specific helicase that unwinds model structures of DNA replication, repair, and recombination as well as G4 structures. We finally demonstrate that promoter sequences of M. tuberculosis PE_PGRS2, mce1R, and moeB1 genes contain G4 structures, implying that G4 structures may regulate gene expression in M. tuberculosis. We discuss these data and implicate targeting G4 structures and DinG helicase in M. tuberculosis could be a novel therapeutic strategy for culminating the infection with this pathogen."

Phage Team1 was propagated on a Staphylococcus aureus strain and a non-pathogenic Staphylococcus xylosus strain used in industrial meat fermentation. The two Team1 preparations were compared with respect to their microbiological and genomic properties. The burst sizes, latent periods, and host ranges of the two derivatives were identical as were their genome sequences. Phage Team1 has 140,903 bp of double stranded DNA encoding for 217 open reading frames and 4 tRNAs. Comparative genomic analysis revealed similarities to staphylococcal phages ISP (97%) and G1 (97%). The host range of Team1 was compared to the well-known polyvalent staphylococcal phages phi812 and K using a panel of 57 S. aureus strains collected from various sources. These bacterial strains were found to represent 18 sequence types (MLST) and 14 clonal complexes (eBURST). Altogether, the three phages propagated on S. xylosus lysed 52 out of 57 distinct strains of S. aureus. The identification of phage-insensitive strains underlines the importance of designing phage cocktails with broadly varying and overlapping host ranges. Taken altogether, our study suggests that some staphylococcal phages can be propagated on food-grade bacteria for biocontrol and safety purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2003345411,"Emerging infectious diseases often result from pathogens jumping to novel hosts. Identifying possibilities and constraints on host transfer is therefore an important facet of research in disease ecology. Host transfers can be studied for the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum, predominantly a pathogen of poultry until its 1994 appearance and subsequent epidemic spread in a wild songbird, the house finch Haemorhous mexicanus and some other wild birds. We screened a broad range of potential host species for evidence of infection by M. gallisepticum in order to answer 3 questions: (1) is there a host phylogenetic constraint on the likelihood of host infection (house finches compared to other bird species); (2) does opportunity for close proximity (visiting bird feeders) increase the likelihood of a potential host being infected; and (3) is there seasonal variation in opportunity for host jumping (winter resident versus summer resident species). We tested for pathogen exposure both by using PCR to test for the presence of M. gallisepticum DNA and by rapid plate agglutination to test for the presence of antibodies. We examined 1,941 individual birds of 53 species from 19 avian families. In 27 species (15 families) there was evidence for exposure with M. gallisepticum although conjunctivitis was very rare in non-finches. There was no difference in detection rate between summer and winter residents, nor between feeder birds and species that do not come to feeders. Evidence of M. gallisepticum infection was found in all species for which at least 20 individuals had been sampled. Combining the present results with those of previous studies shows that a diverse range of wild bird species may carry or have been exposed to M. gallisepticum in the USA as well as in Europe and Asia."
https://openalex.org/W1974677375,"When monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were stimulated with LPS in the presence of anti-CD33/Siglec-3 mAb, the production of IL-12 and phosphorylation of NF-κB decreased significantly. The cell surface proteins of imDCs were chemically cross-linked, and CD33-linked proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. It was CD14 that was found to be cross-linked with CD33. A proximity ligation assay also indicated that CD33 was colocalized with CD14 on the cell surface of imDCs. Sialic acid-dependent binding of CD33 to CD14 was confirmed by a plate assay using recombinant CD33 and CD14. Three types of cells (HEK293T cells expressing the LPS receptor complex (Toll-like receptor (TLR) cells), and the LPS receptor complex plus either wild-type CD33 (TLR/CD33WT cells) or mutated CD33 without sialic acid-binding activity (TLR/CD33RA cells)) were prepared, and then the binding and uptake of LPS were investigated. Although the level of LPS bound on the cell surface was similar among these cells, the uptake of LPS was reduced in TLR/CD33WT cells. A higher level of CD14-bound LPS and a lower level of TLR4-bound LPS were detected in TLR/CD33WT cells compared with the other two cell types, probably due to reduced presentation of LPS from CD14 to TLR4. Phosphorylation of NF-κB after stimulation with LPS was also compared. Wild-type CD33 but not mutated CD33 significantly reduced the phosphorylation of NF-κB. These results suggest that CD14 is an endogenous ligand for CD33 and that ligation of CD33 with CD14 modulates with the presentation of LPS from CD14 to TLR4, leading to down-regulation of TLR4-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2015637310,"Background Assessing the active space of the various types of information encoded by songbirds' vocalizations is important to address questions related to species ecology (e.g. spacing of individuals), as well as social behavior (e.g. territorial and/or mating strategies). Up to now, most of the previous studies have investigated the degradation of species-specific related information (species identity), and there is a gap of knowledge of how finer-grained information (e.g. individual identity) can transmit through the environment. Here we studied how the individual signature coded in the zebra finch long distance contact call degrades with propagation. Methodology We performed sound transmission experiments of zebra finches' distance calls at various propagation distances. The propagated calls were analyzed using discriminant function analyses on a set of analytical parameters describing separately the spectral and temporal envelopes, as well as on a complete spectrographic representation of the signals. Results/Conclusion We found that individual signature is remarkably resistant to propagation as caller identity can be recovered even at distances greater than a hundred meters. Male calls show stronger discriminability at long distances than female calls, and this difference can be explained by the more pronounced frequency modulation found in their calls. In both sexes, individual information is carried redundantly using multiple acoustical features. Interestingly, features providing the highest discrimination at short distances are not the same ones that provide the highest discrimination at long distances."

Intracellular CA (CAi) isoforms are present in certain types of cancer, and growing evidence suggests that low levels correlate with disease severity. However, their physiological role remains unclear. Cancer cell CAi activity, measured as cytoplasmic CO2 hydration rate (kf), ranged from high in colorectal HCT116 (∼2 s−1), bladder RT112 and colorectal HT29, moderate in fibrosarcoma HT1080 to negligible (i.e. spontaneous kf = 0.18 s−1) in cervical HeLa and breast MDA-MB-468 cells. CAi activity in cells correlated with CAII immunoreactivity and enzymatic activity in membrane-free lysates, suggesting that soluble CAII is an important intracellular isoform. CAi catalysis was not obligatory for supporting acid extrusion by H+ efflux or HCO3− influx, nor for maintaining intracellular pH (pHi) uniformity. However, in the absence of CAi activity, acid loading from a highly alkaline pHi was rate-limited by HCO3− supply from spontaneous CO2 hydration. In solid tumors, time-dependence of blood flow can result in fluctuations of CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) that disturb cytoplasmic CO2-HCO3−-H+ equilibrium. In cancer cells with high CAi activity, extracellular pCO2 fluctuations evoked faster and larger pHi oscillations. Functionally, these resulted in larger pH-dependent intracellular [Ca2+] oscillations and stronger inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway reported by S6 kinase phosphorylation. In contrast, the pHi of cells with low CAi activity was less responsive to pCO2 fluctuations. Such low pass filtering would “buffer” cancer cell pHi from non-steady-state extracellular pCO2.

On the time scale of cellular physiology, the spontaneous equilibration of carbonic buffer is relatively slow, as exemplified by a CO2 hydration time constant of several seconds (rate constant kf = 0.18 s−1) (5.Geers C. Gros G. Carbon dioxide transport and carbonic anhydrase in blood and muscle.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 681-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Consequently, biological processes that involve a change in the concentration of CO2, HCO3− or H+ can become rate-limited by carbonic buffer re-equilibration. This limitation has presumably driven the evolution of at least a dozen mammalian carbonic anhydrase (CA) 2The abbreviations used are: CAcarbonic anhydraseCAiintracellular CACAeextracellular CAmTORmechanistic target of rapamycinpHiintracellular pHpCO2CO2 partial pressurepO2O2 partial pressureAMacetoxymethylATZacetazolamideCAssoluble cytoplasmic CANHENa+/H+ exchangeDMA5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride[H+]iintracellular [H+]mTORC1mTOR complex 1S6KS6 kinase. isozymes that accelerate CO2/HCO3− equilibration (6.Supuran C.T.

Thus, CAe activity can improve the venting of acidic products of metabolism over the long diffusion distances found in inadequately perfused solid tumors, allowing their faster growth (20.Chiche J.

Carbonic anhydrase IX promotes tumor growth and necrosis in vivo and inhibition enhances anti-VEGF therapy.Clin Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 3100-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The role of CAi isoforms in cancer physiology is still debated. Down-regulation of gap junctions in cancer cells prevents the intracellular compartment from becoming syncytial (22.Loewenstein W.R. Kanno Y. Intercellular communication and the control of tissue growth: lack of communication between cancer cells.Nature. 1966; 209: 1248-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and this restricts the spatial range over which CAi activity could facilitate CO2 or H+ diffusion. Previously, it has been suggested that CAi activity facilitates the transport of HCO3− or H+ ions across membranes by reducing the extent to which cytoplasmic reactions slow the delivery or removal of the transported ion (23.Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. A transport metabolon. Functional interaction of carbonic anhydrase II and chloride/bicarbonate exchangers.J. Biol.

Physiol. 2014; 592: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To benefit from CA activity, these transporter-evoked H+ or HCO3− fluxes would have to exceed the spontaneous chemical re-equilibration kinetics of carbonic buffer (27.Boron W.F. Evaluating the role of carbonic anhydrases in the transport of HCO3−-related species.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar Another source of disturbance to carbonic buffer equilibrium is fluctuating CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). Cancer cells produce large quantities of CO2 from titration of acids (e.g. lactic) with HCO3− and decarboxylation by mitochondria and the pentose phosphate shunt (28.Swietach P. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Harris A.L. Regulation of tumor pH and the role of carbonic anhydrase 9.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the excess CO2 must be removed with the blood flow. In tumors, vasomotion and hemodynamic factors can produce cycles of intermittent blood flow, commonly observed with periodicities of several minutes (29.Baudelet C. Cron G.O. Ansiaux R. Crokart N.

Episodes of inadequate blood flow produce “closed” pockets of blood, which become oxygen-depleted and accumulate CO2 (43.Bhujwalla Z.M. Artemov D. Ballesteros P. Cerdan S. Gillies R.J. Solaiyappan M.

Blood flow and venous pH of tissue-isolated Walker 256 carcinoma during hyperglycemia.Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar). Periodic restoration of flow returns pCO2 and pO2 to normal. The resulting fluctuations in pCO2 (mirroring pO2) are transmitted across the intra- and extracellular compartments because CO2 gas (unlike H+ or HCO3− ions) crosses membranes rapidly (4.Hulikova A. Swietach P. Rapid CO2 permeation across biological membranes: implications for CO2 venting from tissue.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 2762-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Due to reversible intracellular CO2 hydration, pHi will respond to pCO2 fluctuations, but the coupling between these depends critically on CAi activity. Because cell behavior is strongly modulated by H+ ions (46.Cardone R.A. Casavola V. Reshkin S.J. The role of disturbed pH dynamics and the Na+/H+ exchanger in metastasis.Nat. Rev.

Rev. 2012; 92: 1865-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), CAi activity may act as an important transducer between blood flow and cell signaling. The aim of the present study was to measure CAi activity in the native environment of intact cancer cells and to identify the physiological processes, relevant to cancer, that depend on CAi activity. We describe a novel role for CAi activity in sensitizing cancer cell pH to pCO2 changes, thereby linking metabolism and perfusion with pHi-responsive signaling cascades. Cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC (colorectal HCT116), Cancer Research UK (bladder RT112, colorectal HT29, fibrosarcomal HT1080, and breast MDA-MB-468) or were a gift from Professor Silvia Pastorekova, Bratislava, Slovakia (cervical HeLa). Fibroblast cell lines were obtained from Lonza (NHDF-Ad adult dermal fibroblasts and InMyoFib intestinal myofibroblasts) or ATCC (normal colon CCD-112-Con and carcinoma-derived Hs675.T fibroblasts). Cells were grown in HCO3−-containing DMEM in 5% CO2 and 21% O2 for 48 h until 80–100% confluent (Galaxy 48R, New Brunswick). For some experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm dimethyl oxalylglycine (DMOG) dissolved in DMSO. CA2 gene expression in HCT116 cells was silenced using one of four shRNA constructs cloned into psi-LVRU6-GFP lentiviral vector targeting the 351st, 493rd, 597th, and 695th position of CA2 mRNA (NCBI Reference Sequence NM_000067). All constructs, including scrambled-eGFP, were purchased from Genecopoiea. Stable HCT116 cell clones with silenced CA2 gene expression were selected in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks, and selected clones were pooled together for experiments. Cells were lysed at 4 °C (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 substitute (Applichem), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) plus Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture) and pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad), and detected using mouse monoclonal M75 antibody against human CAIX (a gift from Prof. Pastorekova; Ref. 49.Pastorek J.

Kinase phosphorylation in cells cultured to high density was measured with the phospho-MAPK array profiler (R&D Systems) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in buffer containing 140 mm potassium gluconate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Hepes, 15 mm Mes at pH 7.8 (4 °C), and protease inhibitor. Membranes were removed by centrifugation (20 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C), and the supernatant was diluted to a total protein concentration between 1 and 10 mg/ml (Bradford assay). The CA-catalyzed reaction was triggered by adding 0.33 ml CO2-saturated water to 0.67 ml of lysate in a stirred chamber at 4 °C. The time course of pH (Hamilton Biotrode) was fitted with a kinetic model (19.Swietach P. Wigfield S. Cobden P. Supuran C.T. Harris A.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase 9 spatially coordinates intracellular pH in three-dimensional multicellular growths.J. Biol.

CO2/HCO3−-free solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH to 7.4 with NaOH), 4.5 mm KCl, 11 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. For CO2/HCO3−-buffered solution, Hepes was replaced with 22 mm NaHCO3, and the solution was bubbled with either 5% CO2 (pH 7.4) or 20% (pH 6.8). For Cl−-free solutions, Cl− was replaced with gluconate. For acetate-containing solution, 80 mm NaCl was replaced with 80 mm sodium acetate. For NH4+-containing solution, 20 mm NaCl was replaced with 20 mm NH4Cl. Cells were superfused (37 °C at 4 ml/min) in a poly-l-lysine-treated Perspex chamber (solution exchange time constant <3 s) except for fluctuating pCO2 protocols, which were performed in 2-ml Lab-Tek chambers (Nunc) that allow a more gradual solution exchange. Cells were imaged confocally using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal system on an Axiovert inverted microscope. To measure pHi, cells were AM-loaded for 10 min with 10 μm cSNARF1 (excitation, 555 nm; emission, 580 and 640 nm). The fluorescence ratio was converted to pHi using a calibration curve obtained by the nigericin method (50.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Intracellular pH measurements in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells utilizing spectroscopic probes generated in situ.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Calibration was performed twice a year for each cell line, and the stability of the curve was tested by the null point method (51.Eisner D.A. Kenning N.A. O'Neill S.C. Pocock G. Richards C.D. Valdeolmillos M. A novel method for absolute calibration of intracellular pH indicators.Pflugers Arch. 1989; 413: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membrane H+ (or H+-equivalent) flux was calculated as the rate of pHi change × buffering capacity (3.Hulikova A. Harris A.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Swietach P. Regulation of intracellular pH in cancer cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Intrinsic buffering capacity was measured in separate experiments using the graded ammonium removal technique (3.Hulikova A. Harris A.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Swietach P. Regulation of intracellular pH in cancer cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CO2/HCO3−-dependent buffering was estimated using the equation for an open buffer system: 2.303 × [HCO3−]i. Intracellular [HCO3−] was calculated by best fitting a mathematical model of pHi regulation to the time course of pHi recovery from an acid or base load (see below). This approach derives instantaneous carbonic buffering capacity (rather than assuming that the buffer is distributed at equilibrium across the cell membrane at all times). To measure [Ca2+]i, cells were AM-loaded for 20 min with 50 μm Fluo3 (excitation, 488 nm; emission, >510 nm). For co-cultures, regions with distinct areas of cancer cells and fibroblasts (distinguished by cell morphology and size) were selected for imaging. A mathematical model of pHi control was parameterized using data for buffering capacity (β) and membrane transport fluxes of H+ and HCO3− ions (JH and JHCO3) (3.Hulikova A. Harris A.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Swietach P. Regulation of intracellular pH in cancer cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The carbonic buffer equilibrium constant, KCO2, was 10−6.1 m, and the spontaneous CO2 hydration rate constant (kf) was 0.18 s−1 (the reverse rate constant, kr, was kf/KCO2). CAi activity was represented as a dimensionless scalar (ca). Surface area/volume ratio was 1/h where h is the monolayer height (10 μm). CO2 permeability, p, was 104 μm/s (4.Hulikova A. Swietach P. Rapid CO2 permeation across biological membranes: implications for CO2 venting from tissue.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 2762-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). pCO2 was a sinusoidal function, f, of amplitude A, frequency φ, and baseline of 5% CO2. The equations are as follows. d[CO2]i/dt=ca×kf×10−pHi×[HCO3−]i−ca×kf×[CO2]i+p/h×(f(t)−[CO2]i)(Eq. 1) d[HCO3−]i/dt=ca×kf[CO2]i−ca×kf×10−pHi×[HCO3−]i+JHCO3(Eq. 2) dpHi/dt=−(ca×kf×[CO2]i−ca×kr×10−pHi×[HCO3−]i+JH)/β(Eq. 3) Total CAi activity was measured in intact cells superfused continuously with physiological salt solution at body temperature. The CAi-catalyzed reaction was triggered by switching between CO2/HCO3−-free and 5% CO2/22 mm HCO3−-buffered superfusates. The time constant of solution exchange (2.7 s; determined by fluorescently labeling one solution with 30 μm fluorescein) was adequately fast to ensure that pCO2 was manipulated rapidly. CAi-catalyzed reaction kinetics were determined from the initial rate of pHi change (reported using the fluorescent pH indicator cSNARF1 AM-loaded into cells) and intrinsic buffering capacity (52.Schroeder M.A. Ali M.A. Hulikova A. Supuran C.T. Clarke K. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Tyler D.J. Swietach P. Extramitochondrial domain rich in carbonic anhydrase activity improves myocardial energetics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W1993449328,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process that contributes to epithelial tissue morphogenesis during normal development and in tumor invasiveness and metastasis. The transcriptional regulator SnoN robustly influences EMT in response to the cytokine TGFβ, but the mechanisms that regulate the fundamental role of SnoN in TGFβ-induced EMT are not completely understood. Here we employ interaction proteomics to uncover the signaling protein TIF1γ as a specific interactor of SnoN1 but not the closely related isoform SnoN2. A 16-amino acid peptide within a unique region of SnoN1 mediates the interaction of SnoN1 with TIF1γ. Strikingly, although TIF1γ is thought to act as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, we find that TIF1γ operates as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase that promotes the sumoylation of SnoN1 at distinct lysine residues. Importantly, TIF1γ-induced sumoylation is required for the ability of SnoN1 to suppress TGFβ-induced EMT, as assayed by the disruption of the morphogenesis of acini in a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells. Collectively, our findings define a novel TIF1γ-SnoN1 sumoylation pathway that plays a critical role in EMT and has important implications for our understanding of TGFβ signaling and diverse biological processes in normal development and cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W1978191461,"Spatial statistics has seen rapid application in many fields, especially epidemiology and public health. Many studies, nonetheless, make limited use of the geographical location information and also usually assume that the covariates, which are related to the response variable, have linear effects. We develop a Bayesian semi-parametric regression model for HIV prevalence data. Model estimation and inference is based on fully Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC). The model is applied to HIV prevalence data among men in Kenya, derived from the Kenya AIDS indicator survey, with n = 3,662. Past studies have concluded that HIV infection has a nonlinear association with age. In this study a smooth function based on penalized regression splines is used to estimate this nonlinear effect. Other covariates were assumed to have a linear effect. Spatial references to the counties were modeled as both structured and unstructured spatial effects. We observe that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection. The results also indicate that men in the urban areas were more likely to be infected by HIV as compared to their rural counterpart. Men with higher education had the lowest risk of HIV infection. A nonlinear relationship between HIV infection and age was established. Risk of HIV infection increases with age up to the age of 40 then declines with increase in age. Men who had STI in the last 12 months were more likely to be infected with HIV. Also men who had ever used a condom were found to have higher likelihood to be infected by HIV. A significant spatial variation of HIV infection in Kenya was also established. The study shows the practicality and flexibility of Bayesian semi-parametric regression model in analyzing epidemiological data."
https://openalex.org/W2086057725,"Processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) are related, cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes that contribute to post-transcriptional gene regulation in all eukaryotic cells. Both structures contain translationally repressed mRNAs and several proteins involved in silencing, stabilization or degradation of mRNAs, especially under environmental stress. Here, we monitored the dynamic formation of PBs and SGs, in somatic cells of adult worms, using fluorescently tagged protein markers of each complex. Both complexes were accumulated in response to various stress conditions, but distinct modes of SG formation were induced, depending on the insult. We also observed an age-dependent accumulation of PBs but not of SGs. We further showed that direct alterations in PB-related genes can influence aging and normal stress responses, beyond their developmental role. In addition, disruption of SG-related genes had diverse effects on development, fertility, lifespan and stress resistance of worms. Our work therefore underlines the important roles of mRNA metabolism factors in several vital cellular processes and provides insight into their diverse functions in a multicellular organism."
https://openalex.org/W2080695512,"Research in both infants and adults demonstrated that attachment expectations are associated with the attentional processing of attachment-related information. However, this research suffered from methodological issues and has not been validated across ages. Employing a more ecologically valid paradigm to measure attentional processes by virtue of eye tracking, the current study tested the defensive exclusion hypothesis in late childhood. According to this hypothesis, insecurely attached children are assumed to defensively exclude attachment-related information. We hypothesized that securely attached children process attachment- related neutral and emotional information in a more open manner compared to insecurely attached children. Sixty-two children (59.7% girls, 8–12 years) completed two different tasks, while eye movements were recorded: task one presented an array of neutral faces including mother and unfamiliar women and task two presented the same with happy and angry faces. Results indicated that more securely attached children looked longer at mother’s face regardless of the emotional expression. Also, they tend to have more maintained attention to mother’s neutral face. Furthermore, more attachment avoidance was related to a reduced total viewing time of mother’s neutral, happy, and angry face. Attachment anxiety was not consistently related to the processing of mother’s face. Findings support the theoretical assumption that securely attached children have an open manner of processing all attachment-related information."
https://openalex.org/W1966378137,"Antagonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have the potential to act as analgesic drugs that may help alleviate chronic pain. This study was done to look at the possible rewarding properties of the mGluR5 antagonist, fenobam, in a cognitive assay. Analgesic conditioned place preference (aCPP) was used to examine the effects of fenobam (30 mg/kg) and the prototypical mGluR5 antagonist, MPEP, and these effects were compared to those of a drug with known analgesic properties, morphine (10 mg/kg). In each experiment, one group of mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery to model chronic pain; the other group received a control sham surgery. Both fenobam and MPEP induced preference in the SNI mice, such that SNI mice spent significantly more time in the mGluR5 antagonist-paired chamber compared to a vehicle-paired chamber. No such preference developed for sham mice. Morphine induced preference in male and female mice in both the SNI and sham groups. The results showed that fenobam and MPEP likely reduced on-going distress in the SNI mice, causing them to prefer the chamber paired with the drug compared to the vehicle-paired chamber. Since sham animals did not prefer the drug-paired chamber, these data demonstrate that mGluR5 antagonism is non-rewarding in the absence of pain-like injury."
https://openalex.org/W2060568604,"Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is a member of the family of cytoplasmic sorting nexin adaptor proteins that regulate endosomal trafficking of cell surface proteins. SNX17 localizes to early endosomes where it directly binds NPX(Y/F) motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of its target receptors to mediate their rates of endocytic internalization, recycling, and/or degradation. SNX17 has also been implicated in mediating cell signaling and can interact with cytoplasmic proteins. KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped 1), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein associated with cerebral cavernous malformations, has previously been shown to interact with SNX17. Here, we demonstrate that SNX17 indeed binds directly to KRIT1 and map the binding to the second Asn-Pro-Xaa-Tyr/Phe (NPX(Y/F)) motif in KRIT1. We further characterize the interaction as being mediated by the FERM domain of SNX17. We present the co-crystal structure of SNX17-FERM with the KRIT1-NPXF2 peptide to 3.0 Å resolution and demonstrate that the interaction is highly similar in structure and binding affinity to that between SNX17 and P-selectin. We verify the molecular details of the interaction by site-directed mutagenesis and pulldown assay and thereby confirm that the major binding site for SNX17 is confined to the NPXF2 motif in KRIT1. Taken together, our results verify a direct interaction between SNX17 and KRIT1 and classify KRIT1 as a SNX17 binding partner."
https://openalex.org/W2071848366,"The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a key role in the regulation of bone remodeling in mice and humans. Two transmembrane proteins that are involved in decreasing the activity of this pathway by binding to extracellular antagonists, such as Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), are the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (Lrp5) and Kremen 2 (Krm2). Lrp 5 deficiency (Lrp5-/-) as well as osteoblast-specific overexpression of Krm2 in mice (Col1a1-Krm2) result in severe osteoporosis occurring at young age. In this study, we analyzed the influence of Lrp5 deficiency and osteoblast-specific overexpression of Krm2 on fracture healing in mice using flexible and semi-rigid fracture fixation. We demonstrated that fracture healing was highly impaired in both mouse genotypes, but that impairment was more severe in Col1a1-Krm2 than in Lrp5-/- mice and particularly evident in mice in which the more flexible fixation was used. Bone formation was more reduced in Col1a1-Krm2 than in Lrp5-/- mice, whereas osteoclast number was similarly increased in both genotypes in comparison with wild-type mice. Using microarray analysis we identified reduced expression of genes mainly involved in osteogenesis that seemed to be responsible for the observed stronger impairment of healing in Col1a1-Krm2 mice. In line with these findings, we detected decreased expression of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (Smpd3) and less active β-catenin in the calli of Col1a1-Krm2 mice. Since Krm2 seems to play a significant role in regulating bone formation during fracture healing, antagonizing KRM2 might be a therapeutic option to improve fracture healing under compromised conditions, such as osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2011882979,"Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. To understand complex networks, it is crucial to investigate their community structure. In this paper, we develop an online community detection algorithm with linear time complexity for large complex networks. Our algorithm processes a network edge by edge in the order that the network is fed to the algorithm. If a new edge is added, it just updates the existing community structure in constant time, and does not need to re-compute the whole network. Therefore, it can efficiently process large networks in real time. Our algorithm optimizes expected modularity instead of modularity at each step to avoid poor performance. The experiments are carried out using 11 public data sets, and are measured by two criteria, modularity and NMI (Normalized Mutual Information). The results show that our algorithm's running time is less than the commonly used Louvain algorithm while it gives competitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W2033232322,"The prevailing method of analyzing GWAS data is still to test each marker individually, although from a statistical point of view it is quite obvious that in case of complex traits such single marker tests are not ideal. Recently several model selection approaches for GWAS have been suggested, most of them based on LASSO-type procedures. Here we will discuss an alternative model selection approach which is based on a modification of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC2) which was previously shown to have certain asymptotic optimality properties in terms of minimizing the misclassification error. Heuristic search strategies are introduced which attempt to find the model which minimizes mBIC2, and which are efficient enough to allow the analysis of GWAS data. Our approach is implemented in a software package called MOSGWA. Its performance in case control GWAS is compared with the two algorithms HLASSO and GWASelect, as well as with single marker tests, where we performed a simulation study based on real SNP data from the POPRES sample. Our results show that MOSGWA performs slightly better than HLASSO, whereas according to our simulations GWASelect does not control the type I error when used to automatically determine the number of important SNPs. We also reanalyze the GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) and compare the findings of the different procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2064674028,"The affect-as-information hypothesis (e.g., Schwarz & Clore, 2003), predicts that the positive or negative valence of our mood differentially affects our processing of the details of the environment. However, this hypothesis has only been tested with mood induction procedures and fairly complex cognitive tasks in humans. Here, six baboons (Papio papio) living in a social group had free access to a computerized visual search task on which they were over-trained. Trials that immediately followed a spontaneously expressed emotional behavior were analyzed, ruling out possible biases due to induction procedures. RTs following negatively valenced behaviors are slower than those following neutral and positively valenced behaviors, respectively. Thus, moods affect the performance of nonhuman primates tested in highly automatized tasks, as it does in humans during tasks with much higher cognitive demands. These findings reveal a presumably universal and adaptive mechanism by which moods influence performance in various ecological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2014705302,"The glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a plasminogen (Pg) receptor on the cell surface. In this study, we demonstrate that GRP78 also binds the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), which results in a decrease in K(m) and an increase in the V(max) for both its amidolytic activity and activation of its substrate, Pg. This results in accelerated Pg activation when GRP78, t-PA, and Pg are bound together. The increase in t-PA activity is the result of a mechanism involving a t-PA lysine-dependent binding site in the GRP78 amino acid sequence (98)LIGRTWNDPSVQQDIKFL(115). We found that GRP78 is expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells where it is co-localized with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which is also a t-PA-binding protein in these cells. We demonstrate that both Pg and t-PA serve as a bridge between GRP78 and VDAC bringing them together to facilitate Pg activation. t-PA induces SK-N-SH cell proliferation via binding to GRP78 on the cell surface. Furthermore, Pg binding to the COOH-terminal region of GRP78 stimulates cell proliferation via its microplasminogen domain. This study confirms previous findings from our laboratory showing that GRP78 acts as a growth factor-like receptor and that its association with t-PA, Pg, and VDAC on the cell surface may be part of a system controlling cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1980863322,"The enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH; EC 1.1.1.42) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, to produce 2-oxoglutarate. The incompleteness of the tricarboxylic acids cycle in marine cyanobacteria confers a special importance to isocitrate dehydrogenase in the C/N balance, since 2-oxoglutarate can only be metabolized through the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway. The physiological regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase was studied in cultures of Prochlorococcus sp. strain PCC 9511, by measuring enzyme activity and concentration using the NADPH production assay and Western blotting, respectively. The enzyme activity showed little changes under nitrogen or phosphorus starvation, or upon addition of the inhibitors DCMU, DBMIB and MSX. Azaserine, an inhibitor of glutamate synthase, induced clear increases in the isocitrate dehydrogenase activity and icd gene expression after 24 h, and also in the 2-oxoglutarate concentration. Iron starvation had the most significant effect, inducing a complete loss of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, possibly mediated by a process of oxidative inactivation, while its concentration was unaffected. Our results suggest that isocitrate dehydrogenase responds to changes in the intracellular concentration of 2-oxoglutarate and to the redox status of the cells in Prochlorococcus."

https://openalex.org/W1978757288,"Tumor growth and development is influenced by its microenvironment. A major extracellular matrix molecule involved in cancer progression is hyaluronan (HA). Hyaluronan and expression of a number of hyaladherin family proteins are dramatically increased in many cancer malignancies. One such hyaladherin, hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR) has been considered to be a biomarker for tumor progression. Interestingly, overexpression of HABP1 in fibroblast has been shown to increase autophagy via generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of HA leading to apoptosis. Cancerous cells are often found to exhibit decreased rate of proteolysis/autophagy in comparison to their normal counterparts. To determine if HABP1 levels alter tumorigenicity of cancerous cells, HepR21, the stable transfectant overexpressing HABP1 in HepG2 cell line was derived. HepR21 has been shown to have increased proliferation rate than HepG2, intracellular HA cable formation and enhanced tumor potency without any significant alteration of intracellular ROS. In this paper we have observed that HepR21 cells containing higher endogenous HA levels, have downregulated expression of the autophagic marker, MAP-LC3, consistent with unaltered levels of endogenous ROS. In fact, HepR21 cells seem to have significant resistance to exogenous ROS stimuli and glutathione depletion. HepR21 cells were also found to be more resilient to nutrient starvation in comparison to its parent cell line. Decline in intracellular HA levels and HA cables in HepR21 cells upon treatment with HAS inhibitor (4-MU), induced a surge in ROS levels leading to increased expression of MAP-LC3 and tumor suppressors Beclin 1 and PTEN. This suggests the importance of HABP1 induced HA cable formation in enhancing tumor potency by maintaining the oxidant levels and subsequent autophagic vacuolation."
https://openalex.org/W2060206703,"Fe-treated biochar and raw biochar produced from macroalgae are effective biosorbents of metalloids and metals, respectively. However, the treatment of complex effluents that contain both metalloid and metal contaminants presents a challenging scenario. We test a multiple-biosorbent approach to bioremediation using Fe-biochar and biochar to remediate both metalloids and metals from the effluent from a coal-fired power station. First, a model was derived from published data for this effluent to predict the biosorption of 21 elements by Fe-biochar and biochar. The modelled outputs were then used to design biosorption experiments using Fe-biochar and biochar, both simultaneously and in sequence, to treat effluent containing multiple contaminants in excess of water quality criteria. The waste water was produced during ash disposal at an Australian coal-fired power station. The application of Fe-biochar and biochar, either simultaneously or sequentially, resulted in a more comprehensive remediation of metalloids and metals compared to either biosorbent used individually. The most effective treatment was the sequential use of Fe-biochar to remove metalloids from the waste water, followed by biochar to remove metals. Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn were reduced to the lowest concentration following the sequential application of the two biosorbents, and their final concentrations were predicted by the model. Overall, 17 of the 21 elements measured were remediated to, or below, the concentrations that were predicted by the model. Both metalloids and metals can be remediated from complex effluent using biosorbents with different characteristics but derived from a single feedstock. Furthermore, the extent of remediation can be predicted for similar effluents using additive models."

Increased residency time of molecules that regulate adhesion turnover contributes to adhesion stability, ultimately determining migration speed across two-dimensional surfaces. In the present study we test the role of Src kinase in regulating dynamic exchange of the focal adhesion protein NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L. Using either chemical inhibition or fibroblasts genetically null for Src together with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we find that Src significantly reduces NEDD9 exchange at focal adhesions. Analysis of NEDD9 mutant constructs with the two major Src-interacting domains disabled revealed the greatest effects were due to the NEDD9 SH2 binding domain. This correlated with a significant change in two-dimensional migratory speed. Given the emerging role of NEDD9 as a regulator of focal adhesion stability, the time of NEDD9 association at the focal adhesions is key in modulating rates of migration and invasion.

Our study suggests that Src kinase activity determines NEDD9 exchange at focal adhesions and may similarly modulate other focal adhesion-targeted Src substrates to regulate cell migration. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is an essential component of cell migration and is chiefly determined by integrin receptor binding to extracellular matrix ligands. Ligand-bound and cross-linked integrins together with the associated signaling molecules and polymerized actin filaments in the cell interior comprise specialized adhesion sites known as focal adhesions. These sites both tether the cells to the underlying matrix and transmit signals bi-directionally between the matrix and the cell cytoplasm (1.Wozniak M.A. Modzelewska K. Kwong L. Keely P.J. Focal adhesion regulation of cell behavior.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). During cell motility, focal adhesions must form and turnover, allowing grip and release of the underlying matrix and translocation of the cell bodies. Rapid exchange of proteins between focal adhesions and the cytoplasm (measured in time scales of s ) facilitates the reorganization of the macromolecular focal adhesions in response to conditions that favor migration (2.Goetz J.G.

Although there have been a handful of studies investigating the exchange rates of focal adhesion molecules, at present there is little understanding of how this is controlled. We have employed Src/Yes/Fyn (Src)−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and NEDD9−/− MEFs to investigate the role of Src kinase in NEDD9 dynamic exchange at focal adhesions. Our data indicate that Src regulates the transit time of NEDD9 at focal adhesions. Src/Yes/Fyn (SYF−/−) null and FAK−/− MEFs were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and NEDD9 (NEDD9−/−) MEFs have been described (11.Zhong J. Baquiran J.B. Bonakdar N. Lees J. Ching Y.W. Pugacheva E. Fabry B. O'Neill G.M. NEDD9 stabilizes focal adhesions, increases binding to the extracellular matrix, and differentially effects 2D versus 3D cell migration.PloS ONE. 2012; 7: e35058Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen) or 15% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Monoclonal anti-NEDD9 and polyclonal anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal anti-paxillin and p130Cas (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Src (Clone GD11) (Millipore), monoclonal anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), monoclonal anti-GFP and polyclonal anti-paxillin Tyr(P)-118 (Invitrogen), anti-β-actin and anti-HSP-70 (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis (Amersham Biosciences), and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used. NEDD9 fused to GFP has been previously described (19.Law S.F. O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Einarson M.B. Golemis E.A. The docking protein HEF1 is an apoptotic mediator at focal adhesion sites.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate NEDD9 Tyr-629 and Tyr-631 to phenylalanines (NEDD9.DFDF). Primer pairs: forward (5′-GCTGGATGGATGACTT-3′) and reverse (5′-TCGAAGTCATCCATCCAGC-3′) and forward (5′-CGATTTCGTCCACCTACAGGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCCTGTAGGTGGACGAAA-3′). SH2BD domain deletion was achieved by synthesizing the sequence encoding the first 67 amino acids (M1-M67) flanked by EcoR1 and AvaI restriction sites then joined by restriction enzyme-mediated ligation with the NEDD9 beginning at Ser-358 (deleting the intervening 290 residues). The mutant sequence was subcloned into the same GFP vector backbone as the wild-type sequence. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient MEF cell transfection was achieved using a nucleofector (Amaxa) and MEF1 nucleofector kit (Lonza). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 1 mg of protein lysate extracted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm NA3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein G-agarose was swollen in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) on ice for 30 min, then washed in PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were precleared with 4 mg of agarose and mixed end-over-end at 4 °C for 1 h. Precleared lysates were incubated with anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science) or mouse IgG for 2 h at 4 °C to which 4 mg of protein G-agarose was added and incubated for a further 16 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (supplemented with inhibitors) and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For all other immunoblotting. PTY lysis buffer protein extraction and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (20.Cowell L.N. Graham J.D. Bouton A.H. Clarke C.L. O'Neill G.M. Tamoxifen treatment promotes phosphorylation of the adhesion molecules, p130Cas/BCAR1, FAK, and Src, via an adhesion-dependent pathway.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7597-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells cultured overnight on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X. Coverslips were mounted with Fluorsave (Merck-Millipore). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 confocal, 63× oil objective. Images were captured using the Leica LAS-AF software. Cells were imaged at a single optical plane corresponding to focal adhesion positions on the ventral surface. Transfected cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, Boston, MA). Media were then exchanged for CO2-independent media supplemented with 15% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic, and cultures were equilibrated at 37 °C for 1 h. FRAP analysis was performed using either Leica SP5 confocal and 63× oil objective (NEDD9 mutant constructs) or Olympus FV1000 confocal and 60× oil objective (SYF−/− and PP2 experiments), both equipped with a 37 °C environmental chamber. Focal adhesions were photobleached for 3 s with an argon laser at 50%. Images of the bleached area were then recorded every 1.4 s over a minimum 60-s period. Recovery rates were calculated and normalized to single control measurements taken per focal adhesion using either the Leica-supported software LAS-AF or the Olympus Fluoview software. FRAP analysis was performed on cells from three independent experiments on separate days and then pooled to obtain sufficient numbers of focal adhesions for analysis. Src inhibition with PP2 (Sigma) was achieved by incubation with 2 μm PP2 overnight before analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Time-lapse images of transfected cells at low confluence in a 35-mm plastic dish were captured using an ORCA ERG cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu SDR Clinical Technology, NSW, Australia) and an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a 37 °C environmental chamber. Transmitted light images of transfected cells (identified by initial single fluorescence image) were captured every 5 min over 6 h. Cells undergoing division or apoptosis were excluded from analysis. Nuclear translocation was tracked in the time-lapse image stacks using Metamorph V6.3 software (Molecular Devices). We first confirmed that NEDD9 localization to focal adhesions does not require Src kinase activity by transfecting Src−/− MEFs with GFP-tagged NEDD9. NEDD9 robustly localized to focal adhesions in a similar pattern to that observed in NEDD9−/− MEFs, with strong concordance between the focal adhesion marker paxillin and GFP.NEDD9 subcellular distribution (Fig. 1A). NEDD9 is detected as two phospho forms by Western blot (21.Law S.F. Zhang Y.Z. Klein-Szanto A.J. Golemis E.A. Cell cycle-regulated processing of HEF1 to multiple protein forms differentially targeted to multiple subcellular compartments.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Liu X. Elia A.E. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. Farley J. Wang T. A novel ability of Smad3 to regulate proteasomal degradation of a Cas family member HEF1.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6759-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and exogenous GFP.NEDD9 similarly produces a doublet in NEDD9−/− and Src−/− MEFs (Fig. 1A). The small decrease in the upper form of NEDD9 in the Src−/− MEFS was inconsistent between experiments (data not shown). We next compared GFP-tagged NEDD9 exchange at focal adhesions between Src−/− and NEDD9−/− MEFs by FRAP. For uniformity, all analyses were focused on focal adhesions in regions of protruding cell membrane. Notably, the recovery of GFP.NEDD9 appeared faster in the Src −/− MEFs (Fig. 1, B and C). Quantification of recovery rates confirmed that they were indeed significantly faster (Fig. 1D). To discount the possibility that the differences seen might be due to different cell backgrounds (Src−/− versus NEDD9−/− MEFs) GFP.NEDD9 recovery was next measured in NEDD9−/− MEFs treated with PP2, a chemical inhibitor of Src kinase. Importantly, NEDD9 fluorescence recovery in the presence of PP2 was significantly increased when compared with untreated NEDD9 −/− MEFs (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the Src−/− MEFs express endogenous NEDD9, to rule out that the difference reflects changes in the total amount of NEDD9 protein, we next compared the dynamics of GFP.NEDD9 in NEDD−/− MEFs versus matched wild-type MEFs. This revealed identical recovery kinetics between the NEDD9−/−MEFs and the wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1E). Together these data suggest an important role for Src in determining NEDD9 exchange at focal adhesions. For comparison, we examined GFP.NEDD9 with the C-terminal domain deleted (NEDD9.ΔCT). This domain encompasses the focal adhesion targeting domain (23.Arold S.T. Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E. The structural basis of localization and signaling by the focal adhesion targeting domain.Structure. 2002; 10: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and is required for focal adhesion localization (24.O'Neill G.M. Golemis E.A. Proteolysis of the docking protein HEF1 and implications for focal adhesion dynamics.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5094-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with mCherry-tagged paxillin to identify the focal adhesion region of interest for photobleaching (Fig. 2, A and B). As anticipated, the NEDD9.ΔCT construct exhibited faster exchange in the region of the focal adhesions (Fig. 2, C and D). However, this did not simply reflect free diffusion, as the same analysis of unfused GFP at focal adhesions marked by mCherry paxillin showed an ∼10-fold higher exchange rate (GFPNEDD9.ΔCT K = 0.35 ± 0.018 versus GFP K = 2.98 ± 0.24; ***, p < 0.001, Student's t test). Consequently, despite the lack of the focal adhesion targeting domain (thereby abrogating GFP-positive adhesions), the molecular dynamics were slowed around the focal adhesion relative to unfused GFP. Together these data suggest that localization (concentrated appearance at a focal adhesion) is separable from the rate of exchange between the focal adhesion juxtamembrane region and the cytoplasm. Src stimulates focal adhesion turnover (10.Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. FAK-Src signalling through paxillin, ERK and MLCK regulates adhesion disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) and regulates actin filament dynamics (25.Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. v-Src's hold over actin and cell adhesions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), in turn controlling actomyosin force that determines adhesion molecule exchange (3.Goetz J.G. Bidirectional control of the inner dynamics of focal adhesions promotes cell migration.Cell Adh. Migr. 2009; 3: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Potentially, therefore, faster NEDD9 exchange in the absence of Src activity may have been secondary to altered actin filament dynamics or Src-dependent focal adhesion turnover. To rule this out we quantified the role of the two direct NEDD9 Src target sites: the SBD (DYDY) and the SH2BD (26.O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Integrin signalling: a new Cas(t) of characters enters the stage.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). First, the SBD tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine to prevent phosphorylation (DFDF) (Fig. 3A). Note that NEDD9 does not contain the additional Src SH3 binding that forms the Src bipartite binding domain in other Cas family proteins (13.Singh M. Cowell L. Seo S. O'Neill G. Golemis E. Molecular basis for HEF1/NEDD9/Cas-L action as a multifunctional coordinator of invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 48: 54-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and so only binds Src via the tyrosine motif. NEDD9.DFDF generates the same doublet pattern on Western blot as seen for the wild-type sequence (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence confirmed co-localization of the mutant protein with paxillin-positive focal adhesions at the cell periphery and ventral surface (Fig. 3B). FRAP analysis of GFP.NEDD9.DFDF positive focal adhesions revealed a significantly increased fluorescence recovery rate compared with wild-type NEDD9 (Fig. 4, A–C). Thus phosphorylation of the DYDY motif and subsequent Src kinase docking may slow the rate of NEDD9 molecular exchange at focal adhesions.FIGURE 4NEDD9 Src SH2 binding motif and substrate binding domain mediate molecular exchange.

As this also deletes the NEDD9 antibody binding epitope, anti-p130Cas antibodies, which bind a conserved epitope (19.Law S.F. O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Einarson M.B. Golemis E.A. The docking protein HEF1 is an apoptotic mediator at focal adhesion sites.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5184-5195Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), were used to confirm expression of the truncated protein (Fig. 3A). Importantly, loss of the substrate binding domain does not affect NEDD9 targeting to the focal adhesions (Fig. 3B). GFP-tagged NEDD9ΔSH2BD co-localized at all regions of paxillin-positive focal adhesions (Fig. 3B). FRAP analysis of this construct revealed a striking increase in the rate of fluorescence recovery (Fig. 4, A–C). Notably, this was also significantly faster than the recovery rate of NEDD9.DFDF (Fig. 4C). We then questioned whether the NEDD9 mutant proteins exhibited an altered mobile fraction, defined as the maximum plateau of fluorescence recovery. Although analysis revealed a significant difference between the maximum plateaus of the NEDD9ΔSH2BD versus NEDD9.DFDF and NEDD9 (Fig. 4D), the magnitude of the difference was very small (80 and 82% versus 80 and 79%). Thus in each case ∼20% of the total pool remains immobile, agreeing with earlier descriptions of the stable focal adhesion fraction over a similar time course (27.Wolfenson H. Lubelski A. Regev T. Klafter J. Henis Y.I. Geiger B. A role for the juxtamembrane cytoplasm in the molecular dynamics of focal adhesions.PloS ONE. 2009; 4: e4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Notably, the difference between GFP.NEDD9 in the NEDD9−/− MEFs versus the Src−/− MEFs was considerably larger (Fig. 1C). The relatively smaller difference between the mutant forms and the PP2-treated cells with wild-type NEDD9 suggests differences observed in the Src−/− MEFs may be cell type-specific and suggest that the most important effects of Src may be on exchange. Our data suggest a hierarchy of Src kinase effects; the substrate binding domain has the greatest effects on NEDD9 dynamics at focal adhesions, whereas the Src SH2 binding motif has a more limited role. Given the differences in molecular exchange between wild-type NEDD9, NEDD9ΔCT, NEDD9.DFDF, and NEDD9ΔSH2BD, we questioned whether these differences might reflect differential interaction with NEDD9 partner molecules. As FAK is a well established partner of NEDD9 (13.Singh M. Cowell L. Seo S. O'Neill G. Golemis E. Molecular basis for HEF1/NEDD9/Cas-L action as a multifunctional coordinator of invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 48: 54-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), FAK interaction with each of the NEDD9 constructs was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. This revealed that NEDD9, NEDD9.DFDF, and NEDD9ΔSH2BD show equivalent and robust interaction with FAK (Fig. 5A). By contrast, considerably less FAK co-immunoprecipitates with NEDD9ΔCT. Thus we next confirmed that FAK is required for NEDD9 targeting to focal adhesions by analyzing GFP.NEDD9 subcellular distribution in FAK−/− fibroblasts. This revealed that GFP.NEDD9 does not target to focal adhesions in the absence of FAK expression (Fig. 5B). Importantly, exogenous expression of FAK restores NEDD9 targeting to focal adhesions (Fig. 5B). Finally, FRAP analysis of NEDD9ΔCT in the FAK−/− fibroblasts revealed that in the absence of FAK, this truncated protein now diffuses freely in the region of focal adhesions, with rates of recovery ∼3-fold faster than those seen in the NEDD9−/− fibroblasts that endogenously express FAK (Fig. 5, C and D). Based on these findings we suggest that the interaction between NEDD9ΔCT and FAK may attenuate NEDD9ΔCT dynamics but requires the NEDD9 C-terminal domain to anchor NEDD9 at the focal adhesions. Next we questioned the effect of the altered rates of molecular exchange on focal adhesion morphology and signaling. Comparison of the total number of focal adhesions revealed that neither NEDD9.DFDF nor NEDD9ΔSH2BD altered the number of focal adhesions per cell (Fig. 6, A and B). However, focal adhesions in cells expressing NEDD9ΔSH2BD were significantly larger (Fig. 6C). To investigate whether expression of the NEDD9 mutant constructs altered focal adhesion signaling, we analyzed paxillin phosphorylation at focal adhesions.

https://openalex.org/W2026205533,"Numerous features make Mycobacterium bovis BCG an attractive vaccine vector for HIV. It has a good safety profile, it elicits long-lasting cellular immune responses and in addition manufacturing costs are affordable. Despite these advantages it is often difficult to express viral antigens in BCG, which results in genetic instability and low immunogenicity. The aim of this study was to generate stable recombinant BCG (rBCG) that express high levels of HIV antigens, by modification of the HIV genes. A directed evolution process was applied to recombinant mycobacteria that expressed HIV-1 Gag fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Higher growth rates and increased GFP expression were selected for. Through this process a modified Gag antigen was selected. Recombinant BCG that expressed the modified Gag (BCG[pWB106] and BCG[pWB206]) were more stable, produced higher levels of antigen and grew faster than those that expressed the unmodified Gag (BCG[pWB105]). The recombinant BCG that expressed the modified HIV-1 Gag induced 2 to 3 fold higher levels of Gag-specific CD4 T cells than those expressing the unmodified Gag (BCG[pWB105]). Mice primed with 107 CFU BCG[pWB206] and then boosted with MVA-Gag developed Gag-specific CD8 T cells with a frequency of 1343±17 SFU/106 splenocytes, 16 fold greater than the response induced with MVA-Gag alone. Levels of Gag-specific CD4 T cells were approximately 5 fold higher in mice primed with BCG[pWB206] and boosted with MVA-Gag than in those receiving the MVA-Gag boost alone. In addition mice vaccinated with BCG[pWB206] were protected from a surrogate vaccinia virus challenge."

The aim of the current study was to identify possible submicroscopic genomic alterations using a high-density chromosomal microarray in a retrospective cohort of patients with otherwise undiagnosable intellectual disabilities referred by doctors from the public health system in Central Brazil. The CytoScan HD technology was used to detect changes in the genome copy number variation of patients who had intellectual disability and a normal karyotype. The analysis detected 18 CNVs in 60% of patients. Pathogenic CNVs represented about 22%, so it was possible to propose the etiology of intellectual disability for these patients. Likely pathogenic and unknown clinical significance CNVs represented 28% and 50%, respectively. Inherited and de novo CNVs were equally distributed. We report the nature of CNVs in patients from Central Brazil, representing a population not yet screened by microarray technologies."

NO-aspirin is a novel drug that has efficacy against a number of solid tumours, and can inhibit Wnt signaling, and although we have shown Wnt signaling to be important for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell proliferation and survival inhibition of Wnt signaling does not appear to be involved in the induction of ALL cell death. Treatment of B lineage ALL cell lines and patient ALL cells with NO-aspirin induced rapid apoptotic cell death mediated via the extrinsic death pathway. Apoptosis was dependent on caspase-10 in association with the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) incorporating pro-caspase-10 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1). There was no measurable increase in TNF-R1 or TNF-α in response to NO-aspirin, suggesting that the process was ligand-independent. Consistent with this, expression of silencer of death domain (SODD) was reduced following NO-aspirin exposure and lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of SODD suppressed expansion of transduced cells confirming the importance of SODD for ALL cell survival. Considering that SODD and caspase-10 are frequently over-expressed in ALL, interfering with these proteins may provide a new strategy for the treatment of this and potentially other cancers."

Based on a chlorpyrifos-degrading fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides strain Hu-01 (collection number: CCTCC M 20711), a fungal wettable powder preparation was developed aiming to efficiently remove chlorpyrifos residues from vegetables. The formula was determined to be 11.0% of carboxymethyl cellulose-Na, 9.0% of polyethylene glycol 6000, 5.0% of primary alcohol ethoxylate, 2.5% of glycine, 5.0% of fucose, 27.5% of kaolin and 40% of freeze dried fungi by response surface methodology (RSM). The results of quality inspection indicated that the fungal preparation could reach manufacturing standards. Finally, the degradation of chlorpyrifos by this fungal preparation was determined on pre-harvest cabbage. Compared to the controls without fungal preparation, the degradation of chlorpyrifos on cabbages, which was sprayed with the fungal preparation, was up to 91% after 7 d.

Intensive sampling was conducted on thirty cows (n = 15/group). Multiple saliva, vaginal mucus and blood samples were collected around parturition and analyzed for total immunoglobulin-(Ig)A, plasma serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), anti-LPS IgA, IgG, IgM, tumour necrosis factor(TNF)-α, and interleukin(IL)-1. Results regarding total secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies showed greater concentrations in the saliva and an overall tendency for higher total sIgA in the vaginal mucus of the LPS-treated cows. Treatment had no effect on plasma sIgA, IgG, IgM anti-LPS antibodies, haptoglobin, SAA, LBP, TNF-α, and IL-1. Treatments by time interactions were observed for SAA and IL-1 with lowered concentrations of both variables in the plasma of LPS-treated cows after parturition. Overall, repeated oronasal LPS treatment clearly enhanced total sIgA antibodies in the saliva, stimulated their production in vaginal mucus shortly before calving, and lowered plasma IL-1 around parturition, but showed limited effects on markers of the acute phase response in the plasma in dairy cows around parturition."

However, tilt illusion magnitude remained unchanged before and after orientation training, at either trained or untrained orientations.
