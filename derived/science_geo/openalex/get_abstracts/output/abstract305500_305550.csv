https://openalex.org/W1967851076,"Three ice cores to bedrock from the Dunde ice cap on the north-central Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China provide a detailed record of Holocene and Wisconsin-Würm late glacial stage (LGS) climate changes in the subtropics. The records reveal that LGS conditions were apparently colder, wetter, and dustier than Holocene conditions. The LGS part of the cores is characterized by more negative δ18O ratios, increased dust content, decreased soluble aerosol concentrations, and reduced ice crystal sizes than the Holocene part. These changes occurred rapidly ∼10,000 years ago. In addition, the last 60 years were apparently one of the warmest periods in the entire record, equalling levels of the Holocene maximum between 6000 and 8000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2021729230,"A nearly complete spider spinneret was found in Middle Devonian rocks (about 385 to 380 million years old) near Gilboa, New York. This is the earliest evidence yet discovered for silk production from opisthosomal spigots, and therefore for spiders. Two previously known Devonian fossils described as spiders lack any apomorphies of the order Araneae and are probably not spiders. The spigots of the Devonian spinneret resemble those of members of the living suborder Mesothelae, but the number of spigots and their distribution are like those of members of the suborder Opisthothelae, infraorder Mygalomorphae. The Devonian spider belonged to a clade that may be the sister group of all other spiders, of Mesothelae, or of Opisthothelae."

The present understanding of both natural and artificially initiated (triggered) lightning is reviewed, and suggestions are given for future research that can improve our understanding both of the physics of lightning and the parameters that are important for protection."
https://openalex.org/W2037401098,"Measured concentrations of CO2, O2, and related chemical species in a section across the Florida Straits and in the open Atlantic Ocean at approximately 25°N, have been combined with estimates of oceanic mass transport to estimate both the gross transport of CO2 by the ocean at this latitude and the net CO2 flux from exchange with the atmosphere. The northward flux was 63.9 × 106 moles per second (mol/s); the southward flux was 64.6 × 106 mol/s. These values yield a net CO2 flux of 0.7 × 106 mol/s (0.26 ± 0.03 gigaton of C per year) southward. The North Atlantic Ocean has been considered to be a strong sink for atmospheric CO2, yet these results show that the net flux in 1988 across 25°N was small. For O2 the equivalent signal is 4.89 × 106 mol/s northward and 6.97 × 106 mol/s southward, and the net transport is 2.08 × 106 mol/s or three times the net CO2 flux. These data suggest that the North Atlantic Ocean is today a relatively small sink for atmospheric CO2, in spite of its large heat loss, but a larger sink for O2 because of the additive effects of chemical and thermal pumping on the CO2 cycle but their near equal and opposite effects on the CO2 cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2017262578,"Near-infrared images of the Venus night side show bright contrast features that move from east to west, in the direction of the cloud-top atmospheric superrotation. Recently acquired images of the Venus night side along with earlier spectroscopic observations allow identification of the mechanisms that produce these features, their level of formation, and the wind velocities at those levels. The features are detectable only at wavelengths near 1.74 and 2.3 micrometers, in narrow atmospheric windows between the CO2 and H2O bands. The brightest features have brightness temperatures near 480 Kelvin, whereas the darkest features are more than 50 Kelvin cooler. Several factors suggest that this radiation is emitted by hot gases at altitudes below 35 kilometers in the Venus atmosphere. The feature contrasts are produced as this thermal radiation passes through a higher, cooler, atmospheric layer that has horizontal variations in transparency. The 6.5-day east-west rotation period of the features indicates that equatorial wind speeds are near 70 meters per second in this upper layer. Similar wind speeds have been measured by entry probes and balloons at altitudes between 50 and 55 kilometers in the middle cloud layer. The bright features indicate that there are partial clearings in this cloud deck. The presence of these clearings could decrease the efficiency of the atmospheric greenhouse that maintains the high surface temperatures on Venus."

https://openalex.org/W2011870439,"A calculation of the mass of an electron,
based upon the modification of electromagnetic
theory proposed in a recent paper, has led to
the surprising result that the mass inside an
electron in uniform motion, when calculated
from the momentum, is equal but opposite in
sign to the mass outside."

https://openalex.org/W2140316261,"THAT physical science is constantly rendering most magnificent service to human life was never more dramatically demonstrated than on the occasion of the recent wreck of the steamship Republic. That a ship, disabled and hidden in a dense fog, was yet able to summon to its aid another ship a hundred miles away by an inaudible, invisible, yet infallible means of communication, thereby saving many hundred lives, is a feat that would have been pronounced impossible by our grandfathers if not by ourselves but a few years ago. Had Mr. Binns, the operator of the wireless telegraph on the Republic, lived near Boston about two hundred and twenty years ago, he would surely have been burned for witchcraft. So thick and fast have come such contributions of science to our commercial and economic life, that most people now take them as a matter of course. A telephone is at present almost as much of a household necessity as a kitchen stove. The steam engine and the electric motor, since by their aid ten men can do the work of one hundred, are increasing our potential manufacturing population at a rate that must satisfy even President Roosevelt that we are in no immediate danger of dying out as a nation. Musicians are being replaced by arc lights, or by pianolas; and even teachers are being compelled to yield their divine calling to graphophones in the teaching of foreign languages. Are we then surprised that this is called a scientific age? Do we wonder that scientists are 1Address delivered at the Fourth Annual Conference of the Schools of Vermont with the University of Vermont, March 12, 1909. I -. . _ -_. I --"
