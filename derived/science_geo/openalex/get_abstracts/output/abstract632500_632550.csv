https://openalex.org/W2942861472,"Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death, is triggered by oxidative stress in cancer, heat stress in plants, and hemorrhagic stroke. A homeostatic transcriptional response to ferroptotic stimuli is unknown. We show that neurons respond to ferroptotic stimuli by induction of selenoproteins, including antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Pharmacological selenium (Se) augments GPX4 and other genes in this transcriptional program, the selenome, via coordinated activation of the transcription factors TFAP2c and Sp1 to protect neurons. Remarkably, a single dose of Se delivered into the brain drives antioxidant GPX4 expression, protects neurons, and improves behavior in a hemorrhagic stroke model. Altogether, we show that pharmacological Se supplementation effectively inhibits GPX4-dependent ferroptotic death as well as cell death induced by excitotoxicity or ER stress, which are GPX4 independent. Systemic administration of a brain-penetrant selenopeptide activates homeostatic transcription to inhibit cell death and improves function when delivered after hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke."

Here, we report a synergy between shape-generating processes in the cell interior and the external organization and composition of the cell-surface glycocalyx. Mucin biopolymers and long-chain polysaccharides within the glycocalyx can generate entropic forces that favor or disfavor the projection of spherical and finger-like extensions from the cell surface. A polymer brush model of the glycocalyx successfully predicts the effects of polymer size and cell-surface density on membrane morphologies. Specific glycocalyx compositions can also induce plasma membrane instabilities to generate more exotic undulating and pearled membrane structures and drive secretion of extracellular vesicles. Together, our results suggest a fundamental role for the glycocalyx in regulating curved membrane features that serve in communication between cells and with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2942504068,"Varying pH of luminal fluid along the female reproductive tract is a physiological cue that modulates sperm motility. CatSper is a sperm-specific, pH-sensitive calcium channel essential for hyperactivated motility and male fertility. Multi-subunit CatSper channel complexes organize linear Ca2+ signaling nanodomains along the sperm tail. Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 9 (EFCAB9) as a bifunctional, cytoplasmic machine modulating the channel activity and the domain organization of CatSper. Knockout mice studies demonstrate that EFCAB9, in complex with the CatSper subunit, CATSPERζ, is essential for pH-dependent and Ca2+-sensitive activation of the CatSper channel. In the absence of EFCAB9, sperm motility and fertility is compromised, and the linear arrangement of the Ca2+ signaling domains is disrupted. EFCAB9 interacts directly with CATSPERζ in a Ca2+-dependent manner and dissociates at elevated pH. These observations suggest that EFCAB9 is a long-sought, intracellular, pH-dependent Ca2+ sensor that triggers changes in sperm motility."

The proteins comprising this intrinsic retinal visual cycle are unknown. Here, we show that RGR opsin and retinol dehydrogenase-10 (Rdh10) convert all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol during exposure to visible light. Isolated retinas from Rgr+/+ and Rgr-/- mice were exposed to continuous light, and cone photoresponses were recorded. Cones in Rgr-/- retinas lost sensitivity at a faster rate than cones in Rgr+/+ retinas. A similar effect was seen in Rgr+/+ retinas following treatment with the glial cell toxin, α-aminoadipic acid. These results show that RGR opsin is a critical component of the Müller cell visual cycle and that regeneration of cone visual pigment can be driven by light."
https://openalex.org/W2944091076,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory skin disease resulting in non-healing wounds affecting body areas of high hair follicle and sweat gland density. The pathogenesis of HS is not well understood but appears to involve dysbiosis-driven aberrant activation of the innate immune system leading to excessive inflammation. Marked dysregulation of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) in HS is observed, which may contribute to this sustained inflammation. Here, we analyzed HS skin transcriptomes from previously published studies and integrated these findings through a comparative analysis with a published wound healing data set and with immunofluorescence and qPCR analysis from new HS patient samples. Among the top differently expressed genes between lesional and non-lesional HS skin were members of the S100 family as well as dermcidin, the latter known as a sweat gland-associated AMP and one of the most downregulated genes in HS lesions. Interestingly, many genes associated with sweat gland function, such as secretoglobins and aquaporin 5, were decreased in HS lesional skin and we discovered that these genes demonstrated opposite expression profiles in healing skin. Conversely, HS lesional and wounded skin shared a common gene signature including genes encoding for S100 proteins, defensins, and genes encoding antiviral proteins. Overall, our results suggest that the pathogenesis of HS may be driven by changes in AMP expression and altered sweat gland function, and may share a similar pathology with chronic wounds."
https://openalex.org/W2952746737,"Developing high yielding rice varieties that are tolerant to drought stress is crucial for the sustainable livelihood of rice farmers in rainfed rice cropping ecosystems. Genomic selection (GS) promises to be an effective breeding option for these complex traits. We evaluated the effectiveness of two rather new options in the implementation of GS: trait and environment-specific marker selection and the use of multi-environment prediction models. A reference population of 280 rainfed lowland accessions endowed with 215k SNP markers data was phenotyped under a favorable and two managed drought environments. Trait-specific SNP subsets (28k) were selected for each trait under each environment, using results of GWAS performed with the complete genotype dataset. Performances of single-environment and multi-environment genomic prediction models were compared using kernel regression based methods (GBLUP and RKHS) under two cross validation scenarios: availability (CV2) or not (CV1) of phenotypic data for the validation set, in one of the environments. Trait-specific marker selection strategy achieved predictive ability (PA) of genomic prediction up to 22% higher than markers selected on the bases of neutral linkage disequilibrium (LD). Tolerance to drought stress was up to 32% better predicted by multi-environment models (especially RKHS based models) under CV2 strategy. Under the less favorable CV1 strategy, the multi-environment models achieved similar PA than the single-environment predictions. We also showed that reasonable PA could be obtained with as few as 3,000 SNP markers, even in a population of low LD extent, provided marker selection is based on pairwise LD. The implications of these findings for breeding for drought tolerance are discussed. The most resource sparing option would be accurate phenotyping of the reference population in a favorable environment and under a managed drought, while the candidate population would be phenotyped only under one of those environments."
https://openalex.org/W2942818855,"A key function of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is to bridge events that are discontinuous in time, and it has been proposed that medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) supports memory retention by sustaining the sequential activity of hippocampal time cells. Therefore, we recorded hippocampal neuronal activity during spatial working memory and asked whether time cells depend on mEC inputs. Working memory was impaired in rats with mEC lesions, but the occurrence of time cells and of trajectory-coding cells in the stem did not differ from controls. Rather, the main effect of mEC lesions was an extensive spatial coding deficit of CA1 cells, which included inconsistency over time and reduced firing differences between positions on the maze. Therefore, mEC is critical for providing stable and distinct spatial information to hippocampus, while working memory (WM) maintenance is likely supported either by local synaptic plasticity in hippocampus or by activity patterns elsewhere in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2943959904,"To compare axonal loss in ganglion cells detected with swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) in eyes of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus healthy controls using different machine learning techniques. To analyze the capability of machine learning techniques to improve the detection of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the complex Ganglion Cell Layer-Inner plexiform layer (GCL+) damage in patients with multiple sclerosis and to use the SS-OCT as a biomarker to early predict this disease.Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (n = 80) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 180) were enrolled. Different protocols from the DRI SS-OCT Triton system were used to obtain the RNFL and GCL+ thicknesses in both eyes. Macular and peripapilar areas were analyzed to detect the zones with higher thickness decrease. The performance of different machine learning techniques (decision trees, multilayer perceptron and support vector machine) for identifying RNFL and GCL+ thickness loss in patients with MS were evaluated. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to display the ability of the different tests to discriminate between MS and healthy eyes in our population.Machine learning techniques provided an excellent tool to predict MS disease using SS-OCT data. In particular, the decision trees obtained the best prediction (97.24%) using RNFL data in macular area and the area under the ROC curve was 0.995, while the wide protocol which covers an extended area between macula and papilla gave an accuracy of 95.3% with a ROC of 0.998. Moreover, it was obtained that the most significant area of the RNFL to predict MS is the macula just surrounding the fovea. On the other hand, in our study, GCL+ did not contribute to predict MS and the different machine learning techniques performed worse in this layer than in RNFL.Measurements of RNFL thickness obtained with SS-OCT have an excellent ability to differentiate between healthy controls and patients with MS. Thus, the use of machine learning techniques based on these measures can be a reliable tool to help in MS diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2944214465,"It is well established that low resource environments early in life can predispose children to adverse health and compromised developmental outcomes. We explore possible mechanistic pathways underlying poor developmental outcomes in children growing up in a low resource setting in urban Bangladesh. We tested associations between psychosocial risks, namely maternal distress and poor caregiving experiences, and biological risks, namely poor growth (HAZ) and inflammation (C-reactive protein: CRP), and children’s developmental outcomes. Child development was measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at 6 and 27 months in one cohort, and using the MSEL and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 36 and 60 months respectively in another cohort. In the younger cohort, we found that more inflammation (estimated by the child’s CRP level at four months) predicted lower receptive language scores at 6 months, while more frequent caregiving interactions predicted higher receptive language scores at 6 months. In the older cohort, we found that at 27 months, a child’s growth measured by his or her current HAZ was positively associated with gross motor, visual reception, receptive language, and expressive language scores. In the oldest cohort, we found that higher HAZ and more frequent stimulating activities in the home predicted higher motor and language scores, whereas more inflammation (as estimated by CRP over the first two years of life) predicted lower motor scores at 36 months. At 60 months, we found that HAZ and caregiving experiences were positively associated with verbal IQ, whereas inflammation was negatively associated with verbal IQ. This work identifies malnutrition, inflammation, and caregiving as potential sites of intervention to improve neurodevelopment in children growing up in global poverty."
https://openalex.org/W2944487182,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the leading causes of death worldwide. Since only a subset of CAD patients develops myocardial infarction, it is likely that unique factors predispose to AMI. Circulating microRNAs represent diagnostic powerful biomarkers for detection of heart injuries and patients’ risk stratification. Using an array-based approach, the expression of 84 circulating miRNAs was analyzed in plasma of pooled stable CAD patients (CAD; n = 5) and unstable CAD patients (AMI_T0; n = 5) enrolled within 24 hours from an AMI event. The array experiments showed 27 miRNAs differentially expressed with a two-fold up- or down-regulation (10 up- and 17 down-regulated miRNAs). Among them, miR-423-5p dis-regulation was confirmed in a larger case study (n = 99). Circulating miR-423-5p resulted to be significantly down-regulated within 24 hours from the AMI event (FC = -2, p≤0.05). Interestingly, miR-423-5p expression resulted to be increased (FC = +2; p≤0.005) in a subgroup of the same AMI patients (AMI_T1; n = 11) analyzed after 6 months from the acute event. We extended miR-423-5p expression study on PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), confirming also in this tissue its up-regulation at 6 months post-AMI. Receiver operating characteristic analyses (ROC) were performed to detect the power of miR-423-5p to discriminate stable and unstable CAD. In plasma, miR-423-5p expression accurately distinguishes stable and unstable CAD patients (AUC = 0.7143, p≤0.005). Interestingly, the highest discriminatory value (AUC = 0.8529 p≤0.0005) was identified in blood cells, where miR-423-5p expression is able to differentiate unstable CAD patients during an acute event (AMI_T0) from those at six months post-AMI (AMI_T1). Furthermore, cellular miR-423-5p may discriminate also stable CAD patients from unstable CAD patients after six months post-AMI (AUC = 0.7355 p≤0.05). The results of this pilot-study suggest that miR-423-5p expression level both in plasma and blood cells, could represent a new promising biomarker for risk stratification of CAD patients."

One strategy is to continuously adjust the sensitivity of neurons to suppress responses to common features of the input while enhancing responses to new ones. Here we image the excitatory synaptic inputs and outputs of retinal ganglion cells to understand how such dynamic predictive coding is implemented in the analysis of spatial patterns. Synapses of bipolar cells become tuned to orientation through presynaptic inhibition, generating lateral antagonism in the orientation domain. Individual ganglion cells receive excitatory synapses tuned to different orientations, but feedforward inhibition generates a high-pass filter that only transmits the initial activation of these inputs, removing redundancy.

These results demonstrate how a dynamic predictive code can be implemented by circuit motifs common to many parts of the brain. A general principle in understanding the design of sensory systems is the need to encode information efficiently which, in turn, requires removal of redundancies in the signal received from the outside world (Barlow, 1961Barlow H.B. Possible principles underlying the transformations of sensory messages.in: Rosenblith W.A. Sensory Communication. MIT Press, 1961: 217-234Google Scholar, Fairhall et al., 2001Fairhall A.L. Lewen G.D.

Laughlin S.B. Principles of Neural Design. MIT Press, 2015Crossref Google Scholar). This principle helps us understand why the retina does not operate simply like a camera conveying a stream of intensity values for each pixel. Natural images contain a large amount of redundant information because pixels nearby in space and/or time tend to be correlated (Atick and Redlich, 1992Atick J.J. Redlich A.N.

Real and optimal neural images in early vision.Nature. 1992; 360: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rather than continuously transmitting the presence of an unchanging visual input, many retinal neurons preferentially signal deviations from the local image statistics, such as regions of contrast or the sudden movement of an object. Such computations are direct reflections of spatial receptive fields with antagonistic surrounds and temporal receptive fields signaling changes in light intensity. Representing information by ignoring statistical regularities to highlight unusual components is termed predictive coding, an approach widely used in informatics to, for instance, compress images (Kingston and Autrusseau, 2008Kingston A.

Predictive coding can be a dynamic process, consistent with the animal’s need to adjust to sensory environments with different statistics (Sharpee et al., 2006Sharpee T.O. Sugihara H. Kurgansky A.V.

For instance, the retina can adjust within seconds to changes in the variance in light intensity (contrast), and this occurs through changes in the strength of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B.

Further, some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) implement a dynamic predictive code (DPC) by rapidly altering their sensitivity to orientation in response to changes in the distribution of spatial correlations, becoming less sensitive to orientations that are common features of the input and more sensitive to orientations that are uncommon (Gollisch and Meister, 2010Gollisch T.

The neural circuitry by which the visual system implements a DPC is not understood, either in the retina (Kastner and Baccus, 2014Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Insights from the retina into the diverse and general computations of adaptation, detection, and prediction.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 25: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or in the cortex (Benucci et al., 2013Benucci A. Saleem A.B. Carandini M.

Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). One model proposes construction of a modifiable pattern detector that is fed by an array of excitatory subunits, each one tuned to a different stimulus pattern; when one of these detector subunits is driven strongly, it depresses and makes a smaller contribution to the activity of the output neuron, which therefore becomes more sensitive to other, rarer, patterns (Bastos et al., 2012Bastos A.M.

Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This model is attractive but is not thought to operate in the retina because bipolar cells providing excitatory inputs to RGCs do not appear to be sensitive to orientation (Hosoya et al., 2005Hosoya T. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis of “network plasticity” has therefore been proposed, in which the locus of the adaptive changes are the synapses RGCs receive from the inhibitory amacrine cells, with these synapses obeying an anti-Hebbian plasticity rule that strengthens them when they are co-activated with the RGC (Hosoya et al., 2005Hosoya T. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this scheme, a vertically orientated stimulus will strengthen inhibitory inputs above and below the RGC, making it more sensitive to horizontal orientations. To identify the circuit mechanisms generating dynamic predictive coding of spatial patterns, we used an optical approach based on the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (Marvin et al., 2013Marvin J.S. Borghuis B.G. Tian L. Cichon J. Harnett M.T. Akerboom J. Gordus A. Renninger S.L. Chen T.W. Bargmann C.I. et al.An optimized fluorescent probe for visualizing glutamate neurotransmission.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) to compare the synaptic output from individual RGCs with the excitatory synaptic inputs they receive from an array of bipolar cells. We probed these synapses using gratings of different orientations and found that many are strongly tuned to orientation through lateral antagonism in the orientation domain. Further, a subset of RGCs was driven by a mixture of excitatory synapses tuned to different orientations, providing the basic connectivity for a modifiable pattern detector. The nulling of a constant input is then generated through at least two mechanisms: depression of excitatory synapses and fast feedforward inhibition (FFI). The basic features of this circuit are found in many other parts of the brain and may provide a general design for the dynamic tuning of neurons and removal of redundancy. The signals RGCs deliver to the brain depend on the integration of a variety of synaptic inputs, often with mixed properties. Understanding how the activity of these inputs determines the output of the neuron has been difficult because individual synapses on a dendrite cannot be isolated using electrophysiology (Branco and Häusser, 2011Branco T. Häusser M. Synaptic integration gradients in single cortical pyramidal cell dendrites.Neuron. 2011; 69: 885-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2017Schmidt-Hieber C.

Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we used in vivo imaging in larval zebrafish expressing iGluSnFR over the surface of subsets of RGCs (Figure 1A). Visual stimuli generated “hotspots” of iGluSnFR fluorescence on dendrites (Figure 1B), and these displayed many of the functional properties expected of glutamate release from the synapses of bipolar cells, such as adaptation to contrast (Marvin et al., 2013Marvin J.S. Borghuis B.G. Tian L. Cichon J. Harnett M.T. Akerboom J. Gordus A. Renninger S.L. Chen T.W. Bargmann C.I. et al.An optimized fluorescent probe for visualizing glutamate neurotransmission.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar; Figure 2). The axons of these same RGCs could then be tracked to monitor the signal delivered in the optic tectum, also by release of glutamate (Figure 1A). iGluSnFR signals in the tectum were abolished when the cell body in the retina was ablated, demonstrating that they reflected the synaptic release of glutamate from the imaged neuron rather than spillover from neighboring cells (Figure S1).Figure 2The Output from Individual Bipolar Cells Displays Orientation Selectivity but Not Dynamic Predictive CodingShow full caption(A) Raster plot showing the iGluSnFR signal of 606 bipolar cell inputs to 27 retinal ganglion cells in response to a full-field grating that switched orientation from 90° to 0° (stimulus as in Figure 1).

In contrast, the output of RGCs in the tectum was dominated by a fast process of adaptation in which 90% of the decay occured with a time constant of 0.18 s. We explored changes in tuning to orientation by presenting gratings that continuously reversed contrast at 5 Hz and then switching the orientation from horizontal (90°) to vertical (0°) every 5–10 s. In 144 of 148 RGCs, the first presentation of the grating elicited a strong and transient output simply because of the increase in contrast (Figure 1C; Figure S2). Subsequent shifts in orientation did not elicit a response in 39 of the cells (Figure 1F), but in 107 RGCs it did (Nikolaou et al., 2012Nikolaou N. Lowe A.S. Walker A.S. Abbas F. Hunter P.R. Thompson I.D. Meyer M.P. Parametric functional maps of visual inputs to the tectum.Neuron. 2012; 76: 317-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For instance, the upper red trace in Figure 1E shows a neuron generating a strong response to the vertical grating (R0) but very weak responses to the horizontal grating alone (R90), whereas the lower red trace is a neuron that responds to the horizontal but not the vertical. Of the RGCs whose response varied with orientation, 61 exhibited relatively static tuning, responding more strongly to one orientation and adapting incompletely or not at all (Figure 1E, red traces). These statically tuned RGCs had an orientation-selective index (OSI), defined as |R0-R90|/(|R0|+|R90|), that averaged 0.69 (Figure 1D). The remaining 46 RGCs were qualitatively different in generating a transient glutamatergic output at both the horizontal-to-vertical and vertical-to-horizontal transitions, and three examples are shown by the black traces in Figure 1E. Are RGCs transmitting a signal to the tectum at each change in stimulus orientation becoming retuned, or might they simply be responding to local changes in luminance when the grating is rotated within their receptive field? To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out two tests. First, responses to changes in orientation were measured at two spatial phases of the grating shifted by 45°, and then these were compared with responses to changes in phase (steps of 45°) at a fixed orientation. The example traces in Figure 1E show that recovery of sensitivity to the orthogonal stimulus was very similar at different phases and that a phase change alone usually elicited no response, or else a much smaller response, than the orthogonal stimulus (dashed blue box). The averaged synaptic output to this protocol across all 42 RGCs tested in this way is provided in Figure S2. Again, a subset of RGCs responded to orthogonal stimuli irrespective of phase and in these cells phase changes alone elicited much smaller responses. These results confirm that RGCs responding to all changes in stimulus orientation were dynamically altering their tuning to this feature of the stimulus. Among the 46 RGCs that were dynamically tuned, the response to a shift in orientation depressed by 92.0% ± 0.1% within 0.26 ± 0.31 s, effectively suppressing the transmission of redundant information. Within ∼9 s of this profound adaptation, the neurons had become re-tuned to allow signaling of a future change in stimulus orientation, demonstrating the ability to generate a dynamic predictive code (Hosoya et al., 2005Hosoya T. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, Sharpee et al., 2006Sharpee T.O. Sugihara H. Kurgansky A.V.

Efficient auditory coding.Nature. 2006; 439: 978-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Together, the results in Figure 1 demonstrate that the retina of zebrafish informs the brain of orientated features in the visual world through two functionally distinct groups of RGCs, either dynamically or statically tuned. To investigate how some RGCs dynamically alter their tuning to spatial patterns, we began by asking whether their excitatory inputs might be sensitive to orientation. Electrical recordings in the somata of bipolar cells have not yet revealed any orientation selectivity (Hosoya et al., 2005Hosoya T. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), but it is known that inhibitory inputs to the synaptic compartment can dramatically modify the electrical signal that drives their output (Asari and Meister, 2012Asari H. Meister M. Divergence of visual channels in the inner retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Nikolaev et al., 2013Nikolaev A. Leung K.M. Odermatt B. Lagnado L. Synaptic mechanisms of adaptation and sensitization in the retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By imaging iGluSnFR, we directly assessed the signal transmitted by bipolar cells. The raster plot in Figure 2A shows iGluSnFR signals from 606 synaptic inputs onto the dendrites of 27 RGCs; 47% of these synapses displayed significant orientation selectivity and individual examples are shown in Figure 2B. The distribution of OSIs measured for bipolar cell synapses displayed two distinct populations; the smallest group (30%) had a median OSI of 0.3, but the remaining 70% were almost perfectly selective for one orientation over the orthogonal (Figure 2C). We confirmed this finding by surveying the whole population of bipolar cell synapses using zebrafish expressing a fast version of GCaMP6 fused to synaptopyhsin (Johnston et al., 2014Johnston J. Ding H. Seibel S.H. Esposti F. Lagnado L. Rapid mapping of visual receptive fields by filtered back projection: application to multi-neuronal electrophysiology and imaging.J. Physiol. 2014; 592: 4839-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); ∼25% of these displayed orientation selectivity when tested with either moving bars (Figure S3) or the grating stimulus (Figure S4), and there was a clear preference for vertically oriented stimuli (Figure 3F). These results demonstrate that the analysis of orientation within the zebrafish visual system begins within the synaptic compartment of bipolar cells. The kinetics of the signals encoding orientation within the retina and the optic tectum were profoundly different. Figure 2D compares the averaged output of RGCs displaying dynamic predictive coding (black) with the subset of bipolar cell synapses tuned to the horizontal (red). Bipolar cell outputs declined by an average of 49% over a 10 s period, in general agreement with the kinetics of contrast adaptation at the bipolar cell synapse measured using electrophysiology in slices (Jarsky et al., 2011Jarsky T. Cembrowski M. Logan S.M. Kath W.L. Riecke H. Demb J.B. Singer J.H. A synaptic mechanism for retinal adaptation to luminance and contrast.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11003-11015Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or the optical reporter sypHy in vivo (Nikolaev et al., 2013Nikolaev A. Leung K.M. Odermatt B. Lagnado L.

Encoding of luminance and contrast by linear and nonlinear synapses in the retina.Neuron. 2012; 73: 758-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the output of RGCs adapted completely with a dominant time constant of between 0.17 s and 0.25 s. Although depression intrinsic to bipolar cell synapses will also contribute to nulling the output to a constant signal (Gollisch and Meister, 2010Gollisch T. Meister M. Eye smarter than scientists believed: neural computations in circuits of the retina.Neuron. 2010; 65: 150-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), this process is too slow and incomplete to account for the extent of adaptation in the signal delivered to the tectum (Figure 2D). The rapid “zeroing” of the retinal output in the face of an unchanging visual input is key to removing redundancy in the signal transmitted to the brain, and these results demonstrate that the retina carries out this operation after the bipolar cell synapse. How do bipolar cell outputs become tuned to orientation? Two potential mechanisms that might operate together are shown in Figure 3A. The first involves synapses with asymmetric receptive field centers causing features aligned with the long"
https://openalex.org/W2944786900,"C2H2 zinc finger protein (ZFP) genes have been extensively studied in many organisms and can function as transcription factors and be involved in many biological processes including plant growth and development and stress responses. In the current study, a comprehensive genomics analysis of the C2H2-ZFP genes in B. rapa was performed. A total of 301 B. rapa putative C2H2-ZFP (BrC2H2-ZFP) genes were identified from the available Brassica genome databases, and further characterized through analysis of conserved amino acid residues in C2H2-ZF domains and their organization, subcellular localization, phylogeny, additional domain, chromosomal location, synteny relationship, Ka/Ks ratio, and expression pattern. We also analyzed the expression patterns of eight B. rapa C2H2-ZFP genes under salt and drought stress conditions by using qRT-PCR technique. Our results showed that about one-third of these B. rapa C2H2-ZFP genes were originated from segmental duplication caused by the WGT around 13 to 17 MYA, one-third of them were highly and consecutively expressed in all tested tissues, and 92% of them were located in nucleus by prediction supporting then their functional roles as transcription factors, of which some may play important roles in plant growth and development. The Ka/Ks ratios of 264 orthologous C2H2-ZFP gene pairs between A. thaliana and B. rapa were all, except two, inferior to 1 (varied from 0.0116 to 1.4919, with an average value of 0.3082), implying that these genes had mainly experienced purifying selection during species evolution. The estimated divergence times of the same set of gene pairs ranged from 6.23 to 38.60 MY, with an average value of 18.29 MY, indicating that these gene members have undergone different selective pressures resulting in different evolutionary rates during species evolution. In addition, a few of these B. rapa C2H2-ZFPs were shown to be involved in stress responses in a similar way as their orthologs in A. thaliana. Comparison between A. thaliana and B. rapa orthologous C2H2-ZFP genes showed that the majority of these C2H2-ZFP gene members encodes proteins with conserved subcellular localization and functional domains between the two species but differed in their expression patterns in five tissues or organs. Thus, our study provides valuable information for further functional determination of each C2H2-ZFP gene across the Brassica species, and may help to select the appropriate gene targets for further in-depth studies, and genetic engineering and improvement of Brassica crops."

Their potential utility as a source of RNA for transcriptome studies would greatly enhance population-based cancer studies. Although preliminary studies suggest FFPE tissue may be used for RNA sequencing, the effect of storage time on these specimens needs to be determined. We conducted this study to determine whether RNA in archived FFPE high-grade ovarian serous adenocarcinomas from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries was present in sufficient quantity and quality for RNA-Seq analysis. FFPE tissues, stored from 7 to 32 years, were obtained from three SEER sites. RNA was extracted, quantified, quality assessed, and subjected to RNA-Seq (a whole transcriptome sequencing technology). FFPE specimens stored for longer periods of time had poorer RNA sample quality as indicated by negative correlations between specimen storage time and fragment distribution values (DV). In addition, sample contamination was a common issue among the RNA, with 41 of 67 samples having 5% to 48% bacterial contamination. However, regardless of specimen storage time and bacterial contamination, 60% of the samples yielded data that enabled gene expression quantification, identifying more than 10,000 genes, with the correlations among most biological replicates above 0.7. This study demonstrates that FFPE high-grade ovarian serous adenocarcinomas specimens stored in repositories for up to 32 years and under varying storage conditions are a promising source of RNA for RNA-Seq. We also describe certain caveats to be considered when designing RNA-Seq studies using archived FFPE tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2944253851,"Objectives To investigate the feasibility, diagnostic image quality and radiation dose of 3rd generation dual-source computed tomography (CT) using a tin-filtered 100 kV protocol in patients with suspected acute inflammatory sinus disease. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 109 consecutive patients who underwent CT (Siemens SOMATOM Force, Erlangen, Germany) of the paranasal sinus with a new tin-filtered scan-protocol (Sn100 kV; tube current 35 mAs) using iterative reconstruction. Two readers independently assessed subjective image quality using a five-point Likert scale (1 = excellent, 5 = non-diagnostic). Inter-observer agreement was calculated and expressed as percentage of agreement. Noise was determined for calculation of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Effective radiation dose (ED) was calculated from the dose-length-product (DLP). Results All examinations showed diagnostic image quality regarding evaluation of inflammatory sinus disease. On average, subjective general image quality was rated moderate (= 3) with a percentage of agreement between the observers of 81%. The mean image noise was 14.3 HU. The calculated median SNR was 6.0 for intraorbital fat, and 3.6 for the vitreous body, respectively. The median DLP was 2.1 mGy*cm, resulting in a median ED of 0.012 mSv. Conclusions Taking the study limitations into account, ultra-low-dose tin-filtered CT of the paranasal sinus at a tube voltage of 100 kV utilizing an iterative reconstruction algorithm provides for reliable exclusion of suspected acute inflammatory sinus disease in 100% of the cases."

Differences in methodology have brought into question the comparability of different studies. Using primate mandibular second molars, we investigated the effects of mesh preparation parameters smoothing, cropping, and triangle count/mesh resolution (herein, resolution) on six topographic variables (Dirichlet normal energy, DNE; orientation patch count rotated, OPCR; relief index, RFI; ambient occlusion, portion de ciel visible, PCV; enamel surface area, SA; tooth size) to determine the effects of smoothing, cropping, and triangle count/resolution on topographic values and the relationship between these values and diet. All topographic metrics are sensitive to smoothing, cropping method, and triangle count/resolution. In general, smoothing decreased DNE, OPCR, RFI, and SA, increased PCV, and had no predictable effect on tooth size. Relative to the basin cut off (BCO) cropping method, the entire enamel cap (EEC) method increased RFI, SA, and size, and had no predictable effect on DNE and OPCR. Smoothing and cropping affected DNE/OPCR and surfaces with low triangle counts more than other metrics and surfaces with high triangle counts. There was a positive correlation between DNE/OPCR and triangle count/resolution, and the rate of increase was weakly correlated to diet. PCV tended to converge or decrease with increases in triangle count/resolution, and RFI, SA, and size converged. Finally, there appears to be no optimal triangle count or resolution for predicting diet from this sample, and constant triangle count appeared to perform better than constant resolution for predicting diet."

https://openalex.org/W2944814287,"Background Home visiting programs are implemented in high income countries to improve outcomes for families with young children. Significant resources are invested in such programs and high quality evaluations are important. In the context of research trials, implementation quality is often poorly reported and, when reported, is variable. This paper presents the quality of implementation of the right@home program, a sustained nurse home visiting intervention trialled in Australia, and delivered in a ‘real world’ context through usual child and family health services. right@home is structured around the core Maternal Early Childhood Sustained Home-visiting (MECSH) program, which is a salutogenic, child focused prevention model. Method At each visit right@home practitioners completed a checklist detailing the client unique identifier, date of contact and activities undertaken. These checklists were collated to provide data on intervention dose, retention to program completion at child age 2 years, and visit content, which were compared with the program schedule. Quality of family-provider relationship was measured using the Session Rating Scale. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify clusters of activities and allow qualitative assessment of concordance between program aims and program delivery. Results Of 363 intervention families offered the program, 352 (97·0%) commenced the program and 304 (87·3%) completed the program to child age 2 years. 253 of 352 (71·9%) families who commenced the program received more than 75 percent of scheduled visits including at least one antenatal visit. Families rated the participant-practitioner relationship highly (mean 39.4/40). The factor analysis identified six antenatal and six postnatal components which were concordant with the program aims. Conclusions The right@home program was delivered with higher adherence to program dose, schedule and content, and retention than usually reported in other home visiting research. Program compliance may have resulted from program design (visit schedule, dose, content and delivery flexibility) that was consistent with family aims."
https://openalex.org/W2944129696,"Geometrical cues are known to play a very important role in neuronal growth and the formation of neuronal networks. Here, we present a detailed analysis of axonal growth and dynamics for neuronal cells cultured on patterned polydimethylsiloxane surfaces. We use fluorescence microscopy to image neurons, quantify their dynamics, and demonstrate that the substrate geometrical patterns cause strong directional alignment of axons. We quantify axonal growth and report a general stochastic approach that quantitatively describes the motion of growth cones. The growth cone dynamics is described by Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations with both deterministic and stochastic contributions. We show that the deterministic terms contain both the angular and speed dependence of axonal growth, and that these two contributions can be separated. Growth alignment is determined by surface geometry, and it is quantified by the deterministic part of the Langevin equation. We combine experimental data with theoretical analysis to measure the key parameters of the growth cone motion: speed and angular distributions, correlation functions, diffusion coefficients, characteristics speeds and damping coefficients. We demonstrate that axonal dynamics displays a cross-over from Brownian motion (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) at earlier times to anomalous dynamics (superdiffusion) at later times. The superdiffusive regime is characterized by non-Gaussian speed distributions and power law dependence of the axonal mean square length and the velocity correlation functions. These results demonstrate the importance of geometrical cues in guiding axonal growth, and could lead to new methods for bioengineering novel substrates for controlling neuronal growth and regeneration."

While cesarean section is an important emergency obstetric intervention for saving the lives of mothers and newborns, a study comparing the prevalence of cesarean delivery is not sufficiently available in Ethiopia. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of cesarean delivery among women who gave birth at hospitals in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted between July and October 2013. A total of 520 women who gave birth in four hospitals (public = 1, private = 3) were interviewed. Face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire were conducted for primary data collection. Additionally, patients’ charts were reviewed to collect mothers’ clinical data. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions analyses were conducted. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed and a P-value of less than 0.05 was taken to declare the level of significance. Results A total of 512 mothers were included in the final analysis (response rate = 98.4%), the prevalence of cesarean delivery was found to be 47.6% (95% CI: 44.3, 51.1), While 46 (18.2%) of the procedure conducted in public and 198 (76.1%) were in private hospitals. Partograph monitoring [AOR = 3.84 95%CI: 2.24, 6.59], oxytocin administration [AOR = 4. 80 95%CI: 2.87–8.02], previous cesarean delivery [AOR = 2. 86 95%CI: 1.64–5.01] and place of delivery being a private hospital [AOR = 6. 79 95%CI: 4.18–11.01)] were associated with cesarean delivery. Conclusion The prevalence of cesarean delivery was found to be high, and was significantly higher in private hospitals than a public facility. There is a need to conduct cesarean delivery audits to appropriately utilize scarce resources. Further an in-depth exploration of the experiences of women with cesarean delivery is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2943922978,"A sensitive biodosimetry tool is required for rapid individualized dose estimation and risk assessment in the case of radiological or nuclear mass casualty scenarios to prioritize exposed humans for immediate medical countermeasures to reduce radiation related injuries or morbidity risks. Unlike the conventional Dicentric Chromosome Assay (DCA), which takes about 3–4 days for radiation dose estimation, cell fusion mediated Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) technique in G0 lymphocytes can be rapidly performed for radiation dose assessment within 6–8 hrs of sample receipt by alleviating the need for ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation for 48 hrs. Despite this advantage, the PCC technique has not yet been fully exploited for radiation biodosimetry. Realizing the advantage of G0 PCC technique that can be instantaneously applied to unstimulated lymphocytes, we evaluated the utility of G0 PCC technique in detecting ionizing radiation (IR) induced stable and unstable chromosomal aberrations for biodosimetry purposes. Our study demonstrates that PCC coupled with mFISH and mBAND techniques can efficiently detect both numerical and structural chromosome aberrations at the intra- and inter-chromosomal levels in unstimulated T- and B-lymphocytes. Collectively, we demonstrate that the G0 PCC technique has the potential for development as a biodosimetry tool for detecting unstable chromosome aberrations (chromosome fragments and dicentric chromosomes) for early radiation dose estimation and stable chromosome exchange events (translocations) for retrospective monitoring of individualized health risks in unstimulated lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2944043356,"Background Women of reproductive age are at the highest risk of both HIV infection and unintended pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Highly effective contraceptives (HECs) such as hormonal injectable and implants are widely used in this region. HECs are effective for preventing pregnancies. However, unlike condoms, HECs offer no protection against HIV. Dual-method use, or the use of condoms with HECs, is an ideal option to reduce HIV risk but is infrequently practiced. Rather, women tend not to use condoms when they use HECs and increase their HIV risk from their sexual partners. However, it remains unknown whether HIV status affects such tendency. Given the increasing popularity of HECs in sub-Saharan Africa, this study examined the association between the use of HECs and condom use among HIV-positive and negative women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 833 sexually active women aged 18–49 years, recruited from six clinics in Siaya county, Kenya. From March to May 2017, female research assistants interviewed the women using a structured questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between HEC use and consistent condom use in the past 90 days, adjusting for potential confounders. It was also examined with regular partners (husbands or live-in partners) and non-regular partners, separately. In addition, a sub-sample analysis of HIV-negative or unknown women was conducted. Results In total, 735 women were available for the analysis. Among the women, 231 (31.4%) were HIV-positive. HIV-positive women were more likely to use HECs than HIV-negative or status unknown women (70.1% vs. 61.7%, p = 0.027). HEC use was significantly associated with decreased condom use with a regular partner (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.25; 95% CI 0.15–0.43, p<0.001) and a non-regular partner (AOR = 0.25; 95% CI 0.11–0.58, p = 0.001). However, compared with HIV-negative or status unknown women, HIV-positive women were more likely to use HECs and condoms consistently with a regular partner (AOR = 6.54, 95% CI 2.15–20.00, p = 0.001). Other factors significantly associated with consistent condom use included partner’s positive attitude toward contraception, partner’s HIV-positive status, high HIV risk perception, and desire for children in the future. Conclusion Dual-method use was limited among HIV-negative women and women who had HIV-negative partners due to inconsistent condom use. The use of HECs was significantly associated with decreased condom use, regardless of partner type and their HIV status. Due to this inverse association, HIV-negative women may increase their HIV risk from their sexual partners. Therefore, interventions should be strengthened to reduce their dual risks of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy by promoting dual-method use. Family planning services should strengthen counseling on the possible risk of HIV infection from their sexual partners and target not only women but also their partners, who may play a key role in condom use."

Destruction of the glycocalyx can also occur in chronic hyperglycemia. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a reliable marker of premorbid hyperglycemia. We investigated the association between HbA1c level at admission and the degree of organ dysfunction progression 72 hours after admission and ICU mortality. Methods and findings This study was a retrospective observational study. Logistic regression and correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the HbA1c level and the degree of organ dysfunction progression 72 hours after ICU admission. We applied survival analysis to examine the association between HbA1c level and ICU mortality. A total of 90 patients were included in this study. The association between HbA1c level and degree of organ dysfunction progression was significant (r = 0.320; P = 0.002). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that high HbA1c level (≥6.5%) (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.033–8.567; P = 0.043) were significant, independent predictors of severe organ dysfunction progression. Patients with an HbA1c level ≥6.5% exhibited significantly greater liver and kidney dysfunction progression 72 hours after ICU admission compared with those with an HbA1c level <6.5%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survival period was significantly shorter in patients with an HbA1c level ≥6.5% than in those with an HbA1c level <6.5% (P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that HbA1c level ≥6.5% (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.802–6.760; P <0.001) were significant, independent predictors of ICU mortality. Conclusions In patients with sepsis, the HbA1c level at ICU admission is associated with progression of organ dysfunction 72 hours later and with ICU mortality. It may be important to assess HbA1c level at ICU admission because it may be a predictor of ICU outcome. For patients with a high HbA1c level (≥6.5%), greater attention should be paid to the possibility of organ dysfunction progression."
https://openalex.org/W2943891126,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are potentially life-threatening conditions whose partially overlapping phenomenology—distorted perception of appearance, obsessions/compulsions, and limited insight—can make diagnostic distinction difficult in some cases. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as the effective treatments for AN and BDD differ. To improve diagnostic accuracy and clarify the contributions of each of the multiple underlying factors, we developed a two-stage machine learning model that uses multimodal, neurobiology-based, and symptom-based quantitative data as features: task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data using body visual stimuli, graph theory metrics of white matter connectivity from diffusor tensor imaging, and anxiety, depression, and insight psychometric scores. In a sample of unmedicated adults with BDD (n = 29), unmedicated adults with weight-restored AN (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 31), the resulting model labeled individuals with an accuracy of 76%, significantly better than the chance accuracy of 35% (). In the multivariate model, reduced white matter global efficiency and better insight were associated more with AN than with BDD. These results improve our understanding of the relative contributions of the neurobiological characteristics and symptoms of these disorders. Moreover, this approach has the potential to aid clinicians in diagnosis, thereby leading to more tailored therapy."

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 6-38 (PACAP6-38) could inhibit the synthesis and secretion of pineal melatonin. Finding a new way for exploring the mechanism of light-regulated muscle growth in ovo is essential for promoting the productive performance in poultry.Chick embryos were exposed to darkness (D-group) and green light (G-group) throughout the embryonic period, and injected with PACAP6-38 or saline at embryonic day 8. Plasma hormone, skeletal muscle fiber areas, satellite cell proliferation activity, paired domain homeobox transcription factor 7 and myogenic regulatory factors were observed.By saline treatment, the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoreactive cells and mitotic activity of satellite cells in skeletal muscle were higher in G-group than those of in D-group at post-hatching day 0. With the increase of plasma melatonin, green light promoted the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and insulin like factor 1 (IGF-1) in plasma, the satellite cell proliferation, the size of muscle fiber, as well as the mRNA expressions of Pax7, myogenic regulatory factors and IGF-1R. After PACAP6-38 treatment to inhibit the secretion of melatonin in ovo, aforementioned parameters were remarkably decreased and the difference of these parameters was disappeared between D-group and G-group.These data indicated that stimulation with monochromatic green light during incubation enhanced the secretion of melatonin and up-regulation of GH-IGF-1 axis to activate the satellite cells proliferation and myofiber formation, involving the expression of Pax7 and myogenic regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W2944628856,"Cities comprise of mixed green patches that vary in size and are highly scattered and disconnected. Although small green spaces largely dominate the cityscape, they are often neglected and ignored by the naturalists and conservationists, as they do not fulfill the large green spaces criteria. The citizens on the other hand seem to have a different perception and requirements from small green spaces as they are within their neighbourhood. Bangalore, a developing city within South India, consists of a large number of newly formed residential areas which have pocket green spaces in the form of neighbourhood parks (henceforth NPs). They are maintained by the municipality and are mainly designed for recreation purposes, completely neglecting the fact that these spaces could be essential for biodiversity. Here, there is a disconnect between the requirements of the citizens, conservationists and the end product that the municipality delivers. Here, through a questionnaire survey we assess the biodiversity citizens are fond off, and use them as surrogate taxa for the not so immediately obvious taxa, insects to enumerate the biodiversity within NPs. We analyze and identify landscape characteristics around NPs which could enhance the biodiversity within NPs. Our results reveal that people are fond of Birds and Butterflies and we use them as surrogates for the inconspicuous taxa to assess biodiversity within NPs. 55 tree species, 45 species of birds, 41 species of butterflies and 68 morpho species of insects were recorded. We demonstrate that small green spaces are critical systems and help support biodiversity across three scale within the city. Interestingly, results suggests that density of NPs is more important rather than the size of NPs. Also, the presence of high density of NPs within a neighbourhood could support similar biodiversity that large green spaces support. Finally, this study provides insights on the landscape matrix that could help enhance biodiversity support service within NPs and the surrounding neighbourhood."
https://openalex.org/W2943475895,"Introduction Glucosamine dietary supplements are commonly used for the management of osteoarthritis (OA). However, clinical trials have reported varying outcomes with regard to joint function and disease progression. One of the possible reasons for variability in observed effects of glucosamine could be that, unlike prescription drugs, the quality of manufactured dietary supplements is not closely monitored in many countries. Therefore, there is the possibility that the actual amount of glucosamine present in a dietary supplement is different from that claimed on the label. The quality control of glucosamine supplements is further complicated by the unavailability of a simple and effective analytical method for the analysis of glucosamine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a simple analytical method that could be easily adapted by the pharmaceutical industry for routine analysis of glucosamine. Aims To develop a novel high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the quantification of glucosamine, and determine the amount of glucosamine present in a sample of dietary supplements commercially available in Australia and India. Methods Chromatographic separation of glucosamine was achieved using a zwitter-ionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column with a mobile phase consisting of 60% acetonitrile and 40% of 85 mM ammonium acetate, at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and column temperature 40°C. The developed method was validated for intra- and inter-day linearity, accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. The newly-developed method was subsequently used to analyse 12 glucosamine supplements. Results The developed method was selective for glucosamine, which had a retention time of 5.9 min. The standard curve was linear with a correlation coefficient (r2) exceeding 0.99, over the range of 10–200 μg/mL for glucosamine. The relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-day accuracy, precision and reproducibility were all less than 4%. The amount of glucosamine determined in six Australian and six Indian glucosamine supplements ranged between 98.7–101.7% and 85.9–101.8% of the labelled values, respectively. Discussion Unlike previous HPLC methods, this newly-developed HPLC technique does not require pre-derivatisation and can separate glucosamine from both hydrochloride and sulphate salts, and from other amino sugars, such as chondroitin sulphate present in dietary supplements. This simple and effective technique can be employed by analytical laboratories for the quality control of glucosamine dietary supplements. Conclusion The current study has developed a new analytical technique using HPLC-Corona CAD, which can analyse underivatised glucosamine hydrochloride and sulphate within 6 minutes. Using the novel assay, we confirmed that unlike the tested Australian dietary supplements, only half of the tested Indian products had a glucosamine content within ±10% of what was claimed on the label."
https://openalex.org/W2944262929,"Objectives The concurrent implementation of targeted (tPITC) and blanket provider-initiated testing and counselling (bPITC) is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for HIV case-finding in generalized HIV epidemics. This study assessed the effectiveness of this intervention compared to symptom-based diagnostic HIV testing (DHT) in terms of HIV testing uptake, case detection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrollment among children and adolescents in Cameroon, where estimated HIV prevalence is relatively low at 3.7%. Methods In three hospitals where DHT was the standard practice before, tPITC and bPITC were implemented by inviting HIV-positive parents in care at the ART clinics to have their biological children (6 weeks-19 years) tested for HIV (tPITC). Concurrently, at the outpatient departments, similarly-age children/adolescents were systematically offered HIV testing via accompanying parents/guardians. The mean monthly number of children tested for HIV, identified HIV-positive and ART-enrolled were used to compare the outcomes of different HIV testing strategies before and after the intervention. Results In comparing DHT to bPITC, there was a significant increase in the mean monthly number of children/adolescents tested for HIV (223.0 vs 348.3, p = 0.0073), but with no significant increase in the mean monthly number of children/adolescents: testing HIV-positive (10.5 vs 9.7, p = 0.7574) and ART- enrolled (7.3 vs 6.3, p = 0.5819). In comparing DHT to tPITC, there was no significant difference in the mean monthly number of children/adolescents: tested for HIV (223 vs 193.8, p = 0.4648); tested HIV-positive (10.5 vs 10.6, p = 0.9544), and ART-enrolled (7.3 vs 5.8, p = 0.4672). When comparing DHT versus bPITC+tPITC, there was a significant increase in the mean monthly number of children/adolescents: tested for HIV (223.0 to 542.2, p<0.0001), testing HIV-positive (10.5 vs 20.3, p = 0.0256), and ART-enrolled (7.3 vs 12.2, p = 0.0388). Conclusions These findings suggest that concurrent implementation of bPITC+tPITC was more effective compared to DHT in terms of HIV testing uptake, case detection and ART enrolment. However, considering that DHT and bPITC had comparable outcomes with regards to case detection and ART enrolment, bPITC+tPITC may not be efficient. Thus, this finding does not support concurrent bPITC+tPITC implementation as recommended by WHO. Rather, continued DHT+tPITC could effectively and efficiently accelerate HIV case detection and ART coverage among children and adolescents in Cameroon and similar low-prevalence context."
https://openalex.org/W2943996458,"Females of many monandrous insect species announce their receptivity either by specialised sex-pheromones or by a signature mixture of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). The trigger that shuts down the sex-pheromone release or initialises a change in CHC bouquet is thought to be either the mating per se or male pheromones transferred during copulation. Besides a conversion of female volatiles, the application of antiaphrodisiacs, male derived pheromones that render mated females unattractive to competitors, is another strategy to protect females from further sexual chasings. This simple pattern becomes more complicated in the monandrous mason bees Osmia bicornis (syn: O. rufa) and O. cornuta due to a post-copulation phase in their mating sequence. Males display a stereotypic behaviour right after the intromission that induces females’ unreceptivity. This post-copulatory display is predestined both to trigger a transition of the CHC profile and for the application of an antiaphrodisiac. However, the postulated antiaphrodisiac was not detectable even on freshly mated females. Moreover, the male’s post-copulatory display did not trigger a change in the CHC bouquet and neither did the insemination. Instead the CHC profile of freshly emerged females changes into the bouquet of nesting females simply by age as an ontogenetic process in both Osmia species. This autonomous change in the CHC profile coincides with an age-specific decrease of young female’s willingness to mate. How the resulting short period of female receptivity without back coupling by storage of sperm and the lack of an antiaphrodisiac fit into the behavioural ecology of the studied mason bee species is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2944456921,"Background Approximately 11% of people reported to have tuberculosis (TB) have previously received treatment. Clinical outcomes are consistently poor on retreatment regimens, however reasons for this are unclear. This study aimed to explore factors which may contribute to unsuccessful outcomes in retreatment TB. Methods and findings A prospective cohort of consecutive patients starting WHO Category II retreatment regimen was recruited at a central hospital in Malawi. Participants were evaluated at baseline, after completion of the intensive phase at 2-months, and at the end of the 8-month treatment course. Patients were assessed for respiratory co-morbidity; anaemia; renal impairment; diabetes; Anti-retroviral (ART) failure; and drug toxicity. Amongst 158 patients entering TB care at the point of a recurrent episode, only 92 (58%) had a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis. The prevalence of drug resistance was low (9.6%). Of the 158 patients, 131 (83%) were HIV-positive, of whom 96 (73%) were on ART. Of 63 patients on ART >1 year, 24 (38%) had ART failure. Chronic lung disease was found in 88% on CT thorax, including scarring (80%), bronchiectasis (61%), COPD (22%), and destroyed lung (19%). Spirometry revealed restrictive deficit in 60%, and obstructive deficit in 7% of patients. Anaemia and renal impairment were common (34% and 45% respectively). Ototoxicity developed in 32%, and nephrotoxicity in 15%. 40% of patients reported peripheral neuropathy. Liver injury developed in 4%. Conclusions If outcomes are to be improved in retreatment TB, there is an urgent need to address the impact of other co-morbid medical conditions including chronic lung disease, HIV and ART failure."
https://openalex.org/W2944476376,"Background Reliable epidemiological data on Alzheimer's disease are scarce. However, these are necessary to adapt healthcare policy in terms of prevention, care and social needs related to this condition. To estimate the prevalence rate in the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera, with a population of one million, we present a capture-recapture procedure applied to cases of Alzheimer’s disease, based on two epidemiological surveillance systems. Methods To estimate the total number of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease, a capture-recapture study included a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease or receiving medications only eligible for use for this condition, recorded by a specific health insurance information system (Health Insurance Cohort, HIC), and those registered in the French National Alzheimer’s Data Bank (“Banque Nationale Alzheimer”, BNA) in 2010 and 2011. We applied Bayesian estimation of the Mt ecological model, taking into account age and gender as covariates, i.e. factors of inhomogeneous catchability. Results Overall, 5,562 patients with Alzheimer's disease were recorded, of whom only 856 were common to both information systems. Mean age and F/M sex ratio differed between BNA and HIC surveillance systems, 81 vs 84 years and 2.7 vs 3.2, respectively. A Bayesian estimation, with age and gender as covariates, yields an estimate of 15,060 cases of Alzheimer's disease [95%HPDI: 14,490–15,630] in the Alpes-Maritimes. The completeness of the HIC and BNA databases were respectively of 25.4% and 17.2%. The estimated prevalence rate among the population over 65 years old was 6.3% in 2010–2011. Conclusions This study demonstrates that it is possible to determine the number of subjects affected by Alzheimer's disease in a geographical unit, using available data from two existing surveillance systems in France, i.e. 15,060 cases in the Alpes-Maritimes. This is the first stage of a population-based approach in view of adapting available resources to the population’s needs."
https://openalex.org/W2944691715,"Objective To identify long-term profiles of Detached Concern (DC), based on its core dimensions detachment (D) and empathic concern (C), and to determine their association with burnout among human service professionals. Method Self-reported data from healthcare, teaching and social professionals (N = 108) were collected in 3-waves over an 8-month period. Latent profile analysis and analysis of covariance for repeated measures were applied. Results Five relatively stable longitudinal DC profiles emerged: (1) ‘detached’ (high D—low C; 33%); (2) ‘empathic’ (high C—moderate D; 31%); (3) ‘balanced’ (high D—high C; 21%); (4) ‘boundless’ (high C—low D, curvilinear trend; 8%); (5) ‘moderately uninvolved’ (low C—moderate D, increasing; 7%). Findings revealed profile differences based on gender (p < 0.05; χ2(4) = 9.73) and work experience (F [4, 103] = 3.26, p < .05). Differences could also be found for emotional exhaustion (F [4, 101] = 6.34, p < .001). The lowest emotional exhaustion over time occurred among balanced professionals. A stable or increasing risk of exhaustion over time was found in particular among profiles with moderate-to-low levels of detachment. Conclusion A balanced DC protects professionals’ mental health because it is associated with the lowest levels of emotional exhaustion over time among the distinct DC profiles. Findings provide evidence-based information for education and health-promoting interventions and contribute to self-awareness of the strengths and risks of DC and burnout for human service organisations and professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2944722824,"Background African-born individuals in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by HIV yet have low HIV testing rates. We conducted a mixed methods study to assess the uptake and feasibility of a novel strategy for integrating HIV testing into residential health fairs among African-born individuals in Seattle, WA. Methods From April to May 2018, we held six health fairs at three apartment complexes with high numbers of African-born residents. Fairs included free point-of-care screening for glucose, cholesterol, body mass index, blood pressure, and HIV, as well as social services and health education. The health fairs were hosted in apartment complex common areas with HIV testing conducted in private rooms. Health fair participants completed a series of questionnaires to evaluate demographics, access to health services, and HIV testing history. We conducted 18 key informant interviews (KIIs) with health fair participants and community leaders to identify barriers to HIV testing among African-born individuals. Results Of the 111 adults who accessed at least one service at a health fair, 92 completed questionnaires. Fifty-five (61%) were female, 48 (52%) were born in Africa, and 55 (63%) had health insurance. Half of African-born participants accepted HIV testing; all tested negative. The most common reasons for declining testing were lack of perceived risk for HIV and knowledge of HIV status. We identified a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among health fair participants; among those tested, 77% (55/71) were overweight/obese, 39% (31/79) had blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg, and 30% (22/73) had total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL. KIIs identified community stigma and misinformation as major barriers to HIV testing among African-born individuals. Conclusions Residential health fairs are a feasible method to increase HIV testing among African-born individuals in Seattle. The high prevalence of NCDs highlights the importance of integrating general preventive services within HIV testing programs in this population."

There is a paucity of prospective data addressing the risk factors for ACD development. An association between common chronic diseases and ACD was examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Method A cohort of 265,459 healthy participants without ACD at baseline were prospectively followed annually or biennially. Results During average follow-up period of 62 months, 4,906 participants developed ACD (incidence rate 3.58 per 1000 person-years). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for incident ACD comparing estimated glomerular filtration rate 30–60 and < 30 vs. ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 were 3.93 [3.18–4.85] and 39.11 [18.50–82.69]; HRs [95% CI] for ACD comparing prediabetes and diabetes vs. normal were 1.19 [1.12–1.27] and 2.46 [2.14–2.84], respectively. HRs [95% CI] for incident ACD comparing body-mass-index (BMI) of < 18.5, 23–24.9 and ≥ 25 vs. 18.5–22.9 kg/m2 were 0.89 [0.78–1.00], 0.89 [0.80–0.99] and 0.78 [0.66–0.91], respectively. HRs [95% CI] for incident ACD comparing prehypertension and hypertension vs. normal were 0.79 [0.73–0.86] and 1.10 [0.99–1.23], respectively. Metabolic syndrome, hypertension, chronic liver disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not associated with incident ACD. Conclusions The severity of chronic kidney disease and diabetic status were independently associated with an increased incidence of ACD, whereas prehypertension and an increasing BMI were significantly associated with decreased risk of ACD."
https://openalex.org/W2944429978,"1/f fluctuations have been described in numerous physical and biological processes. This noise structure describes an inverse relationship between the intensity and frequency of events in a time series (for example reflected in power spectra), and is believed to indicate long-range dependence, whereby events at one time point influence events many observations later. 1/f has been identified in rhythmic behaviors, such as music, and is typically attributed to long-range correlations. However short-range dependence in musical performance is a well-established finding and past research has suggested that 1/f can arise from multiple continuing short-range processes. We tested this possibility using simulations and time-series modeling, complemented by traditional analyses using power spectra and detrended fluctuation analysis (as often adopted more recently). Our results show that 1/f-type fluctuations in musical contexts may be explained by short-range models involving multiple time lags, and the temporal ranges in which rhythmic hierarchies are expressed are apt to create these fluctuations through such short-range autocorrelations. We also analyzed gait, heartbeat, and resting-state EEG data, demonstrating the coexistence of multiple short-range processes and 1/f fluctuation in a variety of phenomena. This suggests that 1/f fluctuation might not indicate long-range correlations, and points to its likely origins in musical rhythm and related structures."
https://openalex.org/W2944468306,"Task-evoked Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD-fMRI) signal activation is widely used to interrogate eloquence of brain areas. However, data interpretation can be improved, especially in regions with absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation. Absent BOLD-fMRI signal activation may actually represent false-negative activation due to impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) of the vascular bed. The relationship between impaired BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI signal activation may be better studied in healthy subjects where neurovascular coupling is known to be intact. Using a model-based prospective end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) targeting algorithm, we performed two controlled 3 tesla BOLD-CVR studies on 17 healthy subjects: 1: at the subjects' individual resting end-tidal CO2 baseline. 2: Around +6.0 mmHg CO2 above the subjects' individual resting baseline. Two BOLD-fMRI finger-tapping experiments were performed at similar normo- and hypercapnic levels. Relative BOLD fMRI signal activation and t-values were calculated for BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI data. For each component of the cerebral motor-network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, cerebellum und fronto-operculum), the correlation between BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI signal changes and t-values was investigated. Finally, a voxel-wise quantitative analysis of the impact of BOLD-CVR on BOLD-fMRI was performed. For the motor-network, the linear correlation coefficient between BOLD-CVR and BOLD-fMRI t-values were significant (p<0.01) and in the range 0.33-0.55, similar to the correlations between the CVR and fMRI Δ%signal (p<0.05; range 0.34-0.60). The linear relationship between CVR and fMRI is challenged by our voxel-wise analysis of Δ%signal and t-value change between normo- and hypercapnia. Our main finding is that BOLD fMRI signal activation maps are markedly dampened in the presence of impaired BOLD-CVR and highlights the importance of a complementary BOLD-CVR assessment in addition to a task-evoked BOLD fMRI to identify brain areas at risk for false-negative BOLD-fMRI signal activation."
https://openalex.org/W2944534848,"Introduction Combination therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is highly effective but results in significant toxicity including osteonecrosis. Asparaginase is known to potentiate both the antileukemic and osteonecrosis-inducing effects of dexamethasone. The schedule of dexamethasone alters osteonecrosis risk. However, the effects of the interaction with asparaginase are unknown when dexamethasone is given on a discontinuous schedule. Methods Using the murine model of osteonecrosis, we compared the frequency of osteonecrosis in mice receiving discontinuous dexamethasone (3.5 days/ week) with mice receiving asparaginase and discontinuous dexamethasone. We then tested the effect on antileukemic efficacy using six pediatric ALL xenografts. Results The addition of asparaginase to discontinuous dexamethasone did not alter the rate of osteonecrosis compared to dexamethasone alone (7/35 in dexamethasone with asparaginase combination vs. 10/36 in dexamethasone alone, p = 0.62) despite increasing steady-state plasma dexamethasone levels (103.9 nM vs. 33.4 nM, p = 9.2x10-7). Combination therapy with asparaginase and dexamethasone demonstrated synergistic antileukemic effects across all six xenografts studied. Conclusions When discontinuous dexamethasone was given, its anti-leukemic activity synergized with asparaginase but the osteonecrosis-worsening effects of asparaginase (above dexamethasone alone) were not observed. Thus, there is a favorable drug interaction (unchanged toxicity, synergistic efficacy) between discontinuous dexamethasone and asparaginase."
https://openalex.org/W2944780026,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused mostly by mutations in polycystin-1 or polycystin-2. Fluid flow leads to polycystin-dependent calcium influx and nuclear export of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), which facilitates the maintenance of renal epithelial architecture by de-repression of MEF2C target genes. Here, we screened a small-molecule library to find drugs that promotes nuclear export of HDAC5. We found that dopamine receptor antagonists, domperidone and loxapine succinate, stimulate export of HDAC5, even in Pkd1–/–cells. Domperidone targets Drd3 receptor to modulate the phosphorylation of HDAC5. Domperidone treatment increases HDAC5 phosphorylation likely by reducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, thus shifting the equilibrium towards HDAC5-P and export from the nucleus. Treating Pkd1–/–mice with domperidone showed significantly reduced cystic growth and cell proliferation. Further, treated mice displayed a reduction in glomerular cyst and increased body weight and activity. These results suggest that HDAC5 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may be modulated to impede disease progression in ADPKD and uncovers an unexpected role for a class of dopamine receptors in renal epithelial morphogenesis."

It is caused by mutations in ATP7B. We report here the genetic analysis of 102 WD families from a south Indian population. Thirty-six different ATP7B mutations, including 13 novel ones [p.Ala58fs*19, p.Lys74fs*9, p.Gln281*, p.Pro350fs*12, p.Ser481*, p.Leu735Arg, p.Val752Gly, p.Asn812fs*2, p.Val845Ala, p.His889Pro, p.Ile1184fs*1, p.Val1307Glu and p.Ala1339Pro], were identified in 76/102 families. Interestingly, the mutation analysis of affected individuals in two families identified two different homozygous mutations in each family, and thus each affected individual from these families harbored two mutations in each ATP7B allele. Of 36 mutations, 28 were missense, thus making them the most prevalent mutations identified in the present study. Nonsense, insertion and deletion represented 3/36, 2/36 and 3/36 mutations, respectively. The haplotype analysis suggested founder effects for all the 14 recurrent mutations. Our study thus expands the mutational landscape of ATP7B with a total number of 758 mutations. The mutations identified during the present study will facilitate carrier and pre-symptomatic detection, and prenatal genetic diagnosis in affected families."
https://openalex.org/W2944698737,"Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting compound, is associated with increased risk of estrogen-related diseases, including estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Although bisphenol analogs, i.e. bisphenol AF (BPAF), have replaced BPA in industrial settings, increasing data indicate that these alternatives may have similar or even more potent estrogenic effects. As such, BPAF exhibits increased ER binding affinities than BPA in biochemical assays. However, preclinical studies exploring the effects of BPAF on ER+ breast cancer are missing mechanistic data. Thus, we aimed to characterize the effects of BPAF on MCF-7 and T47D ER+ breast cancer cells with mechanistic insight. We found that BPAF promoted cell growth and cell cycle progression concurrently with BPAF-induced ERα transcriptional activity and ER-RTK signaling activation. ER signaling blockage revealed that BPAF-induced cell proliferation and ER-RTK crosstalk were ER-dependent. Gene expression data demonstrated that AREG is a sensitive target of BPAF in our in vitro models. Importantly, we determined that AREG upregulation is necessary for BPAF-induced cellular responses. Ultimately, our novel finding that AREG mediates BPAF-induced ER-RTK crosstalk in ER+ breast cancer cells supports future studies to characterize the impact of BPAF on human ER+ breast cancer risk and to assess the safety profile of BPAF."

We phenotyped and genotyped the mutants, performed genetic crossings and studied the eye structure and pigment composition using light and electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. We show that W and Y phenotypes are controlled by a single autosomal recessive allele, as both traits are metabolically independent. The analysis of the mutants`eye structure showed a reduced number of dark pigment granules while simultaneously, and an increased amount of light vacuoles in white eye mutants was observed. Significant differences in eye pigment composition between strains were also found. The Y mutant had a lower number of ommochromes, while the W mutant had a lower number of ommochromes and pteridines. This indicates that mutated genes are involved in two different, independent metabolic pathways regulating tryptophan metabolism enzymes, pigment transporter granules or pigment granule formation."

To assess the diversity, we used two molecular methods–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). We carried out two types of experiments to measure top-down (adult copepods as predators) and bottom-up effects (phytoplankton as food resources) on the spirotrich ciliates. We observed both strong incubation effects (untreated controls departed from initial assessment of diversity) and high variability across replicates within treatments, particularly for the bottom-up experiments. This suggests a rapid community turn-over during incubation and differential susceptibility to the effects of experimental manipulation. Despite the variability, our analyses reveal some broad patterns such as (1) increasing adult copepod predator abundance had a greater impact on spirotrich ciliates than on other microbial eukaryotes; (2) there was no evidence for strong food selection by the dominant spirotrich ciliates."
https://openalex.org/W2944147209,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis increases energy expenditure (EE). Expanding the volume of active BAT via transplantation holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for morbid obesity and diabetes. Brown adipose progenitor cells (BAPCs) can be isolated and expanded to generate autologous brown adipocyte implants. However, the transplantation of brown adipocytes is currently impeded by poor efficiency of BAT tissue formation in vivo and undesirably short engraftment time. In this study, we demonstrated that transplanting BAPCs into limb skeletal muscles consistently led to the ectopic formation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)+pos adipose tissue with long-term engraftment (>4 mo). Combining VEGF with the BAPC transplant further improved BAT formation in muscle. Ectopic engraftment of BAPC-derived BAT in skeletal muscle augmented the EE of recipient mice. Although UCP1 expression declined in long-term BAT grafts, this deterioration can be reversed by swimming exercise because of sympathetic activation. This study suggests that intramuscular transplantation of BAPCs represents a promising approach to deriving functional BAT engraftment, which may be applied to therapeutic BAT transplantation and tissue engineering.-Liu, Y., Fu, W., Seese, K., Yin, A., Yin, H. Ectopic brown adipose tissue formation within skeletal muscle after brown adipose progenitor cell transplant augments energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2944550435,"Background Diarrhoeal diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in humanitarian crises. Handwashing with soap may reduce diarrhoea by up to 47%, however, the circumstances associated with displacement make it challenging for crisis-affected populations to be able to wash their hands with soap. The Supertowel is an alternative hand-cleaning product, proven to be as efficacious as handwashing with soap. The Supertowel is a micro-fibre towel with an anti-microbial treatment. When dipped in water it is capable of removing and killing pathogens from hands. This study aims to assess whether the Supertowel could be an acceptable and feasible product for crisis-affected populations. Methods The study took place in an Eritrean refugee camp located in Tigray state in Ethiopia. We used a mix of qualitative methods to understand use and acceptability, including baseline observations (n = 13), behaviour trials involving interviews at three time points (n = 19) and focus group discussions (n = 3). We thematically analysed data from interviews and discussions. Results Participants indicated that the Supertowel was convenient, easy to use and saved them water and money. All households participating in the behaviour trials had at least one Supertowel in use at the end of the trials (follow-up visit two). In discussions participants reported that the Supertowel was more desirable than comparable hand cleaning products. In interviews, trial participants explained that the product enabled them to clean their hands at times when they might not normally bother. The research also identified some issues with the smell of the Supertowel and its intuitive use. Conclusions The Supertowel was found to be an acceptable and useful hand-cleaning product that could complement soap use in crisis contexts. This pilot study also identified areas of future research including the need to compare different distribution models for the Supertowel (distribution in hygiene kits compared to distribution with an accompanying communication package) and to evaluate its use at scale over a longer time period."
https://openalex.org/W2944734652,"Previously, we have introduced an improved version of jViz.RNA which enabled faster and more stable RNA visualization by employing compressed tree graphs. However, the new RNA representation and visualization method required a sophisticated mechanism of pseudoknot visualization. In this work, we present our novel pseudoknot classification and implementation of pseudoknot visualization in the context of the new RNA graph model. We then compare our approach with other RNA visualization software, and demonstrate jViz.RNA 4.0’s benefits compared to other software. Additionally, we introduce interactive editing functionality into jViz.RNA and demonstrate its benefits in exploring and building RNA structures. The results presented highlight the new high degree of utility jViz.RNA 4.0 now offers. Users are now able to visualize pseudoknotted RNA, manipulate the resulting automatic layouts to suit their individual needs, and change both positioning and connectivity of the RNA molecules examined. Care was taken to limit overlap between structural elements, particularly in the case of pseudoknots to ensure an intuitive and informative layout of the final RNA structure.

https://openalex.org/W2951848254,"It is easier to indicate the ink color of a color-neutral noun when it is presented in the color in which it has frequently been shown before, relative to print colors in which it has been shown less often. This phenomenon is known as color-word contingency learning. It remains unclear whether participants actually learn semantic (word-color) associations and/or response (word-button) associations. We present a novel variant of the paradigm that can disentangle semantic and response learning, because word-color and word-button associations are manipulated independently. In four experiments, each involving four daily sessions, pseudowords—such as enas, fatu or imot—were probabilistically associated with either a particular color, a particular response-button position, or both. Neutral trials without color-pseudoword association were also included, and participants’ awareness of the contingencies was manipulated. The data showed no influence of explicit contingency awareness, but clear evidence both for response learning and for semantic learning, with effects emerging swiftly. Deeper processing of color information, with color words presented in black instead of color patches to indicate response-button positions, resulted in stronger effects, both for semantic and response learning. Our data add a crucial piece of evidence lacking so far in color-word contingency learning studies: Semantic learning effectively takes place even when associations are learned in an incidental way."
https://openalex.org/W2942811761,"Human decision making involving many alternatives is encumbered with inconsistent prioritization. Although inconsistency is assumed to grow with the number of comparisons, it is shown to be reduced by conscious awareness under certain conditions. This study experimentally investigated the effect of repeating a criteria ranking task on inconsistency scores as measured by four different inconsistency coefficients. A total of 107 participants were engaged in a selection task that comprised of ranking from 3 to 10 criteria and was repeated in three trials. Upon completing the first trial, the participants were informed about the inconsistency issues and could improve their ranking in another two trials. The inconsistency score was computed for each set of comparisons and the effect of repeating the selection task on inconsistency concerning the number of criteria was analyzed using the repeated measures ANOVA. The results reveal a significant change in the inconsistency as the task was repeated but the difference depended on the number of criteria. There exists a borderline in the problem size under which the rankings are associated with significantly lower inconsistency, while the rankings with the larger number of criteria were found to have significantly higher inconsistency."
https://openalex.org/W2944129964,"Background Previous ischemic stroke is a predictor of recurrent ischemic stroke after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Dual antiplatelet therapy, including a P2Y12-inhibitor, is important in secondary prevention after AMI. Ticagrelor, a P2Y12-inhibitor, is more potent than the commonly used clopidogrel. Here, we evaluated the impact of ticagrelor on the risk of ischemic stroke following AMI in patients with previous ischemic stroke. Methods Data for patients with AMI that had a previous ischemic stroke were obtained from the Swedish Registry of Information and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions. Patients were assigned to early and late cohorts, each covering a two-year time period before and after, respectively, the introduction of ticagrelor prescriptions (20 Dec 2011). Patients in the early cohort (n = 1633) were treated with clopidogrel (100%); those in the late cohort (n = 1642) were treated with either clopidogrel (66.3%) or ticagrelor (33.7%). We assessed the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding over time with Kaplan-Meier analyses. We identified predictors of ischemic stroke with multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results Of 3275 patients, 311 experienced ischemic stroke after AMI. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier incidence estimates of ischemic stroke within one year after AMI were 12.1% versus 8.6% for the early and late cohorts, respectively (p<0.01). Intracranial bleeding incidences (1.2% versus 1.5%) were similar between the two cohorts. Conclusions Ticagrelor introduction was associated with a lower rate of ischemic stroke, with no increase in intracranial bleeding, in an AMI population with a history of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2944709682,"This paper explores extreme response style to the Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation (LIBRE) Profile, a measure of social participation in burn survivors. We fit a Multidimensional Generalized Partial Credit Model (MGPCM) with a positive extreme response style (PERS) factor and compared this model with the original MGPCM, estimated the impact that PERS has on scores, and examined the personal characteristics that may result in an individual more likely to respond in a fashion that would inflate their true low scores. The average impact of the PERS, based upon the root mean squared bias, ranged from 0.27 to 0.50 of a standard deviation of the scale. Individuals who were older, had participated in a burn survivor support group, and had selected to self-administer the measure were less likely to have a high PERS bias that masks low scores. Future work can consider PERS when measuring the psychosocial impacts of burn injuries and other health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2950964154,"Data on the association between HIV infection and deaths from underlying medical conditions are needed to understand and assess the impact of HIV on mortality. We present data on mortality in the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (CHBH) South Africa and analyse the relationship between each cause of death and HIV.From 2006 to 2009 data were collected on 15,725 deaths including age, sex, day of admittance and of death, HIV status, ART initiation and CD4+ cell counts. Causes of death associated with HIV were cases, causes of death not associated with HIV were controls. We calculate the odds-ratios (ORs) for being HIV-positive and for each AIDS related condition the disease-attributable fraction (DAF) and the population-attributable fraction (PAF) due to HIV for cases relative to controls.Among those that died, the prevalence of HIV was 61% and of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related conditions was 69%. The HIV-attributable fraction was 36% in the whole sample and 60% in those that were HIV-positive. Cryptococcosis, Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis jirovecii, TB, gastroenteritis and anaemia were highly predictive of HIV with odds ratios for being HIV-positive ranging from 8 to 124, while genito-urinary conditions, meningitis, other respiratory conditions and sepsis, lymphoma and conditions of skin and bone were significantly associated with HIV with odds ratios for being HIV-positive ranging from 3 to 8. Most of the deaths attributable to HIV were among those dying of TB or of other respiratory conditions.The high prevalence of HIV among those that died, peaking at 70% in those aged 30 years but still 7% in those aged 80 years, demonstrates the impact of the HIV epidemic on adult mortality and on hospital services and the extent to which early anti-retroviral treatment would have reduced the burden of both. These data make it possible to better assess mortality and morbidity due to HIV in this still high prevalence setting and, in particular, to identify those causes of death that are most strongly associated with HIV."
