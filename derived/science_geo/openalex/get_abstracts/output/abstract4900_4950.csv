https://openalex.org/W1606423922,"A technique has been developed for the separation of proteins by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to its resolution and sensitivity, this technique is a powerful tool for the analysis and detection of proteins from complex biological sources. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension, and according to molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the second dimension. Since these two parameters are unrelated, it is possible to obtain an almost uniform distribution of protein spots across a two-diminsional gel. This technique has resolved 1100 different components from Escherichia coli and should be capable of resolving a maximum of 5000 proteins. A protein containing as little as one disintegration per min of either 14C or 35S can be detected by autoradiography. A protein which constitutes 10 minus 4 to 10 minus 5% of the total protein can be detected and quantified by autoradiography. The reproducibility of the separation is sufficient to permit each spot on one separation to be matched with a spot on a different separation. This technique provides a method for estimation (at the described sensitivities) of the number of proteins made by any biological system. This system can resolve proteins differing in a single charge and consequently can be used in the analysis of in vivo modifications resulting in a change in charge. Proteins whose charge is changed by missense mutations can be identified. A detailed description of the methods as well as the characteristics of this system are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1520266592,"Cardiac microsomes were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and a cardiac adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(bets-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. After solubilization in sodium dodecyl sulfate and fractionation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single microsomal protein component of approximately 22,000 daltons was found to bind most of the 32P label. The 32P labeling of this component increased several fold when NaF was included in the incubation medium. No other component of cardiac microsomes, including sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase protein, contained significant amounts of 32P label. This 22,000-dalton phosphoprotein formed by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase had stability characteristics of a phosphoester rather than an acyl phosphate. Washing of microsomes with buffered KCl did not decrease the amount of 32P labeling to the 22,000-dalton protein, suggesting that this protein is associated with the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum rather than being a contaminant from other soluble proteins. The 22,000-dalton protein was susceptible to trypsin. Brief digestion with trypsin in the presence of 1 M sucrose did not significantly affect microsomal calcium transport activity, but prevented both subsequent phosphorylation of the 22,000-dalton protein and stimulation of calcium uptake by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that this protein is a modulator of the calcium pump. These results are consistent with previous findings (Kirchberger, M.A., Tada, M., and Katz, A.M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6166-6173; Tada, M., Kirchberger, M.A., Repke, D.I., and Katz, A.M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6174-6180) that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation is associated with stimulation of calcium transport in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, and further indicate that this phosphorylation occurs at a component of low mass (22,000 daltons) of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum which, while separable from the calcium transport ATPase protein (100,000 daltons) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, has the ability to regulate calcium transport by the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1494555596,"An enzyme that uses GTP as substrate for the formation in stoichiometric quantities of formate, inorganic pyrophosphate, and 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(ribosylamino)pyrimidine-5'-phosphate has been purified 2200-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli B. This enzyme is named GTP cyclohydrolase II to distinguish it from a previously studied E. coli enzyme, named GTP cyclohydrolase (and called GTP cyclohydrolase I in this paper), that catalyzes the first of a series of enzymatic reactions leading to the biosynthesis of the pteridine portion of folic acid (Burg, A. W., and Brown, G. M. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 2349-2358). Some of the properties of GTP cyclohydrolase II are: (a) divalent cations are required for activity (Mg2+ is most effective); (b) its molecular weight, estimated by filtration on Sephadex G-200, is 44,000; (c) the K-m for GTP is 41 mum; (d) its pH optimum is 8.5; and (e) its activity is inhibited by inorganic pyrophosphate, one of the products of the reaction. Compounds not used as substrate are: GDP, GMP, guanosine, dGTP, ATP, ITP, and XTP. Properties a, b, c, and e (above), as well as the nature of the products, distinguish this enzyme from GTP cyclohydrolase I. Since GTP cyclohydrolase II apparently is not concerned with the biosynthesis of folic acid, the possible physiological role of this enzyme in the biosynthesis of riboflavin is considered in the light of the present investigations and the previously published work on riboflavin biosynthesis by other investigators."
https://openalex.org/W1484324329,"DNA synthesis and DNA polymerase activity have been measured in terminally differentiating cardiac muscle of the rat. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA essentially ceases by the 17th day of postnatal development. Cardiac muscle of neonatal rats contains at least two molecular species of DNA polymerase: a 3.5 S DNA polymerase that can be extracted from nuclei with 0.2 m potassium phosphate and a 6 to 8 S soluble cytoplasmic DNA polymerase. The nuclear DNA polymerase in crude extracts has a pH optimum of 9.0 and is more active with native DNA than with denatured DNA as the primer-template. The cytoplasmic DNA polymerase in crude extracts has a pH optimum of 7.5 and is more active with denatured DNA. The activity of the 6 to 8 S cytoplasmic DNA polymerase decreases 80-fold from day 1 to day 17 after birth, which correlates temporally with the reduced rate of DNA synthesis. The activity of the 3.5 S nuclear DNA polymerase remains relatively constant throughout postnatal development. Mixing experiments (assay of neonatal enzyme extracts with adult enzyme extracts) gave additive results, suggesting that the decline in 6 to 8 S DNA polymerase activity apparently is not due to the presence of absence of soluble activators or inhibitors at different times during development. These studies may provide a system which can be used to investigate the control of DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation during the terminal stages of cardiac muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1589580009,"Pyridoxamine (pyridoxine) 5'-phosphate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.5) has been purified 2000-fold from rabbit liver. The enzyme preparation migrates as a single protein and activity band on analytical disc gels containing 4,7, or 9 percent acrylamide, and as a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels. The oxidase is, therefore, homogeneous by these criteria. The pure enzyme catalyzes the following reactions in the presence of FMN: (See journal for formula). These activities copurify in the ratio of 1:1:1. Apparent K-m values are 10 muM for pyridoxamine-P, 30 muM for pyridoxine-P, and 40 nM for FMN. Apparent K-m values for N-(phosphopyridoxyl)amines range from 3.1 times 10-5 M to 1.6 times 10-3 M. The dissociation constant for FMN binding, determined by quenching of protein fluorescence, is 20 nM. The pH optima for all three types of substrates are broad, with maxima near pH 9. The pH dependence of FMN binding, measured by quenching of flavin fluorescence, has the same shape as the substrate activity profile. The holoenzyme has absorption maxima red-shifted from those of FMN to 380 nm and 448 nm, and exhibits spectral changes typical of flavoproteins upon reduction with dithionite. Its oxidation-reduction potential at pH 7 in phosphate buffer is -0.131 volt. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 54,000 and is made up of two possibly identical polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 27,000. The applicability of proposed mechanisms of flavin catalysis to this flavoprotein is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486875326,"Tryptophan fluorescence lifetimes at pH 2 and pH 8 have been obtained for lysozyme and for lysozyme derivatives in which tryptophan-62 or tryptophan-108 or both are nonfluorescent. The lifetimes range from about 0.5 ns to 2.8 ns for the various emitting tryptophans. The tryptophan lifetimes appear to increase with exposure of tryptophan to solvent, but intramolecular contacts, probably with cystine residues, can considerably shorten the lifetime. Intertryptophanyl interactions can also affect fluorescence lifetimes. The trytophan-108 lifetime in lysozyme is shorter than in the derivative in which tryptophan-62 is oxidized; this is ascribed to energy transfer from tryptophan-108 to tryptophan-62. From the lifetime results the relative intensities emitted by specific tryptophans can be estimated, and these values also support the existence of intertryptophanyl energy transfer. The emission intensity from tryptophan-62 is greater in the presence of tryptophan-108, and the emission intensity of tryptophan-108 appears to be greater in the absence of tryptophan-62. Conformational effects accompanying chemical modification of tryptophan cannot be completely ruled out, however. The tryptophan-62 lifetime at pH 8 in lysozyme is shorter than in the derivatives, which might indicate a subtle conformational effect. Studies with tri-(N-acetyl-glucosamine)-protein complexes indicate that both the tryptophan lifetimes and the number of emitting tryptophans may be changing upon complexation. The results illustrate the usefulness and the limitations of lifetime measurements in understanding protein fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1560833965,"1. The translocation of 45Ca2+ in vesicles reconstituted with purified Ca2+ ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and phospholipids was dependent on ATP and varied greatly with the composition of the phospholipids. 2. In contrast to sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments, the reconstituted vesicles were impermeable to 14C-labeled oxalate, 3H- or 32P-labeled ATP, or 32P-i. There was no translocation of phosphate from gamma-labeled ATP during Ca2+ uptake. These results are inconsistent with some current formulations of the mechanism of pump action. 3. Reversal of the Ca2+ pump and generation of ATP and ADP and P-i was observed when vesicles loaded with Ca2+ were exposed to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. 4. Experiments on the formation of phosphoenzyme with 32P-labeled ATP showed that most if not all functional ATPase molecules in the reconstituted vesicles were oriented in the same direction, as in the case of sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1500993215,"Rat adrenal gland levels of dopamine beta-hydroxylase are subject to dual control. Activation of the splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla by reserpine induces the synthesis of dopamine beta-hydroxylase without altering the rate of enzyme degradation. In contrast, hypophysectomy causes a decline in steady state dopamine beta-hydroxylase levels by first accelerating the rate of degradation, then by slowing the rate of enzyme synthesis as well. Adrenocorticotropic hormone administration partially reversed the effect of hypophysectomy on dopamin beta-hydroxylase degradation. These findings suggest that the trans-synaptic factors controlling dopamine beta-hydroxylase induction act by a different mechanism (enzyme synthesis) than the hormonal controls regulating steady state levels (enzyme degradation). Thus, active inhibition of enzyme degradation may be an important control in maintenance of steady state enzyme levels."
https://openalex.org/W1604346821,"The polypeptide chain composition and the chemical properties of several annelid hemoglobins and chlorocruorins are presented. In agreement with earlier studies on the hemoglobin from Arenicola cristata (Waxman, L. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 7318-7327), nearly all of the pigments which have been examined consist of one or more different disulfide-linked polypeptide chains of 13,000 to 16,000 daltons, and the heme-protein stoichiometry suggests that more than one polypeptide is associated with each heme. Except for the prosthetic group, there is no outstanding chemical difference between the chlorocruorins and the hemoglobins, nor is ther any apparent differnce between those hemoglobins which show cooperative oxygen binding properties and those which do not. The results suggest that all these hemoglobins have similar structures. On the other hand, the polypeptide chains of mollusc hemoglobins have molecular weights of greater than 220,000. Each polypeptide binds many heme groups. Thus, annelids use small polypeptide chains while molluscs use giant polypeptides to carry O2."
https://openalex.org/W1602276278,"Some physical and chemical properties of the monomeric NADP+-dependent aldehyde reductase (previously called TPN-L-hexonate dehydrogenase or D-glucuronate reductase) from pig kidney have been examined. The amino acid composition has been determined. Four of the five thiol groups react with p-mercuribenzoate at pH 7, with no resulting loss of catalytic activity. High concentrations of p-mercuribenzoate cause complete enzyme inhibition, which can be partly reversed by addition of aldehyde reductase is low (9%, estimated from the ellipticity at 208 nm), and 70 to 80% of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues aare buried within the molecule. One molecule of NADPH binds to the enzyme (Kp equal 25 muM), causing a blue shift and enhancement of the coenzyme fluorescence, and suggesting that the environment of the active site is hydrophobic. In the reduction of D-glyceraldehyde, catalyzed by aldehyde reductase, the pro-4R A hydrogen of NADPH attacks the re face of the carbonyl group. This stereospecificity is the same as in the reductions of D-glyceraldehyde and acetaldehyde effected by rabbit muscle dehydrogenase and liver alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1643996742,"A particulate fraction from calf thyroid catalyzes the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to exogenous glycopeptides and methyl or aryl glycosides to form alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-D-mannose sequences. The transfer to the simple glycosides required a single nonreducing mannose residue linked to a lipophilic aglycone. Thus p-nitrophenyl-, 4-methylumbelliferyl-, phenyl- and methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranosides were effective acceptors while free mannose and glycosides of several other sugars were totally inactive. The Km value for methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside was 2.6 mM. Specificity for the anomeric configuration of the acceptor was glycosylated to the extent of 50% of the alpha anomer and mutual inhibition between these two acceptors was observed. Acetolysis or mild acid hydrolysis of the 14C-labeled products from the glycoside acceptors yielded the disaccharide, 2-O-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-D-mannose, which represents the predominant linkage between mannose residues in the carbohydrate unit A of thyroglobulin. Glycopeptides with mannose sequences served as acceptors for the transfer reaction but only after dinitrophenylation of their peptide portion. The unit A glycopeptides of thyroglobulin with 10 mannose residues (Km equals 0.89 mM) were much better acceptors than glycopeptides containing the core portion of unit B which contains only three mannose components. Reduction in size of unit A glycopeptide acceptors by timed alpha-mannosidase treatment resulted in a progressive decrease in activity. Peptide-free unit A was inactive even after it was modified to carry dinitrophenyl groups on its glucosamine residues. GDP-mannose was the most effective glycosyl donor, with a Km value of 1.4 muM for methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside and 0.30 muM for dinitrophenyl unit A glycopeptides, although ADP- and UDP-mannose could substitute to the extent of 40 to 45%. The mannose transfer to the glycopeptides had a optimum of 6.3 while that to the simple glycopeptides was best at pH 7.0. Both types of transfer reactions required a divalent cation with manganese serving most effectively in that capacity. Mannoslytransferase activity for both groups of acceptors was found predominantly in particulate subcellular fractions. A number of aromatic compounds and reagents which are disruptive of membrane integrity caused loss of enzyme activity presumably by interfering with the function of the lipophilic substituents on the various acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1547369749,"Prostaglandin F2alpha is converted to 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin E2 by adult rat kidney homogenates. A variety of substrates labeled as either the 9beta position alone or at several other positions in the prostaglandin molecule were used to define the step at which the crossover from the F type to the E type prostaglandins takes place. Time course studies further confirmed that 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin F2alpha is the immediate substrate for this enzyme which we have termed prostaglandin 9-hydroxydehydrogenase. An assay system based on specific loss of tritium from 9beta-tritiated prostaglandin F2alpha is described. Enzyme activity with prostaglandin F2alpha as substrate is linear with time up to 10 min, stimulated by NAD+, saturable at low concentrations of substrate, stable to storage at minus 25 degrees in phosphate buffer (up to 3 weeks), and has a broad pH optimum around 7.5. The product, 15-keto,13,14-dihydroprostaglandin E2 was identified by mass spectrometry through a sodium borohydride-sodium borodeuteride reduction method."
https://openalex.org/W1564393297,"The reaction: glycerate-1,3-P2 PLUS GLUCOSE-1-P YIELDS TO GLUCOSE-1,6-P2 plus glycerate-P is catalyzed by a distinct enzyme of mouse brain. A divalent metal requirement was shown when the enzyme was treated with imidazole and EDTA. Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ were quite effective cofactors. The enzyme, in better than 50 percent yield, has been purified away from 99 percent of the phosphoglucomutase, phosphoglycrate mutase, and phosphofructokinase. Acetyl-P, ATP, enolpyruvate-P, creatine-P, and fructose-1,6-P2 are not phosphoryl donors. Glucose-6-P and mannose-1-P are good alternate acceptors. Mannose-6-P, galactose-Ps, and fructose-Ps have little or no acceptor activity. Strong inhibition was found with fructose-1,6-P2, glycerate-2,3-P2, enolpyruvate-P, and acetyl CoA. From the amount of activity and the kinetic constants of the purified enzyme it seems likely that this enzyme is responsible for the glucose-1,6-P2 synthesis of brain."
https://openalex.org/W1594176651,"Neurospora NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase that was treated with iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, or N-ethylmaleimide to block the thiol groups was cleaved with cyanogen bromide. Of the expected 10 peptides, based on a methionine content of 9 residues, 8 were obtained in pure form and 2 were handled as a mixture. The fragments ranged in size from 9 to 109 residues. In addition, there were isolated 6 peptides, produced by anomalous cleavage at the carboxyl groups of tryptophan residues, and two by hydrolysis of an aspartyl-proline bond. Preliminary separation of these peptides was accomplished by gel filtration followed by either ion-exchange chromatography of the larger peptides or by paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis of the smaller fragments. Ordering of the CNBr fragments in sequence was based upon sequences of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides obtained in another laboratory. The complete sequence of the protein is presented. The amino acid sequences of the bovine and chicken liver glutamate dehydrogenases previously determined show considerable homology with the NADP-specific enzyme of Neurospora in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule; this includes the region of the specifically reactive lysine residue and the portion of the sequence that has been implicated in coenzyme binding. Particularly striking is the fact that most of the residues conserved among the three homologous proteins would be expected to be important for conformational, rather than catalytic, effects. This implies that the conformation of the Neurospora enzyme must be similar in parts of its structure to the vertebrate enzymes but undoubtedly differs in some regards."
https://openalex.org/W1675394660,"Adenylyl sulfate reductase has been purified from the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and judged to be homogenous by several criteria. Different forms of the enzyme could be visualized in polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis and these polymeric species have been studied by a combination of absorption spectra, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sedimentation velocity experiments. A dimeric species of molecular weight 440,000 is stable in potassium phosphate buffer but can be dissociated to a 220,000 molecular weight species by either changing the buffer system to Tris-maleate or addition of AMP, DAMP, or adenylyl sulfate. Other catalytically active nucleotides are not capable of effecting this dissociation. The enzyme was determined to contain 12 non-heme irons, 12 acid-labile sulfides, and 1 FAD per molecule when calculated on the basis of a monomeric molecular weight of 220,000. ;el electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated subunits of molecular weight 72,000 and 20,000. The extinction coefficient when determined in phosphate buffer at 372 nm is 108,000 M-1 cm-a. Steady state kinetic experiments employing ferricyanide, cytochrome c, and reduced methyl viologen as artificial electron transfer reagents were performed and the kinetic constants obtained under various conditions. Several nucleotide substrates were employed and compared in each assay with respect to Km and Vmax. The reduction of cytochrome c was found to be sensitive to both anaerobiosis and superoxide dismutase, suggesting the involvement of superoxide anions with this electron acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1526744355,"The kinetics of p-aminobenzoic acid oxidation catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase Compounds I and II was investigated intensively as a function of pH at 25 degrees in aqueous solutions of ionic strength 0.11. All of the rate data were collected from single turnover experiments involving reactions of a single enzyme compound. In reactions of both compounds, deviations from first order behavior with respect to the enzyme were observed at high pH values which were explained in terms of a free radical interaction of product with the enzyme. The effect could be eliminated with sufficient excess of substrate. Kinetic behavior which deviated from first order in substrate, observed at low pH, was explained by a mechanism involving an enzyme-substrate complex which reacted with an additional molecule of substrate but at a slower rate. The pH dependence of the second order rate constants for the reaction of p-aminobenzoic acid with free Compounds I and II is similar to results obtained for the comparable reactions of ferrocyanide, suggesting similar proton-transfer mechanisms for both reducing substrates. The reduction of Compound II by p-aminobenzoic acid appeared to be influenced by two ionizable groups on the enzyme which affect the electronic environment of the heme. The lack of influence of substrate ionizable groups on the rate of the Compound II reaction indicated that potential differences in reactivities of NH2C6H4COO- and NH2C6H4COOH were levelled by the diffusion-controlled limit in the acid region of pH. The reduction of Compound I by p-aminobenzoic acid was not diffusion-controlled and the rate-pH profile could be explained in terms of three acid ionizations, two on the substrate and one on Compound I."
https://openalex.org/W1524466095,"The kinetic mechanism of pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase action has been studied using steady state kinetic analysis. Initial velocity studies are consistent with an earlier suggestion that the enzyme catalyzes this reaction by a seven-site ping-pong mechanism. Although the range of substrate concentrations that could be used was limited by several factors, the initial velocity patterns showing the relationship between the substrates acetyl coenzyme CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH appear to be a series of parallel lines, regardless of which substrate is varied at fixed levels of a second substrate. However, two of the substrates, acetyl-CoA and malonly-CoA, apparently exhibit a competitive substrate inhibition with respect to each other, but NADPH shows no inhibition of any kind. Product inhibition patterns suggest that free CoA is competitive versus acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and is uncompetitive versus NADPH, and that NADP+ is competitive versus NADPH and uncompetitive versus acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA. These results are consistent with a seven-site ping-pong mechanism with intermediates covalently bound to 4'-phosphopantetheine (part of acyl carrier protein). Double competitive substrate inhibition by acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA is consistent with the rate equation derived for the over-all mechanism. The kinetic mechanism developed from these results is capable of explaining the formation of fatty acids from malonyl-CoA and NADPH alone (Katiyar, S. S., Briedis, A. V., and Porter, J. W. (1974) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 162, 412-420) and also the formation of triacetic acid lactone from either malonyl-CoA alone or acetyl-CoA plus malonyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W2137025662,"Since 1938 mammalian succinate dehydrogenase has been thought to contain thiol groups at the active site. This hypothesis was questioned recently, because irreversible inhibition by bromopyruvate and N-ethylmaleimide appeared not to satisfy the requisite criteria for reaction at the active site. These recent observations of incomplete inactivation of succinate dehydrogenase by N-ethylmaleimide and incomplete protection by substrates can, however, be explained adequately by the presence of oxalacetate and other strong competitors of the inactivation process in the enzyme used in these studies. Substrates, competitive inhibitors, and anions which activate succinate dehydrogenase protect the enzyme from inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by N-ethylmaleimide involves at least two second order reactions which are pH dependent, with pKa values of 8.0 to 8.2. This pH dependence, the known reactivity of N-ethylmaleimide toward thiols, and the protection by substrate and competitive inhibitors indicate that sulfhydryl residues are required for catalytic activity and perform an essential, not secondary, role in the catalysis. Just as the presence of tightly bound oxalacetate prevents inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, alkylation of the sulfhydryl residue(s) at the active site prevents the binding of [14C]oxalacetate. Thus, these thiol groups at the active site also may be the site of tight binding of oxalacetate during the activation-deactivation cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1894848241,"Exposure of pepsinogen to acid for less than 2 min yields a product with proteolytic activity. This activity is due to intramolecular and intermolecular formation of pepsin from pepsinogen. We find no evidence for intermolecular proteolytic activity in the zymogen. These conclusions are based upon two sets of experiments. First, chemical cleavage of pepsinogen during short activation is demonstrated by quantitative analysis of the NH2-terminal 2 residues of the pepsin and pepsinogen in an activation mixture. In addition, quantitative NH2-terminal analyses after activation under different conditions confirm our previous inference that the product of unimolecular pepsinogen activation is homogeneous whereas bimolecular activation produces a pepsin product with a variety of NH2 termini. Second, spectral changes which occur upon acidification of a pepsinogen solution and are reversed by neutralization are shown to be consistent with the chemical cleavage of pepsinogen during acidification. The first order rate constant for pepsinogen activation, calculated from these spectral experiments, agrees well with the value we had determined previously."

The acyl-P compound is formed catalytically as judged by the quantity of radioactive alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvalerate produced compared to the concentration of enzyme subunits. Formation of the glutamyl-P compound occurs in the presence of magnesium or manganous ions, and the relation of this apparent lack of metal ion specificity with regard to the highly specific Mg2+-supported biosynthetic activity of the unadenylylated form is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585229138,"The bulk (60 to 65%) of the neuraminidase activity present in rat liver homogenates was found in the M + L (mitochondria plus lysosomes) fraction, The patterns of subcellular distribution were essentially identical whether disialogangliosides or neuramin-lactose (2 yields 3') were utilized as substrates. A new neuraminidase, which hydrolyzes sialyl trisaccharides but which does not act upon glycoproteins and gangliosides, was detected in Golgi apparatus. Unlike the other particulate neuraminidases of rat liver, the Golgi enzyme is stimulated by prior incubation and by the addition of Ca2+ or Zn2+ at 1 mM concentration. Although plasma membrane-rich fractions are often contaminated by Golgi membranes the marked differences in their enzymic properties allowed a clear distinction between the neuraminidases present in these two types of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1563812432,"Thioredoxin from Escherichia coli B and phage T4-infected E. coli B are small hydrogen carrier proteins which in their reduced forms are specific hydrogen donors to E. coli and T4-induced ribonucleotide reductase, respectively. The oxidation-reduction active group of both thioredoxins consists of a single cystine residue which is reduced to sulfhydryl form by NADPH in the presence of E. coli thioredoxin reductase. Reduction of T4 thioredoxin-S2 to thioredoxin-(SH)2 led to a 3-fold increase in the quantum yield of tyrosine fluorescence. By using the spectrofluorimetric properties of T4 thioredoxin and E. coli thioredoxin as markers for their oxidized and reduced forms we have shown that E. coli thioredoxin reductase catalyzed the reaction: (see article) whose equilibrium constant favors formation of E. coli thioredoxin-S2 and T4 thioredoxin-(SH)2. This finding suggests that in the T4-infected cell most of the deoxyribonucleotides required for the viral DNA might be synthesized by the T4-induced ribonucleotide reductase while the host ribonucleotide reductase is inactive due to the shortage of reduced E. coli thioredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1570095717,"Ferritin was dissociated into subunits by various denaturants and the subunits were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Human, horse, rat, and rabbit ferritins all exhibited characteristic patterns of heterogeneity; components with molecular weights of about 19,000, 11,000, and 8,000 were invariably found in these preparations. This result contradicts earlier reports that ferritin consists of 24 identical subunits. These polypeptides were isolated, purified in the presence of low concentrations of detergent, and characterized. Evidence based on amino acid compositions, NH2-terminal analysis and investigation of detergent-induced breakdown products, indicated that the 19,000 molecular weight component is a composite of the 8,000 and 11,000 molecular weight chains. Circular dichroism studies showed that the 19,000 molecular weight polypeptide retained appreciable amounts of ordered secondary structure whereas the two lower molecular weight peptides were unfolded to a much greater extent. If the 8,000 and 11,000 molecular weight polypeptides were recombined in equimolar amounts and the denaturant was completely removed, a substance with electrophoretic mobility and morphological appearance of native apoferritin was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1542542098,"Light density membranes derived from the microsomal fraction of rat skeletal muscle contained an endogenous protein kinase which catalyzed the phosphorylation of an endogenous membrane substrate. No other membrane fraction contained any significant protein kinase activity. The optimal specific activity of the enzyme in these membranes was 350 pmol/mg/min. The endogenous muscle membrane protein kinase required magnesium, was stimulated by micromolar concentrations of calcium, had a pH optimum between 7.0 and 7.5, and demonstrated a K-m for ATP of 2.6 times 10 minus 5 M. The enzyme was markedly heat labile and demonstrated a linear Arrhenius plot with an apparent energy of activation of 12,100 cal/mol. There was no stimulation by cyclic nucleotides; and neither monovalent cations nor various neurotransmitters exerted any effect. It is presently unclear where the membranes exhibiting protein phosphorylation are localized within the muscle fiber. Enzyme markers suggest that these membranes are not derived from sarcolemma or sarcoplasmic reticulum but may originate in transverse tubules. The membrane phosphorylation was largely confined to a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 28,000. Phosphorylation could also be detected in a lower molecular weight substrate as well as two polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 95,000 and 56,000. The M-r-28,000 endogenous protein kinase substrate was isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. High voltage electrophoresis of a partial acid hydrolysate of the phosphorylated M-r-28,000 substrate identified the phosphate bond to be that of phosphoserine. The amino acid composition of the substrate was neither strongly acidic nor basic. It had a high content of glycine, glutamic acid, serine, and lysine. Hydrophobic residues constituted only 45% of the total composition. Following muscle denervation for 10 days, there was a significant decrease in the amount of the M-r-28,000 polypeptide as well as the extent of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1544318707,"Co-solvent and temperature effects on the pK of histidine (imidazolium) residue 46 of trypsin, as well as of weak electrolytes (buffers), which have been reported in two preceding papers, can be satisfactorily explained in terms of enthalpy-entropy compensation patterns. Such patterns have been generated for various mixed solvents between 20 degrees and minus 20 degrees and minus 50 degrees. Under these conditions compensation temperature, T-c, is strongly dependent on the nature of the ionizable group studied: 240 plus or minus 10 K for neutral acids and 310 plus or minus 5 K for cationic acids. This work focuses on the possibilities offered and on the problems raised by the use of this methodology as a tool in the investigation of the active site of enzymes. Furthermore, it is shown in the case of histidine residue 46 of trypsin that the co-solvent effect vanishes at the compensation temperature, a result of great practical significance if applicable to any ionizable group at the active site of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1570913526,"The fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.11) from the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus licheniformis was purified approximately 800-fold (with a 20% yield of activity) by a procedure that included ammonium sulfate precipitation, precipitation by MnCl2, and gamma-alumina gel absorption. Catalysis by this enzyme in vitro was specific for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Km of approximately 20 muM) and proceeded optimally at pH 8.0 to 8.5. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was found to be rapidly inactivated by incubation in the presence of AMP or in the absence of Mn2+. The AMP inactivation was prevented by adding P-enolpyruvate to the incubation mixture. The enzyme was slowly inactivated when incubated in the presence of stabilizing concentrations of Mn2+ (5 mM) at protein concentrations of less than 8 mg of protein per ml. An additional system is produced during sporulation which specifically inactivates fructose bisphosphatase in vitro. This system, which is distinctly different from the AMP inactivating system, can be blocked by P-enolpyruvate. This fructose bisphosphatase, like fructose bisphosphatases from other sources, was strongly inhibited by AMP, exhibiting a Ki of approximately 5 muM. This inhibition, however, could be completely overcome by P-enolpyruvate. P-enolpyruvate was also found to be an activator of the enzyme and exhibited a Km of approximately 2 muM. This activation was prevented in a competitive manner by AMP, exhibiting a Ki of approximately 5 muM. No other effector of fructose bisphosphatase was identified in an extensive search. The specific activity of fructose bisphosphatase in crude extracts was found to be independent of the stage of the life cycle of the bacterium or of the nature of the carbon-energy source supporting growth. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that no new species of fructose biphosphatase is produced during gluconeogenic growth or sporulation. The enzyme extracted from cells under a variety of physiological conditions exhibited a molecular weight of about 5 times 10-5 as determined by sucrose density centrifugation. Therefore, it is proposed that a single constitutively synthesized fructose bisphosphatase is present in B. licheniformis. Measurements of the intracellular level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate indicate that the variation in the level of substrate throughout growth (1 mM) and sporulation (0.3 mM) does not regulate the in vivo activity of this enzyme, since the Km of the enzyme for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is approximately 10-fold lower than the lowest in vivo concentration of substrate. P-enolpyruvate is proposed as the major regulator of fructose bisphosphatase activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1481572597,"The purified enzyme xanthosine-5'-monophosphate (XMP) aminase from Escherichia coli strain B-96 is shown to possess catalytic activity with either glutamine or ammonia as a substrate. This enzyme, which possesses identical subunits, has the following properties: (a) a pH optimum of 8.3 for both aminase and amidotransferase; (b) an apparent K-m for both glutamine and NH3 of 1 mM; (c) an amidotransferase that is approximately 2 times more active than the aminase; (d) a linear relationship between velocity and enzyme concentrationfor both activities; (e) inhibition of both activities by the glutamine analogue 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, but the amidotransferase is more sensitive than the aminase; and (f) inhbiition of both activities by the adenosine analogue, psicofuranine, but again the amidotransferase activity is more sensitive than the aminase. The so-called XMP aminase from the E. coli mutant B-24-1 also has been examined in both crude extracts nad ammonium sulfate fractions and the following data have been obtained: (a) both preparations of enzyme contain aminase and amidotransferase activity; (b) both activities have the same substrate requirements; (c) the pH optima for both activities in the crude extract are identical with those found with the purified enzyme preparation; and (d) the amidotransferase activity in the crude extract and the ammonium sulfate fractions is 2- to 3-fold more active than the aminase. These data demonstrate that this enzyme from E. coli is not strictly a XMP aminase but is, in fact, an amidotransferase capable of utilizing either glutamine or NH3 as a substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1612160805,"The DPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase of pig heart is totally and irreversibly inactivated by 0.05 M potassium cyanate at pH 7.4 A plot of the rate constant versus cyanate concentration is not linear, but rather exhibits saturation kinetics, implying that cyanate may bind to the enzyme to give an enzyme-cyanate complex (K equal 0.125 M) prior to the covalent reaction. In the presence of manganous ion the addition of isocitrate protects the enzyme against cyanate inactivation, indicating that chemical modification occurs in the active site region of the enzyme. The dependence of the decrease of the rate constant for inactivation on the isocitrate concentration yields a dissociation constant for the enzyme-manganese-isocitrate complex which agrees with the Michaelis constant. The allosteric activator ADP, which lowers the Michaelis constant for isocitrate, does not itself significantly affect the cyanate reaction; however, it strikingly enhances the protection by isocitrate. The addition of the chelator EDTA essentially prevents protection by isocitrate and manganous ion, demonstrating the importance of the metal ion in this process. The substrate alpha-ketoglutarate and the coenzymes DPN and DPNH do not significantly affect the rate of modification of the enzymes by cyanate. Incubation of isocitrate dehydrogenase with 14C-labeled potassium cyanate leads to the incorporation of approximately 1 mol of radioactive cyanate per peptide chain concomitant with inactivation. Analysis of acid hydrolysates of the radioactive enzyme reveals that lysyl residues are the sole amino acids modified. These results suggest that cyanate, or isocyanic acid, may bind to the active site of this enzyme as an analogue of carbon dioxide and carbamylate a lysyl residue at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1512290918,"Glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (from Escherichia coli) was previously shown to be composed of a light subunit (molecular weight similar to 42,000) which has the binding site for glutamine and a heavy subunit (molecular weight similar to 130,000) which has binding sites for the other reactants and allosteric effectors. The subunits may be separated with retention of catalytic activities; only the separated light subunit exhibits glutaminase activity. The previous finding that storage of the native enzyme at pH 9 at 0 degrees increased its glutaminase activity by about 25-fold was further investigated; such storage markedly decreased the glutamine- and ammonia-dependent synthetase activities of the enzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate led to transient increase of glutaminase activity followed by inhibition. When the enzyme was treated with N-ethylmaleimide or with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), the glutaminase activity was increased by about 250-fold with concomitant loss of synthetase activities. The enhancement of glutaminase produced by storage of the enzyme at pH 9 was associated with intermolecular disulfide bond formation and aggregation of the enzyme. Aggregation also was observed after extensive treatment of the enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) or N-ethylmaleimide. However, a moderate increase of glutaminase activity (about 30-fold) was observed without aggregation under conditions in which one sulfhydryl group on the light subunit reacted with either reagent. The findings suggest that the increased glutaminase activities observed here are associated with structural changes in the enzyme in which the intersubunit relationship is altered so as to uncouple the catalytic functions of the enzyme and to facilitate access of water to the glutamine binding site on the light subunit."

(1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 201, 513-516). An enzyme has been isolated from this organism which is responsible for the synthesis of N-methylalanine. The stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme leads to the following formulation: Methylamine + pyruvate + NADPH + H-+ yields N-methylalanine + NADP-+ + H2O. This enzyme has been physically separated from alanine dehydrogenase, which is also present in these extracts. This new enzyme has been named N-methylalanine dehydrogenase. It has been purified to near homogeneity as judged by disc gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration chromatography showed that N-methylalanine dehydrogenase has an apparent molecular weight of 77,000, while electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gave rise to a single band with a molecular weight of approximately 36,500. The enzyme is optimally active in the pH range between 8.2 and 8.6. The apparent K-m values for pyruvate, NADPH, and methylamine, respectively, are 1-5 times 10 minus 2 M, 3-5 times 10 minus 5 M, and 7.5 times 10 minus 2 M."
https://openalex.org/W1491239499,"Abstract Isoelectric focusing was used as the final step in the isolation of thymidine phosphorylase which was found to have an isoelectric point of 4.1. Analytical acrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the purified enzyme preparation contained one major protein band which stained for thymidine phosphorylase activity and usually a minor, faster migrating band devoid of activity. Inactivation of thymidine phosphorylase alone or in the presence of sensitizers by ultraviolet light, primarily at 253.7 nm, followed first order inactivation kinetics. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme was the same at pH 5 and 7.4 and the addition of various pyrimidine bases and nucleosides enhanced the inactivation rate at both pH values, but to a greater extent at pH 5. Linear plots of inactivation rates versus concentrations of thymidine or thymine were the same. At 7.8 mM thymidine or thymine, 11- and 4.4-fold increases in photoinactivation of thymidine phosphorylase were observed at pH 5 AND 7.4 RESPECTIVELY. Parabolic curves were obtained with increasing concentrations of either 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine or 5-iodouracil. 5-Iodouracil at 5.2 mM caused 212- (pH 5) and 100- (pH 7.4) FOLD INCREASES IN THE RATES OF PHOTOINACTIVATION OF THYMIDINE PHOSPHORYLASE. However, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine at 5.0mM only enhanced the photoinactivation of enzyme by factors of 83 (pH 5) and 21 (pH 7.4). Neither 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine or 5-bromo-uracil was as potent in sensitizing the enzyme as the iodo analogs. Combinations of 5-iodouracil or 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine with thymine resulted in higher inactivation rates than the additive inactivation rates of individual compounds, whereas combinations of either iodo analog with thymidine resulted in lower inactivation rates. Increasing concentrations of phosphate or NaCl lessened the photoinactivation rate of thymidine phosphorylase alone and protected the enzyme from the sensitization caused by the different bases and nucleosides. No quantitative changes in the number of primary amino groups in thymidine phosphorylase was evident as a result of irradiation in the presence or absence of 5-iodouracil or 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. Examination of the irradiated enzyme on Sephadex G-150 indicated that a larger protein species is formed and that 5-iodouracil promotes this process."
https://openalex.org/W1574976876,"A titratable exchangeable proton resonance assignable to a histidine imidazole ring N--H proton is observed approximately minus 15 ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane. The chemical shift of this resonance is affected by sulfonamide and anion inhibitors, and by removal of zinc or replacement of zinc by cobalt, indicating that the proton is located at or near the active site. The pH dependence of the chemical shift of this resonance, which is abolished by inhibitors, reflects the titration of a group with a pK-a of 7.3 in human carbonic anhydrase B and smaller than or equal to 7.1 in human carbonic anhydrase C. These pK-a values are interpreted to be due to the ionization of a neutral imidazole to form the imidazolate anion coordinated to zinc. A mechanism for enzymatic catalysis involving reversible deprotonation and coordination of a histidine to the metal is consistent with these studies."

This complex which possesses both polymerase activity and a virus-specific endonuclease synthesizes exclusively virus-specific sequences in vitro by a semiconservative mechanism. Analysis by rate zonal sedimentation in alkaline sucrose gradients showed that the products of the reaction are small chains approximately 6 to 9 S, presumably Okazaki intermediates, that are not sealed under our in vitro conditions. Analysis by rate zonal sedimentation in neutral sucrose gradients showed that labeled viral fragments are hydrogen bonded to viral 18 S segments, 0.25 the size of the linear, viral 31 S genome. The 18 S is probably a specific cleavage product of the viral endonuclease found in the replication complex and could represent intermediates in viral replication or degradation products."
https://openalex.org/W1580762092,"Wheat seedling nuclease catalyzes the hydrolysis of intact, bihelical viral DNA or high molecular weight, native Escherichia coli DNA to produce limit polymers which are resistant to further hydrolysis by additional enzyme. These limit products are double-stranded polymers free of single strand interruptions and are terminated at their 5' ends with equal amounts of either deoxycytidylate or deoxyguanylate residues. The average size of the duplex limit products, as determined by (a) alkaline and neutral sucrose gradient sedimentation, (b) viscometric determination of molecular weight, and (c) 5'-end labeling, varies from 2 to 4 times 10-6 depending on the source of the DNA. The involvement of regions rich in adenine-thymine base pairs at the sites of cleavage of the DNA molecule is suggested by the following experimental results: (a) the copolymeric duplex, poly(dA-dt) is hydrolyzed at a rate comparable to that found for denatured calf thymus DNA, a rate which is several orders of magnitude faster than that at which native calf thymus DNA is hydrolyzed; (b) lambda DNA, which contains an adenine-thymine-rich region near its center, is rapidly cleaved to yield two fragments of similar size; (c) the rate of hydrolysis of native DNA is increased approximately 14-fold by increasing the reaction temperature from 20 degrees to 30 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1590367475,"Hemoglobins (Hb) Yakima and Kempsey were purified from patients' blood with diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography. The oxygen equilibrium curves of the two hemoglobins and the effects of organic phosphates on the function were investigated. In 0.1 M phosphate buffer, Hill's constants n for Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were 1.0 to 1.1 at the pH range for 6.5 to 8.0 and the oxygen affinities of both the mutant hemoglobins were about 15 to 20 times that of Hb A at pH 7.0. The Bohr effect was normal in Hb Yakima and one-fourth normal in Hb Kempsey. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, the oxygen affinities to Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were greatly decreased, and an interesting result revealed that these hemoglobins showed clear cooperativity in oxygen binding. Hill's constant n in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate was 1.9 for Hb Kempsey and 2.3 for Hb Yakima at pH 7.0. The cooperativities of these mutant hemoglobins were pH-dependent, and Hb Kempsey showed high cooperativity at low pH (n equal 2.1 at pH 6.6) and low cooperativity at high pH (n equal 1.0 at pH 8.0). Hb Yakima showed similar pH dependence in cooperativity. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, Hb A showed a pH-dependent cooperativity different from those of Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, namely, Hill's n was the highest in alkaline pH (n equal 3.0 at pH 8.0) and decreased at lower pH (n equal 1.5 at pH 6.5). 2,3Diphosphoglycerate bound with the deoxygenated Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, however, had no effect on the oxygen binding of these abnormal hemoglobin. The pH-dependent cooperativity of alpha1beta2 contact anomalous hemoglobin and normal hemoglobin was explained by the shifts in the equilibrium between the high and low ligand affinity forms."
https://openalex.org/W1487119586,"Circular dichroism spectra and circular dichroism difference spectra, generated when porcine heart mitochondrial and supernatant malate dehydrogenase bind coenzymes or when enzyme dihydroincotinamide nucleotide binary complexes bind substrate analogs, are presented. No significant changes are observed in protein chromophores in the 200- to 240-nm spectral range indicating that there is apparently little or no perturbation of the alpha helix or peptide backbone when binary or ternary complexes are formed. Quite different spectral perturbances occur in the two enzymes with reduced coenzyme binding as well as with substrate-analog binding by enzyme-reduced coenzyme binding. Comparison of spectral perturbations in both enzymes with oxidized or reduced coenzyme binding suggests that the dihydronicotinamide moiety of the coenzyme interacts with or perturbs indirectly the environment of aromatic amino acid residues. Reduced coenzyme binding apparently perturbs tyrosine residues in both mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase. Reduced coenzyme binding perturbs tyrosine and tryptophan residues in supernatant malate dehydrogenase. The number of reduced coenzyme binding sites was determined to be two per 70,000 daltons in the mitochondrial enzyme, and the reduced coenzyme dissociation constants, determined through the change in ellipticity at 260 nm, with dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide binding, were found to be good agreement with published values (Holbrook, J. J., and Wolfe, R. G. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 2499-2502) obtained through fluorescence-binding studies and indicate no apparent extra coenzyme binding sites. When D-malate forms a ternary complex with malate dehydrogenase-reduced coenzyme complexes, perturbation of both adenine and dihydronicotinamide chromophores is evident. L-Malate binding, however, apparently produces only a perturbation of the adenine chromophore in such complexes. Since the coenzyme has been found to bind in an open conformation on the surface of the enzyme and the substrate analogs bind at or very near the dihydronicotinamide moiety binding site, protein conformational changes are implicated during ternary complex formation with D-malate which can effect the adenine chromophore at some distance from the substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1509761173,"The reversible complex between the metalloenzyme bovine carbonic anhydrase B and the sulfonamide inhibitor acetazolamide can be frozen irreversibly by the addition of a covalent bond between the methyl group of the inhibitor and the tau-nitrogen of histidine-64. In both cases the inhibited enzyme is inactive as an esterase toward p-nitrophenyl propionate at physiological pH but retains activity controlled by an ionization in the protein exhibiting a pK-a greater than 10. Similarly, both the covalently and reversibly inhibited enzymes in which the catalytically essential Zn(II) ion has been replaced with Co(II) display the same visible absorption spectrum which is invariant over the pH range from 5 to 12. The evidence therefore indicates that the position of the acetazolamide moiety in the active site is independent of both pH and the presence of the covalent bond to histidine-64. Moreover, when reversibly bound, this inhibitor has been shown to replace the water molecule (or hydroxide ion) known to occupy the fourth coordination position of the metal ion and frequently implicated in the catalytic mechanism of carbonic anhydrases. Thus, the activity exhibited by the inhibited enzymes and consequently the second rise observed in the pH rate profile of the native enzyme above pH 0 cannot reflect the ionization of such a water molecule in contrast to what has been postulated previously (Pocker, Y., and Storm, D. R. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 1202-1214). Displacement of the zinc-bound solvent molecule rather than the alkylation of histidine-64 is suggested, however, as the cause of the inactivation of the alkylated enzyme round neutrality. Taken together, the biphasic pH rate profile of native bovine carbonic anhydrase B as well as the activity retained by the alkylated enzyme above pH 9 are best described by a model in which two groups in the enzyme ionize independently, thereby raising the possibility that the high pH activity is controlled by an ionization outside the active site region of the enzyme. Above pH 9.5 the pK; for the reversible interaction between native carbonic anhydrase and acetazolamide falls off linearly with increasing pH. The slope of --1.56 suggests that, among other factors, more than one ionization is responsible for the descending limb of the pH-i-pH profile."
https://openalex.org/W1576069970,"Rat testis tissue receptor assays were utilized to study the kinetics of dissociation of human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) and luteinizing hormone (hLH) under varying conditions of urea concentration and pH. In these competitive protein binding assays, 125I-hFSH and 125I-hLH were the radioligands and hormone dissociation was followed by a decrease in the ability of the dissociating hormone to inhibit uptake of the radioligand by tissue receptors. Rate data for dissociation of the gonadotropins were analyzed for quality of fit to first or second order integrated rate equations by nonlinear regression analysis. Treatment of hFSH with 4 M urea at pH 8 and 25 degrees for 22 hours did not result in significant dissociation, whereas in 8 M urea, over 90% dissociation was observed. The rate of dissociation of hFSH in 8 M urea was increased approximately 4-fold by raising the temperature from 25 to 37 degrees. Similar results were obtained when dissociation of hFSH was followed through use of an accepted whole animal bioassay for FSH, thus confirming the reliability of the tissue receptor assay for such dissociation studies. Kinetic studies showed that hFSH was undissociated by incubation in 6 M urea of pH 8 after 4 hours at 25 degrees. In contrast, hLH was 90% dissociated under similar conditions. This differential rate of inactivation of hLH allowed preparation of hFSH having significant reduced levels of contaminating LH activity, as determined by tissue receptor assays and by whole animal bioassays. Marked differences were noted in the rate of dissociation of hFSH and hLH under acid conditions. hFSH completely dissociated after approximately 2 min of incubation of pH 2 (25 degrees), and over 90% dissociated after 15 min of incubation at pH 3. In contrast, hLH was dissociated 60% after 20 min of incubation at pH 2 (25 degrees) and 40% dissociated after 60 min at pH 3. Neither hormone was significantly dissociated at pH 4.4 after 60 min, but hFSH showed a slightly greater rate of dissociation than did LH in the period between 1 and 23 hours of incubation at that pH. hFSH and hLH were relatively resistant to dissociation after incubation at pH 12 for 1 hour, bu;t dissociated significantly after incubation for 22 hours at that pH. The time course for dissociation of hFSH or hLH under the various conditions described above did not conform clearly to either first or second order kinetics, indicating that the over-all dissociation process represents a mixed order reaction. It appears that urea or acid-induced denaturation of one or both subunits of hLH and hFSH may occur prior to their dissociation. The very rapid rate of dissociation at acid pH values, particularly of hFSH, indicate that ionic interactions contribute importantly to the subunit association phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1552426952,"The oxidation-reduction equilibrium of the gamma chains of human fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) has been studied and compared with that of the alpha and beta chains of human adult hemoglobin (Hb A). The effects of the sulfhydryl (--SH) reagents, iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and p-mercuribenzoate (PMB), on the three kinds of chains and on Hb F have been compared. The midpoint potentials (E-m) of all three sorts of chains are lower than those of tetrameric hemoglobin A or F. The E-m values of alpha chains are the lowest, E-m = 0.049 volt at 6 degrees, and are unaffected by pH change or by PMB treatment, at least from pH 6 to 8. The E-m values of beta-SH chains are higher; E-m = 0.102 volt at pH 7, decreasing to 0.050 volt at pH 8, both at 6 degrees. These results agree with those of Banerjee and Cassoly ((1969) J. Mol. Biol. 42, 337-349). They reported no of PMB on beta chains, but we find that 2 eq of PMB/chain raise E--M to 0.139 volt at pH 7 at 6 degrees, chiefly as the result of reaction at beta-93, not at beta-112. Carboxymethylation at beta-93 has an insignificant compared with that of PMB. The oxidation-reduction potential of gamma chains is similar to that of beta chains. E-m = 0.098 volt at pH 7 at 6 degrees, decreasing to 0.064 at pH 8 and 0.010 at pH 9. The effects of --SH reagents, reacting at position gamma-93 (the only --SH group present in gamma chains), are essentially the same as those seen with beta chains. The oxidation-reduction potential of Hb F is almost identical with that of Hb A, except for being 0.008 volt lower at pH 6 at 6 degrees. This agrees with the results reported by Flohe and Uehleke ((1966) Life Sci. 5, 1041-1045). PMB or iodoacetamide treatment lowers E-m by 0.02 to 0.03 volt, depending on the pH, from 6 to 9, in much the same way as previously reported for Hb A(Brunori, M., Taylor, J.F., Antonini, E., Wyman, J., and Rossi-Fanelli, A. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 2295-2300). The residual oxidation Bohr effect noted in Hb F can be attributed to the oxidation Bohr of the gamma chains. The apparent pK of the heme-linked water molecule was found at 25 degrees to be, for Hb F, 8.1; for gamma-SH chains, 7.85; for gamma-PMB chains, 8.35; and for gamma chains treated with iodoacetate, 7.80. Sedimentation coefficients, s-20, w, at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml, were found to be, for fetal hemoglobin 4.09, for iodoacetamide-treated fetal hemoglobin 4.04, for PMB-treated fetal hemoglobin 3.41, for fetal gamma-SH chains 4.25, and for fetal gamma-PMB chains 3.08."

https://openalex.org/W1541577950,"Abstract The phospholipid composition of the electron transport particles and coupling factor-depleted electron transport particles of Mycobacterium phlei are the same, but they differ in contents. The accessibility of partially purified phospholipase A to these membrane phospholipids was found to be different. Treatment of membranes of Mycobacterium phlei with phospholipase A impairs the rate of oxidation as well as phosphorylation. The inhibition of phosphorylation can be reversed by washing the membranes with defatted bovine serum albumin. The reconstitution of membrane-bound coupling factor-latent ATPase activity to phospholipase A-treated depleted electron transport particles and their capacity to couple phosphorylation to oxidation of substrates remained unaffected after phospholipase A treatment. However, the pH gradient as measured by bromthymol blue was not restored after reconstitution of phospholipase A-treated depleted electron transport particles with membrane-bound coupling factor-latent ATPase. These findings show that the phosphorylation coupled to the oxidation of substrates can take place without a pronounced pH gradient in these membrane vesicles. The dye 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) exhibited low levels of energized and nonenergized fluorescence in phospholipase A-treated membranes. This decrease in the level of ANS fluorescence in phospholipase A-treated membranes was found to be directly related to the amount of phospholipids cleaved. The decrease in the energy-dependent ANS response in phospholipase A-treated electron transport particles, as compared with untreated electron transport particles, was shown to be a result of a change in the apparent K-d of the dye-membrane complex, and of a decrease in the number of irreversible or slowly reversible binding sites, with no change in the relative quantum efficiency of the dye. The decrease in ANS fluorescence in phospholipase A-treated particles appears to be due to a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1545768455,"The behavior of holo-retinol-binding protein (RBP) from human plasma at alkaline pH was examined by absorption and circular dichroism measurements. Between pH 7.5 and 11.7 the ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl groups is reversible. However, there is a gradual irreversible loss of retinol as the pH is raised. After 4 hours at pH 11.7, 13 percent of retinol is lost from retinol-RBP. Alkaline titration of apo-RBP was time-independent and reversible between pH 7.5 and 11.7. The titration data of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in apo-RBP could be fitted with a single theoretical ionization curve of 8.6 phenolic groups having an apparent pK of 11. Acetylation of retinol-RBP with 10-fold molar excess of N-acetylimidazole over tyrosine resulted in the acetylation of all lysine residues and in the acetylation of 0.9 to 1.3 tyrosyl residues per molecule (out of eight). Acetylation of retinol-RBP, APO-RBP, and retinol-RBP-prealbumin complex with 50-fold molar excess of N-acetylimidazole resulted, again, with all of the lysine residues being acetylated and between 1.8 and 2.8 tyrosyl residues per molecule being acetylated. The acetylation did not affect the interaction between retinol and RBP. However, acetylation disrupted the normal binding between retinol-RBP and prealbumin. Deacetylation of tyrosyl residues with hydroxylamine failed to restore the normal binding of retinol-RBP to prealbumin. This excludes the acetylated tyrosyl-residues from being involved in the binding between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1534737124,"Ultraviolet difference spectroscopy has been used to study the binding of the transition state analog saccharo-1,4-lactone to purified rat preputial gland beta-glucuronidase. At pH 4.5 (the pH optimum), the inhibitor induces a difference spectrum indicative of a change in the environment of tryptophyl residues. Based on the magnitude of the induced difference spectrum as a quantitative measure of inhibitor binding, a titration curve for saccharo-1,4-lactone was obtained. A Scatchard plot of the titration data indicates that 4 molecules of inhibitor bind to the enzyme tetramer at a K-I of 4 times 10-7 M. The inhibitor also induces a similar difference spectrum at pH 7.5, although the binding is considerably weaker at this pH than at pH 4.5. When the native enzyme at pH 4.5 is compared with the native enzyme at pH 7.5, a difference spectrum, distinct from that of the binding of saccharo-1,4-lactone, is observed, indicating that the enzyme exists in different conformations at these pH values. The indication that tryptophyl residues are perturbed upon binding of saccharo-1,4-lactone was supported by studies carried out with N-bromosuccinimide. At pH 4.3, this reagent was found to oxidize 6 tryptophyl residues in the native enzyme but only three in the saccharo-1,4-lactone-inhibited enzyme. A spectrophotometric titration of the enzyme indicated that of the 33 tyrosyl residues per subunit, only 5 to 6 ionize at the pK expected for free phenolic groups."
https://openalex.org/W1502129755,"A protein which can render DNA largely acid-soluble has been purified 1600-fold from high salt extracts of Ustilago maydis. The activity is unusual in that substrate DNA is not made acid-soluble through hydrolysis to small oligomers. Rather, the protein appears to bind to DNA to form a complex which itself is acid-soluble. The activity of conversion of DNA to an acid-soluble form is cold-labile, but the inactivation by cold is reversible by brief heat treatment. Divalent cations stimulate the activity; phosphate is inhibitory. Optimal activity is observed at pH 6.0 and again at pH 9.0. Nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates stimulate activity at low protein concentrations but are not hydrolyzed during the course of reaction. The protein behaves anomalously on gel filtration columns and is completely excluded by Sephadex or agarose gels. When analyzed by sedimentation velocity, the protein was found to sediment at 5.3 S, the same rate at which a globular protein of 65,000 daltons would sediment. Dependence of activity upon protein concentrations is sigmoidal. K+ and to a lesser degree NH4+ are partially effective in abolishing the lag in the concentration curve. The protein displays a saturation curve when exposed to increasing DNA concentrations. Such a curve could only result from a non-random or cooperative mode of binding of the protein to DNA. A mutant sensitive to gamma and ultraviolet radiation with an abnormally high level of the protein has been found. Haploid populations of the mutant grow slowly and contain a large proportion (10 to 20%) of inviable cells. Diploids are defective in mitotic allelic recombination and fail to complete meiosis. It is speculated that the protein may be important in the regulation of chromosome condensation."
https://openalex.org/W1597614865,"A new enzyme, galactose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been purified about 50-fold from goat liver. The enzyme can be distinguished from the nonspecific hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by its high substrate specificity and absolute pyridine nucleotide requirement. In contrast to the hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, this enzyme is located exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell. The enzyme is a metalloprotein and is highly sensitive to mercurials. The product of the reaction is possibly a ketoaldose, phosphorylated at the primary alcoholic group."

https://openalex.org/W1496273898,"A group of abundant (15% of the soluble protein) nonhemoglobin proteins was isolated from the primitive (embryonic) red cells found in tadpoles, using the cationic properties of the proteins at pH 8.6 to separate them from hemoglobin and other red cell proteins. The cathodal proteins (CP) were resolved into five components, and the two most predominant proteins were separated and characterized. Purified CP-1b and CP-2 had an amino acid composition similar to that of unfractionated cathodal proteins and to each other, except for small variations in the lysine and half-cystine content. The molecular weight of the purified CP-1b and CP-2 was 13 to 14,000, determined by gel filtration chromatography and electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cathodal proteins were immunologically related although there were quantitative differences in reactivity. The concentration of cathodal proteins in primitive (embryonic) red cells was 100 times that in definitive (adult) red cells coincided with the replacement of primitive red cells. The synthesis of the cathodal proteins appeared to continue throughout the life of the primitive red cells; when hemoglobin synthesis declined in primitive red cells, approximately half of the protein synthesized by the cells was cathodal protein. Although the function of the cathodal proteins is as yet unknown, the data suggest that the cathodal proteins are a unique characteristic of erythroid differentiation in early development."
