https://openalex.org/W2147068163,"T cells that accompany allogeneic hematopoietic grafts for treating leukemia enhance engraftment and mediate the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Unfortunately, alloreactive T cells also cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). T cell depletion prevents GVHD but increases the risk of graft rejection and leukemic relapse. In human transplants, we show that donor-versus-recipient natural killer (NK)-cell alloreactivity could eliminate leukemia relapse and graft rejection and protect patients against GVHD. In mice, the pretransplant infusion of alloreactive NK cells obviated the need for high-intensity conditioning and reduced GVHD. NK cell alloreactivity may thus provide a powerful tool for enhancing the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2090800524,"In situ transmission electron microscopy is used to obtain atom-resolved images of copper nanocrystals on different supports. These are catalysts for methanol synthesis and hydrocarbon conversion processes for fuel cells. The nanocrystals undergo dynamic reversible shape changes in response to changes in the gaseous environment. For zinc oxide-supported samples, the changes are caused both by adsorbate-induced changes in surface energies and by changes in the interfacial energy. For copper nanocrystals supported on silica, the support has negligible influence on the structure. Nanoparticle dynamics must be included in the description of catalytic and other properties of nanomaterials. In situ microscopy offers possibilities for obtaining the relevant atomic-scale insight."
https://openalex.org/W1488574179,"The fundamental biophysical cause of stagnant per capita food production in Africa is soil fertility depletion. Because mineral fertilizers cost two to six times as much as those sold worldwide, a soil fertility replenishment approach has been developed based on naturally available resources: nitrogen-fixing leguminous tree fallows that accumulate 100 to 200 kg N ha, indigenous rock phosphate applications, and biomass transfers of the nutrient-accumulating shrub
 Tithonia diversifolia. Tens of thousands of farmers in East and Southern Africa are becoming food secure with these technologies. Soil fertility depletion must be addressed before other technologies and policies can become effective in overcoming hunger in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2041170922,"The immune system consists of two evolutionarily different but closely related responses, innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Each of these responses has characteristic receptors-Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for innate immunity and antigen-specific receptors for adaptive immunity. Here we show that the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing serine/threonine kinase Rip2 (also known as RICK, CARDIAK, CCK and Ripk2) transduces signals from receptors of both immune responses. Rip2 was recruited to TLR2 signalling complexes after ligand stimulation. Moreover, cytokine production in Rip2-deficient cells was reduced on stimulation of TLRs with lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan and double-stranded RNA, but not with bacterial DNA, indicating that Rip2 is downstream of TLR2/3/4 but not TLR9. Rip2-deficient cells were also hyporesponsive to signalling through interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 receptors, and deficient for signalling through Nod proteins-molecules also implicated in the innate immune response. Furthermore, Rip2-deficient T cells showed severely reduced NF-kappaB activation, IL-2 production and proliferation on T-cell-receptor (TCR) engagement, and impaired differentiation to T-helper subtype 1 (TH1) cells, indicating that Rip2 is required for optimal TCR signalling and T-cell differentiation. Rip2 is therefore a signal transducer and integrator of signals for both the innate and adaptive immune systems."

All but one of the patients were either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children, and cases occurred in communities with very low (7 to 40%) rates of coverage with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The outbreak was associated with the circulation of a derivative of the type 1 OPV strain, probably originating from a single OPV dose given in 1998-1999. The vaccine-derived poliovirus associated with the outbreak had biological properties indistinguishable from those of wild poliovirus."
https://openalex.org/W2159635590,A 20-variable instance of the NP-complete three-satisfiability (3-SAT) problem was solved on a simple DNA computer. The unique answer was found after an exhaustive search of more than 1 million (2(20)) possibilities. This computational problem may be the largest yet solved by nonelectronic means. Problems of this size appear to be beyond the normal range of unaided human computation.

Experimental realization of large-scale quantum information processors remains a long-term vision, as the required nearly pure quantum behaviour is observed only in exotic hardware such as individual laser-cooled atoms and isolated photons. But recent theoretical and experimental advances suggest that cold atoms and individual photons may lead the way towards bigger and better quantum information processors, effectively building mesoscopic versions of 'Schrödinger's cat' from the bottom up."
https://openalex.org/W2045458127,"Global maps of sulfate and methane in marine sediments reveal two provinces of subsurface metabolic activity: a sulfate-rich open-ocean province, and an ocean-margin province where sulfate is limited to shallow sediments. Methane is produced in both regions but is abundant only in sulfate-depleted sediments. Metabolic activity is greatest in narrow zones of sulfate-reducing methane oxidation along ocean margins. The metabolic rates of subseafloor life are orders of magnitude lower than those of life on Earth's surface. Most microorganisms in subseafloor sediments are either inactive or adapted for extraordinarily low metabolic activity."

The hopping phenomenon, however, cannot be detected for CO/Cu(110), even though the hopping barrier is lower than in the CO/Pd(110) case. A theoretical model, which is based on the anharmonic coupling between low-frequency modes (the hindered-translational mode related to the lateral hopping) and the HF mode combined with electron-hole pair excitation, can explain why the hopping of CO is observed on Pd(110) but not on Cu(110)."

https://openalex.org/W2163240506,"Abstract Heterodimerization has been shown to modulate the ligand binding, signaling, and trafficking properties of G protein-coupled receptors. However, to what extent heterodimerization may alter agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of these receptors has not been documented. We have recently shown that heterodimerization of sst2A and sst3 somatostatin receptors results in inactivation of sst3 receptor function (Pfeiffer, M., Koch, T., Schroder, H., Klutzny, M., Kirscht, S., Kreienkamp, H. J., Hollt, V., and Schulz, S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 14027–14036). Here we examine dimerization of the sst2A somatostatin receptor and the μ-opioid receptor, members of closely related G protein-coupled receptor families. In coimmunoprecipitation studies using differentially epitope-tagged receptors, we provide direct evidence for heterodimerization of sst2A and MOR1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Unlike heteromeric assembly of sst2A and sst3, sst2A-MOR1 heterodimerization did not substantially alter the ligand binding or coupling properties of these receptors. However, exposure of the sst2A-MOR1 heterodimer to the sst2A-selective ligand L-779,976 induced phosphorylation, internalization, and desensitization of sst2A as well as MOR1. Similarly, exposure of the sst2A-MOR1 heterodimer to the μ-selective ligand [d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin induced phosphorylation and desensitization of both MOR1 and sst2A but not internalization of sst2A. Cross-phosphorylation and cross-desensitization of the sst2A-MOR1 heterodimer were selective; they were neither observed with the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer nor with the endogenously expressed lysophosphatidic acid receptor. Heterodimerization may thus represent a novel regulatory mechanism that could either restrict or enhance phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors."

We have identified a group of temperate bacteriophages that generate diversity in a gene, designated mtd (major tropism determinant), which specifies tropism for receptor molecules on host Bordetella species. Tropism switching is the result of a template-dependent, reverse transcriptase–mediated process that introduces nucleotide substitutions at defined locations within mtd . This cassette-based mechanism is capable of providing a vast repertoire of potential ligand-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2088291813,"A profound faunal reorganization occurred near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, when several groups of mammals abruptly appeared on the Holarctic continents. To test the hypothesis that this event featured the dispersal of groups from Asia to North America and Europe, we used isotope stratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and quantitative biochronology to constrain the relative age of important Asian faunas. The extinct family Hyaenodontidae appeared in Asia before it did so in North America, and the modern orders Primates, Artiodactyla, and Perissodactyla first appeared in Asia at or before the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. These results are consistent with Asia being a center for early mammalian origination."

A family of proteases catalyzes deconjugation of SUMO-1-containing species. Members of this family also process newly synthesized SUMO-1 into its conjugatable form. To understand these enzymes better, we have examined the localization and behavior of the human SUMO-1 protease SENP2. Here we have shown that SENP2 associates with the nuclear face of nuclear pores and that this association requires protein sequences near the N terminus of SENP2. We have also shown that SENP2 binds to Nup153, a nucleoporin that is localized to the nucleoplasmic face of the pore. Nup153 binding requires the same domain of SENP2 that mediates its targeting in vivo. Removal of the Nup153-interacting region of SENP2 results in a significant change in the spectrum of SUMO-1 conjugates within the cell. Our results suggest that association with the pore plays an important negative role in the regulation of SENP2, perhaps by restricting its activity to a subset of the conjugated proteins within the nucleus.

Rather, known SUMO proteases share sequence homology in their catalytic domains, which is more nearly conserved to viral proteases (3Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Two SUMO proteases have been described in budding yeast, Ulp1p (3Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and Ulp2p/Smt4p (4Strunnikov A.V. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genetics. 2001; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ulp1p is concentrated near the nuclear periphery (5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and interacts with nuclear pore components in two-hybrid assays (6Takahashi Y. Mizoi J. Toh E.A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), while Ulp2p is localized throughout the nucleus (5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). ULP1 is an essential gene, and temperature-sensitive (ts) Ulp1p mutants arrest at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. Ulp2 is not essential, but it is required for normal meiotic development, for regulation of spindle checkpoint arrest, and for chromatin condensation of rDNA during mitosis (4Strunnikov A.V. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genetics. 2001; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these proteins do not appear to act in a simple complementary manner, since ulp1-ts/ulp2-null double mutants grow better than ulp2 single mutants under a variety of conditions (5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In mammals, data base searches find at least seven members of the SUMO protease family (7Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), some of which have now been confirmed to act as SUMO proteases in vitro (8Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T.

Outside of their conserved catalytic domain, these proteases possess non-conserved N-terminal extensions of varying lengths and relatively short non-conserved C-terminal sequences. SENP2 was discovered both through its homology to other SUMO proteases (7Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and its interactions with murine Axin, a regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway (12Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in tissue culture cells or under in vitro conditions, the murine SENP2 homologue (Smt3IP2) cleaves conjugates of SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that full-length human SENP2 associates with nuclear pores in a manner similar to Ulp1 in yeast. This association occurs exclusively with the nuclear face of the pore and requires sequences near the N terminus of SENP2. We have also shown that SENP2 binds specifically to Nup153, a nucleoporin localized to the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore and that this association requires the same domain of SENP2 that mediates its targeting in vivo. Remarkably, a mutant SENP2 protein that is unable to bind Nup153 is significantly more effective in promoting deconjugation of SUMO-1-conjugated species, indicating that localization of SENP2 to the nuclear pore plays an important role in spatially restricting the activity of this enzyme. Affinity-purified antibodies against Xenopus Nup153 were a kind gift from K. Ullman (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City). Affinity-purified antibodies against Xenopus Nup98 were a kind gift from M. Powers (Emory University, Atlanta). The mouse monoclonal antibody mAb414 against nucleoporins, mouse monoclonal antibody against RanGAP1, and anti-V5 antibody were purchased from BAbCO (Richmond, CA), Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and Strategene (La Jolla, CA) respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibody against the green fluorescence protein (GFP) were purchased from CLONTECH, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Rhodamine- and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The SENP2 cDNA was amplified from the human universal QUICK-CloneTM cDNA (CLONTECH). The sequence of the encoded protein was identical to human cDNAs that have been reported by other laboratories (GenBankTMaccession numbers NM021627 and AF151697). The encoded protein has previously been designated as SENP2, and we will use this nomenclature throughout this report. We fused the SENP2 coding sequence in-frame to the 3′-end of the GFP coding sequence by insertion between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). Similarly, we prepared a vector encoding a version of SENP2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag by insertion of the SENP2 coding region between EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Strategene). Truncation mutants were generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Strategene) and subcloned into the same vectors. The SENP2 truncation mutants were also subcloned into pGEX4T-1 between EcoRI and SalI for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria. Expression of the recombinant GST·SENP2 fusion proteins was induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 4 h and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA encoding the mature form of SUMO-1 (amino acids 1–97) was subcloned into pcDNA4/HisMax C (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and NotI restriction sites, allowing expression with six histidine and Xpress epitope tags at its N terminus. A human RanGAP1 cDNA was amplified from the pET-RanGAP1 plasmid kindly provided by Volker Gerke (University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany). The cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), allowing its expression with the V5 epitope and six histidine tags at its C terminus. A form of RanGAP1 that cannot be modified by SUMO-1 was generated by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase to produce a point mutation that substituted lysine 524 with an arginine residue. COS7 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). In all cases, the cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagene Inc., Valencia, CA). To measure the effect of SENP2 expression on the overall profile of conjugated substrates (Fig. 5A), COS7 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with vectors expressing His-Xpress-tagged SUMO-1 and EGFP·SENP2, as indicated. To measure the effect of SENP2 expression specifically on RanGAP1 conjugation (Fig. 5B), COS7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing EGFP or EGFP·SENP2, as well as vectors expressing V5-tagged wild type or unconjugatable mutant human RanGAP1. In Fig. 5, A and B, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and suspended in 125 μl of boiling 2× SDS sample buffer, followed by brief sonication. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting as described below. HeLa cells were grown for immunofluorescence on glass coverslips. In all figures except Fig. 1B, the cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% formaldehyde plus 2% sucrose in KB buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in KB buffer. In Fig. 1B, HeLa cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and cells were alternatively permeabilized with Triton X-100 as described above or permeabilized with 0.004% digitonin at 4 °C for 15 min. In all cases, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in primary and secondary antibodies that had been diluted in KB buffer with 2% normal horse serum. Hoechst 33258 was added to the secondary antibody incubation to stain the DNA. After each incubation, the cells were rinsed five times for 2 min in KB buffer with 2% normal horse serum. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a Hamamatsu Orca II digital CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and Openlab software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Proteins were resolved in 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (Biofluids) containing 0.15% Tween-20 (PBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h, incubated in primary and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h each, thoroughly rinsed with PBS-T after each incubation, and detected using ECL Plus reagents (AmershamBiosciences). Xenopus interphase egg extracts were prepared exactly as described elsewhere (13Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 15 μg of purified recombinant GST·SENP2 fusion proteins were incubated with 15 μl of egg extract plus 500 μl of buffer B (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) for 5 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads that had previously been equilibrated with buffer B were added to the reaction and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1.5 ml of buffer B, and the bound proteins were eluted using 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. The products were subjected to Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. To better understand the function of individual SUMO proteases, we cloned the human homologue of SENP2 by PCR and performed experiments to confirm that a recombinant fragment of the human SENP2 protein (amino acids 178–590, containing the putative catalytic region) had activity in assays for SUMO-1 processing and isopeptide cleavage of bonds between SUMO-1 and RanGAP1 (data not shown). Our results were very similar to those previously described for the in vitro analysis of mouse SENP2 (11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To pursue a better understanding of SENP2 in vivo, we subcloned the SENP2 open reading frame into plasmid vectors for the expression of fusion proteins encoding SENP2 tagged with either green fluorescent protein (EGFP·SENP2) or a FLAG epitope (FLAG-SENP2). To determine the localization of SENP2, we examined the localization of a fusion between GFP and the full SENP2 coding region (EGFP·SENP2) in HeLa cells. When expressed at low levels (Fig. 1A), this protein co-localized with the nuclear envelope, whereas EGFP alone was diffusely distributed. At higher levels of expression, we found the fusion protein not only at the nuclear envelope but also within inclusions in the nucleus (data not shown). EGFP·SENP2 distribution overlapped with immunofluorescent staining using the monoclonal antibody 414 (mAb414), which recognizes a family of FXFG-containing nuclear pore proteins (Fig. 1A). Notably, the distribution of eGFP·SENP2 was more restricted than mAb414 staining and appeared to be found primarily on the nuclear side of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The FLAG-SENP2 localized similarly (data not shown), suggesting that the pattern of localization was independent of the fusion moiety. In addition, polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against SENP2 showed strong staining of the nuclear envelope in immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the endogenous SENP2 protein is also localized to the nuclear envelope. Together, these observations demonstrate unambiguously that SENP2 is associated with the nuclear envelope and strongly indicate that SENP2 is resident on the nuclear face of the nuclear pore. To test more directly whether SENP2 is restricted to the nuclear side of the pore, we examined EGFP·SENP2 accessibility to anti-GFP antibody staining under different permeabilization conditions (Fig. 1B). When cells were permeabilized with digitonin, which disrupts the plasma membrane but leaves the nuclear envelope intact (14Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), we observed no staining with anti-GFP antibodies. However, it was clear that the fusion protein was still present because the GFP emission was observed on the nuclear envelope. By contrast, permeabilization with a detergent that disrupts the nuclear envelope (Triton X-100) allowed staining, indicating that the fusion protein could be recognized by anti-eGFP antibodies. These observations show that SENP2 is localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope. We wished to determine which sequences within SENP2 are required for its correct targeting to the nuclear envelope. To do this, we made a series of deletions in the SENP2 fusion protein, encompassing both the N and C termini (Fig. 2A). Deletion of as few as 30 amino acids from the N terminus of SENP2 disrupted its association to the pore (Fig. 2B). By contrast, fusion proteins that were extensively deleted from the C terminus, including one that retained only 70 amino acids of the N terminus of SENP2 (EGFP·SENP2-(1–70)), were able to localize correctly to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3). A similar deletion analysis using FLAG-SENP2 fusion proteins provided essentially identical results (data not shown), confirming that this finding was independent of the fusion epitope used. These observations show that the sequences within the N-terminal 70 amino acids of SENP2 are both necessary and sufficient for its correct localization at the nuclear pore.Figure 3Sequences at the N terminus of SENP2 are sufficient for localization to the nuclear pore. EGFP fusion proteins with the indicated segments of SENP2 were transfected into HeLa cells. Localization of the fusion proteins was visualized by eGFP fluorescence (left column, green). DNA stained with Hoechst 33258 dye is shown in the center column(blue), and merged images are shown in the right column. Similar results were observed using indirect immunofluorescence with anti-FLAG antibodies against FLAG-tagged SENP2 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether SENP2 binds to nuclear pore proteins, we utilized interphase Xenopus egg extracts (13Smythe C. Newport J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as a source of unassembled, soluble nuclear pore components. We incubated the egg extracts with recombinant GST fusion proteins that encoded different regions of the SENP2 protein. After incubation, we purified the fusion proteins by affinity chromatography and examined whether the samples specifically retained extract proteins that could be recognized in Western blot assays by mAb414 (Fig. 4, upper panel). Fusion proteins encoding the N terminus of SENP2 (e.g.GST·SENP2-(1–170) and GST·SENP2-(1–70)) specifically retained a mAb414-reactive band that migrated with a mobility corresponding to 180 kDa on gel electrophoresis. Previous characterization of mAb414-reactive proteins in Xenopus egg extracts (15Meier E. Miller B.R. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1459-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggested that the 180-kDa band was likely to be the nucleoporin Nup153 (16Sukegawa J. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 72: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To confirm this identification, we subjected the same samples to Western blotting using antibodies against the Xenopus Nup153 (17Ullman K.S. Shah S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This analysis showed that Nup153 associated with GST·SENP2-(1–170) and GST·SENP2-(1–70) (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6) but did not associate with GST or with fusion proteins containing any other region of SENP2 (Fig. 4). Several additional observations suggested that the retention of Nup153 was highly specific. First, no other mAb414-reactive bands were specifically retained in association with GST or any of the GST fusion proteins. Second, Western blots using antibodies directed against a GLFG nucleoporin associated with the nucleoplasmic side of the pore (18Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), Nup98, did not recognize any proteins associated with SENP2 (Fig. 4, lower panel). Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that SENP2 interacts with Nup153 in Xenopus egg extracts. This finding is consistent with the localization of SENP2 determined in Figs. 1 and 2, because Nup153 has been demonstrated to be a component of the nuclear basket in vertebrates (19Pante N. Bastos R. McMorrow I. Burke B. Aebi U. J. Cell Bio. l. 1994; 126: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The specificity of these interactions was independently confirmed by directed two-hybrid analysis in which strong interactions were observed between Nup153 and either full-length SENP2 or the N-terminal domain of SENP2 (data not shown). By contrast, no specific interactions were observed between Nup153 and SENP2 sequences outside of the first 100 amino acids. To determine whether SENP2 localization has any role in regulation of its activity, we transfected COS7 cells with wild type EGFP·SENP2, a mutant lacking the N-terminal 70 amino acids of SENP2 (EGFP·SENP2-(71–590)), and a mutant in which a critical cysteine in the predicted active site of the enzyme was changed to serine (EGFP·SENP2-C/S). EGFP·SENP2-C/S correctly targeted to the nuclear pore in a manner that was indistinguishable from the wild type protein (data not shown). To monitor the pattern of SUMO-1 conjugation within the transfected cells, we simultaneously transfected with a lower concentration of a plasmid expressing tagged SUMO-1 protein (His-Xpress-SUMO-1) and assayed the conjugation of the tagged SUMO-1 by Western blot (Fig. 5). We observed that His-Xpress-SUMO-1 became conjugated to a variety of proteins when it was co-transfected with a vector expressing EGFP, most easily observed on Western blots as a high molecular weight smear. This spectrum was slightly attenuated when the EGFP expression vector was replaced with a vector expressing wild type SENP2. By contrast, when EGFP·SENP2-C/S was co-expressed with the tagged SUMO-1 it dramatically increased the level of SUMO-1 conjugation within transfected cells, indicating that it was not only enzymatically inactive but also functioned in a dominant fashion to disrupt deconjugation by endogenous SENP2. We do not currently know the mechanism whereby EGFP·SENP2-C/S inhibited the endogenous protein. Most remarkably, expression of EGFP·SENP2-(71–590) caused the loss of almost all conjugated forms of His-Xpress-SUMO-1, indicating that SENP2 was much more effective in deconjugation of nuclear proteins when it was no longer tethered to the nuclear pore. These results suggest that association with the pore may play an important negative role in the regulation of SENP2, restricting its activity to a subset of the conjugated proteins within the nucleus and that allowing the protein to access other locations within the nucleus promotes inappropriate deconjugation of SUMO-1 species, which are not normally substrates for this enzyme. Because SENP2 is resident at the nuclear pore, we also examined the capacity of overexpressed SENP2 to alter the conjugation status of RanGAP1 in vivo. RanGAP1 is localized in the cytosol, where SUMO-1 conjugation targets it to the nuclear pore through association with a large nucleoporin, RanBP2 (20Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 21Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we co-transfected a plasmid expressing V5-tagged RanGAP1 with the plasmid expressing EGFP·SENP2 (Fig. 5B). As a control, we performed similar experiments with a mutant version of RanGAP1 lacking the single lysine residue that becomes modified by SUMO-1 conjugation (RanGAP1-K524R, Ref. 22Matunis M.J., Wu, J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). EGFP·SENP2 expression did not substantially alter the pattern of RanGAP1 modification. Moreover, under conditions of moderate or even massive EGFP·SENP2 overexpression, RanGAP1 staining at the nuclear pore was retained (data not shown), further arguing that its SUMO-1 modification status is not regulated by SENP2 despite the fact that RanGAP1 can be deconjugated from SUMO-1 in vitro by SENP2 (Ref. 11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, data not shown). These observations suggest that the primary substrate of SENP2 at the nuclear pore is unlikely to be RanGAP1. SUMO proteases share homology in their catalytic domains but otherwise have widely divergent primary sequences in their N- and C-terminal domains. We have found that human SENP2 localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of nuclear pores through sequences in the N-terminal domain. We have further found that this domain of SENP2 interacts with Nup153, a nucleoporin on the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. Together, our observations suggest that at least one function of the divergent regions in SUMO proteases is their proper localization within the nucleus. Notably, elimination of the N-terminal domain of SENP2 not only allows it to relocalize to other parts of the nucleus but also increases its capacity to deconjugate SUMO-1-conjugated species within the cell. These observations suggest that targeting SENP2 to the nuclear pore is a mechanism to sequester it from SUMO-1-conjugated proteins in the nuclear interior. Alternatively, the N-terminal domain may have a role in negatively regulating SENP2 through additional mechanisms. Our findings suggest that interactions between Nup153 and SENP2 may be responsible for the localization of SENP2 at the nuclear pore (Fig. 4). Nup153 is associated with the basket structure on the nucleoplasmic side of the pore (19Pante N. Bastos R. McMorrow I. Burke B. Aebi U. J. Cell Bio. l. 1994; 126: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and it has been implicated in multiple aspects of nuclear transport and pore structure (17Ullman K.S. Shah S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Walther T.C. Fornerod M. Pickersgill H. Goldberg M. Allen T.D. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5703-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The association between Nup153 and SENP2 is therefore entirely consistent with immunofluorescence data showing that SENP2 was found only on the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1). Ulp1p, a protease for budding yeast SUMO-1 (Smt3), is found at the nuclear pore (5Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and has been reported to bind Nup42p (6Takahashi Y. Mizoi J. Toh E.A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Like Nup153, Nup42p is an FG-repeat containing nucleoporin (24Vasu S.K. Forbes D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These observations may suggest a conserved role for SUMO-1 deconjugation in the regulation of pore activity. However, there are likely to be some differences between vertebrates and yeast in the details of this function because Nup42p is localized on the cytosolic face of the nuclear envelope in yeast (24Vasu S.K. Forbes D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although SENP2 was localized to the nuclear pore, we have not yet found any role for SENP2 in nuclear trafficking. Overexpression of wild type or mutant versions of SENP2 did not significantly alter nuclear import or export of a GFP-labeled chimeric model substrate consisting of HIV-1 Rev and a hormone-inducible nuclear localization sequence (Rev-GR-GFP, Ref. 25Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although such negative results do not exclude the possibility that some nuclear transport pathways are controlled by SENP2, they suggest that modulation of SENP2 activity does not grossly alter the role of Nup153 in pore structure or nuclear import. Interestingly, Pichler et al. (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that RanBP2 is an E3 enzyme for SUMO-1 that can catalyze both its own hyperconjugation to SUMO-1 and the conjugation of Sp100 in vitro. Pichler et al. (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) have proposed a model wherein RanBP2 may couple nuclear import with the conjugation of a subset of SUMO-1 substrates (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It would be attractive to speculate that SENP2 might have a role in transport-linked deconjugation of the same subset of SUMO-1-conjugated proteins. Notably, translocation through the nuclear pore is not essential for their efficient conjugation of Sp100 by RanBP2 (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nonconjugatable forms of Sp100 show no defects in nuclear localization in vivo(27Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), suggesting that SUMO-1 modification cannot be essential for its nuclear import. These observations further indicate that pore-associated SUMO-1 conjugation and deconjugation activities are unlikely to be involved in nuclear transport per se. An alternative function might be the specific marking of newly imported proteins, perhaps to direct their localization after nuclear entry or to regulate their activity before their assembly into macromolecular complexes within the nucleus (28Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SENP2 is closely related to a rat SUMO-1 protease, Axam, which has been reported as an Axin-binding protein (11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Axam antagonizes the binding of Dvl-1 to Axin and suppresses GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation in the Axin complex, thereby enhancing β-catenin degradation (12Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Enhancement of β-catenin degradation does not require SUMO protease activity (11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that SENP2 may have multiple, independent functions. Earlier reports on Axam also indicated that Axam and SENP2 (SMT3IP2) are localized to the cytosol (11Nishida T. Kaneko F. Kitagawa M. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39060-39066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We believe that the difference between these observations and ours was that both reports visualized the localization of N-terminal-truncated forms of Axam or SENP2, missing 72 or 42 amino acids, respectively. We suspect that expression levels and cell type-specific differences may also contribute to the differences between our observations and those reports, since we did not observe localization of truncated forms of SENP2 in the cytosol. We cannot currently explain the relationship between the APC/β-catenin pathway and SENP2, but it will be of interest to examine whether SENP2 or other SUMO-1 pathway enzymes regulate nuclear translocation or subnuclear localization of any of the proteins of the APC/β-catenin pathway. In summary, we have shown that full-length SENP2 localizes to the nuclear face of the nuclear pore. This localization is likely to be achieved through interaction with Nup153. Appropriate localization to the pore plays an important role for the correct regulation of SENP2 because its mislocalization leads to the inappropriate deconjugation of many SUMO-1-conjugated species. It will be of interest in the future to determine which SUMO-1-conjugated species are normally the targets of SENP2 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2136828798,"A recent development in instruments to investigate biomolecular interactions is surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection with a biospecific sensor chip. In this method, a probe (P) or a target molecule (T) is bound to a gold-plated cell and a solution containing the other molecule is passed over it. Light is beamed through a prism and strikes the glass surface of the flow cell containing the sample at an angle, such that the beam is totally reflected. At a particular wavelength and incident angle between the beam and glass, a surface plasmon wave of excited electrons (plasmon resonance) is produced at the gold layer and is detected as a reduced intensity of the reflected light beam. By measuring the deflection of the beam, binding of P &T can be easily quantitated. This article describes the mechanism and applicatioins of the SPR technique."

We find that SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) influences the repertoire of NK receptors. In adult SHIP −/− mice, the NK compartment is dominated by cells that express two inhibitory receptors capable of binding either self or allogeneic MHC ligands. This promiscuous repertoire has significant functional consequences, because SHIP −/− mice fail to reject fully mismatched allogeneic marrow grafts and show enhanced survival after such transplants. Thus, SHIP plays an important role in two processes that limit the success of allogeneic marrow transplantation: graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease."

https://openalex.org/W2111058678,"In birds and many other animals, there are large interspecific differences in the magnitude of annual variation in population size. Using time-series data on populations of solitary bird species, we found that fluctuations in population size of solitary birds were affected by the deterministic characteristics of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic factors. In species with highly variable populations, annual variation in recruitment was positively related to the return rate of adults between successive breeding seasons. In stable populations, more recruits were found in years with low return rates of breeding adults. This identifies a gradient, associated with the position of the species along a “slow-fast” continuum of life history variation, from highly variable populations with a recruitment-driven demography to stable, strongly density-regulated populations with a survival-restricted demography. These results suggest that patterns in avian population fluctuations can be predicted from a knowledge of life-history characteristics and/or temporal variation in certain demographic traits."

Inhibiting ERK activation with the MEK inhibitor U0126 increased the EGF-stimulated association of Gab1 with either full-length glutathione S-transferase-p85 or the p85 C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a result reproduced by co-immunoprecipitation of the native proteins from intact cells. This increased association of Gab1 and the PI3K correlates with an increase in PI3K activity and greater phosphorylation of Akt.

In support of this divergent effect of ERK on Gab1/PI3K association following HGF and EGF stimulation, U0126 decreased the HGF-stimulated association of p85 and the Gab1 c-Met binding domain but did not alter the EGF-stimulated association of p85 and the c-Met binding domain. An examination of the mechanism of this effect revealed that the treatment of cells with EGF + U0126 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 as well as its association with another SH2-containing protein, SHP2. Furthermore, overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of SHP2 or pretreatment with pervanadate markedly increased EGF-stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These experiments demonstrate that EGF and HGF-mediated ERK activation result in divergent effects on Gab1/PI3K signaling. HGF-stimulated ERK activation increases the Gab1/PI3K association, whereas EGF-stimulated ERK activation results in a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and a decreased association with the PI3K.

Similar to the Drosophila daughter of sevenless protein, DOS, and the insulin receptor substrate proteins 1 and 2 family, Gab1 consists of a PH domain at its N terminus, several proline-rich motifs in the C-terminus, and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites.

One of the most important signaling proteins found to associate with Gab1 in response to various stimuli is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Studies have shown that the activation of the PI3K is involved in a wide range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, and prevention of apoptosis (13Frevert E.U.

We have previously demonstrated that the PI3K is required for HGF-mediated kidney epithelial cell migration and in vitro tubulogenesis (16Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J. Nigam S.K. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of Gab1 for this response has been demonstrated in work by Maroun et al. (5Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) who found that the loss of association of Gab1 and the PI3K due to mutation of the PI3K binding sites in Gab1 results in a decrease of c-met-mediated tubulogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. An association of the PI3K with Gab1 was also reported to be required for HGF-mediated cell survival and DNA repair (17Fan S. Ma Y.X. Gao M. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4968-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previously, it was believed that regulation of the PI3K association with Gab1 was mediated solely by receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 on the PI3K SH2 binding motifs447YVPM451 and472YVPM476 in the MBD domain, and/or589YVPM at the carboxyl terminus. However, we have demonstrated that in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, Gab1 is also phosphorylated on serine and threonine in response to ERK2 activation by HGF (12Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation studies revealed that ERK2 primarily phosphorylates Gab1 in the MBD domain, and an examination of the Gab1 sequence for potential ERK binding and phosphorylation sites revealed that the476TP478 motif immediately following the472YVPM476 PI3K binding site was a high probability ERK1/2 phosphorylation site within the MBD domain of Gab1. In a more recent study, we found that the phosphorylation of both Tyr472 and Thr476 resulted in a higher affinity of a YVPMTP-containing peptide for the PI3K than did the phosphorylation of Tyr472 alone. Thus, ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of this site can initiate a novel regulation of the Gab1/PI3K interaction. This was confirmed by demonstrating that HGF-stimulated association of the PI3K with Gab1 was partially dependent on ERK activation (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our recent determination that HGF-stimulated epithelial cell morphogenesis requires ERK1/2 activation provides a potential physiologic role for ERK-regulated PI3K activation (18Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this same study, we found that EGF, but not HGF, activates ERK5 in addition to ERK1/2. The expression of a kinase-dead form of ERK5 in epithelial cells prevented EGF-stimulated morphogenesis, demonstrating that EGF and HGF use different MAPK signaling pathways for their morphogenic responses. Because the branching morphogenesis observed following EGF and HGF stimulation is phenotypically distinct, we decided to investigate the effects of EGF-stimulated ERK activation on the association of Gab1 with the PI3K. In contrast to the positive regulation of the Gab1/PI3K interaction that we found following HGF-stimulated ERK activation, EGF-stimulated ERK activation down-regulates the interaction of Gab1 and the PI3K. The investigation of the mechanism of this effect revealed that EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 was diminished in the setting of ERK activation, thereby decreasing the association of SH2-docking proteins. Immortalized mIMCD-3 epithelial cells (19Rauchman M. Nigam S. Delpire E. Gullans S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HEK cells were maintained at low passage using standard cell culture techniques in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed when the cells were 80–90% confluent. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. mIMCD-3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and then stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml, Sigma), HGF (40 ng/ml, Sigma), or vehicle control for 10 min. To inhibit ERK activation, cells were pretreated with 10 μm U0126 (Promega) for 20 min prior to EGF stimulation (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). U0126 has been shown to inhibit MEK1, MEK 2 (20Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem.

Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). U0126 was used rather than PD98059, because we have found that EGF-mediated ERK5 activation, which is critical for EGF-mediated mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis, is fully inhibited by U0126 but only partially inhibited by PD98059 at concentrations ≤100 μm (18Karihaloo A.

Following EGF stimulation, cells were lysed in 800 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4. The GST-p85 full-length N-terminal and C-terminal fusion proteins were expressed as described previously (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol.

The bacteria were lysed with sodium deoxycholate, and the supernatants were collected and incubated with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin until use. Control experiments were performed with GST-Sepharose beads generated by expression of the empty pGEX-4T vector. Total GST fusion protein amounts were estimated visually using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE with albumin standards. 1 mg of total protein from the appropriate mIMCD-3 whole cell lysates was then incubated with the GST fusion protein of interest for 30 min at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer followed by resolution through SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) using Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) for 90 min at 18 volts. Usually, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in wash buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). After five additional rinses with TBS-T, blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (Gab1 or p85, Upstate Biotechnology). After rinsing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution in TBS-T for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were visualized by ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). 800 μg of mIMCD-3 cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL 4B (1:1 slurry in phosphate-buffered saline (Amersham Biosciences) and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with anti-Gab1 overnight followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose CL4B. After incubating for another 2 h at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer prior to the resolution through SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed using the methods mentioned above or following the protocol of the primary antibody manufacturer. For the expression of the MBD domain of Gab1, lysates from mIMCD-3 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-MBD or vector control were used. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol.

For the expression of SHP2, HEK cells were transiently transfected with either the empty control vector, pIRES-GFP, or the vector encoding Myc-tagged wild-type SHP2 (SHP2-WT) or catalytically inactive SHP2 (SHP2-CS). These constructs, which independently express green fluorescent protein to allow rapid determination of transfection efficiency, were a kind gift of Dr. Anton Bennett. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as previously described HGF (12Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Gab1 from control and EGF-stimulated mIMCD-3 cells ± U0126 was performed as above. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4, twice with 100 mm Tris, 500 mm LiCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, pH 7.5, and twice with 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4, pH 7.5. The pellets were then resuspended in 50 μl of the final wash buffer containing 12 mm MgCl2 and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). To start the PI3K reaction, 10 μl of 40 μm ATP containing 30 μCi of [32P]ATP was added to each pellet and was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 m HCl and the lipids extracted using 160 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The phases were separated by centrifugation, and 50 μl of the lower organic phase was spotted onto a glass-backed silicon thin-layer chromatography plate. The lipids were resolved by thin-layer chromatography in MeOH-CHCl3-H2O-NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2) and visualized using the Storm PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed on triplicate samples using ImageQuant software. All experiments were repeated on at least three separate occasions. Quantification of ECL immunoblots was performed using the NIH Image program. The values for co-immunoprecipitation experiments were normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated protein and expressed as the mean ± S.E. The results were analyzed using the Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Our observation that HGF and EGF appear to use different ERK signaling pathways for epithelial morphogenesis (18Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) led us to examine the effect of ERK activation on EGF-stimulated Gab1/PI3K association. Initial experiments tested the ability of a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein encoding the full-length p85 subunit of the PI3K to associate with Gab1 from EGF-stimulated mIMCD-3 cell lysates. Similar to previous results in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (5Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), EGF stimulation was found to induce the interaction of Gab1 and p85 in vitro (Fig. 1A, upper panel). To examine the role of ERK in regulating this association, cells were pretreated with 10 μm U0126, a concentration of the MEK inhibitor that prevents both ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation (18Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK activation resulted in a marked increase in the EGF-stimulated association of p85 with Gab1. To determine whether this effect was specific for the p85 SH2 domain interactions with Gab1, we used GST fusion proteins encoding the N-terminal SH2 and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85. These pull-down experiments revealed that the EGF-stimulated interaction of Gab1 and the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 appears to be ERK activation-independent (Fig. 1A, middle panel), whereas the association of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 with Gab1 increased with the inhibition of ERK activation (Fig. 1A, lower panel), mimicking the results obtained with full-length p85. The effects of EGF-mediated ERK activation on endogenous Gab1/PI3K interactions were then examined by co-immunoprecipitation from mIMCD-3 cells. Compared with control cells, the interaction of Gab1 and the PI3K was increased following the EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the in vitro pull-down results, this interaction was further increased in the setting of inhibition of ERK activation. The quantitation of the results from three experiments revealed that stimulation with EGF resulted in a 9-fold increase in Gab1/PI3K association, whereas concomitant inhibition of ERK activation led to an additional 40% increase in the Gab1/PI3K association (Fig. 1C). This result was confirmed in EGF-stimulated HEK cells (data not shown) and demonstrates that EGF-mediated ERK activation down-regulates the EGF-stimulated Gab1/PI3K association. In contrast to the results now presented for EGF, we have previously found that HGF-mediated ERK1/2 activation causes an increase in the HGF-stimulated Gab1/PI3K association. The association of the PI3K with Gab1 occurs primarily at three consensus Y XXM association sites in Gab1 (5Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 11Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). One of these sites, 472YVPMTP479, is included in the Gab1 MBD domain and also encodes the ERK1/2 consensus phosphorylation sequence P X(S/T)P. We have shown that the MBD region is the primary target of ERK2 phosphorylation of Gab1 (12Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that dual phosphorylation of the472YVPMTP478 motif on Tyr472 and Thr476 results in a higher affinity binding site for p85 than does phosphorylation on Tyr472 alone (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of ERK activation decreases the Gab1/PI3K association as well as downstream Akt activation by ∼50% (Fig. 2A, left panel) (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is likely that HGF-stimulated ERK2 phosphorylation at the472YVPMTP478 site results in a physiologically relevant increase in HGF-stimulated PI3K activation. The current experiments demonstrate that preventing EGF-stimulated ERK activation results in an increase in the association of Gab1 with p85, suggesting that HGF and EGF-stimulated ERK activation can mediate divergent downstream events (Fig. 2A, right panel). To determine whether the effects of EGF on ERK-regulated Gab1/PI3K association are also mediated by the MBD of Gab1, we examined the association of the MBD with p85 following HGF or EGF stimulation. The MBD of Gab1 can associate with and be phosphorylated by either the c-met receptor (directly through the c-met binding sequence and indirectly through association with Grb2) or the EGFR (indirectly through association with Grb2). Immunoprecipitation of the epitope-tagged MBD domain reveals that both HGF and EGF can induce the association of the Gab1 MBD with the p85 subunit of the PI3K (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5). In agreement with our previous finding that HGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation results in the creation of a higher affinity p85 binding site, U0126 treatment caused a decrease in the HGF-stimulated MBD-p85 association that was indistinguishable from that seen with full-length Gab1 (Fig. 2, compare A, lanes 3 and 4, with B, lanes 3 and 4). However, the inhibition of ERK activation did not influence EGF-induced p85 binding to the Gab1 MBD (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, the HGF-stimulated association of p85 with the Gab1 MBD was significantly stronger than that observed for EGF stimulation, possibly because the dual binding interaction between the MBD and c-met results in a more efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 binding motif. Taken together, these results are most consistent with a model in which HGF-mediated ERK2 activation increases the Gab1/PI3K association through direct phosphorylation of the p85 binding site in the MBD, whereas EGF-mediated ERK activation decreases the Gab1/PI3K association through a mechanism outside of the MBD. Because p85 association is dependent on the phosphorylation of the Y XXM SH2 binding sites in Gab1, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 in both resting and EGF-stimulated mIMCD-3 cells was examined. Immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine followed by blotting with anti-Gab1 revealed the expected increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 following EGF stimulation with a further increase in the setting of concomitant inhibition of ERK activation (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of Gab1 followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting confirmed these results (Fig. 3B) with quantitation demonstrating that inhibition of ERK activation resulted in a 62% increase in the EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, we have previously demonstrated that HGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation does not alter c-met-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (7Yu C.F. Roshan B. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the increased Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurs following EGF stimulation, and concomitant ERK inhibition increases the association of Gab1 with other SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins, we examined the association of Gab1 with SHP2. SHP2 is an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase that associates with Gab1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner at tyrosines 627 and 659 in the C terminus of Gab1 (8Cunnick J.M. Mei L.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In both anti-Gab1 and anti-SHP2 immunoprecipitates, we were able to detect the association of Gab1 with SHP2 following the stimulation of mIMCD-3 cells with EGF (Fig. 3D). After inhibition of ERK activation with U0126, there was a substantial increase in the EGF-stimulated co-immunoprecipitation of Gab1 and SHP2, similar to that seen with Gab1/PI3K association. These results demonstrate that EGFR activation in the absence of ERK activation results in a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and subsequently a greater recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins such as the PI3K and SHP2, and they suggest that EGF-stimulated ERK activation normally serves to down-regulate Gab1 signaling. Two potential mechanisms, whereby EGF-stimulated ERK activation could decrease the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1, are to either decrease the EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 or to increase the activity of a Gab1-associated phosphatase. A decrease in the EGFR-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 could occur because of the inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity or a decrease in the association of Gab1 with the EGFR. As a marker for EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates revealed an indistinguishable level of EGFR phosphorylation in cells stimulated with EGF in the presence or absence of ERK inhibition with U0126 (Fig. 4A). The association of Gab1 with the EGFR occurs indirectly via an SH3-mediated association of Gab1 and Grb2 and a phosphotyrosine-dependent SH2-mediated association of Grb2 with the EGFR. Because ERK2 has been shown to directly phosphorylate Gab1 in the MBD region that encodes one of the proline-rich Grb2 SH3 binding sites (11Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of EGF-stimulated ERK activation on Gab1·Grb2 and Grb2·EGFR complex formation. The SH3-mediated association of Gab1 and Grb2 was found to be constitutive and was not altered by EGF stimulation, either in the presence or absence ERK inhibition (Fig. 4B). The SH2-mediated association of Grb2 with the EGFR was increased following EGF stimulation with no alteration detected in the setting of ERK inhibition (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate no detectable effect of ERK activation on EGFR phosphorylation or association of the receptor with Gab1 and thus do not support the model that the EGF-stimulated ERK-dependent decrease in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is the result of regulation of the EGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. An alternative explanation for the ERK-mediated decrease in EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 is that ERK serves to either recruit and/or activate a tyrosine phosphatase to Gab1. To examine this possibility, we determined the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 in the presence of the cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. The addition of pervanadate at 50 μm to serum-starved mIMCD-3 cells resulted in a 4-fold increase in basal Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, quantitated in B). Stimulation with EGF increased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation 9-fold over base line with an additional 2.2-fold increase in phosphorylation in the setting of pervanadate treatment. These data demonstrate that one or more phosphatases regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 both in quiescent and EGF-stimulated cells. A logical candidate for an EGF-dependent ERK-stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphatase is SHP2. Recently, Gab1 has been identified as a potential SHP2 substrate in the EGF (8Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and cytokine receptor signaling pathways (10Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the work by Cunnick et al. (8Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), SHP2 was found to be capable of dephosphorylating peptides containing either phosphorylated Tyr589 (a PI3K binding site in Gab1) or Tyr627 + Tyr659 (the SHP2 binding sites in Gab1), although the ability of SHP2 to dephosphorylate native Gab1 following EGF stimulation was not determined. To further examine the role of SHP2 in Gab1 dephosphorylation, we used the transient expression of SHP2-CS in HEK cells. In unstimulated cells, the expression of SHP2-CS resulted in a minimal increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 as compared with cells expressing wild-type SHP2 or the empty vector (Fig. 5C, lane 2 versus lanes 1 and 3). However, following EGF stimulation, SHP2-CS-expressing cells exhibited approximately a 2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation compared with controls, a change similar to that seen following pervanadate treatment (Fig. 5A) or U0126 treatment (Fig. 3B). Of note, we have thus far been unable to detect an increase in SHP2 phosphatase activity in Gab1 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated cells using the artificial substrate paranitrophenyl phosphate, preventing us from directly determining the role of ERK activation in the regulation of SHP2. Based on the results shown in Fig. 5A, we believe that this failure to detect increased SHP2 activity is because of either the relative insensitivity of the assay or the instability of the Gab1/SHP2 association. Our present data are most consistent with a model in which EGF stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 followed by recruitment of the PI3K and SHP2. SHP2 then acts to dephosphorylate Gab1 and down-regulate its activation, an effect that is enhanced by simultaneous ERK activation. ERK could be acting to either increase the association of Gab1 with SHP2 or to stimulate its phosphatase activity. Our observation that inhibition of ERK activation results in an increase in the association of Gab1 with SHP2 (Fig. 3D) would seem to rule out the former possibility. However, it is conceivable that an initial ERK-mediated increase in SHP2 association results in the dephosphorylation of multiple Gab1 tyrosine residues including Tyr627 and/or Tyr659 followed by the loss of the SHP2-Gab1 association. Interestingly, the association of SHP2 with Gab1 through Tyr627 and Tyr659 has been found to be required for EGF-induced ERK2 activation (8Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ERK-mediated decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 might then serve as a negative feedback regulator of further ERK2 activation. The binding of the p85 subunit of the PI3K to phosphotyrosine residues typically results in the activation of the catalytic 110kD subunit of the enzyme and the production of phosphoinositide 3,4,5 triphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3) at the cell membrane. To determine whether the increase in the PI3K-Gab1 association detected following the inhibition of ERK activation plays a significant role in the activation state of the PI3K, PI3K activity was assayed in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates from EGF-stimulated cells. The stimulation of mIMCD-3 cells with EGF increased the activity of the PI3K by ∼1.5-fold (Fig. 6A). The pretreatment of EGF-stimulated cells with U0126 resulted in an additional 2-fold increase in Gab1-associated PI3K activity. The production of PI-3,4,5-P3 at the membrane serves as a binding site for PH domain containing proteins such as Akt. The recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane results in its phosphorylation and activation by protein kinase B, leading to enhanced cell survival and proliferation (23Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). To determine whether ERK regulates the activation of this signaling pathway downstream of the PI3K, we examined the activation of Akt using a phosphorylation-specific antibody. Akt was basally phosphorylated to a low level in control cells with a 1-fold increase in Akt activation following EGF stimulation (Fig. 6B, quantitated in C). Although U0126 pretreatment had no effect on basal Akt phosphorylation, EGF-stimulated cells demonstrated a further 50% increase in Akt phosphorylation in the setting of U0126-mediated ERK inhibition. These results demonstrate that EGF-stimulated ERK activation plays a significant role in down-regulating the ability of Gab1 to recruit and activate the PI3K and its downstream effectors. Although both HGF and EGF are capable of activating Gab1 and inducing epithelial morphogenesis, the phenotypic effects of these growth factors are distinct. HGF stimulation of mIMCD-3 cells results in cell processes with multiple branches, whereas the EGFR ligands EGF and transforming growth factor-α stimulate longer processes with fewer branch points (24Barros E.J. Santos O.F. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ability of Gab1 to induce these morphogenic effects is dependent on its localization to the membrane, which is mediated by the binding of the Gab1 PH domain to PI-3,4,5-P3 (5Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The association of the PI3K with Gab1, resulting in local PI-3,4,5-P3 generation, thus serves to perpetuate Gab1 signaling. Therefore, the careful regulation of this interaction may serve to dictate whether the phenotypic outcome of receptor stimulation is process branching or process elongation. Our results suggest that growth factor-selective MAPK activation is capable of providing a second level of regulation of the interaction of the PI3K and Gab1 in addition to receptor phosphorylation of the p85 binding sites. HGF-activated ERK2 appears to directly phosphorylate Gab1 near the p85 binding site, resulting in enhanced PI3K binding and activation. In contrast, EGF-stimulated ERK activation, possibly ERK5, causes a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Gab1 and results in diminished PI3K signaling.

The AR belongs to a large family of nuclear receptors, whose members mediate the actions of steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, vitamin D3, and fatty acid derivatives. The majority of these receptor proteins share a common domain organization (see Fig. 1 A). The ligand binding domain (LBD) in the carboxyl terminus binds ligand and participates in dimerization and ligand-dependent transactivation. A hinge region connects the LBD to the DNA binding domain (DBD), a region responsible for recognition of and binding to DNA target sequences and receptor dimerization. The amino-terminal domain (NTD) of these proteins is the most variable in length and amino acid sequence but is often critical for transactivation. In the case of the AR, the major transactivation domain has been mapped to the amino-terminal domain (3Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

This region of the receptor also contains homopolymer stretches of the amino acids glutamine (Gln), glycine (Gly), and proline (Pro). The largest stretch of glutamines is of particular interest because expansion of this sequence from on-average 22 to greater than 40 residues results in the neuromuscular degenerative condition spinal bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy's disease (reviewed in Refs. 24Choong C.S.

The DBD is characterized by two zinc-coordinated modules that fold to give a compact globular structure. The DNA recognition helix is part of module I and is orientated at 90° to a second helix in module II, and together these form the hydrophobic core of the domain (see Ref. 26Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar and references therein). The LBD is characterized by a unique fold, termed a “helical sandwich,” consisting of three layers of anti-parallel α-helix. In the agonist-bound holo-LBD, the ligand is in a hydrophobic pocket buried in the structure (26Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The recently published AR-LBD structure fits well with this canonical structure and contains 11 helical segments and 4 β-strands (27Poujol N. Wurtz J.M. Tahiri B. Lumbroso S. Nicolas J.C. Moras D.

In contrast, little is known about the three-dimensional structure of the NTD of nuclear receptors. Studies on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transactivation domain (GR-AF1/τ1, amino acids 77–262) revealed little stable structure in aqueous solution (29Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J.

However, in the presence of the helix-stabilizing solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE) or the natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the GR-AF1/τ1 domain adopted a clear α-helical conformation (30Baskakov I.V.

NMR spectroscopy revealed three α-helical regions within a functional subdomain of this region (amino acids 187–242) (29Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J-Å. Härd T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, the amino-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 15–44) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α adopted a helical conformation in the presence of TFE (31Hi R. Osada S. Yumoto N. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35152-35158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For both the GR and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, the introduction of helix-disrupting mutations supported the importance of helical structure for receptor-dependent transactivation (29Dahlman-Wright K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To date, despite the importance of sequences within the AR-NTD for gene regulation, there have been no reports on the structure of this domain. In the present study we have used a combination of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, and sensitivity to protease digestion to analyze the secondary and tertiary structure of the amino-terminal domain of the AR involved in transactivation. These studies reveal that the AR contains limited stable secondary structure in aqueous solution but adopts a more stable conformation in the presence of the secondary structure-stabilizing solvents TFE and TMAO. Of particular note is that binding of the AR transactivation domain to a target protein,i.e. the general transcription factor TFIIF, was found to induce a more stable conformation. AR4 mutant polypeptides M5, M8, and M9 were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table I. For AR4-M5 the coding sequence of AR4 was first subcloned into Bluescript pBSK (+), and single-stranded DNA was prepared. AR4-M8 and -M9 were created using the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene) and pET-AR4 (16McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of mutant M8, the parent DNA was first mutated with the L236P primers, and a second round of mutagenesis was then performed on the resulting mutant DNA using the L251P primers. The authenticity of all plasmids was confirmed by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing of the insert. It should be noted that one additional change, a conservative serine to threonine, was found in AR4-M8 at position 255.Table ISite-directed mutagenesis primersAR4 MutantMutationOligonucleotidesM5 Antisense primerI181N/L182N5′-CCTTAAAGAC AACAAC AGCGAGGCCAG-3′M8 Sense primer 1L236P5′-CGCCAAGGAG CCG TGTAAGGCAGTGTCGGTGAGCATGGGCCTG-3′ Antisense primer 15′-CAGGCCCATGCTCACCGACACTGCCTTACA CGG CTCCTTGGCG-3′M8 Sense primer 2L251P5′-GTGTGGAGGCG CCG GAGCATCTGACTCC-3′ Antisense primer 25′-GGAGTCAGATGCTC CGG CGCCTCCACAC-3′M9 Sense primerA353P/A355P5′-GCACTGGACGAG CCG GCT CCG TACCAGAGTCG-3′ Antisense primer5′-CGACTCTGGTA CGG AGC CGG CTCGTCCAGTGC-3′Mutated codons are highlighted in bold and underlined.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by a process of freeze-thawing and incubation with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme at 4 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using Ni2+-nitriloacetate-agarose affinity chromatography resin (Qiagen). A PCR product encoding AR4 was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences), previously digested with BamHI, to generate pGEX-AR4. The GST-AR4 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli strain BLR(DE3) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4–5 h at room temperature in 2×TY media (1.6% Bactotryptone, 1.0% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). The cells were lysed as before, and the recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was estimated against bovine serum albumin standards using the Bradford assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the AR and representative SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the purified AR polypeptides. Purified, recombinant AR4, AR4-M5, -M8, and -M9 were diluted to a final concentration of 50 pmol/10-μl reaction in proteolysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm CaCl2, 60 mm KCl) and digested with 0.25 ng/μl trypsin for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 75 °C for 5 min. The samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-hexahistidine antibody (Sigma). GST-AR4 (50 pmol) in proteolysis buffer was partially digested alone or in the presence of LexADBD, ARDBD, or RAP74-CTD. The digestions were performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl at room temperature for the indicated times with 0.25 ng/μl trypsin, 2 ng/μl chymotrypsin, or 8 ng/μl endoproteinase Glu-C. GST-AR4 was also digested with each enzyme in the presence of TFE and/or TMAO for the times indicated at room temperature. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 75 °C for 5 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the digested proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-GST antibody (Sigma) and visualized by ECL. The artificial trypsin substrate Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester (0.23 mm) was incubated with 0.25 ng/μl trypsin in 63 mm sodium phosphate, 0.06 mm HCl in the presence of TFE or TMAO. The reactions were monitored at 253 nm, and absorbance readings were taken every 2 min for 20 min. Fluorescence measurements were made using a Shimadzu 1501 spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission band widths of 10 nm using a 1-cm path-length cuvette. The fluorescence spectra of AR4 (30 μg/ml in dialysis buffer) were read at excitation wavelengths of 278 and 295 nm and emission wavelengths between 300 and 450 nm. Excitation at 278 nm resulted in fluorescence emission from tryptophan and tyrosine residues; in addition, there was energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan. However, excitation at 295 nm resulted in selective tryptophan fluorescence. All spectra were corrected for the contribution of the buffer and solute concentrations. As a control, we measured the fluorescence spectrum of 1.6 μm N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide in the absence and presence of 3 m TMAO, the highest concentration used in these experiments. There was a modest quenching of the N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide signal (less than 15%) in the presence of TMAO (data not shown). Thus, we conclude the effects of TMAO on AR4 fluorescence are genuine effects on protein conformation. In the quenching experiments the fluorescence spectra for AR4 was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide in the absence or presence of 3 m TMAO after excitation at 295 nm. The Stern-Volmer constant (Ksv) was calculated using the equation F0/F = 1 +Ksv[Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence in the absence and presence of quencher, Q, respectively (see Ref. 35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Purified AR4 was dialyzed against 4 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mmsodium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol for CD analysis. The far UV CD spectra for AR4 was measured at 20 °C in the presence or absence of trifluoroethanol on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter calibrated with (1 S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Far UV CD spectra (195–260 nm) were measured using a cell of 0.02-cm path length. At the concentrations of protein obtainable in the presence of added solvents and solutes, it was not possible to record near UV CD spectra (260–320 nm) with suitable precision. Despite the importance of the amino-terminal transactivation domain in the function of the AR, no three-dimensional structure for this region is currently available. We have therefore undertaken CD analysis of the AR transactivation domain (Fig. 1 A, amino acids 142–485) to gain insight into the secondary structure content of this part of the receptor. The CD spectrum in the far UV range is sensitive to the conformation of the polypeptide backbone and can be used to estimate the proportions of secondary structure elements present and changes in the conformation under specific conditions. In aqueous solution, the AR polypeptide showed relatively little stable secondary structure. The dominant feature of the CD spectrum was a minimum at around 200 nm, which is characteristic of a non-ordered polypeptide (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in the presence of increasing amounts of the hydrophobic solvent TFE, the CD spectrum was characterized by minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of a significant proportion of α-helical structure (Fig. 2 A). The increase in the value of the negative ellipticity at 222 nm with increasing TFE was consistent with increasing α-helix content. We used the SELCON procedure (36Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) to give an indication of the changes in secondary structure content at increasing concentrations of TFE, although it should be noted that the deconvolution analysis has only been strictly calibrated for proteins in aqueous solutions. The analysis indicates that the helical content increased from 13 to 40% with a reduction in the turn and other structure contents from 32 to 20% and from 36 to 25%, respectively, as the TFE concentration was increased from 0 to 50% (Fig. 2 B). Despite the limitations of the analysis, the data indicate that under specific conditions, the AR transactivation domain has the propensity to adopt a stable conformation with significant α-helical content. Fluorescence emission spectra for proteins result from the presence of aromatic amino acids, with tryptophan fluorescence making the dominant contribution. The AR4 polypeptide contains 13 tyrosines and 2 tryptophan residues (Trp396 and Trp432) (Fig. 1 A). Excitation at 278 nm results in fluorescence emission from tryptophan and tyrosine residues; in addition, there can be energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan. The spectrum thus provides information about the local conformation surrounding these residues. The fluorescence spectrum for AR4 is characterized by an emission maximum at 343 nm, due to the tryptophan residues, and a shoulder at 309 nm, resulting from tyrosine emission (Fig. 3 A). The folding of the AR transactivation domain was investigated using TMAO, which has been shown to facilitate the folding of proteins into “native” conformations (see Ref. 37Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the presence of up to 3 mTMAO there was an increase in the quantum yield, the tryptophan emission maximum blue shifted to 336 nm, and the shoulder due to tyrosine fluorescence was lost (Fig. 3 A). A similar trend was observed with 10 and 20% TFE (data not shown). These results indicate that the two tryptophan residues become less solvent-exposed, and there is an increase in the energy transfer from tyrosine to tryptophan residues, consistent with the AR polypeptide becoming more structured. Acrylamide is known to act as a dynamic quencher of tryptophan fluorescence and can therefore be used to investigate the accessibility of tryptophan residues. Tryptophan residues on the surface will be more readily quenched than those buried within the protein structure. Fig. 3 B shows that in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide the fluorescence intensity for the tryptophan maximum after excitation at 295 nm was reduced. Using the Stern-Volmer equation (“Experimental Procedures”), a plot of F0/F against acrylamide concentration was obtained, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quenching agent, respectively. From the linear plot, a Stern-Volmer constant (Ksv) of 10.8 m −1 was calculated, indicating that both tryptophans have a high degree of exposure to solvent and behave in an identical fashion (35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In the presence of 3 m TMAO, a Ksv of 9.7m −1 was observed (data not shown). This is consistent with the folding of the AR polypeptide, leading to the tryptophan residues being less susceptible to the quenching agent. Taken together the spectroscopy analysis indicates that the AR transactivation domain is structurally flexible and capable of a adopting a more folded conformation in the presence of the alcohol TFE or the natural osmolyte TMAO. The AR transactivation domain is predicted to contain four α-helical regions, giving an α-helical content of about 20% (Fig. 4), comparable with the values calculated from CD analysis. Therefore, to investigate the possible existence of local structural elements, the fluorescence spectrum for AR4 after denaturation was measured. In the presence of 6m urea the tryptophan emission maximum red-shifts to 350 nm, indicating the tryptophan residues have become even more fully exposed to solvent (Fig. 5). In addition, a clear peak of tyrosine fluorescence at 309 nm was now seen, indicating a reduction in energy transfer and an increased separation between tyrosine and tryptophan residues. Taken together with the CD results, the fluorescence data indicate that AR4 has a limited amount of secondary and tertiary structure, which is lost on treatment with urea.Figure 5The fluorescence emission spectrum for AR4 in the absence or presence of 6 m urea after excitation (Ex.) at 278 nm. A λmaxfor tryptophan was observed at 342 nm in the absence of urea. In the presence of urea, the λmax for tryptophan increased to 350 nm, and a clear peak of tyrosine fluorescence at 309 nm was observed. Data represent the average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate further the local conformation of the AR transactivation domain, we used limited proteolytic digestion and site-directed mutagenesis. The first three helical regions were targeted with double point mutations, which were predicted to disrupt the local helical conformation (Fig. 4). AR4 was digested with trypsin for different times, and fragments retaining the amino-terminal histidine tag were specifically detected using an anti-His antibody. Trypsin digestion of AR4 led to four distinct amino-terminal fragments (Fig. 6, bands 2–5). Strikingly, point mutations M5 and M8, predicted to disrupt helical regions 1 or 2, respectively, led to a loss or reduction in bands 4 and 5 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy of all three mutant polypeptides (M5, M8, and M9) revealed an increase in the signal due to tyrosine emission, consistent with the loss of local structure and an increase in the distance between tyrosine and tryptophan residues (data not shown). Taken together, these studies provide strong support for the existence of local structural elements within the AR4 polypeptide, which can be disrupted by helix-breaking mutations. The function of the AR is critically dependent upon protein-protein interactions (see the Introduction). Among such interactions, we have previously demonstrated binding of the AR4 polypeptide to the general transcription factor TFIIF, which was sufficient to relieve squelching by the receptor transactivation domain (16McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of protein-protein interactions on AR transactivation domain folding, a polypeptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 155 amino acids of RAP 74 (RAP74-CTD), which contains the receptor binding site, 2J. Reid, R. Betney, I. Murray, K. Walt, and I. J. McEwan, manuscript in preparation.was used. Because RAP74-CTD has a carboxyl-terminal histidine tag, a GST-AR4 fusion protein was used in these studies to permit specific detection of AR polypeptides using an anti-GST monoclonal antibody. The GST-AR4 fusion protein was extremely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage, and treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or endoproteinase Glu-C resulted in the generation of a series of stable fragments of relative molecular mass 24,000–30,000 Da, representing the GST moiety (Figs. 7 and8). In the presence of RAP74-CTD (amino acids 363–517), the AR polypeptide was markedly less susceptible to cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 7 A) and chymotrypsin (Fig. 8 A). In addition to the full-length protein, fragments of 55,000 Da (band 2) and 34,000–37,000 Da (bands 3–4) or 59,000 Da (band 2) were protected from cleavage with trypsin or chymotrypsin, respectively. Total protein concentration was kept constant in all samples using the LexADBD or ARDBD as nonspecific proteins of comparable molecular mass to RAP74-CTD. RAP74-CTD was less efficient at protecting the AR polypeptide from endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage, although limited protection of the full-length and a 57,000-Da fragment was seen (Fig. 8 C, bands 1 and 2).Figure 8Limited proteolysis of GST-AR4 with chymotrypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C.

https://openalex.org/W2079185228,"The pressure-induced chemical reaction of liquid butadiene was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell. Dimerization was found to occur above 0.7 gigapascal, giving vinylcyclohexene according to a cyclo-addiction reaction and only a trace amount of polybutadiene forms. By irradiating the high-pressure sample with a few milliwatts of the 488-nanometer argon+ laser line, the dimerization was completely inhibited, and the rapid formation of pure trans-polybutadiene was observed. The use of different excitation wavelength allows us to emphasize the selectivity of the process and to identify the active role of the 2(1)Ag state in this pressure- and laser-induced chemical reaction."

Molecular chaperones (heat-shock proteins) were initially identified by their appearance under conditions of stress. During stress, these proteins prevent aggregation and assist in the refolding of misfolded proteins. Chaperones also play essential roles in a variety of cellular functions under normal conditions. These functions include assisting in the folding of newly translated proteins, guiding translocation proteins across organelle membranes, assembling and disassembling oligomeric protein complexes, and facilitating proteolytic degradation of unstable proteins (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, different classes of molecular chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE) function in concert: DnaJ and GrpE act as co-factors for the ATPase activity catalyzed by DnaK (2Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar).

Although the Hsp70 family members share a high degree of sequence conservation, members of the DnaJ-like protein family are structurally diverse, containing different combinations of 1–3 conserved domains. All DnaJ-like proteins contain a characteristic J-domain, which is believed to mediate the interactions with Hsp70 that regulate ATPase activity (2Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Regions in the C terminus of the DnaJ-like protein are much less conserved and thought to mediate interactions with polypeptide substrates (4Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hsp70, which is ubiquitously expressed, several DnaJ family proteins exhibit some tissue specificity (5Cheetham M.E. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Biochem.

Thus, DnaJ proteins may play a role in determining the specificity of functional engagement of Hsp70 in distinct cellular compartments or in different cell types (4Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G.

For example, heat shock treatment induces the overexpression of certain chaperones, which is correlated with the increasing protective effect against light damage in the retina (7Barbe M. Tytell M. Gower D. Welch W. Science. 1988; 241: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and against glutamate excitotoxicity in cortical neuron cultures (8Rordorf G. Koroshetz W.J. Bonventre J.V.

A hallmark of polyglutamine diseases is the proteolytic production of an N-terminal fragment of huntingtin, containing the polyglutamine repeat, that forms aggregates (inclusions) in the nucleus and cytoplasm of affected neurons (10Igarashi S.

Although the inclusions have not been shown to have a causal role in these diseases, their involvement in the pathogenesis of HD has been supported by the correlation between the number of inclusions in HD patients' cortex and the severity of their disease (17Yamamoto A.

Moreover, inclusion formation precedes neurological dysfunction in the transgenic mice model of HD and is associated with predisposition to cell death in in vitro cell models of HD (19Martindale D.

The involvement of molecular chaperones in the polyglutamine expansion-induced diseases is best evidenced by the fact that Hsp70 and DnaJ-like protein Hsp40/HDJ1 were isolated as suppressors for polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration in the fly (21Warrick J.M.

However, overexpression of different members of universally expressed DnaJ-like family proteins have had varied results in the cellular model of HD: Overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ increased polyglutamine-induced aggregation (23Wyttenbach A. Carmichael J. Swartz J. Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this paper, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of a DnaJ-like family protein, MRJ, which is highly enriched in the central nervous system. In HD cell models, overexpressed MRJ effectively suppressed the protein aggregation, caspase activity, and cellular toxicity induced by the mutant huntingtin, suggesting that MRJ may be a chaperone that acts on neuronal disease proteins. Partial cDNAs of bovine mrj were initially isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the second extracellular region of peripherin/rds was used as bait. To construct the bait plasmid, the coding sequence for peripherin/rds (Arg-123 to Ser-264) was PCR-amplified from the human retinal cDNA (forward primer, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCGGGGCTCGCTGGAGAACACC; reverse primer, 5′-GTACCCATGGTTAGGAGTTCATGAGGCTGCTGTA) and inserted into NdeI/NcoI-digested pASII vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To obtain the full-length bovine mrj cDNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE were carried out using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized on bovine retinal poly(A)+ RNA using gene-specific primers (5′-CTGGCCGTCTTCTTCAACTTCCACCC-3′ for 5′-RACE; 5′-GGAGCCGAGGCACGGGCTCGTTC-3′ for 3′-RACE). The second-strand cDNA was subsequently synthesized and ligated with an adapter primer. Finally, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE products were PCR-amplified using adapter-ligated cDNAs as template. The forward primer used for the PCR was a modified adapter primer that contains an extra BamHI site, and the reverse primer is a nested gene-specific primer (5′-CATGCCATGGTGATCTTCCTGCTGTTCACCAC for 5′-RACE; 5′-CATGCCATGGAAGTCTGTTTCCTTCCTTTGATGC for 3′-RACE). The nested PCR products were then digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into NcoI/BamHI-digested pACTII vector (CLONTECH) for sequencing. To isolate human mrj cDNA, full-length bovine mrj cDNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Ready to Go kit, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) and used as a probe to screen a human retinal cDNA library (a kind gift from Dr. J. Nathans). The cDNA inserts were PCR-amplified from the positive isolates and cloned for sequencing. Several clones contained full-length human mrj, with an encoded sequence identical to the human mrj recorded in GenBankTM (accession number NP_005485). To generate a GST-MRJ fusion construct for antibody production, a BamHI/XhoI cDNA fragment containing the C-terminal 198 residues of bovine MRJ was excised from the pACTII vector isolated from the two-hybrid screen and inserted 3′ of the GST open reading frame in pGEX-5X-2 vector. The same cDNA fragment was also subcloned into a BamHI/SalI-digested pMAL-cRI* vector (26Chuang J.-Z. Lin D.C. Lin S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1095-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) to produce an MBP-MRJ fusion for antibody purification. The coding sequence of full-length human MRJ and an N-terminal 41-amino acid-deleted mutant were also subcloned into a PRK5 vector for eukaryotic expression. For the ATPase activity assay, a His6 tag was fused to the C terminus of an ORF containing either the full-length (MRJ-(1–241)), the J plus G/F domain (MRJ-(1–109)), or the C-terminal domain (MRJ-(108–241)) of human MRJ in pET28a vector using standard PCR-cloning methods. All PCR-derived constructs were sequenced to confirm the absence of spurious mutations. Total RNA (20 μg) from various bovine tissues was purified and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and blotted as described previously (27Chuang J.Z. Milner T.A. Zhu M. Sung C.-H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2919-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A α-32P-radiolabeled, bovine mrj cDNA fragment containing the region encoding the entire 3′-UTR region (nucleotides 811–1374) was hybridized in 5× SSC, 30% formamide, 2% SDS, 200 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA and 5× Denhardt's solution at 42 °C. Human poly(A)+ RNA tissue blots (CLONTECH) were similarly probed with radiolabeled cDNA fragment of the human mrj 3′-UTR region (nucleotides 730–1406). After hybridization, RNA blots were washed three times with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature before autoradiography. BL21(DE3) harboring fusion constructs encoding His6-tagged MRJ fragments were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 3 h. The cells were lysed, and postnuclear supernatant was purified on a nickel column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). Fusion proteins were dialyzed against ATPase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgOAc). The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the purity of the protein was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The ATPase activity assay was performed as described previously (28Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, assays were carried out in duplicate, with two 50-μl reactions per sample. Each reaction contained 1 μm bovine Hsp70 (Hsc70, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 50 μm ATP, 0.6 μm purified His6-tagged MRJ fragment, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, MA) in ATPase reaction buffer. Prior to the reaction, 7 μl of each sample was removed and used to assess the basal level of radioactive release. At different time intervals during the 30 °C incubation, 7-μl aliquots were taken out and transferred to 0.5 ml of suspension containing 50 mm HCl, 5 mm H3PO4, and 7% (w/v) activated charcoal (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to stop the reaction. The reactions were centrifuged and assayed by liquid scintillation counting. The cpm values were converted to moles of Pirelease into the supernatant at each time point. Initial titration of MRJ proteins (0–6 μm) in the Hsp70 ATPase assay showed that the ATPase stimulation effect of MRJ is dosage-dependent and that components in the ratio of 1 mol of Hsp70 to 1–3 mol of full-length MRJ fragments were effective. Note that the His6-tag has been found to have no adverse effect on the co-chaperone activity of Hsp40 (29Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Bovine GST-MRJ was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with minor modifications. Briefly, the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside-induced bacterial culture was centrifuged and the cell pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated. The sonicated samples were supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, sonicated, and recentrifuged. The final pellet was dissolved in 8m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A gel slice containing GST-MRJ was excised, ground, and used for immunization (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA). The resulting antiserum was used in this report. MBP-MRJ fusion proteins, which are soluble in Triton X-100, were produced and purified according to manufacturer's instruction (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). To affinity-purify the immunized rabbit antiserum, crude serum was first passed through Sepharose columns conjugated with GST and MBP proteins, then a column conjugated with MBP-MRJ fusion protein. The antibodies were eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.5. PRK vectors expressing HD exon 1 (1–67 amino acids) plus additional 150 glutamines, Hsp70, and red fluorescence protein have been described in a previous study (25Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of 293 cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For co-transfection, same amounts of huntingtin cDNA and the PRK vectors were used for expression of huntingtin alone. At 24 or 48 h after transfection, cells grown in six-well plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton-100. Double labeling was carried out using rabbit anti-MRJ antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-huntingtin antibody. The latter one was generated against the human huntingtin N terminus (amino acids 1–256), the same antigen that has been used to generate rabbit antibody EM48 (30Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H.

A Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 135) and video system (Dage-MTI Inc., Michigan City, IN) were used to capture images. The captured images were stored and processed using Adobe PhotoShop software. Cell viability was determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTS) assay (Cell Titer 96, Promega) as described in our previous study (25Zhou H. Li S.H.

Briefly, transfected 293 cells in six-well plates were transferred into 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in serum-free medium, and 20 μl of MTS reagent (2.1 mg/ml) was added to each well. The cells were then incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 10% SDS. The plates were read with a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS, Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA) at 490 nm. Each data point was obtained using a triplet assay. Fluorometric assays of caspase-3 activity (25Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Li S.H. Cheng A.L., Li, H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5159-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed using kits obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratory (Hercules, CA). Cultured 293 cells were transiently transfected with mutant huntingtin 150Q or co-transfected with huntingtin and MRJ for 24 or 48 h in six-well plates. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4/NaHPO4, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate). To measure caspase activity, 200 μl of assay buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS, 20% sucrose) was added to a tube, with a final concentration of 10 ng/μl peptide substrate (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl) for caspase-3. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were added to the tube to start the reaction. When the caspase inhibitor (Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone) was used to measure the specificity of the assay, it was added to cell lysates at a concentration of 50 μm for 30 min before the addition of the specific caspase substrate. Background was obtained with the same assay buffer without cell lysates. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the measurement of the caspase activity with a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC) set at 390-nm excitation and 460-nm emission. For staurosporine treatment, transfected cells were grown in culture medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then incubated with staurosporine (2.5 μm, Sigma Chemical Co.) for 6 h before caspase-3 activity analysis. All values were obtained from three to five independent experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Various tissues dissected from rats were homogenized and lysed in extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). The supernatant prepared by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted. Immunoblotting assays were performed by standard procedures. For signal detection, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate were used. For the transfected cells, immunoblotting procedures were carried out as described previously (25Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). During a two-hybrid screen for genes whose products interact with a retinal disease protein peripherin/rds (32Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Genet. 1993; 3: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a cDNA containing partial sequences with significant homology to several DnaJ-like family proteins was isolated. To obtain a full-length cDNA of this DnaJ-like protein, we produced 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR products from bovine retinal RNA, and fused them together (see “Experimental Procedures”). The deduced amino acid sequence of this bovine cDNA (Fig. 1) was 94 and 90% identical to human and mouse MRJ, respectively (34Hunter P.J. Swanson B.J. Haendel M.A. Lyons G.E. Cross J.C.

This was further supported by the isolation of several full-length human mrj cDNA clones from a human retinal library probed with the bovine cDNA. Although human MRJ has 242 amino residues, both the bovine and mouse mrj encode an open reading frame of 241 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 26.9 kDa and a predicted pI of 7.4 (Table I).

Expression of constitutively active Rac1 in “COSphox ” cells induced translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane. Furthermore, translocation of p47phox was induced in the absence of p67phox expression, even though Rac does not directly bind p47phox. Rac effector domain point substitutions (A27K, G30S, D38A, Y40C), which can selectively eliminate interaction with different effector proteins, impaired Rac1V12-induced superoxide production. Activation of endogenous Rac1 by expression of constitutively active Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) derivatives was sufficient to induce high level NADPH oxidase activity in COSphox cells. The constitutively active form of the hematopoietic-specific GEF, Vav1, was the most effective at activating superoxide production, despite detection of higher levels of Rac1-GTP upon expression of constitutively active Vav2 or Tiam1 derivatives. These data suggest that Rac can play a dual role in NADPH oxidase activation, both by directly participating in the oxidase complex and by activating signaling events leading to oxidase assembly, and that Vav1 may be the physiologically relevant GEF responsible for activating this Rac-regulated complex.

Binding of inflammatory mediators to specific phagocytic cell surface receptors triggers assembly of the multicomponent NADPH oxidase. Tight regulation of NADPH oxidase activation is required, because excessive or inappropriate superoxide release can damage adjacent host tissue, as has been implicated in pathologic inflammatory conditions (4Jackson J.H.

The Rac insert domain is not involved in binding to p67phox but rather is postulated to directly interact with the flavocytochrome (27Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D.

McPhail L.C. Lambeth J.D. Han C. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells express the Rac1 but not the Rac2 isoform. The transgenic “COSphox ” cells exhibit high level NADPH oxidase activity induced using either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or arachidonic acid, two soluble stimuli commonly used to activate the neutrophil NADPH oxidase. Agonist-elicited superoxide production by the COSphox cells was significantly inhibited by transient expression of dominant-negative Rac mutants or by overexpression of the inhibitory Rac-binding protein, RhoGDI. These results supported an important role for Rac in regulating the NADPH oxidase in COSphox cells, consistent with the genetic data in murine and human neutrophils.In the current study we show that Rac activation in COSphox cells, either by expression of constitutively active Rac exchange factors or by expression of constitutively active Rac derivatives, is sufficient to induce membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox and activate the NADPH oxidase, in the absence of any other stimulus. Constitutively active Vav1 was more effective at activating superoxide production than Vav2 or Tiam1. Selective Rac effector domain point substitutions, which disrupt interaction with different downstream effector proteins, inhibited Rac1V12-induced NADPH oxidase activity, supporting a role for multiple effectors in mediating Rac-GTP oxidase activation. Our data suggest that Rac can regulate phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity both as a direct participant in the oxidase complex and as an activator of signaling events leading to oxidase assembly.DISCUSSIONAt least two separate events are required for assembly of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in intact cells: 1) phosphorylation of p47phox followed by membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox, and 2) activation and membrane translocation of Rac. How Rac activation contributes to regulation of the NADPH oxidase has not been fully elucidated. It is well established that Rac-GTP is a component of the active oxidase complex, binding to both p67phox and also likely the flavocytochrome (1Babior B.

In this study, we show that in COSphox cells, activation of Rac, either by expression of V12 or L61 Rac derivatives or by expression of constitutively active Rac exchange factors, can itself drive membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox and assemble a functional NADPH oxidase in the absence of any other stimulus. This contrasts with assembly of the NADPH oxidase in standard cell-free assay conditions, where activated Rac (added as Rac-GTPγS) is insufficient for initiating superoxide production unless an active conformation of p47phox is induced by the addition of an anionic amphiphile (1Babior B. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huang J. Kleinberg M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15519-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Optimal Rac-GTP-induced superoxide production required p47phox expression, as is the case for agonist-elicited oxidase activity in phagocytes and in another heterologous intact cell model based on the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (56de Mendez I. Leto T.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been reported to partially inhibit agonist-elicited membrane translocation of Rac in intact human neutrophils while having a minimal effect on p47phox and p67phox membrane translocation (55Dorseuil O. Quinn M.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, our results are not inconsistent with these observations, because residual Rac translocation may have been sufficient to activate p47phox and p67phox translocation in this study. In addition, non-Rac-dependent pathways for inducing NADPH oxidase assembly may also exist. We therefore propose that Rac can play a dual role in NADPH oxidase activation in intact cells, both as a direct participant in the assembled oxidase and as an activator of signaling events leading to p47phox and p67phox membrane translocation.It is important to note that the COSphox cells are a model system that may lack proteins that could influence NADPH oxidase assembly in response to activated Rac in phagocytes. For example, p40phox is not expressed in COS cells. In resting neutrophils, p40phox is associated with p67phox and one-third to one-half of cellular p47phox in a high molecular weight cytosolic complex of undetermined stoichiometry and translocates to the membrane upon cellular activation (57Heyworth P. Curnutte J. Badwey J. Serhan C.N. Ward P.A. Molecular and Cellular Basis of Inflammation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 165-191Google Scholar). p40phox can also bind cytoskeletal proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3′-phosphate (58Ellson C.D. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K.

In assays using either cell-free conditions or the K562 model, the addition of p40phox has been variously reported to exert either a positive or negative influence or have no effect at all on oxidase activity (58Ellson C.D.

Hence, the role of p40phox in regulating NADPH oxidase activity and whether or not it might influence the response to Rac activation is unclear but will be investigated in future studies.In transgenic COS cells, expression of constitutively active Rac or constitutively active Rac-GEFs was sufficient to direct membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 derivatives also stimulated p47phox translocation to the plasma membrane, even in the absence of p67phox expression, although Rac-GTP does not directly bind to p47phox (23Dorseuil O.

In neutrophils, current evidence indicates that p47phox membrane translocation requires phosphorylation of multiple serine residues, including serines 303, 304, and 328, to expose an SH-3 domain necessary for p47phox association with a proline-rich region on the p22phox flavocytochrome subunit (8–11,14). The kinases that phosphorylate p47phox in vivo are unknown, although multiple protein kinases, including protein kinase C and members of the PAK and mitogen-activated protein kinase families can phosphorylate p47phox in vitro(69McPhail L.C. Waite K.A. Regier D.S. Nixon J.B. Qualliotine-Mann D. Zhang W.X. Wallin R. Sergeant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rac is known to activate numerous downstream effector proteins, including phospholipase C-β2, as well as serine/threonine kinases, which regulate diverse signaling pathways (36Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 37Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), and we postulate that these can contribute directly or indirectly to p47phox membrane translocation. Whether activated Rac and its downstream effector proteins induce p47phox phosphorylation in COSphox cells is currently under investigation. In preliminary studies we have found that the protein kinase C-selective inhibitor GF109203x reduced Rac1V12-, Rac1L61-, and Vav1ΔN-186-induced superoxide production by ∼25% (data not shown). Expression of constitutively active Rac1V12 or Rac1L61 derivatives was also sufficient to induce p67phox membrane translocation in the absence of p47phox expression, probably through direct p67phox interaction with overexpressed Rac-GTP.Rac mutations that can selectively disrupt interaction with different effector proteins impaired Rac1V12-induced COSphox NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that multiple effectors mediate Rac-GTP-induced oxidase activation. Point substitutions A27K or G30S, which prevent Rac interaction with p67phox (40Lapouge K. Smith J.S. Walker A.P. Gamblin J.S. Smerdon J.S. Rittinger K. Mol.

Instead, this DIS motif is base-paired in a long distance interaction (LDI) that extends the stem of the primer-binding site domain. In this study, we show that targeting of the LDI by either antisense oligonucleotides or specific mutations can induce the conformational switch to a branched multiple hairpin (BMH) structure, and this LDI-to-BMH switch coincides with increased RNA dimerization. Another interesting finding is that the extended LDI stem can resist a certain level of destabilization, indicating that a buffer is created to prevent a premature conformational switch and early dimerization.

Distinct functions have been assigned to individual sequence and/or structure motifs (see Fig. 1 A). The 5′-terminal TAR hairpin forms the binding site for the viral Tat protein and the cellular cyclin T protein (3Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

The formation of this RNA-protein complex on the nascent transcript is essential for high level transcription from the LTR promoter (5Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The poly(A) hairpin also functions as part of the nascent transcript. The structure inhibits polyadenylation through the masking of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal (6Klasens B.I.F. Thiesen M. Virtanen A. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Klasens B.I.F. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1870-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both the TAR and poly(A) sequences are part of the terminal repeat (R), and a second copy is present at the extreme 3′-end of the viral RNA genome. At this position, inhibition of polyadenylation by the suppressive RNA structure is overcome by an upstream enhancer element that facilitates the binding of the CPSF polyadenylation factor. Thus, the upstream TAR and poly(A) hairpins play pivotal roles during the early phase of viral gene expression. In addition, these structure motifs in the R region also participate in later phases of the viral replication cycle (2Berkhout B. Adv.

An extended structure domain encompasses the primer-binding site (PBS) that binds the tRNALys3 primer for reverse transcription. Whereas the PBS motif is largely exposed within this structured RNA domain, there is some recent evidence for an additional upstream tRNA interaction site that is actively masked by base pairing in the extended PBS stem. This primer activation signal (PAS) is not involved in tRNA-annealing, but is essential for efficient initiation and elongation of reverse transcription (9Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol.

Further downstream we find structure motifs that have been implicated in dimerization and packaging of the HIV-1 RNA into virion particles.

Science. 1998; 279: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Thus, a multitude of critical RNA signals are clustered in the 336 nucleotides of the untranslated leader. The functional analysis of these motifs in replication studies with mutant viruses is seriously complicated by the overlap of some of these RNA replication signals. This problem is less severe in defined biochemical assays that focus on a particular RNA function, e.g. RNA dimerization with in vitro synthesized transcripts. A static secondary structure model of the HIV-1 leader RNA has been proposed (1Berkhout B. Progr. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we recently presented evidence that the HIV-1 leader does not constitutively adopt the conformation that is characterized by the multiple hairpins as shown in Fig. 1 A. In fact, the HIV-1 leader RNA folds into a more stable alternative conformation that appears to regulate the process of RNA dimer formation (20Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L.B. RNA. 2000; 6: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, we demonstrated that the poly(A) and DIS sequences can base pair, thereby masking the DIS palindrome and actively inhibiting RNA dimerization (21Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This long distance interaction (LDI) extends the stem region that forms the basis of the structured PBS domain (Fig. 1, B and C), and this RNA conformation is characterized by a typical fast migration on non-denaturing gels. The LDI conformation is thermodynamically more stable than the alternative conformation that we termed the branched multiple hairpin (BMH) structure. However, the viral NC protein can induce the latter structure, concomitant with increased RNA dimerization. It thus appears that the extended PBS stem region is involved in the regulation of both the reverse transcription and dimerization reactions through masking of the PAS and DIS elements. This dynamic property of the leader RNA structure may serve to coordinate the early and late replication functions, and we proposed the idea of an RNA checkpoint that regulates different leader RNA functions in a temporal manner. We performed a detailed in vitro analysis to further study the extended stem of the PBS domain and its influence on the structure and function of the HIV-1 leader RNA. The results indicate that the extended PBS stem can absorb minor mutations, but that progressive destabilization of the base-pairing potential does eventually trigger the LDI-to-BMH structural switch and subsequent RNA dimerization. In this sensitive assay system, we were also able to measure a modest effect of tRNA-PBS-annealing on the overall leader RNA conformation and its dimerization properties. These results provide the first evidence that the reverse transcription and dimerization reactions may be coupled through conformational changes within the leader RNA. Wild-type and mutant plasmids were used for PCR amplification and subsequent in vitro transcription. Plasmid Blue-5′-LTR (22Das A.T. Klaver B. Klasens B.I.F. van Wamel J.L.B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contains an XbaI-ClaI fragment of the HIV-1 subtype B molecular clone LAI (23Peden K.W.C. Martin M.A. Karn J. HIV, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1996Google Scholar). This HIV-1 fragment contains the complete 5′-LTR, PBS, leader, and the 5′-end of the gag gene (positions −454 to −376 relative to the transcriptional start site, +1), which was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). The construction of all mutants that target the U5-leader stem has been described previously (10Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 4-nucleotide deletion within the DIS hairpin loop of mutant GC1 was introduced as described (24Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant plasmids were used as templates for PCR amplification. The T7 promoter sequence was introduced into the PCR product with sense primers containing the T7 promoter sequence. The T7 promoter sequence was inserted immediately upstream of positions +1 or +92 with the sense primers T7-1 and T7-92. The oligonucleotide 290/270 was used as the antisense PCR primer. DNA products were separated on an agarose gel and extracted with the QIAEX II DNA isolation system according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA transcripts were produced with the megashortscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) in the presence of 1 μl of [α-32P]UTP (0.33 MBq/μl, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was purified on a 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Bands were visualized by autoradiography and excised from the gel, and RNA was eluted overnight in water at room temperature. The RNA was precipitated and dissolved in RNase-free water. RNA was renatured by incubation for 2 min at 85 °C, 10 min at 65 °C, and subsequent slow cooling to room temperature. RNA was quantified by scintillation counting, and the samples were stored at −20 °C. Dimerization was performed with ∼20 ng of 32P-labeled RNA in 24 μl of dimerization buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl). Depending on the type of experiment, we added 200 ng of oligonucleotide or tRNA (1, 4, or 8 μg of calf liver tRNA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mixture was heated for 2 min at 85 °C and was subsequently incubated for 10 min at 65 °C and slow cooled to room temperature in ∼1 h for renaturing and dimerization. We added 12 μl of loading buffer (30% glycerol with bromphenol blue), and the samples were analyzed both on a TBE gel (4% non-denaturing acrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE) and on a TBM gel (same as the TBE gel but with 0.1 mm MgCl2). Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V at room temperature and was followed by drying and autoradiography. Quantitation of the percentage dimerization was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Arrays comprising every possible 5- to 25-mer antisense oligonucleotide scanning HIV sequences +1 to +331 were synthesized using solid phase DNA chemistry. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in situ by delivery of phosphoramidite precursors to the surface of a derivatized microscope glass slide using inkjet technology. Standard DNA chemistry couples the precursors to the array surface or the growing DNA chain and repeated rounds of synthesis create oligonucleotides of specific sequence and length that are spatially addressable (25Hughes T.R.

In vitro transcripts were prepared from a double-stranded DNA template containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter generated by standard PCR from plasmid pBlue-5′-LTR (22Das A.T. Klaver B. Klasens B.I.F. van Wamel J.L.B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with primers T7-2 (6Klasens B.I.F. Thiesen M. Virtanen A. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and an antisense HIV primer hybridizing with the 5′-end to HIV nucleotide +290. PCR products were gel-purified and transcription reactions were performed with the Megashortscript T7 transcription kit, and transcripts were purified over a G50 spin column. Cy5 labeling was performed post-transcriptionally using the ULYSIS Cy5 labeling kit (Kreatech). RNA concentration and labeling density (∼1 Cy5 group per 34 nucleotides) were determined by spectrophotometry. Hybridizations were performed in a 280-μl reaction containing TEN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0), supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Transcripts (12 fmol of RNA or 100 fmol of Cy5) were heated to 85 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature in the presence or absence of the 151/123 oligonucleotide (50 pmol) (21Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Array hybridizations were performed for 16 h at room temperature under constant rotation of the hybridization chamber. Hybridization chambers were emptied and disassembled, and the array was quickly placed in a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 1× TEN buffer with 0.1% Triton, washed for 30 s by inverting the tube, placed in a second tube containing 0.1× TEN, and washed for a further 30 s with mixing. The array was slowly pulled from the final washing solution while being blown dry with a nitrogen gun at close range. The arrays were subsequently scanned in a Agilent confocal array scanner at 10-micron resolution. The Agilent feature extraction software package was used to automatically detect oligonucleotide features in the hybridization image, and the resulting data were corrected for local background for each individual feature. Hybridization signals that did not pass the stringent quality tests or that were at or below background signal levels were discarded. The experimental data were exported to a tab-delimited text file and were imported in spreadsheet software for detailed analysis. To study the effect of the extended PBS stem region on the LDI-BMH equilibrium and DIS-mediated RNA dimerization, we targeted the HIV-1 leader RNA with a set of antisense DNA oligonucleotides. The transcript-oligonucleotide complexes were analyzed on non-denaturing TBE and TBM gels to distinguish the different leader RNA conformations; the two monomer forms (the fast migrating LDI and the BMH forms) and RNA dimers. The HIV-1 transcript 1–290 that is shown in detail in Fig. 1 C stably adopts the fast migrating LDI conformation on the TBE and TBM gels (lane 1 in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Oligonucleotides targeting the TAR region (lanes 2 and 3) do not affect the LDI conformation and do not induce RNA dimer formation. Oligonucleotides that target the poly(A) domain do trigger the LDI-to-BMH rearrangement. This is clearly demonstrated on the TBE gel by the appearance of the slow migrating BMH form (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6). Consistent with previous results (27Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2594-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the LDI form refolds during electrophoresis on the TBM gel (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6). Most importantly, the LDI-to-BMH switch coincides with increased formation of RNA dimers (D), at least for the 104/77 and 122/99 oligonucleotides. The RNA dimers are apparent on the TBE gel (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6), but dimers are more prominent on the TBM gel (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). The TBM gel yields the highest dimerization level because labile kissing-loop RNA dimers do survive electrophoresis in the presence of magnesium. We initially tested five oligonucleotide probes that cover most of the PBS domain. All these oligonucleotides mediate the LDI-to-BMH switch (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–11), but the 181/152 and 202/182 probes show a partial transition (lanes 8 and 9). This trend translates directly into the dimerization capacity of HIV-1 RNA, which is strongly induced by oligonucleotides 151/123 and 223/200 that target the left and right side of the extended PBS stem, respectively. A very minor stimulation of RNA dimer formation is observed with probes 181/152 and 202/182, and oligonucleotide 245/216 induces an intermediate level of RNA dimers. The same samples were also analyzed on the TBM gel that stabilizes the dimer conformation (Fig. 2 B). The ranking order of the dimer induction properties of the antisense oligonucleotides in the PBS domain is 151/123 > 223/200 > 245/216 > 181/152 > 202/182. The probe 245/216 anneals very close to the DIS hairpin, apparently without preventing its dimerization function. However, we observed a severe dimerization defect when the probe is extended by three nucleotides toward the DIS element (probe 248/216, results not shown). We show two control reactions with other anti-DIS oligonucleotides (269/246 and 290/270). As expected, these probes do effectively trigger the LDI-to-BMH switch, but they block subsequent RNA dimerization by shielding of the actual dimerization motif (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 12 and 13). These results demonstrate that the DIS motif is solely responsible for in vitro dimerization of HIV-1 RNA. This was confirmed in studies with a mutant transcript with a truncated palindrome (GCGCGC to GC) that did not form dimers under these conditions (results not shown). We observed an almost perfect correlation between the ability of certain antisense oligonucleotides to mediate the LDI-to-BMH switch and their stimulatory effect on RNA dimerization. This result reinforces the idea that RNA dimer formation is prevented by the LDI conformation and that dimerization occurs spontaneously for BMH-folded transcripts. However, it cannot be excluded that the oligonucleotides have a more direct impact on the RNA dimerization reaction. To critically test this possibility, we used the TAR-deleted HIV-1 transcript 92–290 that exclusively folds into the BMH structure. Such transcripts indeed form dimers at a reasonable efficiency (27Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2594-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most importantly, none of the antisense oligonucleotides that stimulate dimerization of the wild-type transcript have an effect on the dimerization properties of this 5′-truncated transcript (results not shown). These combined results demonstrate that RNA dimerization is a direct consequence of the LDI-to-BMH conformational switch of the HIV-1 leader RNA. The results described thus far indicate that oligonucleotide-mediated targeting of the PBS domain can affect the LDI-BMH equilibrium but not all subdomains react similarly. Targeting of the PBS motif and the directly flanking sequences only marginally affected the level of RNA dimerization. Disruption of the PBS stem by DNA probes that bind either to the left side (151/123) or the right side (223/200) seems the most effective trigger of the LDI-to-BMH conformational switch, as measured by induction of RNA dimerization. To corroborate this result, we analyzed additional antisense oligonucleotides that target slightly shifted leader RNA domains. In brief, these oligonucleotides exhibit profound differences in their effect on the LDI-to-BMH equilibrium and concomitantly on the dimerization properties of the transcript. For instance, probe 151/123 induces RNA dimer formation as is the case when a more upstream leader sequence is targeted (132/104). However, a downstream shift (161/133) results in an almost complete loss of the ability to induce the BMH conformation and RNA dimerization (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 4). Probe 223/203 targets the right side of the LDI stem and effectively triggers RNA dimerization. Compared with this probe, a significant loss in dimerization was observed when a more upstream site is targeted (202/182, see Fig. 2). Similarly, less dimers are induced when a more downstream site is targeted (245/216 and 245/225, Fig. 3). These results indicate that maintenance of the upper part of the PBS stem, that is the PAS-containing segment, is critical for maintenance of the extended PBS stem and stable LDI folding of the HIV-1 leader RNA. One obvious problem with the use of oligonucleotides as antisense probes is that a length of about 20 nucleotides is required to ensure annealing onto the RNA template. Thus, the PAS stem cannot be targeted more specifically by this approach. We therefore synthesized mutant HIV-1 transcripts with more defined, precise alterations. A set of 18 transcripts with mutations in the PBS domain was analyzed, but we will focus on mutants that target the PAS-containing stem segment. The left side was altered in mutant 2L, the right side in mutant 2R, and the 2LR double mutant restores the base pairing possibility (28Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15474-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As a control, we also included the 3L mutant that alters the sequence directly upstream of the PAS element. All these mutations have a partial effect on the LDI-BMH equilibrium, but they do not detectably induce RNA dimerization (Fig. 4, A and B). The most significant conformational shift is apparent for the 2L and 2R mutants (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3), and this effect is less apparent when base pairing is restored in the 2LR double mutant (lane 4). Mutant 3L shows a marginal LDI-to-BMH shift (lane 5). These results are consistent with the proposed modulatory role of the PAS stem, but it is also apparent that the precise disruption of the base pairs of the PAS stem segment is not sufficient to trigger a complete LDI-to-BMH switch and subsequent RNA dimerization. To test whether more dramatic mutations can force a complete conformational switch, we analyzed the D1 deletion mutant that removes nearly the complete left side of the PBS domain (positions 112–148), including the PAS element (28Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15474-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, this radical mutation caused a complete LDI-to-BMH switch (Fig. 4 A, lane 6; note that this transcript is much shorter than the wild-type control), which endows this transcript with the property to dimerize (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 6). The inverse correlation between the stability of the LDI stem and the dimerization properties of the transcript was also probed with mutants that further stabilize the extended LDI stem. Virus mutants with these RNA genomes were previously reported to exhibit a severe replication defect, and phenotypic revertants were isolated that open up the stem region by additional mutations (29Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4130-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We measured a total RNA dimerization defect for these mutants (results not shown). This RNA dimerization defect is likely to have contributed to the virus replication defect, but these mutant RNA templates also exhibit reverse transcription defects (29Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4130-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PAS stem segment influences the overall folding of the HIV-1 leader RNA; the LDI-BMH equilibrium is shifted to the BMH conformation, and dimerization is induced to some extent. Interestingly, it has recently been proposed that the opening of the PAS stem occurs during initiation of reverse transcription. The tRNALys3 primer first anneals onto the PBS, but an additional interaction with the PAS element is required for efficient initiation of reverse transcription (9Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Beerens N. Berkhout B. RNA. 2002; 8: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, a scenario can be proposed in which reverse transcription events (the initial tRNA-PBS complex formation and subsequent tRNA-PAS interaction) affect the leader RNA conformation (LDI-to-BMH switch) and possibly some of the leader RNA-associated functions (e.g. dimerization). We set out to study the effect of tRNALys3-annealing on the structure and dimerization function of the HIV-1 leader RNA. To mimic the natural reverse transcription process, one would ideally assemble the vRNA-tRNA complexes with viral proteins such as the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme or the NC protein/Gag-p55 precursor. We tried this approach, but these protein-RNA samples turned out to be too complex to allow a straightforward identification of the different RNA structures (LDI, BMH, and D) by their electrophoretic mobility. The tRNALys3 primer or the anti-PBS DNA probe 202/182 were heat-annealed onto the 1–290 transcript, and the complexes were analyzed on TBE and TBM gels (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 1–7). We included oligonucleotide 151/123 that triggers the LDI-to-BMH switch and RNA dimerization (lane 7) and anti-DIS oligonucleotide 269/246 that also mediates the switch but effectively blocks dimerization (lane 6). We tested three tRNA concentrations (1, 4, and 8 μg) none of which triggered RNA dimerization of the 1/290 transcript by tRNA-annealing (lanes 2–4). A similar result was obtained with the anti-PBS probe, although a low level of RNA dimer is formed (lane 5). The"
https://openalex.org/W2009234076,"Activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is the result of the assembly of a membrane-localized flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559) with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac. Activation can be reproduced in an in vitro system in which cytochrome b559-containing membranes are mixed with cytosolic components in the presence of an anionic amphiphile. We proposed that the essential event in activation is the interaction between p67phox and cytochrome b559 and that Rac and p47phox serve as carriers for p67phox to the membrane. When prenylated, Rac can fulfill the carrier function by itself, supporting oxidase activation by p67phox in the absence of p47phox and amphiphile. We now show that a single chimeric protein, consisting of residues 1–212 of p67phox and full-length Rac1 (residues 1–192), prenylated in vitro and exchanged to GTP, becomes a potent oxidase activator in the absence of any other component or stimulus. Oxidase activation by prenylated chimera p67phox (1–212)-Rac1 (1–192) is accompanied by its spontaneous association with membranes. Prenylated chimeras p67phox (1–212)-Rac1 (178–192) and p67phox (1–212)-Rac1 (189–192), containing specific C-terminal regions of Rac1, are inactive; the activity of the first but not of the second chimera can be rescued by supplementation with exogenous nonprenylated Rac1-GTP. An analysis of prenylated p67phox -Rac1 chimeras suggests that the basic requirements for oxidase activation are: (i) a “two signals” membrane-localizing motif present in Rac, comprising the prenyl group and a C-terminal polybasic sequence and (ii) an intrachimeric or extrachimeric protein-protein interaction between p67phox and Rac1, causing a conformational change in the “activation domain” in p67phox . Activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is the result of the assembly of a membrane-localized flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559) with the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac.

Superoxide (O2⨪) is generated by the NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen by a plasma membrane-localized flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559) composed of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox (reviewed in Refs. 1Nauseef W.M.

Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1999: 769-786Google Scholar). The catalytic core of the enzyme is gp91phox, which contains all redox stations through which electrons flow from NADPH to oxygen (3Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H.

A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Stimuli causing O2⨪ production activate an intracellular signaling process leading to the initiation of electron transport and O2⨪production. The most likely mechanistic model for this is the induction of a conformational change in gp91phox, brought about by interaction of cytochrome b559 with one or more cytosolic components, subsequent to their translocation to the plasma membrane. These components are p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or 2). Upon transfer to the membrane, a multi-component complex is assembled, known as the O2⨪-forming NADPH oxidase complex (referred to as “oxidase”) (reviewed in Ref. 6Lambeth J.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 427-439Google Scholar). Oxidase assembly can be induced in vitro in a cell-free system consisting of phagocyte membranes and the cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac, exposed to an anionic amphiphile serving as activator (7Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Bromberg Y. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identifying the cytosolic component(s) responsible for causing the conformational change in gp91phox is essential for elucidating the molecular basis of this change. The best established fact is the binding of p47phox to p22phox, mediated by the interaction between a Src homology 3 domain in p47phox and a proline-rich region in the C terminus of p22phox, consequent to the opening of intramolecular bonds in p47phox (9Sumimoto H.

This is compatible with a model in which either p67phox or Rac or both components are responsible for the induction of the conformational change in gp91phox. A central role for p67phox is supported by the identification of an “activation domain” in p67phox consisting of residues 199–210 (16Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or residues 187–193 and 199–210 (17Grizot S. Fieschi F. Dagher M.-C. Pebay-Peyroula E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21627-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that was proposed to interact directly with gp91phox and regulate electron flow from NADPH to FAD (18Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for such a role is offered by the recent description of the binding of p67phox to whole cytochrome b559 and to the gp91phox subunit, an interaction enhanced by the presence of Rac (19Dang P.M.-C. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A regulatory effect of Rac on cytochrome b559, based on direct interaction between these two components involving the “insert region” of Rac, was also proposed (20Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and supported by experimental evidence (21Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We recently put forward a model for oxidase assembly in which a central role is attributed to p67phox as the only component that makes direct contact with and induces a conformational change in gp91phox (22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the intact cell, p67phox is carried to the membrane habitat of cytochrome b559 by two carriers, p47phox and Rac. The “carrier for p67phox ” functions of p47phox and Rac are not symmetrical, as shown by the fact that oxidase activation in vitro can be achieved by p67phox + Rac but not by p67phox + p47phox (13Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15519-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the carrier role of Rac, we made use of the fact that in eukaryotic cells small GTPases undergo posttranslational modification, expressed in part in C-terminal prenylation. Thus, the physiological form of Rac in phagocytes is a protein geranylgeranylated (prenylated) at residue Cys189 (23Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9786-9794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prenylated Rac1 was found capable of eliciting oxidase activation in a cell-free system containing phagocyte membranes and p67phox, in the absence of p47phox and of an activating amphiphile (22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), demonstrating that membrane association of Rac was not only required (24Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but also sufficient for the induction of oxidase activation. Recently, this issue was approached by the use of a novel experimental tool, the construction of chimeric proteins consisting of segments of p67phox and Rac1 (25Miyano K. Ogasawara S. Han C.-H. Fukuda H. Tamura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14089-14097Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A chimera consisting of p67phox truncated at residue 212, fused to full-length Rac1 and exchanged to GTPγS, 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)diphosphate 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)diphosphate was found capable of amphiphile-dependent oxidase activation in the absence of p47phox (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This recombinant chimeric protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and, consequently, nonprenylated. Because Rac in mammalian phagocytes is prenylated and prenylated Rac has a superior ability to associate with membranes, we constructed a series of prenylated p67phox -Rac1 chimeras. We now demonstrate that a p67phox (1–212)-Rac1 chimera enzymatically prenylated in vitro and exchanged to GTPγS elicits NADPH dependent O2⨪ production by phagocyte membranes in the absence of an activator and of any other oxidase component. This is the first demonstration of the ability of a single protein to elicit oxidase activation in membranes from resting phagocytes in the absence of any stimulus. guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)diphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanosine 5′-2-O-(thio)diphosphate Membranes were prepared from guinea pig peritoneal macrophages (7Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and solubilized by n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and membrane vesicles were produced by dialysis against buffer without detergent (27Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p47phox and p67phox were prepared in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, and nonprenylated Rac1 was produced in E. coli, by procedures described before (14Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30326-30329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). p67phox truncated at residue 212 was produced in E. coli, as described previously (22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Four chimeric constructs were generated, joining residues 1–212 of p67phox with full-length Rac1 (residues 1–192) or parts of it, as recently reported (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by batch affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose and thrombin cleavage in situ. Nonprenylated chimeras and Rac1 were geranylgeranylated in vitro by recombinant mammalian geranylgeranyltransferase type I. Recombinant human geranylgeranyltransferase type I was produced in Sf9 cells coinfected with baculoviruses encoding the two subunits of the enzyme and purified as described (28Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic prenylation was performed essentially as described in Ref. 29Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar. A typical reaction mixture contained 10 nmol of recombinant p67phox -Rac1 chimera, 20 nmol of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Sigma), and 10 units of geranylgeranyltransferase type I (one unit transfers 1 nmol of geranylgeranyl to protein/h) in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol, and 10 μm GDP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker at 600 rpm, whereupon n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 4.375 mm, and the reaction continued for additional 45 min. The mixture was ice-cooled and subjected to sonic disruption in an ultrasonic processor (Vibra Cell, 400 w; Sonics and Materials). At this stage, an aliquot was removed for assessing the degree of prenylation by Triton X-114 partition. To the rest of the reaction mixture, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), bringing the final concentration of n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside to 3.5 mm. Each preparation of prenylated protein was examined for the success of prenylation by assessing the relative amounts of chimera partitioning in the detergent and aqueous phases upon temperature-dependent phase separation in Triton X-114, as described in Ref. 30Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar. Aliquots from the two phases, brought to equal volumes, were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the degree of prenylation was estimated from the relative intensities of the bands present in the two phases. The correlation of prenylation with partitioning in the detergent phase was proven by the absence of material in the detergent phase when chimeras were mock-prenylated in the absence of geranylgeranyltransferase type I or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Chimeras or Rac1 were subjected to nucleotide exchange to GTPγS or GDPβS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described before (22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prenylated chimeras were tested for the ability to elicit NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production upon addition to phagocyte membrane vesicles, essentially as described for nonprenylated chimeras (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but in the absence of an amphiphilic activator. In all experiments, the membranes were present at an equivalent of 5 nm cytochrome b559heme, and chimeras were added at concentrations that varied from 50 to 800 nm. When p47phox was added, it was present at a concentration of 300 nm. This concentration was chosen for the sake of simplicity, based on preliminary experiments showing that activation with 300 mm p47phox was not different from that using equimolar concentrations of chimera and p47phox (50–800 nm, each). The activity of chimeras was compared with that of a combination of isolated p67phox (1–212) and prenylated Rac1, at concentrations that varied from 50 to 800 nm, each. Aliquots of 2 nmol of prenylated chimera were mixed with membrane vesicles (300 pmol equivalent of cytochrome b559 heme) in a volume of 0.6 ml. The mixtures were kept for 10 min at 4 °C and injected in a Superose 12 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The chimeras were quantified by assessing the functional competence of the p67phox segment shared by all three chimeras. Thus, membrane-bound and free chimeras were measured by assaying lithium dodecyl sulfate- and NADPH-dependent O2⨪ production by 50-μl aliquots of column fractions upon supplementation with p47phox and Rac1-GTPγS (both at 300 nm), in the absence (membrane-bound chimera) or presence (free chimera) of membrane vesicles (equivalent of 5 nm cytochrome b559 heme). The membrane vesicles were quantified by measuring the amount of cytochrome b559, as described in Ref. 22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. Four nonprenylated p67phox -Rac1 chimeras were generated in E. coli, as recently described (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and were subsequently prenylated enzymatically in vitro. The structure and nomenclature of the prenylated chimeras are identical to those of the nonprenylated counterparts and are illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Prenylation was confirmed by the partition of over 90% of the product in the detergent layer upon phase separation in Triton X-114 at 37 °C (Fig. 1 B). The prenylated chimeras had the expected Mr, with only minor proteolytic degradation. We and others have recently reported that a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal residues 1–212 of p67phox and full-length Rac1 (our chimera 3) is capable of oxidase activation in the presence of an anionic amphiphile, even in the absence of p47phox (25Miyano K. Ogasawara S. Han C.-H. Fukuda H. Tamura M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14089-14097Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These chimeras were expressed in E. coli and were therefore nonprenylated. We now demonstrate that the addition of a geranylgeranyl group to the C terminus of chimera 3 results in the formation of a molecule that, when added to phagocyte membranes, elicits dose-dependent NADPH-dependent O2⨪ generation in the absence of any activator (Fig. 2 A). We examined the activating ability of prenylated chimera 3 exchanged to the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog GTPγS or left in the native state. As seen in Fig. 2 A, chimera 3-GTPγS had a clearly superior activating ability, and the dose-response curve was hyperbolic. The presence of p47phox added little to the activating capacity of the chimera; Vmax was 111.6 ± 5.6 mol O2⨪/s/mol cytochrome b559 heme in the presence of p47phox and 101.9 ± 5.9, in its absence (means ± S.E. of three experiments, for each group). The corresponding EC50 values were 145.7 ± 23.9 and 111.7 ± 24.0 nm chimera 3, respectively. The oxidase-activating ability of prenylated chimera 3 in the absence of amphiphile was superior to that of its nonprenylated equivalent assayed in the presence of the amphiphile lithium dodecyl sulfate (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It also differed from nonprenylated chimera 3 by its almost complete independence from p47phox. Nonprenylated chimera 3 exchanged to GTPγS was incapable of activation in the absence of amphiphile, both in the presence and in the absence of p47phox (Fig. 2 A). Amphiphile-independent oxidase activation by prenylated chimera 3-GTPγS was superior to that elicited by equimolar amounts of the individual fusion partners, namely p67phox (1–212) and in vitro prenylated Rac1-GTPγS, whether p47phox was present or not (Fig. 2 A). The finding that prenylated chimera 3 contains all of the elements required for the induction of electron flow through the redox stations of the oxidase, in the absence of help from another component or activator, is compatible with the proposal that only p67phox interacts with gp91phox and that Rac1 functions exclusively as a membrane-targeting molecule (22Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To test this proposal, we constructed two additional prenylated p67phox -Rac1 chimeras. Both contained residues 1–212 of p67phox, which was fused either to residues 178–192 of Rac1, containing both the prenylation signal (residues 189–192) and the polybasic domain (residues 183–188) (chimera 2), or to residues 189–192 of Rac1, lacking the polybasic domain (chimera 1). Because prenylated chimeras 1 and 2 lack the ability to bind nucleotides, they were assayed in native form, in the absence of amphiphile and in the presence and absence of p47phox. As apparent in Fig. 2 (B and C), the chimeras were unable to activate the oxidase under conditions in which chimera 3 was markedly active. These results can be interpreted as indicating that the role of Rac is more than just a carrier for p67phox and that a region upstream of residue 178, missing in chimeras 1 and 2, is required for oxidase activation. The insert region of Rac1 was proposed to play such a role by direct interaction with cytochrome b559 (20Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined the oxidase-activating ability of a mutant of chimera 3 (chimera 8), in which the insert region of Rac1 (residues 123–133) was deleted. The nonprenylated form of chimera 8 was found to be equal in activity to chimera 3, when tested in the presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 D, prenylated chimera 8 was capable of oxidase activation in the absence of lithium dodecyl sulfate, although it was less potent than chimera 3, both in the presence and absence of p47phox. Therefore, removal of the insert region of Rac1 has only a moderate negative effect on the activating capacity of chimera 3, making a direct interaction between the Rac segment of chimera 3 and cytochrome b559unlikely. Another possible reason for the lack of activity of chimeras 1 and 2 is that they are unable to form intramolecular bonds between the p67phox and Rac1 segments of the chimeras. We proposed (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the existence of such bonds in the GTP-bound (but not in the GDP-bound) form of chimera 3, and recently direct evidence for this, based on mutating residues involved in p67phox -Rac1 interaction (31Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), emerged. 2R. Sarfstein, Y. Gorzalczany, and E. Pick, manuscript in preparation. Intramolecular bonds were also reported to exist in Ras-Raf1 chimeras, when the Ras segment was in GTP-bound form (32Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kutokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we supplemented prenylated chimeras 1 and 2 with equimolar concentrations of nonprenylated Rac1, exchanged to GTPγS or GDPβS, and examined their ability to activate the oxidase in the absence of amphiphile and p47phox. As apparent in Fig. 2 B, the addition of Rac1-GTPγS to the inactive prenylated chimera 2 resulted in substantial oxidase activation; under the same conditions Rac1-GDPβS was not enhancing. However, supplementing prenylated chimera 1 with Rac1-GTPγS did not result in enhancement (Fig. 2 C). We propose that Rac1-GTPγS, but not Rac1-GDPβS, interacts with the p67phox (1–212) segment of chimeras 1 or 2, forming tripartite complexes (Fig. 3, B and C). Extrachimeric interaction of chimeras 1 and 2 with Rac1-GTPγS mimics the intrachimeric bonds between the Rac1 and p67phox segments in prenylated chimera 3 (Fig. 3 A). The binding of exogenous Rac1-GTPγS induces a conformational change in the activation domain of the p67phox segment, which is essential for a productive interaction with cytochrome b559. The Rac-induced conformational change in p67phox is, so far, hypothetical; no difference in the conformation of free (17Grizot S. Fieschi F. Dagher M.-C. Pebay-Peyroula E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21627-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Rac-associated (31Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) p67phox was detected in structural studies, but the latter employed p67phox truncated at residue 203 and therefore lacked most of the activation domain, including the crucial residue 204 (16Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A further condition for oxidase activation is the association of the chimeras with the membrane. The success of chimera 2, as opposed to the failure of chimera 1, to activate in the presence of exogenous Rac1 is best explained by the requirement for two signals for recruitment to the membrane: prenylation and a C-terminal polybasic domain. A “two signals” requirement for membrane localization of prenylated Rac was proposed (24Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and demonstrated recently by the use of a Rac1 mutant lacking residues 183–188 (33Di-Poi N. Faure J. Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M.-C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The particular roles of Rac and p67phox in oxidase activation, as revealed by this and an earlier study (26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), bear a striking resemblance to those of Ras and Raf1. Thus, it was recently shown that, in addition to its role as a carrier of Raf1 to the membrane, Ras has to interact physically with Raf1 to activate it (34Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ability of prenylated chimera 3 to elicit oxidase activation upon addition to phagocyte membranes in the absence of p47phox and amphiphile is most readily explained by its spontaneous association with the membrane and the formation of a complex with cytochrome b559. We tested this hypothesis directly by quantifying the binding of prenylated chimera 3-GTPγS and of native chimeras 2 and 1 to phagocyte membrane vesicles by gel filtration on Superose 12. This was based on the finding that membrane vesicles elute in the exclusion volume of the column (7.5 ml), whereas free chimeras elute at 12.9–14.1 ml. 3Free prenylated chimeras eluted on Superose 12 later than expected on the basis of Mr alone, probably because of hydrophobic interaction with the column material. This also resulted in low recoveries and poor interexperimental reproducibility. As seen in Fig. 4 A, chimeras 3 and 2 bound to membrane vesicles with similar affinity, as shown by their detection in close correlation with the cytochrome b559 marker; a small amount of chimera 1 was also found associated with the membrane. The mere addition of NADPH to fractions containing membrane-associated chimera 3 led to O2⨪production (Fig. 4 B); only minimal O2⨪ production by fractions containing membrane-bound chimera 2 and no O2⨪production by fractions containing the small amount of membrane-bound chimera 1 were detected. These findings are in agreement with the direct assessment of the oxidase-activating ability of the chimeras (Fig. 2), with one exception: membrane-bound chimera 2 did exhibit a low level of activity in the gel filtration assay that was not detectable in the regular cell-free assay. The results provide further support for our proposal that oxidase activation by prenylated p67phox -Rac1 chimeras depends on the fulfillment of two conditions: high affinity membrane association resting on two signals and the presence of intrachimeric bonds between the p67phox and Rac segments of the chimera (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a single recombinant protein capable of NADPH oxidase activation in vitro, in the absence of any other oxidase component and stimulus. These results support a model of oxidase activation in which p67phox acts as the only cytosolic component responsible for inducing a conformational change in the gp91phox subunit of cytochrome b559. Prenylated Rac1 translocates to the membrane and serves either as a carrier or as a membrane anchor for p67phox. In addition, the interaction of Rac1 with p67phox results in a conformational change in the activation domain of p67phox, which is essential for productive interaction with cytochrome b559. This model is not to be interpreted as a negation of the role of p47phox in oxidase activation in vivo. p47phox is a key participant in the stimulus-elicited oxidase activation in the intact phagocyte, as shown by the impairment of O2⨪ production in chronic granulomatous disease patients lacking p47phox. p47phox probably functions both as a carrier for p67phox and as a component interacting directly with gp91phox (35DeLeo F., Yu, L. Burritt J.B. Loetterle L.R. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. Quinn M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is likely that in the in vivo reality Rac and p67phox cooperate in bringing about the optimal juxtaposition of the p67phox activation domain with the corresponding motif on gp91phox. We thank T.

We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method and two-electrode voltage clamping to identify residues within the binding pocket that are important for mediating these different actions. Each residue from α1T60 to α1K70 was mutated to cysteine and expressed with wild-type β2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Methanethiosulfonate reagents reacted with α1T60C, α1D62C, α1F64C, α1R66C, α1S68C, and α1K70C. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) slowed methanethiosulfonate modification of α1F64C, α1R66C, and α1S68C, whereas SR-95531 slowed modification of α1D62C, α1F64C, and α1R66C, demonstrating that different residues are important for mediating GABA and SR-95531 actions. In addition, methanethiosulfonate reaction rates were fastest for α1F64C and α1R66C, indicating that these residues are located in an open, aqueous environment lining the core of the binding pocket. Positively charged methanethiosulfonate reagents derivatized α1F64C and α1R66C significantly faster than a negatively charged reagent, suggesting that a negative subsite important for interacting with the ammonium group of GABA exists within the binding pocket. Pentobarbital activation of the receptor increased the rate of methanethiosulfonate modification of α1D62C and α1S68C, demonstrating that parts of the binding site undergo structural rearrangements during channel gating.

For example, agonist binding induces conformational changes that result in channel opening, whereas binding of competitive antagonists does not. Distinguishing the specific amino acid residues involved in the binding of agonists and antagonists will help to elucidate the structural rearrangements that govern the pharmacological effects of these compounds. In this paper, we examined the molecular determinants important for the binding of the agonist GABA and the competitive antagonist SR-95531 to the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), receptor and explored the conformational changes that occur within the GABA-binding site during channel activation by a barbiturate. ligand-gated ion channel γ-aminobutyric acid, GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A substituted cysteine accessibility method methanethiosulfonate 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate 2-mercaptoethanol acetylcholine-binding protein GABAA receptors are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are members of an evolutionarily related superfamily of LGICs that also includes nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine, and serotonin-type 3 receptors (1Ortells M.O.

The neurotransmitter recognition site, where agonists such as GABA and muscimol and antagonists such as SR-95531 and bicuculline bind, is located at the interface between the α and β subunits because residues have been identified on both subunits that are important for ligand recognition. On the α1 subunit, residues identified include Phe64 (12Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sigel E. Baur R. Kellenberger S.

Based on work on the related nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, residues that contribute to forming the binding site are located in at least six different non-contiguous extracellular N-terminal regions of the α and β subunits. These regions have been designated loops A–F (19Corringer P.J., Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Residues within these loops likely have different functional roles. Some residues may directly contact ligand, some may be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the binding site, and others may mediate local conformational movements within the site. In the present study, we examined the binding site region surrounding α1F64 (loop D) of the GABAA receptor. In the homologous region of the serotonin-type 3 receptor, White and colleagues (20Yan D. Schulte M.K. Bloom K.E. White M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5537-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) used alanine-scanning mutagenesis and determined that different amino acid residues contribute to the binding of agonists and antagonists. We hypothesized that the region surrounding α1F64 of the GABA-binding site also contains unique residues important for agonist and antagonist binding, and we tested this hypothesis by using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). SCAM has been used on a variety of ion channels to elucidate channel lining and binding site residues, to determine the location of channel gates and selectivity filters, and to identify regions of the protein that are involved in conformational rearrangements during state changes (21Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In this method, individual amino acid residues are mutated to cysteine, and the ability of sulfhydryl-specific reagents to modify covalently each introduced cysteine is assessed by observing the effect of the reagent on receptor function. We measured the rates of sulfhydryl modification of accessible introduced cysteine residues in the presence and absence of GABA and SR-95531. We identified a subsite important for agonist binding that includes α1F64, α1R66, and α1S68 and an antagonist-binding subsite that includes α1D62, α1F64, and α1R66. In addition, we used sulfhydryl-specific reagents of different charge and determined that a negative subsite exists within the binding pocket. Finally, we measured rates of sulfhydryl modification in the presence of pentobarbital (a GABAAreceptor modulator that opens the channel), and we identified conformational changes that occur within the GABA-binding site during channel activation. The α1 cysteine mutants were engineered using the Altered Sites II® in vitro Mutagenesis Systems (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or by recombinant PCR as described previously (14Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kucken A.M. Wagner D.A. Ward P.R. Boileau J.A. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 932-939PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine substitutions were made in the rat α1 subunit at positions Tyr59, Thr60, Ile61, Asp62, Val63, Phe64, Phe65, Arg66, Gln67, Ser68, Trp69, and Lys70, where the number reflects the position in the mature α1 subunit protein. The cysteine mutants were subcloned into pGH19 (23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 24Robertson G.A. Warmke J.M. Ganetzky B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The presence of the mutations was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and double-strand cDNA sequencing. The mutants have been named, using the single letter amino acid code, as wild-type residue, residue number, and mutated residue. X. laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously (25Boileau A.J. Kucken A.M. Evers A.R. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). cRNA transcripts were generated using the mMessage T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). GABAA receptor rat α1 or α1mutants were expressed with wild-type rat β2 subunits by injection of cRNA into oocytes (0.3 ng of cRNA/subunit/oocyte, except for α1F64Cβ2 and α1R66Cβ2 that were injected at 7 ng of cRNA/subunit to ensure high levels of receptor expression). Mean maximal responses to GABA ranged from 1 to 10 μA. The oocytes were stored in ND96 medium (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2–14 days and used for electrophysiological recordings. Oocytes under two-electrode voltage clamp (Vhold of −80 mV) were continuously perfused with ND96 at a rate of 5 ml/min. The bath volume was 200 μl. GABA, SR-95531 (Sigma), pentobarbital (Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA), and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) were dissolved in ND96. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp recording was carried out using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced to a computer with a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–2.0 megaohms in ND96. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 6 (Axon Instruments). The sulfhydryl-specific reagents used were derivatives of MTS obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The reagents used were 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), and 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). All oocytes were stabilized before addition of MTS reagent by application of GABA (5 s) at 10-min intervals until the GABA-activated peak currents (IGABA) varied by <10%. GABA concentrations used were EC40–EC60 for each mutant. After the GABA response stabilized, freshly diluted MTS reagent was applied for 2 min; the cell was washed for 5 min, and then GABA was applied at the same concentration used before the MTS treatment. MTSEA (2 mm), MTSET (2 mm), or MTSES (5 mm) were used. The effect of the MTS reagent was calculated as (IGABA-post/IGABA-pre) − 1, where IGABA-post is the current elicited by GABA after MTS application, and IGABA-pre is the current elicited by GABA before MTS application. The rate of MTS reagent covalent modification of introduced cysteines was determined by measuring the outcome of sequential applications of MTS reagents on IGABA. The protocol was as follows: EC20–EC60 GABA was applied for 5 s; the cell was washed for 30 s; MTS reagent was applied for 5–20 s; the cell was washed for 2.5 min; and the procedure was repeated until IGABA no longer changed indicating that the reaction was complete. Before the rate of MTS modification was measured, GABA was applied every 3 min until IGABA stabilized to within 3% demonstrating that the observed changes in IGABA after application of MTS reagent were due to the effects of the MTS reagent. Concentration of MTS reagent and time of application varied as follows: α1D62C: MTSEA, 1 mm, 20 s; α1F64C: MTSES, 10 μm, 5 s; MTSET, 10 nm, 5 s; MTSEA, 100 nm, 5 s; α1R66C: MTSES, 500 μm, 20 s; MTSET, 1 μm, 5 s; MTSEA, 10 μm, 10 s; α1S68C: MTSES: 150 μm, 10 s; MTSET: 100 μm, 5 s; MTSEA: 100 μm, 5 s. The effects of agonists and antagonists on the rate of MTS modification were tested by co-applying GABA (EC85–EC95), SR-95531 (IC90–IC95), or pentobarbital (500 μm) with MTSES for all mutants except α1D62C, in which case they were co-applied with MTSEA. For these studies, IGABA was stabilized before the rate of MTS reaction was measured as follows: apply GABA (EC20–60) for 5 s, wash for 30 s, apply GABA, SR-95531, or pentobarbital at high concentration for 5–20 s, wash for 2.5 min, and repeat the procedure. This procedure was repeated until the peak of the GABA (EC20–60) current was within 3% of the previous GABA (EC20–60) current peak. For all rate experiments, the decrease in current was plotted versus cumulative time of MTS exposure. We assume that the concentration of MTS reagent does not change significantly during the reaction, and thus, we can determine a pseudo first–order rate constant from the rate of decrease in IGABA. Peak current at each time point was normalized to the initial peak current, and a pseudo first-order rate constant (k1) was determined by fitting the data with a single exponential decay equation: y = span·e−kt + plateau. Because the data are normalized to IGABA at time 0, span = 1 − plateau. The second-order rate constant (k2) for MTS reaction was determined by dividing the calculated pseudo first-order rate constant by the concentration of MTS reagent used (26Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To verify the accuracy of this protocol, second-order rate constants were determined using at least two different concentrations of MTS reagents for several mutants. Concentration-response experiments were performed as described previously (14Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, these trials used a low concentration of GABA (EC2–EC7) immediately before the test concentration of agonist to correct for any slow drift in GABA responses that may occur during the experiment. Currents elicited by each test concentration were normalized to the corresponding low concentration current before curve fitting. Concentration-response data were fit to the following equation: I =Imax/(1 + (EC50/[A])n), where I is the peak response to a given concentration of GABA;Imax is the maximum amplitude of current; EC50 is the concentration of GABA that produces a half-maximal response; [A] is the concentration of GABA; and n is the Hill coefficient. IC50 values were measured as described previously (18Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SR-95531 IC50 values were measured by applying a fixed concentration of GABA (EC20–EC60) immediately followed by co-application of the same concentration of GABA and a test concentration of SR-95531. Inhibition was calculated as IGABA + SR-95531/IGABA. Data were fit to the following equation: inhibition = 1 − 1/(1 + (IC50/[Ant])n), where IC50 is the concentration of antagonist that blocks half of IGABA; [Ant] is the concentration of antagonist, and n is the Hill coefficient.KI values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff/Chou equation (27Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12288) Google Scholar, 28Chou T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 235-247PubMed Google Scholar): KI = IC50/(1 + [A]/EC50), where [A] is the concentration of GABA used, and EC50 is the concentration of GABA that elicits a half-maximal response. Data analysis was carried out using nonlinear regression analysis included in the GraphPad Prism software package (San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com). Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by a post hoc Dunnett's test. All compounds were measured after energy minimization (<0.5 kcal/Å; Chemsketch, ADC, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). All MTS regents were measured from the sulfur to the center of the base of the tetrahedron formed by the terminal tertiary group. GABA was measured from the nitrogen to the base of the tetrahedron formed by the carboxyl group. SR-95531 was measured from the carbon of the methyl group to the center of the base of tetrahedron formed by the carboxyl group. The mature protein sequences of the rat α1 and β2 subunits were homology modeled with a subunit of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (29Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the AChBP was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (code 1I9B) and loaded into Swiss Protein Data bank Viewer (SPDBV, ca.expasy.org/spdbv). The α1 protein sequence from Thr12–Ile227 and the β2protein sequence from Ser10–Leu218 were aligned with the AChBP sequence using the alignment function of SPDBV. The aligned sequences of the α1 and β2subunits were threaded onto an AChBP subunit using the “Interactive Magic Fit” function of SPDBV. The threaded subunits were imported into SYBYL (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) where energy minimization was carried out with the first 100 iterations carried out using Simplex minimization followed by 10,000 iterations using the Powell method. We reported previously that when mutated to cysteine, alternating residues from α1T60 to α1S68 are accessible to covalent modification by MTSEA-biotin, suggesting that this region of the GABA-binding site forms a β-strand (14Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also determined that the presence of GABA inhibits the reaction of MTS compounds at α1F64C, α1R66C, and α1S68C, indicating that these residues may face into the agonist-binding pocket. In the present study, we used MTS reagents of different size and charge to explore the physicochemical environment of this region of the GABA-binding site. The MTS reagents used were MTSEA (3.7 Å long), which covalently adds a positively charged ethyl-ammonium group, MTSET (4.5 Å), which adds a positively charged ethyl-trimethylammonium group, and MTSES (4.8 Å), which adds a negatively charged ethyl-sulfonate group (Fig. 1). In order to determine the ability of the MTS reagents to react with each introduced cysteine, mutant α1 and wild-type β2 subunits were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and IGABA (EC40–60) was measured before and after a 2-min MTS application. Because the MTS reagents did not affect the amplitude of IGABAat wild-type α1β2 receptors, we assumed that current changes observed in mutant receptors were due to covalent modification of the introduced cysteine residues (Fig. 1). In general, the residues that were reported previously (14Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be modified by MTSEA-biotin (α1T60C, α1D62C, α1F64C, α1R66C, and α1S68C) were also accessible to modification by MTSEA, MTSET, and MTSES (Fig. 1). Reaction with MTS reagents reduced GABA current by 14 (α1K70C, MTSET) to 96% (α1F64C, MTSEA). In contrast to all other mutants, covalent modification of α1T60C caused an increase in IGABAsuggesting that the GABA EC50 value for this mutant receptor decreases following covalent modification. At any given position, the magnitude of the MTS effect on IGABA was dependent on the specific MTS reagent used (Fig. 1). The observed differences in MTS effects may be due to the charge and/or size of the functional group tethered within the binding site. However, it is also possible that the MTS reactions did not go to completion due to their varied intrinsic reactivities (21Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we measured the rate at which each MTS reagent modified α1D62C, α1F64C, α1R66C, and α1S68C, making sure that each reaction was followed to completion. The rates of covalent modification of an introduced cysteine were obtained by measuring the effect of successive subsaturating applications of each MTS reagent on IGABA (Fig. 2A). The decrease in IGABA was plotted versus cumulative duration of MTS exposure and fit with a one-phase exponential decay curve, which yields a pseudo first-order rate constant (k1). To correct for the concentration dependence of the rate, a second-order rate constant (k2, Table I) was calculated by dividing k1 by the concentration of MTS used (“Experimental Procedures”). In general, the maximal effects of the MTS reagents observed in the rate experiments were consistent with those measured in the 2-min pulse protocol (mutant: MTSEA maximal inhibition/MTSEA 2-min inhibition; α1D62C: 64/54%; α1F64C: 92/96%; α1R66C: 32/33%; α1S68C: 34/32%). Because the reactions went to completion, these data indicate that tethering groups of different size and charge to the mutant receptors differentially affects IGABA.Table IRates of reaction of MTSES, MTSET, and MTSEA at α1D62Cβ2, α1F64Cβ2, α1R66Cβ2, and α1S68Cβ2receptorsReceptorMTSESMTSETMTSEAk2nk2nk2nm−1s−1m−1s−1m−1 s−1α1D62Cβ2NR1-aNR is no reaction.1NR116 ± 14α1F64Cβ223400 ± 600045,500,000 ± 2,800,00042,475,000 ± 235,0004α1R66Cβ250 ± 115116,000 ± 13,000413,000 ± 17004α1S68Cβ2270 ± 8072800 ± 140062000 ± 3003free sol.17,000212,00076,000Rates of covalent modification of cysteine-containing receptors were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”k2 values represent mean second-order rate constants ± S.D. of at least three experiments.

The rate of reaction of MTS modification of a binding site engineered cysteine depends on several factors as follows: 1) the movement of the MTS reagent from bulk solution to the substituted cysteine in the binding pocket (permeability of the pathway); 2) the intrinsic electrostatic potential within the pocket and along the pathway; 3) the ionization (acid dissociation) of the substituted cysteine's sulfhydryl group; and 4) steric restrictions in forming an activated complex between the thiolate of the substituted cysteine and the MTS reagent. MTS reagents react preferentially with the ionized thiolate (RS−) form of cysteine (30Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A.

For example, MTSET modified α1F64C with a k2 of ∼5,500,000 m−1 s−1, which was about 340-fold faster than reaction at α1R66C. Reaction at α1R66C, in turn, was about 40-fold faster than modification at α1S68C (Table I). At α1D62C, MTSEA was the only reagent tested that significantly altered IGABA. There are two possible explanations for this result. Either MTSET and MTSES do not react with α1D62C or covalent modification by these reagents does not change IGABA, implying that any apparent modification is functionally silent. To test these possibilities, we measured the ability of MTSEA to modify covalently α1D62C after application of MTSET or MTSES. If MTSET or MTSES modified α1D62C, then reaction with MTSEA should not occur, and no change in IGABA should be observed. Application of MTSES or MTSET prior to MTSEA had no effect on the ability of MTSEA to inhibit IGABA (data not shown), indicating MTSET and MTSES do not react with α1D62C. It should be noted that the reaction rate of MTSEA with α1D62C was very slow (k2 = 16 m−1s−1) indicating that α1D62C has limited accessibility. In free solution, the rates of MTSEA, MTSET, and MTSES with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) are 76,000, 212,000, and 17,000m−1 s−1, respectively (21Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) (Table I). The rate constants depend on the charges of the reactants. Because the net charge of 2-ME is −1, positively charged MTS reagents react faster than negatively charged MTS reagents with this compound (31Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the reaction rate constants of MTSET and MTSEA with α1F64C were ∼30-fold faster than the their rates of reaction with 2-ME in free solution (Table I). The rate of reaction of the MTS reagents with α1F64C is influenced by the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the GABA-binding site, which arises from fixed charges and dipoles in the protein. The faster rates of MTSET and MTSEA modification of α1F64C compared with the rates of modification of a simple thiol in solution are likely due to these intrinsic properties of the protein and suggest that the short range interactions of MTSET and MTSEA with the GABA-binding site are stronger than those with a simple thiol. Similar fast rates were measured for MTSET and MTSEA reaction with the acetylcholine-binding site cysteines, αC192/193, in reduced, wild-type Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, k2 ∼3 × 106m−1 s−1(31Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The intrinsic electrostatic potential at a substituted cysteine can be examined by determining the rate of reactions of MTS reagents that differ in charge (26Pas"

A new member of the CLCA gene family was identified, mCLCA4, that is expressed preferentially in organs containing a high percentage of smooth muscle cells, including intestine, stomach, uterus, bladder, and aorta. Reverse transcription-PCR using template RNA prepared from mouse bladder and stomach smooth muscle layers dissected free of mucosa yielded mCLCA4-specific bands. In situ hybridization with an mCLCA4-specific probe confirmed prominent expression in smooth muscle of major vessels of the heart but not cardiac muscle. High expression was also detected in the gastrointestinal tract, in bronchioles, and in aortic and lung endothelial cells. Transient expression of mCLCA4 in 293T cells resulted in the appearance of a prominent calcium-activated chloride current. Whole-cell currents activated by ionomycin or methacholine were anion-selective and showed minimal rectification or voltage-dependent gating. Similar to endogenous currents in smooth muscle cells, methacholine-induced currents were transient, and spontaneous transient inward currents were occasionally observed at resting membrane potentials.

Here we report the cloning and expression of a new member of the CLCA gene family in mouse. Unlike other CLCA genes, mCLCA4 is highly expressed in smooth muscle. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells with mCLCA4 results in the expression of calcium-activated currents with anion selectivity and kinetics similar to those observed in smooth muscle. These results suggest that mCLCA4 is the gene that encodes calcium-activated chloride channels in smooth muscle and broadens the physiological and pathological relevance of the CLCA gene family. RNA was prepared from mouse large intestine, kidney, and lung by grinding frozen organs with a mortar and pestle and extracting with Trizol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed (Superscript, Invitrogen) using random hexamers. cDNA was subjected to PCR (93 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s; 35 cycles) with degenerate primers based on Lu-ECAM-1 amino acids 36–45 (5′-ATTGCAATTAACCCCAGTGTGCCAGANGA-3′) and 165–174 (5′-GCRTAYTCRTCRAANAYNCCCCA-3′). PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing to rule out Taq PCR error. Distinct sequences were obtained from intestine versus kidney and lung (which were identical to mCLCA1) and were consistent across multiple RNA and cDNA preparations. The full open reading frame of mCLCA4 was obtained in two steps. Using oligo-dT-primed intestinal cDNA as a template and primers derived from the mCLCA1 sequence, a product was obtained comprising the start codon to base pair 2550. 3′ RACE was then employed to obtain the interval from base pair 2359 to the 3′ poly(A) tract. Primers derived from these sequences were used to amplify a 2.7-kb product containing the entire open reading frame. PCR error was minimized by using high fidelity Herculase DNA polymerase (Stratagene), by sequencing products directly before cloning, and by sequencing multiple pGEM-T clones. The final product was transferred as a SalI/SstII fragment to pIRES2 (XhoI/SstII) for expression in HEK293T cells. One 3′ RACE product was obtained that contained an insertion at base pair 2663 (5′-TGGTCTGAGTACCCCCAGCACCCCTCCTGGTCTGAGTACCCCCAGCACCCCTCCTGGTC-3′), resulting in a triple repeat of the amino acid sequence LSTPSTPPG beginning at position 880. The full-length clones all lacked the insertion. Primer pairs specific for mCLCA4 were designed based on alignment of the four known mouse CLCA genes and corresponding to the interval base pairs 1123–1443, 5′-catcaatgacagctcctacctagc-3′ and 5′-atcaatcaggccattcacgtcttcc-3′. Primers were also designed to bracket at least one intron to rule out amplification of genomic DNA. Initially, a mouse multi-tissue cDNA array (RapidScan, Origene) was probed. To confirm and extend these results, the organs identified in the array and several others were isolated from a C57BL/6 mouse, and RNA was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR as before. Smooth muscle tissue was isolated from mouse bladder and stomach by dissecting away mucosal and serosal tissue layers under microscopic observation. 18 S ribosomal RNA was amplified as an internal control for RNA amount and reverse transcription using a primer:competitive oligomer ratio of 3:7 as described by Ambion. PCR was varied from 15 to 35 cycles to determine the range of linear amplification with added template. The profile at 25 cycles is shown. Total RNA from mouse aortic endothelial cells was a gift from Bernd Nilius (Leuven, Belgium). Lung microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from lung tumors as described (34Dong Q.G. Bernasconi S. Lostaglio S., De Calmanovici R.W. Martin-Padura I. Breviario F. Garlanda C. Ramponi A. Mantovani A. Vecchi A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In some tissues a smaller product, identified by an x in Fig. 4, was sometimes obtained in addition to the expected band. This product was excised, inserted into pGEM-T (Promega), and determined by sequence analysis of three clones to be an artifact unrelated to mCLCA4. In addition, a Southern blot of the gel hybridized with mCLCA4 cDNA detected only the upper band. A subclone containing base pairs 2670 of the mCLCA4 open reading frame through the 3′-untranslated region was used for in situ hybridization analysis; this probe avoided regions with high similarity to mCLCA1 and mCLCA2. In situ hybridization studies were performed using a modification of procedures described by Wilkinson and Green (35Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 155-171Google Scholar). Mouse tissues were fixed overnight in freshly prepared ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The embryos were dehydrated through ethanol into xylene and embedded in paraffin using a Tissue-Tek V.I.P. automatic processor (Miles, Mishawaka, IN). Sections (5 μm) were adhered to commercially modified glass slides (Super Frost Plus, VWR, Rochester, NY), dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through graded ethanols, and treated with proteinase K to enhance probe accessibility and with acetic anhydride to reduce nonspecific background. Single-stranded RNA probes were prepared by standard techniques with specific activities of 5 × 109dpm/mg. Sections were hybridized at Tm − 15 °C, washed at high stringency (Tm − 7 °C) and treated with RNase A to further diminish nonspecific adherence of probe. Autoradiography with NBT-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) was performed for 25 days. Slides were developed with D19 (Kodak), and the tissue was counterstained with hematoxylin. The expression of ICl(Ca)in mCLCA4-transfected and control HEK293T cells was examined by whole-cell, patch clamp recording using classical and perforated patch clamp methods as described previously (36Fleischmann B.K.

Kotlikoff M.I. Albelda S.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1257-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein-expressing pIRES2-mCLCA4 or vector alone (LipofectAMINE Plus, Invitrogen), trypsinized 24 h later, and seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. After 18 h, cells were transferred to a temperature-controlled chamber maintained at 36 °C (Brook Industries) and superfused at 1 ml/min with extracellular solution (126 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mm glucose; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Anion shift experiments utilized the above extracellular solution in which 100 mm NaCl was replaced by an equimolar amount of sodium glutamate, shifting the theoretical chloride equilibrium potential to 24 mV (assuming zero glutamate permeability). Recording pipettes (resistance, 3–5 megaohms) were filled with 130 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgATP, and 0.075 mm EGTA; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. For perforated patch experiments, pipettes were dipped in pipette solution for 1–2 s then back-filled with pipette solution containing 200 mg/ml nystatin. After seal formation and establishment of the whole cell recording configuration, cells were voltage-clamped at −60 mV (Axopatch 200 B, Axon Instruments). Records were filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. Current reversal potentials were measured either by step or ramp (−60 to 40 mV applied every 30 s) protocols. Cells were exposed to calcium-mobilizing agents (ionomycin or methacholine) by means of a puffer pipette connected to a controlled solenoid (Picospritzer, General Valve Corp.). A microscope equipped with an ultraviolet source was used to select green fluorescent protein-positive cells for recording. To identify the CLCA isoform present in mouse smooth muscle, RT-PCR was performed with degenerate primers on template RNA extracted from an organ rich in smooth muscle, the large intestine. Degenerate primers for RT-PCR were designed based on published CLCA sequences to amplify any CLCA cDNA including mCLCA1, mCLCA2, and mCLCA3. Thus, RNA extracted from established sites of mCLCA1 expression, lung and kidney, could serve as positive controls for amplification of CLCA mRNA. RT-PCR of intestinal RNA produced a much stronger band than either lung or kidney (Fig. 1). Direct sequencing of the amplification products revealed only the mCLCA1 sequence in lung and kidney but a new and distinct sequence in intestine, which we have designated mCLCA4. The electropherogram showed no sign of mCLCA3, previously reported in intestinal goblet cells, indicating that mCLCA4 is the predominant CLCA family member in large intestine (data not shown). The full 2.7-kb, 909-amino acid open reading frame of mCLCA4 was obtained using primers derived from the mCLCA1 sequence and 3′ RACE (Fig. 2). Comparison of the mCLCA4 amino acid and DNA sequences with those of the other mouse CLCA family members revealed an abrupt divergence at amino acid 873 resulting from a frameshift mutation (Fig. 2; GenBankTM accession number AY00827). mCLCA4 retains 79% identity with mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 but only 45% with mCLCA3. All of the general features found in other CLCA family members, such as the symmetrical cysteine cluster, processing sites, and glycosylation sites are conserved in mCLCA4 (Fig. 2). Construction of a phylogenetic tree of known CLCA proteins places mCLCA4 on Branch A, whose members all bear the sequence RARSPT (corresponding to amino acids 592–597 of mCLCA4), containing two adjacent sites for phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin kinase II and protein kinase C as well as a site for protein kinase A (Fig. 3). Members on branches B and C lack this sequence (note that the genetic nomenclature is based on order of discovery; thus, mCLCA4 is not the ortholog of hCLCA4).Figure 2Comparison of mCLCA4 amino acid sequence with those of other mouse CLCA family members. Glycosylation sites are indicated by stars; the cysteine cluster is indicated by underlines, the phosphorylation hotspot is indicated by a double underline with closed circles indicating the phosphorylated residues, and the processing site by an arrowhead.

Expression was detected in the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and heart (data not shown). To confirm and extend these results, these and other organs were dissected and analyzed from a C57BL/6 mouse. Expression was highest in large and small intestine and was also significant in stomach and esophagus but just detectable in salivary gland (Fig. 4 A; lower band x is an artifact). Outside the gastrointestinal tract, strong expression was detected in uterus and lung, and lower expression was detected in aorta, heart, and skeletal muscle, whereas none was detectable in kidney or pancreas (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether mCLCA4 expression in mixed organs was associated with expression in smooth muscle, two mouse organs were chosen in which the smooth muscle layer could be dissected free of overlying tissue layers. The tunica muscularis was dissected from the mouse bladder and stomach for RNA preparation and RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, isolated smooth muscle from both tissues was strongly positive for mCLCA4 expression, with stomach more prominent. To determine the sites of expression at higher resolution, we probed tissue sections by in situ hybridization with an mCLCA4-specific 33P-labeled cRNA probe derived from the 3′-untranslated region. The best evidence for expression in smooth muscle was observed in vessels associated with the heart. A very strong signal was observed in the walls of the aorta with a much lower signal in adjoining cardiac muscle and little signal above background in the endothelium of the aortic valve (Fig. 5, a and e). The pulmonary vein (Fig. 5, b and f) and its branches were also intensely labeled, whereas the coronary artery was less so (Fig. 5, c and g). Connective and adipose tissues were consistently negative. The atrioventricular bundle, consisting of muscle cells modified to function as nerve fibers, was also positive (not shown). In lung, the signal was concentrated around bronchioles and blood vessels (Fig. 6,a–d). Surprisingly, in the gastrointestinal tract mCLCA4 expression was more strongly associated with the mucosa than with underlying smooth muscle (Fig. 6, e–h). In small intestine for example, label was concentrated in villi, whereas smooth muscle layers were more weakly labeled. In contrast to mCLCA1 and mCLCA3, mCLCA4 signal was not confined to deep crypt or goblet cells.Figure 6Expression of mCLCA4 in lung and gastrointestinal tract.

Because endothelial cells are difficult to detect by in situ hybridization, we obtained endothelial cells that had been isolated from aorta or lung microvasculature and analyzed them by RT-PCR. Endothelial cells from either source had high levels of mCLCA4 expression (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether mCLCA4 encodes a functional chloride channel, the cDNA was inserted into a vector bearing a green fluorescent protein marker and transfected into HEK293T cells, and whole cell currents of fluorescent cells were measured. Recordings were made in extracellular solution containing Cs+ substituted for Na+ to block any calcium-activated potassium currents. Under these conditions, mCLCA4-transfected HEK cells, but not vector-transfected cells, exhibited a prominent inward current when exposed to ionomycin (Fig. 7 A). 16 of 23 cells exposed to ionomycin displayed prominent inward currents, whereas no current was observed in 6 cells transfected with vector alone. The evoked currents were transient in nature even when evoked after exposure to ionomycin, which results in a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i; inactivation of the smooth muscle calcium-activated chloride channel that is independent of Ca2+ has been reported (38Wang Y.-X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Methacholine was also used to stimulate calcium release via endogenous muscarinic receptors. As shown in Fig. 7 B, methacholine activated a transient current of similar time course and smaller magnitude than ionomycin (Fig. 7 B). A second prominent feature of expression of mCLCA4 was the appearance of spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) similar to those observed in smooth muscle cells from several tissues (17Wang Q. Hogg R.C. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 525-537Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 39Janssen L.J. Sims S.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 427: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Spontaneous currents were observed in 10 of 29 cells transfected with mCLCA4 (Fig. 7 C), whereas in 21 cells transfected with a green fluorescent protein plasmid lacking mCLCA4 no spontaneous methacholine-activated chloride currents were observed. To obtain the current-voltage relationship of the calcium-activated inward current, a step depolarization experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the I-V relationship was linear over the voltage range from −60 to 40 mV, indicating little voltage dependence of gating or intrinsic rectification of mCLCA4 over this voltage range, similar to findings for mCLCA1 (25Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

Wang Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current was shown to be chloride-selective by substitution of extracellular Cl−ions with glutamate ions (Fig. 8 B). In these experiments, the current was activated by exposure of cells to ionomycin in the presence of normal extracellular solution or the same solution in which 100 mm NaCl was replaced by 100 mm sodium glutamate; glutamate ions have a permeability ratio in calcium-activated chloride channels of approximately 0.05 relative to Cl− ions (1Evans M.G. Marty A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 378: 437-460Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 40Amedee T. Large W.A. Wang Q. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 428: 501-516Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the presence of glutamate ions substituted for chloride ions, the reversal potential of the calcium-activated inward current shifted from 0 to 18.2 ± 3.6 mV (n = 6; Fig. 8 B), which was quite close to the theoretical ECl (24 mV, assuming zero glutamate permeability) and confirmed the anion selectivity of the channel. The CLCA gene family comprises an expanding group of calcium-activated chloride channels. To date, the expression of known CLCA genes has been largely restricted to epithelial and endothelial tissue, from which they were first cloned (23Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K.

(Lond.). 1987; 389: 513-525Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in large measure the genes responsible for these currents have not been clearly identified, and the extent to which they represent variants of the described CLCA or ClC (44Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) gene families has been uncertain. The identification of a CLCA gene with prominent expression patterns in smooth muscle significantly expands the potential importance of this gene family. In general, calcium-activated chloride channels in various mammalian tissues are similar in single-channel conductance, anion selectivity, and drug sensitivity (for review, see Ref. 45Gruber A.D. Fuller C.M. Elble R.C. Benos D.J. Pauli B.U. Curr. Genomics. 2000; 1: 201-222Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These and other shared properties led to the proposal that all calcium-activated chloride channels in mammalian tissues may be mediated by a family of closely related proteins (20Large W.A. Wang Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the CLCA family is deeply divergent at the amino acid level, all share several features. The CLCA precursor is about 900 amino acids long and contains two proteolytic cleavage sites. The first cleavage removes the amino-terminal signal sequence, resulting in a long extracellular amino-terminal tail. The second cleavage event removes the carboxyl-terminal ∼200 amino acids, yielding products of 90 and 30–40 kDa, both closely associated with the plasma membrane (24Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D.

The structure and stoichiometry of the channel remain to be established. We report the cloning and functional expression of a novel member of the CLCA family, termed mCLCA4. The gene product is strongly related to mCLCA1 and mCLCA2 and shares the potential phosphorylation sites for calcium/calmodulin kinase II, consistent with regulation by intracellular calcium. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis indicates substantial expression of mCLCA4 in smooth muscle and certain epithelial and endothelial tissues. Expression in smooth muscle was never observed for mCLCA1, mCLCA2, or mCLCA3 (46Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem.

Expression studies with mCLCA4 were consistent with this notion, and transfection of HEK293T cells with mCLCA4 resulted in the expression of a prominent calcium-activated chloride current. The current-voltage relationship measured in voltage steps during exposure to ionomycin was consistent with a very weakly voltage-dependent channel, similar to measurements of calcium-activated chloride currents in smooth muscle (20Large W.A. Wang Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other tissues (1Evans M.G. Marty A. J. Physiol.

Similarly, despite sustained elevations of [Ca2+]i obtained with ionomycin, the activated current decayed with kinetics generally similar to that observed in smooth muscle (38Wang Y.-X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The appearance of spontaneous, transient calcium-activated currents, a prominent feature of smooth muscle chloride currents (17Wang Q. Hogg R.C. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 451: 525-537Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), also suggests a marked functional similarity between mCLCA4 and the smooth muscle channel. In summary, we report the sequence and functional expression of a novel calcium-activated chloride channel with distinct tissue expression. Although the definitive determination of the extent to which this channel underlies specific postsynaptic currents in smooth muscle or secretory cells will require careful comparison of biophysical properties of heterologously expressed mCLCA4 with currents recorded in native cells and gene targeting experiments, our data identify mCLCA4 as a likely candidate for calcium-activated chloride currents in smooth muscle. The dependence of STICs upon unitary calcium-release events was established by Walsh and co-workers (Zhu Ge, R., Sims, S. M., Taft, R. A., Fogarty, K. E., and Walsh, J. V. (1998) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 513, 711–718). We thank Dr. Bernd Nilius for mouse aortic endothelial cells RNA and the laboratory of Dr. Alan Nixon for assistance with microscopy."

For some time there has been a consensus on the overall sequence of steps and key residues involved (4Matthews B.W. Sigler P.B. Henderson R. Blow D.M. Nature. 1967; 214: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Catalysis is initiated by the noncovalent binding of the polypeptide substrate to an active site cleft. After attack by a nucleophilic serine onto the scissile amide bond, the acylation phase of the reaction proceeds via the formation of a tetrahedral oxy-anion intermediate that collapses to form an acyl-enzyme (ester) complex with concomitant release of the C-terminal product fragment. In the deacylation phase of catalysis, attack of a water molecule onto the ester bond results in a second tetrahedral intermediate that collapses, releasing the N-terminal product fragment and regenerating the vacant enzyme.Pioneering work on the structural biology of the serine protease family (4Matthews B.W.

A crucial role as a general base was postulated for the conserved histidine, i.e. it deprotonates both the nucleophilic serine in the acylation phase and the “hydrolytic” water during the deacylation phase. A hydrogen bond between the active site histidine and a negatively charged aspartate was proposed to stabilize the positive charge on the histidine that arises during catalysis. In addition to the identification of the catalytic triad, the early x-ray structures also indicated that the peptide amides of the active site serine and a neighboring glycine could act as H-bond donors, which create an “oxy-anion” hole serving to stabilize the two tetrahedral intermediates formed during catalysis.The availability of cryo-cooling techniques and synchrotron radiation sources has recently enabled significant improvements in the resolution of crystal structures to be obtained for several members of the serine protease family.

From the highest resolution structure, that of subtilisin at 0.78-Å resolution (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) obtained at pH 6, crystallographic evidence was presented for an enhanced H-bond between the active site histidine and aspartate, for which the hydrogen was located approximately equidistant between the two residues (1.2 Å from His-57 Nδ1 and 1.5 Å from Oδ2 of Asp-102). This observation supported an earlier suggestion deriving from NMR studies (15Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The precise nature of this hydrogen bond, which has been termed a “low barrier hydrogen bond” (15Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) or a “catalytic hydrogen bond” (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), has been controversial (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ash E.L. Sudmeier J.L. DeFabo E.C. Bachovchin W.W. Science. 1997; 278: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the case of the lower resolution (1.1-Å) structure for PPE1 at approximately pH 7–8, the hydrogen between His-57 and Asp-102 appeared to be closely associated with Nδ1 of His-57 with a distance of the maximum of the hydrogen peak to Nδ1 of His-57 of 0.82 Å. Further, the distance of the Nδ1 of His-57 to Oδ2 of Asp-102 in this structure was 2.70 Å, which was slightly longer than that observed in the subtilisin structure (2.62 Å).Recent studies have also shown that PPE can form a relatively stable acyl-intermediate with simple peptides such as human β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7; YPFVEPI). The complex formed between PPE and BCM7 was crystallized, and its structure was first reported to 1.9-Å resolution (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, more recently, to 1.6-Å resolution (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This complex showed the substrate bound in a productive manner as an anti-parallel β-strand, extending by one strand a six-stranded β-barrel near the active site. Continuous electron density was observed between the C-terminal carbon of Ile-7 of BCM7 and the oxygen of Ser-195, consistent with the presence of a covalent ester bond between inhibitor and enzyme. The ester carbonyl was stabilized by H-bonds within the oxy-anion hole. A water molecule, in position to form a H-bond to Nε2 of His-57, was observed seemingly positioned for nucleophilic attack onto the ester bond. Such attack does not occur inasmuch as the crystallization was carried out at approximately pH 5, where His-57 is presumably protonated. The PPE·BCM7 complex was shown to be catalytically active because raising the internal pH of crystals initiated the deacylation reaction. Structures were obtained during hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme complex by elevating the pH of the pH 5 crystals, flash-freezing these crystals shortly afterward, and then recording x-ray diffraction data at cryogenic temperatures. A structure consistent with the accumulation (predominantly) of a tetrahedral intermediate was refined to 1.4-Å resolution (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results suggested a mechanism whereby the ester linkage was cleaved with the bound peptide being released simultaneously from the substrate binding cleft. An early x-ray structure of PPE in complex with two noncovalently bound peptides has also been reported (18Meyer E.F. Radhakrishnan R. Cole G.M. Presta L.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although, in that work, the orientation of both peptides was reversed with respect to productive binding.The unusual combination of a structure of native elastase at atomic resolution (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the ability of PPE to form crystals of a catalytically relevant acyl-intermediate (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J.

Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the availability of a high resolution structure of the tetrahedral intermediate of the deacylation pathway (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) motivated attempts to improve the resolution of the x-ray structures of acyl-enzyme complexes formed between PPE and peptide substrates. Of particular interest was the planarity of the ester group in the acyl-enzyme complex, and the hydrogen bond between Asp-102 and His-57. The original PPE·BCM7 structure (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed a H-bonding interaction up to the P3 glutamic acid residue and Gln-192 of PPE, whereas the remaining inhibitor residues were disordered and possibly interfered with crystal contacts. Recent kinetic studies on BCM7 analogues (19Wright P.A. Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a truncated N terminus indicated that significant inhibition of PPE could be effected by simple tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides terminating in a carboxylic acid. We therefore prepared a series of tri- and tetrapeptide analogues of BCM7 with the P3 glutamic acid replaced by a range of other amino acids (N-acetyl-X-Pro-Ile-CO2H and N-acetyl-Val-X-Pro-Ile-CO2H) and screened these for inhibition of PPE. Co-crystallization of PPE with the N-acetyl-Asn-Pro-Ile-CO2H inhibitor proved successful, and an x-ray diffraction data set to 0.95-Å resolution of this complex with good inhibitor occupancy was obtained. Here we report the atomic resolution structure of this acyl-enzyme complex and discuss structural issues concerning the mechanism of serine protease catalysis, which can be addressed as a result of the improvements in the accuracy of the atomic coordinates as well as from other features of the electron density map.CONCLUSIONSSerine protease catalysis represents one of the best structurally characterized of all enzymatic reactions. Several atomic resolution structures have been reported from this family, as has the tetrahedral intermediate been described at slightly lower resolution. The x-ray structure of an acyl-enzyme complex at 0.95 Å helps to complete the picture of the deacylation pathway at very high resolution. In combination with an atomic resolution structure of the native enzyme (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is apparent that there is virtually no geometric strain, either within the protein or the substrate, at this point along the reaction coordinate. By contrast, comparison with the high resolution structure of the tetrahedral intermediate (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reveals a number of subtle structural rearrangements and supports previously postulated mechanisms for synchronizing the ester bond cleavage with product release. In general, however, it is our view that the combination of structural results are consistent with Warshel's suggestion that the (prime) driving force for serine protease catalysis is achieved via a “preorganized polar environment,” which provides more electrostatic stabilization to the transition state than occurs in water (36Warshel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27035-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). This proposal does not, of course, preclude catalytic roles for subtle hydrogen transfers and conformational changes, which occur during catalysis. Because of the historical importance of the serine proteases in studies on enzyme catalysis and continuing medicinal interest in their inhibition, the details of their catalytic mechanism remain of interest. For some time there has been a consensus on the overall sequence of steps and key residues involved (4Matthews B.W. Sigler P.B. Henderson R. Blow D.M. Nature. 1967; 214: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Catalysis is initiated by the noncovalent binding of the polypeptide substrate to an active site cleft. After attack by a nucleophilic serine onto the scissile amide bond, the acylation phase of the reaction proceeds via the formation of a tetrahedral oxy-anion intermediate that collapses to form an acyl-enzyme (ester) complex with concomitant release of the C-terminal product fragment. In the deacylation phase of catalysis, attack of a water molecule onto the ester bond results in a second tetrahedral intermediate that collapses, releasing the N-terminal product fragment and regenerating the vacant enzyme. Pioneering work on the structural biology of the serine protease family (4Matthews B.W. Sigler P.B. Henderson R. Blow D.M.

Biol. 1972; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) led to the concept of a conserved active site catalytic triad formed by active site serine, histidine, and aspartate residues. A crucial role as a general base was postulated for the conserved histidine, i.e. it deprotonates both the nucleophilic serine in the acylation phase and the “hydrolytic” water during the deacylation phase. A hydrogen bond between the active site histidine and a negatively charged aspartate was proposed to stabilize the positive charge on the histidine that arises during catalysis. In addition to the identification of the catalytic triad, the early x-ray structures also indicated that the peptide amides of the active site serine and a neighboring glycine could act as H-bond donors, which create an “oxy-anion” hole serving to stabilize the two tetrahedral intermediates formed during catalysis. The availability of cryo-cooling techniques and synchrotron radiation sources has recently enabled significant improvements in the resolution of crystal structures to be obtained for several members of the serine protease family. X-ray structures of subtilisin (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), trypsin (11Rypniewski W.R.

In addition to improving the accuracy of the atomic coordinates of the native enzymes, multiple occupancies for a number of residues have been revealed (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G.

Norregaard-Madsen M. Dauter M. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). From the highest resolution structure, that of subtilisin at 0.78-Å resolution (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) obtained at pH 6, crystallographic evidence was presented for an enhanced H-bond between the active site histidine and aspartate, for which the hydrogen was located approximately equidistant between the two residues (1.2 Å from His-57 Nδ1 and 1.5 Å from Oδ2 of Asp-102). This observation supported an earlier suggestion deriving from NMR studies (15Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The precise nature of this hydrogen bond, which has been termed a “low barrier hydrogen bond” (15Frey P.A. Whitt S.A. Tobin J.B. Science. 1994; 264: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) or a “catalytic hydrogen bond” (1Kuhn P. Knapp M. Soltis S.M. Ganshaw G. Thoene M. Bott R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13446-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), has been controversial (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ash E.L. Sudmeier J.L. DeFabo E.C. Bachovchin W.W. Science. 1997; 278: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the case of the lower resolution (1.1-Å) structure for PPE1 at approximately pH 7–8, the hydrogen between His-57 and Asp-102 appeared to be closely associated with Nδ1 of His-57 with a distance of the maximum of the hydrogen peak to Nδ1 of His-57 of 0.82 Å. Further, the distance of the Nδ1 of His-57 to Oδ2 of Asp-102 in this structure was 2.70 Å, which was slightly longer than that observed in the subtilisin structure (2.62 Å). Recent studies have also shown that PPE can form a relatively stable acyl-intermediate with simple peptides such as human β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7; YPFVEPI). The complex formed between PPE and BCM7 was crystallized, and its structure was first reported to 1.9-Å resolution (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and, more recently, to 1.6-Å resolution (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This complex showed the substrate bound in a productive manner as an anti-parallel β-strand, extending by one strand a six-stranded β-barrel near the active site. Continuous electron density was observed between the C-terminal carbon of Ile-7 of BCM7 and the oxygen of Ser-195, consistent with the presence of a covalent ester bond between inhibitor and enzyme. The ester carbonyl was stabilized by H-bonds within the oxy-anion hole. A water molecule, in position to form a H-bond to Nε2 of His-57, was observed seemingly positioned for nucleophilic attack onto the ester bond. Such attack does not occur inasmuch as the crystallization was carried out at approximately pH 5, where His-57 is presumably protonated. The PPE·BCM7 complex was shown to be catalytically active because raising the internal pH of crystals initiated the deacylation reaction. Structures were obtained during hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme complex by elevating the pH of the pH 5 crystals, flash-freezing these crystals shortly afterward, and then recording x-ray diffraction data at cryogenic temperatures. A structure consistent with the accumulation (predominantly) of a tetrahedral intermediate was refined to 1.4-Å resolution (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results suggested a mechanism whereby the ester linkage was cleaved with the bound peptide being released simultaneously from the substrate binding cleft. An early x-ray structure of PPE in complex with two noncovalently bound peptides has also been reported (18Meyer E.F. Radhakrishnan R. Cole G.M. Presta L.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although, in that work, the orientation of both peptides was reversed with respect to productive binding. The unusual combination of a structure of native elastase at atomic resolution (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the ability of PPE to form crystals of a catalytically relevant acyl-intermediate (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the availability of a high resolution structure of the tetrahedral intermediate of the deacylation pathway (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) motivated attempts to improve the resolution of the x-ray structures of acyl-enzyme complexes formed between PPE and peptide substrates. Of particular interest was the planarity of the ester group in the acyl-enzyme complex, and the hydrogen bond between Asp-102 and His-57. The original PPE·BCM7 structure (17Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Robinson C.V. Roach P.L. Aplin R.T. Westwood N.J. Hajdu J. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed a H-bonding interaction up to the P3 glutamic acid residue and Gln-192 of PPE, whereas the remaining inhibitor residues were disordered and possibly interfered with crystal contacts. Recent kinetic studies on BCM7 analogues (19Wright P.A. Wilmouth R.C. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a truncated N terminus indicated that significant inhibition of PPE could be effected by simple tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides terminating in a carboxylic acid. We therefore prepared a series of tri- and tetrapeptide analogues of BCM7 with the P3 glutamic acid replaced by a range of other amino acids (N-acetyl-X-Pro-Ile-CO2H and N-acetyl-Val-X-Pro-Ile-CO2H) and screened these for inhibition of PPE. Co-crystallization of PPE with the N-acetyl-Asn-Pro-Ile-CO2H inhibitor proved successful, and an x-ray diffraction data set to 0.95-Å resolution of this complex with good inhibitor occupancy was obtained. Here we report the atomic resolution structure of this acyl-enzyme complex and discuss structural issues concerning the mechanism of serine protease catalysis, which can be addressed as a result of the improvements in the accuracy of the atomic coordinates as well as from other features of the electron density map. CONCLUSIONSSerine protease catalysis represents one of the best structurally characterized of all enzymatic reactions. Several atomic resolution structures have been reported from this family, as has the tetrahedral intermediate been described at slightly lower resolution. The x-ray structure of an acyl-enzyme complex at 0.95 Å helps to complete the picture of the deacylation pathway at very high resolution. In combination with an atomic resolution structure of the native enzyme (2Wurtele M. Hahn M. Hilpert K. Hohne W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is apparent that there is virtually no geometric strain, either within the protein or the substrate, at this point along the reaction coordinate. By contrast, comparison with the high resolution structure of the tetrahedral intermediate (3Wilmouth R.C. Edman K. Neutze R. Wright P.A. Clifton I.J. Schneider T.R. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2053801955,"Collagen glucosyltransferase (GGT) activity has recently been shown to be associated with human lysyl hydroxylase (LH) isoform 3 (LH3) (Heikkinen, J., Risteli, M., Wang, C., Latvala, J., Rossi, M., Valtavaara, M., Myllylä, R. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 36158–36163). The LH and GGT activities of the multifunctional LH3 protein modify lysyl residues in collagens posttranslationally to form hydroxylysyl and glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysyl residues respectively. We now report that in the nematode,<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, where only one ortholog is found for lysyl hydroxylase, the LH and GGT activities are also associated with the same gene product. The aim of the present studies is the identification of amino acids important for the catalytic activity of GGT. Our data indicate that the GGT active site is separate from the carboxyl-terminal LH active site of human LH3, the amino acids important for the GGT activity being located at the amino-terminal part of the molecule. Site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine at position 144 to isoleucine and a leucine at position 208 to isoleucine caused a marked reduction in GGT activity. These amino acids were conserved in <i>C. elegans</i> LH and mammalian LH3, but not in LH1 or LH2, which lack GGT activity. The data also reveal a D <i>X</i>D-like motif in LH3 characteristic of many glycosyltransferases and the mutagenesis of aspartates of this motif eliminated the GGT activity. Reduction in GGT activity was not accompanied by a change in the LH activity of the molecule. Thus GGT activity can be manipulated independently of LH activity in LH3. These data provide the information needed to design knock-out studies for investigation of the function of glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysyl residues of collagens <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2055570398,"Matrilins constitute a family of four oligomeric extracellular proteins that are involved in the development and homeostasis of cartilage and bone. To reveal their homo- and heterotypic oligomerization propensities, we analyzed the four human matrilin coiled-coil domains by biochemical and biophysical methods. These studies not only confirmed the homo- and heterotypic oligomerization states reported for the full-length proteins but revealed seven novel matrilin isoforms. Specific heterotrimeric interactions of variable chain stoichiometries were observed between matrilin-1 and matrilin-2, matrilin-1 and matrilin-4, and matrilin-2 and matrilin-4. In addition, matrilin-1 formed two different specific heterotetramers with matrilin-3. Interestingly, a distinct heterotrimer consisting of three different chains was formed between matrilin-1, matrilin-2, and matrilin-4. No interactions, however, were observed between matrilin-2 and matrilin-3 or between matrilin-3 and matrilin-4. Both homo- and heterotypic oligomers folded into parallel disulfide-linked structures, although coiled-coil formation was not dependent on disulfide bridge formation. Our results indicate that the heterotypic preferences seen for the matrilin coiled-coil domains are the result of the packing of the hydrophobic core rather than ionic interactions. Mass spectrometry revealed that the concentrations of the individual chains statistically determined the stoichiometry of the heteromers, suggesting that formation of the different matrillin chain combinations is controlled by expression levels.

It has been shown that at least in the case of matrilin-1 and matrilin-3, these networks can either be associated with collagen fibrils or be collagen-independent. In the case of matrilin-1, it appears that the collagen-matrilin interaction is periodic, and it has been proposed that matrilin-1 may play a role in collagen fibril assembly (2Winterbottom N.

Consistent with this hypothesis, ultrastructural studies of the cartilage of growth plates of matrilin-1 null mice revealed an abnormal type II collagen fibrillogenesis and fibril organization in the matrix of the zone of maturation (8Huang X. Birk D.E. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 434-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, matrilin-1 binds to the aggrecan core protein (9Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem.

In addition to binding to other matrix proteins, it has been proposed that matrilin-1 interacts with integrin α1β1 receptors and so may play a role in cell signaling (11Makihira S. Yan W. Ohno S.

These complementary and in part overlapping expression patterns of matrilins gain additional potential functional significance through the recent discovery of hetero-oligomers formed by matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 in cartilage (6Klatt A.R.

Biophys. 2001; 387: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was shown that their assembly was not dependent on the number of EGF-like repeats but on the presence of the two cysteines within the coiled-coil domain, which form covalent disulfide bonds responsible for both homo- and hetero-oligomerization (24Zhang Y. Chen Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of whether hetero-oligomer formation can also exist between other matrilins. To address this issue, we investigated the homo- and hetero-oligomerization properties of the four human matrilins. To avoid difficulties associated with the supramolecular assembly properties of the proteins, these analyses were limited to the individual coiled-coil domains produced by recombinant expression in E. coli. Moreover, coiled-coil domains usually display the same oligomerization state as the full-length proteins. The structures and assembly products of the individual proteins and all possible chain combinations were assessed by SDS-PAGE, nondenaturing PAGE, mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, and analytical ultracentrifugation. These studies not only confirmed the known homotypic and heterotypic oligomerization forms reported for the full-length proteins but also revealed seven novel matrilin chain combinations. We demonstrate that the concentrations of the individual chains statistically determine the stoichiometry of the heteromers. Together with the thermodynamic results that revealed an increased thermal stability of the hetero-oligomers, this finding suggests that formation of the different matrillin chain combinations is controlled by expression levels.DISCUSSIONAs a step toward our goal to understand matrilin structure and function, we have characterized the four human matrilin coiled-coil domains and all possible chain combinations therefrom by biochemical and biophysical methods. Coiled-coil domains usually display the same oligomerization state as the full-length proteins but offer the advantage of avoiding difficulties associated with the full-length proteins, such as supramolecular assembly. We found that ccMat1, ccMat2, and ccMat4 all formed disulfide-linked, three-stranded, parallel homotrimers, whereas ccMat3 folded into a disulfide-linked, four-stranded, parallel coiled-coil structure (Fig. 6). Consistent oligomerization states have previously been reported for the full-length proteins (5Piecha D. Muratoglu S. Morgelin M. Hauser N. Studer D. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Deak F. J. Biol.

Based on the coiled-coil structures, we were able to identify nine different matrilin isoforms, seven of which have not been described previously. The possible matrilin chain combinations are shown in Fig. 6. An unexpected feature of the matrilin hetero-oligomers consisting of two different polypeptide chains is that they can exist in different stoichiometries. The most plausible explanation for this observation is that the thermodynamic stabilities of the heterotypic coiled-coils with the same chain composition are very similar. Our studies not only confirmed two heterotetramers of different chain stoichiometries reported for biochemically isolated matrilin-1 and matrilin-3 (6Klatt A.R. Nitsche D.P. Kobbe B. Morgelin M.

Eyre D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but also demonstrated that these interactions occur via the proteins' coiled-coil domain. These findings emphasize the validity of our approach and demonstrate that the characterization of the coiled-coil domains from a protein family can be used to predict their oligomerization properties.The α-helical coiled coil is the most widespread subunit oligomerization motif found in proteins (39Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 40Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Kohn W.D. Mant C.T.

Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). It is a type of protein structure consisting of 2–5 amphipathic α-helices that “coil” around each other in a slight supertwist (39Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 40Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The sequences of left-handed coiled coils are characterized by a heptad repeat of seven residues denoted a–g with a 3,4-hydrophobic repeat of mostly apolar amino acids at positions a and d (43McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 44Sodek J. Hodges R.S. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3800-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interactions between the core residues a and d and the two flanking positions e and g determine the number of strands, the parallel or antiparallel orientation of α-helices, and the homo- or heterotypic association of subunits into a coiled coil (for a review, see Refs. 39Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar and 42Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar).Matrilin-3 differs from the other matrilins in terms of its tetrameric oligomerization state. It is well known that the residues at the a and d positions can exert a major influence on oligomer selection. Crucial roles in oligomer specification are played by leucine and the β-branched residue isoleucine (45Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Tetramers are known to be favored by sequences enriched by leucine residues at the a sites and isoleucine at the d sites, whereas trimers display a more even distribution of hydrophobic residues at these positions. The preferences for specific amino acids at the core positions of coiled-coils can be explained by differences in packing geometry in these structures. Since only matrilin-3 contains a single isoleucine residue at a d position of the third heptad repeat, it is tempting to speculate that this residue specifies the four-stranded oligomerization state of the protein. Considering the importance of isoleucine for specifying the oligomerization state, chicken matrilin-3 may possibly even form a trimer because this residue is not conserved in the avian species. In addition, the d position of the fourth heptad repeat of all known matrilin-3 species is occupied by residues that are not frequently found at these positions (46Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It should be noted that residues at the b, c, e, and g positions of the tetramer also contribute to the hydrophobic core (45Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Thus, the amino acid sequence at these positions can also influence the oligomerization state. Accordingly, Beck et al. (37Beck K. Gambee J.E. Kamawal A. Bachinger H.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3767-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) observed a switch in the oligomerization state of the coiled-coil domain of matrilin-1 after substitution of a single residue. After replacing arginine 487, which forms a potential interchain ionic interaction with a glutamate 492, with glutamine, the peptide folded into a homotetramer at neutral pH. Interestingly, the mutant peptide folded into a homotrimer at acidic and basic pH. It should be noted, however, that the interchain salt bridge is an unlikely determinant in specifying the four-stranded oligomerization state, because the interaction is conserved among the human and mouse matrilins.Our findings raise the question about the molecular determinants that specify that matrilin-3 interacts with matrilin-1 but not with matrilin-2 and matrilin-4. In line with our results, it has been established by phylogenetic analysis that the coiled-coil domain of ccMat3 is most closely related to ccMat1 (1Deak F. Wagener R. Kiss I. Paulsson M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all coiled-coil structures containing matrilin-3 are four-stranded. It is well established that hetero-oligomerization can occur as a “relief” of repulsive electrostatic interactions between residues in the g position with residues in the e′ position of a neighboring chain in a homo-oligomer (for a review, see Ref. 47Hodges R.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions between residue i of chain 1 in g and residue i′ + 5 in e of chain 2 are prominent because of the proximity of these residues (45Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Repulsive interactions disrupt the complementary packing at the interface of the coiled-coil, thus accounting for the instability of the homodimers. However, interchain g and e′ interactions do not explain hetero-oligomer formation of matrilins. There is only one potential attractive interaction between residues of the last two heptads that is conserved in all four coiled-coils (Arg or Lys in g to Glu in e′; see Fig. 1 B). Tetramers also exhibit two types of ion pairs that are rarely found in trimers. These are g to b′ and c to e′ salt bridges. Like the e and g residues, however, these salt bridges are unlikely to account for the hetero-oligomerization specificity of matrilins. Furthermore, hetero-oligomer formation of matrilins is not the result of homo-oligomer instability, because all four homotypic matrilin coiled-coils fold into very stable structures. Because electrostatic interactions do not provide an explanation, we therefore suggest that the heterotypic preferences seen for the matrilin coiled-coil domains are the result of the packing of the hydrophobic core. Our hypothesis is consistent with a recent study of Keating et al. (48Keating A.E. Malashkevich V.N. Tidor B. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 14825-14830Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), who addressed the role of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions in determining heterotypic interaction specificity. These authors showed that computational modeling of coiled-coil structures can be used to predict interaction energy differences that agree quantitatively with experimental results positions in determining interaction specificity. The calculations could be used to predict coiled-coil partnering preferences that arise from core packing. Accordingly, residues that are known to favor trimer or tetramer formation over dimerization (such as Ile or Val at the d position) were found to destabilize the heterodimers.The principal function of coiled-coil domains is subunit oligomerization of multisubunit proteins. Oligomerization generates multivalency, provides high local concentrations of functional sites, and allows clustered domains to function in a concerted manner. Heteromers could further increase the structural and functional diversity of matrilins. Candidates are the vWFA domains, which are arranged in different ways in different isoforms (for a schematic view, see Figs. 1 A and 6). These domains are present in a large number of other extracellular proteins, including collagens, complement factors, integrins, and von Willebrand factor (49Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) and mediate self-interaction and ligand-binding activities (49Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand-binding affinity of vWFA domains could be modulated by the expression of matrilins as homo- and hetero-oligomers. Such a mechanism has also been proposed for the heparin-binding properties of thrombospondins (51O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24921-24924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where thrombospondin-2 has a lower affinity than thrombospondin-1. Thus, the ligand-binding affinity could be varied by the formation of thrombospondin homo- and heterotrimers. Coiled-coil domains also play an important role in the formation of laminins for which isoform-specific functions are well established (52Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 53Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Laminins comprise a family of at least 14 heterotrimers that are assembled through a coiled-coil domain from at least 11 different polypeptide chains. Laminins function as structural components and are essential for morphogenesis but in addition interact with cell surface receptors such as integrins and α-dystroglycan. The many interactions of laminins are mediated by binding sites, often contributed by single domains, which may differ between different forms of laminin. One important function of many laminins is their ability to self-associate into independent networks (54Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since self-assembly is mediated by the N-terminal domains, these interactions differ among isoforms.The vWFA domain is the most likely candidate for the self-interaction seen for matrilins, leading to the formation of supramolecular structures, which may play a role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix structure. Also in this case, hetero-oligomerization could provide a means to increase the structural diversity of these complexes and generate assemblies with particular properties. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study on collagen V by Chanut-Delalande et al. (55Chanut-Delalande H. Fichard A. Bernocco S. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24352-24359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These authors investigated the role of collagen V in homotypic and heterotypic fibril formation. They found that both collagen V heterotrimer and homotrimer formed thin fibrils. When mixed with collagen I, however, heterotrimer and homotrimer exerted different effects in heterotypic fibril formation. Unlike the heterotrimer, which was buried in the fibril interior, the homotrimer was localized as thin filamentous structures at the surface of wide collagen I fibrils and did not regulate fibril assembly. Its localization at the fibril surface suggests that the homotrimer can act as a molecular linker between collagen fibrils and/or macromolecules in the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, like our findings on matrilin heteromer formation, the control of collagen V homo- and heterotrimers seems to be determined by chain stoichiometry.Furthermore, coiled-coil domains can also harbor binding sites for globular proteins. For example, the N-terminal domain of agrin binds to the coiled-coil domain of laminins (56Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Schumacher B. Lustig A. Yurchenco P.D. Ruegg M.A. Engel J. Denzer A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6762-6770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is important for the localization of agrin to the synaptic basal lamina and other basement membranes. In the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium Staphylothermus marinus, a subtilisin-like protease interacts with the four-stranded right-handed coiled coil of the surface layer protein tetrabrachion (57Peters J. Nitsch M. Kuhlmorgen B. Golbik R. Lupas A. Kellermann J. Engelhardt H. Pfander J.P. Muller S. Goldie K. Engel A. Stetter K.-O. Baumeister W. J. Mol.

Likewise, particular matrilin isoforms may contain binding sites for extracellular proteins that are not present in the homo-oligomers. Thus, depending on their respective distribution in tissues, the different matrilin isoforms might fulfill specific biological functions. This conclusion is also supported by a study of Chapman et al. (12Chapman K.L. Mortier G.R. Chapman K. Loughlin J. Grant M.E. Briggs M.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that mutations in the vWFA domain in matrilin-3 are associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.The tissue distribution of matrilins indicates that some of the chain combinations identified in this study are more prominent than others.

https://openalex.org/W2040684561,"Activated mast cells release a variety of potent inflammatory mediators including histamine, cytokines, proteoglycans, and serine proteases. The serine proteases belong to either the chymase (chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity) or tryptase (trypsin-like specificity) family. In this report we have investigated the substrate specificity of a recently identified mast cell protease, rat mast cell protease-4 (rMCP-4). Based on structural homology, rMCP-4 is predicted to belong to the chymase family, although rMCP-4 has previously not been characterized at the protein level. rMCP-4 was expressed with an N-terminal His tag followed by an enterokinase site substituting for the native activation peptide. The enterokinase-cleaved fusion protein was labeled by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, demonstrating that it is an active serine protease. Moreover, rMCP-4 hydrolyzed MeO-Suc-Arg-Ala-Tyr-pNA, thus verifying that this protease belongs to the chymase family. rMCP-4 bound to heparin, and the enzymatic activity toward MeO-Suc-Arg-Ala-Tyr-pNA was strongly enhanced in the presence of heparin. Detailed analysis of the substrate specificity was performed using peptide phage display technique. After six rounds of amplification a consensus sequence, Leu-Val-Trp-Phe-Arg-Gly, was obtained. The corresponding peptide was synthesized, and rMCP-4 was shown to cleave only the Phe-Arg bond in this peptide. This demonstrates that rMCP-4 displays a striking preference for bulky/aromatic amino acid residues in both the P1 and P2 positions.

Mast cells are potent inflammatory cells with well known harmful effects, e.g. during allergic reactions. However, their primary beneficial function in vivo is most likely their involvement in the expulsion of nematode parasites and in the defense against bacterial infections (1Knight P.A. Wright S.H.

The inflammatory mediators include histamine, proteoglycans, prostaglandins, cytokines, and neutral proteases (4Welle M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Mast cells are a particularly rich source of serine proteases belonging to the tryptase family, the chymase family, and the recently identified mMCP-8 family. Proteases belonging to the mMCP-8 family have as yet unknown substrate specificity. The tryptase family of proteases cleaves their substrate at the C-terminal side of basic amino acids (Arg and Lys), whereas the chymase family has chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity, i.e. they cleave peptides after aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp). Based on phylogenetic relationships, the chymase family can be further subdivided into two groups, the α- and the β-chymases (5Chandrasekharan U.M. Sanker S. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A. Science. 1996; 271: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In nonrodent mammals only a single α-chymase can be found, whereas in rodents several β-chymases are expressed in addition to the α-chymase. At least 18 mammalian α- and β-chymases have been identified and cloned (6Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, only a few of them have been characterized in detail with regard to structure and cleavage specificity. Five of the ten rat mast cell proteases (rMCP-1, rMCP-2, rMCP-3, rMCP-4, and rMCP-5) are considered to display chymase activity (7Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). rMCP-5 (initially designated as rMCP-3) is the rat α-chymase and the homologue to the single human chymase found so far. The rat mast cell β-chymases rMCP-1 and rMCP-2, expressed by connective tissue mast cells and MMC, respectively, have been extensively investigated with regard to tissue distribution, charge, heparin binding, substrate specificity, inhibitor susceptibility, and structure (7Lutzelschwab C.

This results in increased leukocyte migration and microbial product influx that potentially enhances the inflammatory response. rMCP-3 and rMCP-4 (GenBankTM accession numbers U67888 and U67907, respectively) were initially cloned from the rat mucosal mast cell line RBL-1 (7Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and group phylogenetically with the β-chymases. Both rMCP-3 and rMCP-4 have been suggested to be MMC proteases, with detectable mRNA levels primarily found during parasitic infections (12Lutzelschwab C. Lunderius C. Enerback L. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3730-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, neither rMCP-3 nor rMCP-4 has been characterized at the protein level. Chymases utilize extended substrate-binding sites to discriminate between substrates. Additional understanding of the biological role of a protease may be obtained by a detailed analysis of its substrate specificity. In the present study, rMCP-4 has been characterized with regard to activity, heparin binding, and extended substrate specificity. The rMCP-4 expression construct was obtained by PCR amplification using full-length cDNA (7Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as template. For purification purposes the 5′-primer contained a sequence encoding six histidine residues. The 5′-primer also introduced an enterokinase susceptible peptide (Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) in replacement of the natural activation peptide. The enterokinase cleavage site enables subsequent removal of the histidine residues and thereby enables activation of the protease. The PCR product was inserted into the pCEP-Pu2 vector (13Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide sequence of the final product was confirmed using the Thermo Sequenase-radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and vector specific primers. Human embryonic kidney cells, 293-EBNA, were transfected with the pCEP-Pu2/rMCP-4 construct as previously described (13Hallgren J. Karlson U. Poorafshar M. Hellman L. Pejler G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13068-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Selection was initiated by the addition of 5 μg/ml puromycin to the cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin). After 1 week of selection, the level of puromycin was decreased to 0.5 μg/ml. The conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads/liter (Qiagen). After 6 h of incubation at 4 °C on a shaker, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and transferred to 10-ml PolyPrep Chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The beads were washed with PBS (pH 7.2) containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, and the column was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in PBS. Protein purity and concentration was estimated on SDS-PAGE. The samples were mixed with sample buffer and 5% β-mercaptoethanol and run on a 12% gel. To visualize protein bands, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Recombinant rMCP-4 was digested for 5h with EKMaxTM (Invitrogen) enterokinase, one unit/10 μg of recombinant protease. A 10-ml PolyPrep Chromatography column containing 0.2 ml of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.2). 10 μg of EK-cleaved rMCP-4 in 125 μl of PBS (pH 7.2) was applied to the column, followed by washing with PBS (0.15 M NaCl) and stepwise elution with increasing NaCl concentrations from 0.25 to 1.15 m. The flow-through and eluted fractions were assayed by the chromogenic substrate S-2586 and run on SDS-PAGE to estimate the protein content. Initial experiments showed that rMCP-4 bound to heparin-Sepharose. To purify rMCP-4 from enterokinase and other impurities, EK-digested rMCP-4 samples were therefore purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (see above). Following affinity chromatography, the protein concentration was determined by measuring A280 with a calculated extinction coefficient of 20690 m −1 cm−1. Enzymatic activity was measured toward the chromogenic substrate S-2586 (MeO-Suc-Arg-Ala-Tyr-pNA) (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden). Standard measurements were performed in 96-well microtiter plates with a substrate concentration of 0.18 mm in 200 μl of PBS. S-2586 hydrolysis was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a Multiscan MCC/340 spectrophotometer (Labsystem). The dependence on heparin for enzymatic activity was assayed after the addition of pig mucosal heparin (Sigma) at different enzyme-to-heparin mass ratios. As controls, the samples with heparin or enterokinase only were included. In addition, the activity of rMCP-4 that had not been EK-digested was measured. To evaluate the fraction of active rMCP-4, the protease (1 μg) was titrated with human α1-antichymotrypsin (Calbiochem). The residual activity was measured with S-2586 after overnight incubation of rMCP-4 with the inhibitor at different inhibitor to chymase molar ratios. Three samples, each containing ∼2 μg of His6-EK-rMCP-4 in PBS were prepared. 10 μg of pig mucosal heparin and 0.7 μl (0.7 unit) of EK Max enterokinase were added to one of the samples. EK (0.7 μl) or heparin (10 μg) was added to the remaining two samples, respectively. Following 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the aliquots were mixed with 5 μCi of [3H] DFP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 16h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were assayed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, incubated for 1 h in 1 m sodium salicylate, and dried in a vacuum dryer. To analyze the amount of labeled DFP covalently bound to the protease active site, an x-ray film was exposed to the gel for 2 weeks. A library of substrate peptides was generated by synthesizing degenerate oligonucleotides with the nucleotide sequence AATTCTCTCACTCCAGGCGGC-(NNK)9-CATCACCATCACCATCACTAA (N represents any nucleotide, and K represents T or G) encoding a random nonamer followed by a histidine tag. The oligonucleotides were introduced into the coding region of the T7 phage capsid protein in the T7Select 1–1 vector arms (T7Select system manual; Novagen) by the method according to Cwirla et al. (14Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The vector constructs were packaged into phage particles in vitro. The total number of T7 clones after packaging was 5.3 × 107 plaque forming units. The phage library was amplified to a titer of 2 × 1010 plaque forming units/ml in the BLT 5615 bacterial strain. Amplification is necessary for the expression of His-tagged inserts and their display on the surface of the phage particles. The His-tagged capsid protein is only produced in very low numbers (0.1–1/phage) because of an upstream partial deletion of the capsid protein promoter region in the T7Select 1–1 vector. Hence, a His-tagged capsid protein is present on at least 10% of the assembled phage particles. The native capsid protein is expressed by the host bacterial strain, BLT 5615, upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. An aliquot of the amplified phages (∼109 plaque forming units) were allowed to bind to 100 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads for 2 h while rotating gently. Unbound phages were removed by washing 10 times with 1.5 ml of 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.2, further washed twice in 1.5 ml of PBS, finally resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. A control elution of the phages with 100 μl of 500 mm imidazole concluded that at least 1 × 108 phages were attached to the matrix after washing. rMCP-4 was activated as previously described in the absence of heparin and then subjected to heparin-Sepharose purification. Following elution with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl, heparin was added to a 1:5 mass ratio of protease to heparin. The selection was started by adding 0.5 μg of protease (200 nm) or buffer without protease as a control to the tubes with the resuspended beads. The protease was allowed to digest susceptible phages at 37 °C overnight with gentle agitation. To recover released phages, the Ni-NTA-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the phages in the supernatant were removed in a total volume of 3 × 100 μl of PBS (pH 7.2). To ensure that all recovered phages lacked the histidine tag, 15 μl of fresh Ni-NTA-agarose beads were added to the phage suspension, and the mixture was agitated for 15 min followed by centrifugation to recover the supernatant. 10 μl of the supernatant was used to determine the amount of detached phages in each round of selection. The remaining 290 μl of the supernatant was added to a 10-ml culture (OD = ∼0.6) of Escherichia coli (BLT5615). The bacteria had been induced with 100 μl of 100 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 30 min before phage addition to ensure production of the phage capsid protein. Approximately 2 h after phage addition, the bacteria lysed, and the phage sublibrary was added to fresh agarose beads. After binding and washing the sublibrary, a new round of selection was started. Following six rounds of selection, 35 plaques were arbitrarily isolated from LB plates, and each dissolved in phage extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 6 mm MgSO4). To disrupt the phages, the dissolved material was mixed 1:1 with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The phage DNA was then amplified by PCR, using T7 SelectUP and T7 SelectDOWN primers (T7Select Cloning kit, Novagen). After amplification, the PCR fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR fragments were then sequenced using Thermo Sequenase-radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). In a control experiment, to verify the completeness and functionality of the library, 1.5 μl (1 unit) of thrombin (Sigma) was used to pan the library, because the substrate specificity for thrombin is known (15Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The protocol for the selections with thrombin was the same as for rMCP-4, except that the incubation time was decreased to 2 h, and only four rounds of selection were performed. To verify that the sequences from the phage display selections were indeed substrates for rMCP-4, and to confirm the cleavage site (P1–P1′ amino acids), a synthetic peptide was constructed from the aligned sequences. The peptide substrate, NH2-LVWFRG-COOH (purchased from Åke Engström, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, BMC, Uppsala, Sweden), was dissolved in Me2SO. Different concentrations of the peptide (10% Me2SO in PBS, pH 7.2) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 16 ng of rMCP-4, with or without heparin. The samples from the incubation mixtures were applied to a Source 5RPC ST 4.6/150 HPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in a 2:3 ratio (v/v) of 70% acetonitrile with 10 mm NaOH. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile ranging from 30 to 70% over 25 min. The effluent was analyzed by monitoring spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Fractions corresponding to peaks were collected and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The coding region for rMCP-4 was PCR-amplified using the corresponding full-length cDNA clone as template. The construct contained an N-terminal His6 tag followed by an EK site that replaced the natural activation peptide. The resulting fragment of 711 bp was inserted in the pCEP-Pu2 vector in frame with the BM40 signal sequence, which is a signal sequence derived from the human protein SPARC (secreted protein,acidic and rich in cysteine), also referred to as osteonectin. The pCEP-Pu2 vector containing the protease construct was introduced into the 293-EBNA cell line by LipofectAMINE transfection. Recombinant rMCP-4 present in the culture medium was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and was subjected to enterokinase digestion. Many of the various isolated chymases show binding to heparin, mediated by positively charged amino acid residues located at the chymase surface (16Trong H.L. Newlands G.F. Miller H.R. Charbonneau H. Neurath H. Woodbury R.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Sali A. Matsumoto R. McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Experiments were therefore carried out to determine whether the recombinant rMCP-4 showed affinity for heparin. EK-digested rMCP-4 was loaded on columns of heparin-Sepharose, which were eluted stepwise with buffers containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. These experiments showed almost 100% binding of rMCP-4 to heparin-Sepharose at 0.15 m NaCl and elution of the protein at ∼0.35 m NaCl (Fig. 1 A). The heparin-Sepharose affinity was utilized for routine purification of rMCP-4 after the EK step, allowing separation of EK and other impurities from the EK-digested mature rMCP-4 protein. The molecular mass of rMCP-4 before EK digestion, as determined by the migration on SDS-PAGE, was estimated to be 28 kDa (Fig. 2 A). After enterokinase digestion a molecular mass of 26 kDa was observed for the mature protease, which correlates well with the calculated theoretical value of 24,987 Da (7Lutzelschwab C. Pejler G. Aveskogh M. Hellman L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the histidine tag and the enterokinase cleavage site add ∼1.5 kDa in size to the recombinant protease, the molecular mass of the uncleaved fusion protein is close to the expected value. Based on structural comparisons with other serine proteases, rMCP-4 is expected to display chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity, i.e. cleaving substrates at the C-terminal side of aromatic amino acid residues. To test whether this is the case, the ability of rMCP-4 to hydrolyze S-2586 (MeO-Suc-Arg-Ala-Tyr-pNA) was tested. S-2586 has previously been utilized as an efficient substrate for the main chymase found in rat connective tissue mast cells, rMCP-1 (19Pejler G. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12187-12195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). rMCP-4 was indeed shown to hydrolyze S-2586. S-2586 hydrolysis was strongly enhanced by heparin in a dose-dependent manner and was barely detectable at suboptimal heparin concentrations (Fig. 1 B). The specific activity toward S-2586 (at 1 mm concentration of S-2586) was ∼0.6 pmol of hydrolyzed S-2586 s−1/μg rMCP-4 at a 1:1 protease to heparin (w/w) ratio. Attempts were made to determine Km and kcat values of rMCP-4 for S-2586. However, no leveling out of the curve corresponding to the substrate cleaving rates was reached at S-2586 concentrations up to 3.5 mm. Above this concentration S-2586 was not soluble, and determination of kinetic parameters was therefore not possible. The serine protease inhibitor DFP, which covalently binds to the serine residue in the catalytic triad, can be used to detect active serine proteases. EK-digested rMCP-4, with or without heparin, was incubated with 3H-labeled DFP. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Fig. 2 B shows that EK-digested rMCP-4 binds DFP both in the presence and absence of heparin, whereas its non-EK-digested counterpart does not. This shows that rMCP-4 is an active protease. Further, because no additional DFP-binding bands other than rMCP-4 and EK were visible (removal of enterokinase by heparin chromatography was not done in the DFP labeling experiment), the rMCP-4 preparation was free from other contaminating serine proteases. To confirm that no other chymotryptic proteases were present in the purified preparation, the activity toward S-2586 was tested in samples not activated with enterokinase. No activity toward S-2586 was detected in such samples (data not shown). EK-digested rMCP-4 was active site-titrated with α1-antichymotrypsin, a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin family. Close to 100% inhibition of rMCP-4 was obtained at a molar ratio of inhibitor to protease of ∼1:1, indicating that essentially all of the recombinant rMCP-4 molecules were correctly folded (Fig. 3). A phage display analysis was performed to determine the substrate specificity of rMCP-4 in more detail. The C terminus of the capsid protein 10 of the T7 phage was manipulated to contain a nine-amino acid-long random peptide followed by a histidine tag. The histidine tag was used to anchor the phages to a matrix. Phages with a random peptide that is susceptible to protease cleavage will be detached from the matrix and can therefore be removed and be propagated. The release of phages after each protease digestion step was determined by titration and plating in top agarose. The number of cleaved phages after each selection compared with the control is shown in Fig. 4. After six rounds of selection, the addition of rMCP-4 to the amplified library gave a 20-fold higher release of phages than the control library with buffer only. After six rounds of selection and propagation, 32 individual phage plaques were picked and sequenced (Table I). A consensus could be seen when aligning the phage sequences, especially at the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. The nomenclature by Schechter and Berger (20Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar) is used to designate the amino acid residues in the substrate cleavage region, where P1–P1′ corresponds to the scissile bond. The obtained sequences (indicated in bold type in Table I) were aligned according to the presumed cleavage site. The result for each given subsite is shown in Fig. 5, where the heights of the bars in each diagram represent the percentages of that amino acid in the subsite, given by the aligned phage display sequences. The predominant P4 amino acid (Fig. 5 A) is Leu, whereas Val dominates in the P3 position (Fig. 5 B). A preference for Trp and other aromatic amino acids was seen in P2 (Fig. 5 C). Only five of the total (32) number of sequenced clones lacked an aromatic P2 amino acid residue, instead they had Leu (two sequences), Met (two sequences), or Ser (one sequence). The phage display analysis indicates that rMCP-4 has a high preference for P1 Phe or Tyr (Fig. 5 D) and that a broader spectrum of amino acids are tolerated in the P1′ substrate position (Fig. 5 E). The dominating amino acid in the P2′ position is Gly (47%),i.e. an amino acid with a small side chain. Further, several of the other clones recognized by rMCP-4 also had amino acid with relatively small side chains at the P2′ position (Ala, Ser; Fig. 5 F), indicating a preference for small side chains at this position.Table ITarget sequences for rMCP-4Clone no.P4P3P2P1P1′P2′12YIWFLGEMP13WIWYNSVLK2WLFFNGSLW4WVFFSYSEL19WVFFQSALP7YTYYSLLVV32GFSFFWGRW17IIWYVALPE25GLMFFQGGW1LMWFRGLSI29LMWFRGAFD15LLYFRGVEV18SLVWFRSKF26WLVWFRGQR28RWMLVWFRR27VVWFRGVFS11LVYYVSRRM10GLTWFMGTW16IEWYSGRLW23AVEYYRFDS3MLTWFFSTP8, 21LVWYNLPLS14EWMVWFTGV9VVWYSLVPY24VVWYVATLS5DEVVFYLGF31ELVLFMGGW20LVLFASRVV22LVMFSGTYW30DMVWLMYRL6VAGLGSFGHAmino acid sequences of the randomized nonamer regions present in rMCP-4 susceptible phages are shown.

The general structure of the amino acid sequences in the phage clones is PGG X9HHHHHH, where X indicates the randomized region. The sequences were aligned hypothetically into a P4–P2′ consensus (shown in bold type) where cleavage is proposed to occur between the P1 and P1′ amino acid residue.

The sequences were aligned hypothetically into a P4–P2′ consensus (shown in bold type) where cleavage is proposed to occur between the P1 and P1′ amino acid residue. In a control experiment where the phage display library was subjected to cleavage with thrombin, eight clones were sequenced. Four of these clones had the exact same sequence, Thr-Leu-Met-Val-Pro-Arg-Thr-Gly-Ser. When dissecting this sequence into P4–P1, the resulting specificity is P4-Met, P3-Val, P2-Pro, and P1-Arg. The four remaining sequences (the most probable P1 positions are underlined) were Met-Ala-Ser-Pro-Arg-Met-Leu-Arg, Gly-Ala-Lys-Pro-Arg-Ala-Leu-Arg, Ser-Arg-Ala-Ser-Arg-Leu-Lys-Val, and Arg-Trp-Ser-Pro-Arg-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Gly. Using the positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial library method, the substrate specificity for thrombin has been determined previously to P4-Nle (norleucine, substitute for Met), P3-Xaa and P2-Pro (strictly), with the use of P1-Arg (21Backes B.J.

On the other hand, the possibility of expressing recombinant apolipoproteins such as apoA-I (13McGuire K.A. Davidson S. Jonas A. J.

Although FRET does not have the resolution of x-ray diffraction or solution NMR, it provides an alternative approach to obtain structural constraints that can be used to build a low resolution structure of an apolipoprotein in the lipid-bound state. This approach has been recently used to study some structural properties of the organization of human apoA-I molecules in discoidal lipoproteins (19Li H-h Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is expected that many more studies will apply FRET techniques to investigate the structure of apolipoproteins in the lipid-bound state. In this report we present the results of an extensive FRET study that was directed to investigate structural features of apoLp-III in the lipid-bound state. Four intramolecular and four intermolecular, interhelical distances were estimated in this study and used to infer the conformation of individual apoLp-III molecules as well as the arrangement of different apolipoprotein molecules in discoidal lipoproteins. Moreover, the comparison between the interhelical distances in the lipid-free and in the lipid-bound state demonstrated for the first time that the formation of discoidal lipoproteins is accompanied by a large increase in the distance of separation between the helices of the apolipoprotein. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the commercial kit QuikChange, manufactured by Stratagene. A pET-32a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) containing the insert of L. migratoria apoLp-III was used for mutagenesis. The PCR reaction containing the plasmid and the primers was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the PfuDNA polymerase. Competent cells, Epicurian (Stratagene), were transformed with the PCR reaction. The plasmid DNA of the transformed bacteria was sequenced from the S-tag and T7-terminator sites. AD494 expression host cells were transformed with the pET-32a-apoIII plasmids containing the correct sequences. Wild type L. migratoria apoLp-III contains two Trp residues and no Cys residues. The single Trp mutant containing a reporter Trp in helix 4 at position 113 was obtained with a single mutation (W128F) of the wild type apoLp-III. This mutant was subsequently used as a template to construct four single Cys mutants. The single Trp mutant has been previously characterized and shown to have structural and functional properties nearly identical to those of the wild type apoLp-III in both the lipid-free (21Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and lipid-bound states (22Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. Chetty P.S. Rodriguez V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34162-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The location of the Cys residues was chosen on the basis of the crystal structure of L. migratoria apoLp-III (1aep.pdb). The following substitutions were carried out: N16C (Cys in helix 1), A51C (Cys in helix 2), N83C (Cys in helix 3) and A147C (Cys in helix 5); we will refer to these mutants as Cys-H1, Cys-H2, Cys-H3, and Cys-H5 mutants, respectively. According to the crystal structure the amino acid residues replaced by Cys are exposed to the solvent. The location of the Cys residues and that of the only Trp residue is shown in Fig. 1. A double mutant containing no Trp residues, W128F/W113F, was also constructed, and we will refer to this mutant as the Phe mutant. This mutant was needed to correct the fluorescence spectra for the scattering generated by the lipoproteins as well as to study possible intermolecular energy transfer processes. Expression of the protein was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the protein isolated from the bacteria and purified as previously reported (21Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17501-17509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Recombinant locust apoLp-III was cleaved from the rest of the fusion protein with enterokinase (Novagen). ApoLp-III does not have any cleavage sites for enterokinase. ApoLp-III was purified from the cleavage reaction by nickel affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography in DE52. Acrylodan (AcD), didansyl-l-cystine (DDC), and 4-acetamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid (AMS) were purchased from Molecular Probes. AcD was dissolved in methanol (10 mm), DDC was dissolved in dimethylformamide (20 mm), and AMS (20 mm) was dissolved in 0.4m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Before the labeling reaction, the proteins (20–40 μm) were treated with 2 mm dithiothreitol followed by dialysis against the appropriate volume of 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, to reduce dithiothreitol concentration to 50 μm. These protein preparations were incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of probe (AcD, DDC, or AMS) at room temperature for 12 h. The excess of probe was removed by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G25 (Amersham Biosciences). In the cases of AcD and DDC, due to their low water solubility part of the probe goes out of solution at this concentration. These samples were centrifuged before the gel filtration chromatography. The samples treated with AMS were directly applied to the column. Unlabeled protein was separated by gel filtration chromatography in Superdex 75, as explained below. Before the second chromatography, the samples were dried by speed vacuum to promote the oxidation and dimerization of the unlabeled protein. When these samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, two bands corresponding to monomer and dimer were observed; only the band corresponding to the monomer was fluorescent under the UV light, indicating that the labeling reaction was specific. The specificity of the labeling was also confirmed using as negative control wild type apoLp-III, which contains no Cys residues. Under identical labeling conditions the wild type protein was not labeled. The samples were dissolved in 1.5 mguanidinium hydrochloride buffered with 25 mm potassium phosphate, and the dimers were separated from the monomers by fast protein liquid chromatography in a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column using the same buffer. The elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm as well as at the absorption maximum of the corresponding probe. The fractions containing the monomer were collected and dialyzed against 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The labeling efficiency (fraction of labeled protein) was determined from the concentration of protein, as determined by reaction with bicinchoninic acid (BCA kit, Pierce) and from the UV absorption spectra of the labeled protein using the absorption coefficients (23Haughland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996: 23Google Scholar) of the corresponding probes (AcD, ε386 = 19,200m−1 cm−1; AMS, ε328= 31,500 m−1 cm−1; DDC, ε334 = 8,300 m−1cm−1). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The labeling efficiencies obtained with each of Cys mutants and probes are indicated in Table I. The fraction of labeled protein obtained for a given probe was compared with the intensity of the emission spectra of the protein, obtained by direct excitation of the probe. This comparison showed a very good correlation of the data of the efficiency of labeling with the intensities of the emission spectra of the probes.Table ISpectral overlap integral J(λ) and Förster distances (Ro) for the energy transfer from tryptophan in helix 4 (Trp-113) to different acceptors in helices 1, 2, 3, and 5Mutant1-aApoLp-III mutants contain Cys residues at positions 16 (Cys-H1), 51 (Cys-H2), 83 (Cys-H3), or 147 (Cys-H5).

Open table in a new tab Discoidal lipoproteins were prepared by the method reported by Jonas et al. (35Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were mixed with DMPC and sodium cholate in a 1/260/715 molar ratio and then dialyzed exhaustively against 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. When indicated, the corresponding proteins were diluted with the Phe mutant. Analysis of the resulting lipoprotein complexes by gradient gel electrophoresis (24Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) indicated one predominant population of complexes with an apparent diameter of 20.7 nm (Fig. 2). Steady-state emission and excitation fluorescence spectra were recorded with an ISS K2 fluorescence spectrophotometer using 0.5-mm slits for excitation and emission (8-nm bandwidth). The light output of the lamp was recorded simultaneously with the emission spectrum by recording the intensity in a reference photomultiplier. Trp emission was recorded with excitation at both 280 and 285 nm and collected between 295 and 600 nm every 1 nm. Emission spectra of the acceptor-labeled proteins was recorded with excitation at both 280 nm and at the wavelength of the acceptor absorption maximum 340, 380, and 325 nm for DDC, AcD, and AMS, respectively. All spectra were corrected for the Raman peak of the solvent. The emission spectra of the lipoprotein samples were also corrected for the contribution of scattering using as the control lipoproteins prepared with the mutant containing no Trp residues. All measurements were carried out at 28 °C in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The experiments were performed in a 0.4-cm path length cell, and the absorbance of the samples was kept below 0.025. Donor quantum yields in the absence of acceptor (QD) were obtained from the fluorescence of unlabeled mutants using as reference a solution of tryptophan in water, Qd = 0.13, (25Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20356-20363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantum yield of the labeled samples were obtained in the same fashion but were also corrected to account for the labeling efficiency. The Förster distances (Ro in Å) were calculated using the following equation. Ro=0.211(κ2 n−4 QdJ )1/6.Equation 1 The spectral overlap integral, J (in units ofm−1cm−1nm4), was calculated from the absorption spectra of the acceptors and the normalized fluorescence spectra of the donor in the absence of acceptor. A κ2value of 0.67 was assumed for all the samples and conditions. The efficiency of energy transfer was calculated from the quantum yields of Trp fluorescence in the absence (QD) and in the presence (QDA) of acceptor according to Equation 2 below. D-A distances were estimated from the Ro values, and the efficiency of FRET was estimated from Equation 3 below.E=1−(QDA/QD)Equation 2 E=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)Equation 3 CD spectra were acquired at 28 °C in a Jasco CD spectrophotometer Model 715. The CD spectra of the same samples used in fluorescence experiments were determined in a 1-cm path length cell. Spectra were corrected using the buffer as blank and smoothed. Protein concentrations of the samples containing lipoproteins or lipid-free proteins were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the BCA kit (Pierce). The protein concentration of unlabeled and lipid-free apoLp-III samples was also determined by UV absorption spectroscopy in the presence of 2m guanidinium hydrochloride using an extinction coefficient of 5,790 m−1cm−1. The structure of apoLp-III in the lipoprotein lipid-bound state as well as the nature and magnitude of the conformational change that takes place when lipid-free apoLp-III binds to a lipid surface were investigated by FRET. Four single-Cys mutants were constructed using as basis the crystal structure of the lipid-free protein. All these mutants contain a single Trp residue (Trp-113), which is located in the nonpolar face and near the middle of helix 4. The Cys residues were located in the polar face of the helices 1 (Cys-H1 mutant), 2 (Cys-H2), 3 (Cys-H3), and 5 (Cys-H5). Fig. 1 shows the location of the Trp residue as well as the location of the Cys residues engineered in helices 1, 2, 3, and 5. The intermolecular distances between the Trp-113 and probes attached to the helices 1, 2, 3, or 4 were determined in both the lipid-free and the lipid-bound states. Although the distances in the lipid-free state are known from the crystallographic data, the estimation of these distances by FRET and the use of three different probes provided a mechanism to evaluate the reliability of the data and detect systematic errors in the estimates of the intermolecular distances. A potential influence of the mutations and/or the probes attached to the Cys residues on the secondary structure of the proteins was studied by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). All the mutants but one were highly α-helical in both the lipid-free and the lipid-bound states (Table I). The only exception was the Cys-H5 mutant labeled with AMS that showed a lower α-helical content in the folded lipid-free state. However, the CD spectrum of the AMS-labeled Cys-H5 mutant in the lipid-bound state was indistinguishable to the spectra of other mutants. Therefore, it was considered that the AMS-labeled Cys-H5 mutant could still provide useful information on the interhelical distances in the lipid-bound state, and consequently, it was included in the studies. All the mutants used were also characterized by their ability to interact with lipids. With no exceptions, all the proteins were active and able to spontaneously form discoidal lipoprotein particles when incubated with DMPC (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the acceptor probes, AcD, DDC, and AMS, covalently bound to the Cys-H5 mutant. For the sake of clarity and because no major differences were observed between the absorption spectra of the probes in the lipid-free and lipid-bound state of the proteins, only one absorption spectrum per probe is shown in Fig. 4. To illustrate the extent of the donor-acceptor spectral overlap in different conformational states, Fig. 4 includes the normalized tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of Cys-H5 in the lipid-free and lipid-bound states. Binding to lipid promotes a small red shift of the emission of Trp-113, from 317 to 323 nm. A similar red shift was observed and previously reported for the single Trp mutant containing no Cys (17Soulages J.L. Arrese E.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10574-10580Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The overlap-integral values (J) and Förster distances (Ro) for each donor/acceptor pair in different conformational states are given in Table I. In the lipid-free and lipid-bound proteins AMS has the largest Ro (mean Ro ∼ 31 Å), followed by AcD (mean Ro ∼ 26 Å) and DDC (mean Ro ∼ 22 Å). Minor differences are also found between the Ro values estimated for different mutants when the comparison is made between proteins in equivalent conformational states and labeled with the same probe (Table I). FRET efficiencies were calculated from the intensities of Trp emission with excitation at 280 nm as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5, top panel, shows the corrected fluorescence emission spectra of the folded and unlabeled lipid-free Cys-H1 mutant together with the spectra obtained with the folded lipid-free protein labeled with AcD, DDC, or AMS. The equivalent spectral data obtained with the Cys-H5 mutant is shown in Fig. 6, top panel. The FRET efficiencies observed in the folded lipid-free state for all the mutants are shown in Table II. As expected from the Ro values of the probes and the crystallographic distances, a high level of quenching of the Trp fluorescence by the three acceptor probes is observed for all Cys mutants. The donor/acceptor distances, which were calculated using these efficiency values and the individual Ro values for each D-A pair, are also shown in Table II. These distances are larger than the crystallographic distances of separation between the Trp residue (Trp-113) and the Cys residues (Table II). However, the difference between the estimated distance and the crystallographic distance could be simply attributed to the size and orientation of the probes. The distances of separation between Trp-113 and the Cys residues estimated with DDC are significantly shorter than those estimated with AcD or AMS (Table II). Even though the DDC-derived distances correspond very well to the crystallographic distances between the Trp residue and the Cys residues, they are likely to be underestimated. This is so because of the size of the probes, where longer separation distances are expected between D-A pairs than between the corresponding Trp-Cys pairs. The shorter D-A distances estimated with DDC could be due to the presence of a disulfide group in the proteins labeled with this probe. This disulfide bond, which links the probe to the Cys residue, could quench the Trp fluorescence by an extra mechanism (26Chen Y Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), leading to an overestimation of the actual FRET to the dansyl group. Overall and considering the potential effect of the size of the probes and the orientation factors, the three probes provided reasonable D-A distance estimates in the folded state of the protein.Figure 6Effect of the conformational state of the protein on the efficiency of Trp-FRET to three different probes located in helix-5.

Although SMDF has been shown to be a type II protein, the molecular determinants of membrane biogenesis, insertion, and topology remain elusive. Here we used heterologous expression of a yellow fluorescent protein-SMDF fusion protein along with a stepwise deletion strategy to show that the apolar/uncharged segment (Ile76-Val100) acts as an internal, uncleaved membrane insertion signal that defines the topology of the protein. Unexpectedly, removal of the transmembrane segment (TM) did not eliminate completely membrane association of C-terminal fragments. TM-deleted fusion proteins, bearing the amino acid segment (Ser283-Glu296) located downstream to the epidermal growth factor-like motif, strongly interacted with plasma membrane fractions. However, synthetic peptides patterned after this segment did not insert into artificial lipid vesicles, suggesting that membrane interaction of the SMDF C terminus may be the result of a post-translational modification. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated that the 40-kDa form, but not the 83-kDa form, of SMDF was segregated into lipid rafts. Deletion of the N-terminal TM did not affect the interaction of the protein with these lipid microdomains. In contrast, association with membrane rafts was abolished completely by truncation of the protein C terminus. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a topological model for SMDF in which the protein associates with the plasma membrane through both the TM and the C-terminal end domains resembling the topology of other type III neuregulins. The TM defines its characteristic type II membrane topology, whereas the C terminus is a newly recognized anchoring motif that determines its compartmentalization into lipid rafts.

NGR-1 isoforms have been classified according to the structure of their N-terminal region. Thus, type I and type II isoforms (which include acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity and glial growth factor II) contain an Ig-like domain, whereas type III presents a cysteine-rich domain (2Buonano A.

Mason T.B.A. Dietrich P. Mendelsohn M. Talmage D.A. Role L.W. Neuron. 2000; 25: 79-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The first type III NRG reported was SMDF, a neuregulin highly expressed in motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion neurons (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At variance with other type III NRGs, SMDF has a type β3 EGF-like motif and is characterized by the absence of a second TM segment downstream of the EGF-like domain. Amino acid sequence and hydropathy analysis does not reveal the presence of a true TM segment (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There is, however, an apolar/uncharged stretch of amino acids at the N-terminal domain that might act as a TM segment (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, SMDF has been proposed to be a group II membrane protein with a single TM segment that locates the N terminus to the cytosol, and exposes the EGF-like motif to the extracellular milieu (5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mitogenic activity of SMDF on neighboring cells may require the proteolytic release of the EGF-like motif, although the intact protein may also serve as a membrane-attached signal (5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.Y. Miller S.J. Falls D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2841-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, it has been reported that some members of the NRG-1 family are segregated into lipid rafts, membrane microdomains considered platforms for the selective delivery of proteins to specialized locations in neurons and epithelial cells (7Frenzel K.E. Falls D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this paper, we study the molecular determinants of SMDF topology. In addition, we investigate whether SMDF biogenesis involves compartmentalization in lipid rafts. The experimental approach uses an YFP-SMDF fusion protein that had the fluorescent protein fused to the N terminus of the NRG. We show that the apolar/uncharged region located at the N-terminal domain of the protein acts as an uncleaved, internal membrane insertion signal sequence, and report that the protein is additionally anchored to the plasma membrane through its C terminus, probably by an acylation-like post-translational modification. We also report that SMDF partitions into lipid rafts. Interestingly, only the 40 kDa form of SMDF was detected in rafts domains. Removal of the TM did not alter partitioning of the protein into membrane rafts. In contrast, segregation into these lipid microdomains was prevented by deletion of the C-terminal anchoring site. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a membrane topology model for this protein which resembles that proposed for other members of the type III NRG-1 gene subfamily, namely the protein is anchored to the cell membrane through two sites. Human dorsal root ganglion (Normal-NCI CGAP PNS1) cDNA library, primers, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, Optiprep, and pcDNA3.1 were obtained from Invitrogen. Pfu turbo DNA polymerase and BL21 codon plus Escherichia coli strain were from Stratagene. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine clone PT-66, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C were obtained from Sigma. pEYFP-C1 and the anti-GFP antibody (Living Colors Aequorea victoria peptide antibody) were from CLONTECH. Streptavidin Alexa 546 was from Molecular Probes. Anti-HRGβ3 antibody was from Santa Cruz. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG was from Vector Laboratories. ECL Plus was fromAmersham Biosciences. SMDF-encoding cDNA was amplified from a human DRG library by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase and the EcoRI restriction site containing primers 5SMDF: CCT TGG AAT TCG ACG ATT TAT and 3SMDF: GTT AAT GTT CGA ATT CGA CAG GC. The amplified fragment was gel purified, EcoRI digested, and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid. Direct and inverse oriented sequences were selected by restriction analysis and verified by automatic sequencing. To clone SMDF into the pEYFP-C1 plasmid, PCR amplification was performed using as template pcDNA-SMDF with the 5′-EcoRI restriction site containing primer 5.4SMDF: CAG GCC GAA TTC TGG AGG TGA GCC G and the 3′-SalI restriction site containing primer 3.1SMDF: GAT GCA GCA AGT CGA CAG CAG CAC C. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned directionally into the pEYFP-C1 plasmid. For the cloning in pGEX-4T1 a similar procedure was used, except the 5′-EcoRI restriction site containing primer 5.2SMDF: GCC TTC TTC TGA ATT CGA GCC GAT G was used. To obtain the pEYFP-SMDFΔ108–296 construct, pEYFP-SMDF was truncated at the BglII site. A similar strategy, but using the EspI site, was used to produce pEYFP-SMDFΔ1–64 and pEYFP-SMDFΔ65–296. All other deletions were obtained by one-step inverse PCR with the proofreading Pfu turbo DNA polymerase and two restriction digestions. Briefly, externally oriented primers with PAC1 unique restriction sites were used to amplify the whole construct except the region to be deleted. PCR products were digested (in the amplification buffer) with 20 units of DpnI for 2 h at 37 °C to remove the methylated plasmid templates, subsequently purified, and digested with PAC1. Purified digestions were re-ligated, transformed in DH5α, and selected for kanamycin resistance. More than 95% of the colonies contained the designed deletions as verified by restriction digestion and automatic sequencing. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated on 2-cm2 wells at 250,000 cells/well. 20 h later, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000, following the manufacturer's recommendations. To prepare conditioned mediums, cells were serum starved 24 h post-transfection, and the medium was collected 48–72 later. MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Crude plasma membranes were essentially prepared as described by Schroering and Carey (5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with buffer A (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 6,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min to prepare low speed pellet (Pi, containing the plasma membranes) and supernatants (S), which contain the soluble proteins and the remaining membranes. Low speed pellets (Pi) were washed in buffer B (buffer A + 1 mNaCl), incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged, and washed with buffer A for desalting. In some experiments, pellets were washed with 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 12. Final pellets (P) and supernatants (S), prepared from equivalent amounts of cells, were mixed with β-mercaptoethanol containing SDS sample buffer, heated, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 10% fat-free skim milk in TBS and incubated with the anti-GFP antibody or the anti-HRGβ3 polyclonal antibody in blocking buffer (1:2,000) for 1 h. Membranes were washed with TBS-Tween (0.3%), incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and developed with the ECL Plus system. SMDF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB receptors was carried out as described by Ho et al. (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were grown until ≥80% confluence in 24-well plates. Thereafter, cells were serum starved for 2 h and incubated with serum-free, conditioned medium or recombinant SMDF for 15 min at room temperature as indicated. The medium was removed, and cells were harvested with 100 μl of β-mercaptoethanol containing SDS sample buffer. Whole cell extracts were heat denatured, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1,000). Cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips at 50–200 × 103 cells/well and transfected as indicated previously. The medium was removed, and cells were washed three times for 5 min using PBS with 10% fetal bovine serum (PBS/FBS) at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were incubated with anti-HRGβ3 (1:200) in PBS/FBS at room temperature for 20 min, washed with PBS/FBS three times for 8 min, and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) in PBS/FBS at room temperature for 20 min. Washes were repeated, and cells were incubated with streptavidin Alexa 546 (1:200) in PBS/FBS, washed in the same conditions, and prepared for in vivo fluorescence microscopy in a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a 20× objective. For confocal microscopy studies, cells were transfected, washed with PBS, and observed in vivo with a confocal microscope Olympus Fluoview 300 using a 478 nm argon laser. SMDF-encoding cDNA was cloned in pGEX-4T-1 and transformed in the BL21 codon plus strain. Bacterial cells were grown at 28 °C until reaching 0.6–0.8 A (600 nm). Thereafter, cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.3 mm for 4 h and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and 5 mm dithiothreitol and sonicated. Triton-X100 was added to reach 1% and centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 10 min. GST-SMDF was purified from the supernatant with GSH-agarose beads. After extensive washing, GST-SMDF was eluted from the beads with 10 mm GSH in 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. Protein concentration was calculated with the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar). Analysis of detergent-insoluble complexes in flotation gradients was performed following standard protocols (7Frenzel K.E. Falls D.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Mañes S. Mira E. Gómez-Moutón C. Lacalle R.A. Séller P. Labrador J.P. Martı́nez-A C.

A. 1999; 96: 3734-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 2.5 × 106 transiently transfected cells were cooled on ice, washed with PBS, and scraped off in buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4), passed 10 times through a 29-gauge needle, extracted at 4 °C for 30 min, and brought to 35% Optiprep. One ml of the extract was sequentially overlaid with 8 ml of 30% Optiprep in 0.5× buffer C and 400 μl of buffer C in an SW41 tube. After centrifugation (178,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h), 10 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient; 200 μl of each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, pH-neutralized, and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-HRGβ3 and anti-GFP antibodies. For differential scanning calorimetry large multilamellar vesicles made from synthetic dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or DMPC plus cholesterol at 10% molar percentage were used. Dried lipids films obtained from chloroform solutions were suspended in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmHepes pH 7.4 to give a final concentration of 1 mm in terms of lipid phosphorus. The resuspended lipids were kept for 90 min above their phase transition temperatures and vortexed. The resulting liposomes were stored overnight at 4 °C to assure a complete hydration of the sample prior to the differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Thermograms were recorded on a high resolution Microcal MC-2 differential scanning microcalorimeter, equipped with a DA-2 digital interface and data collection, as described (14Encinar J.A. Fernández A.M. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Lipid dispersions containing the peptides at different molar ratios, and the corresponding buffer in the reference cell were thermally equilibrated in the microcalorimeter, at ≈10 °C for 45 min, before heat was applied. Differences in the heat capacity between the sample and the reference cell were obtained by raising the temperature at a constant rate of 45 °C/h. Transition temperatures and enthalpies were calculated by fitting the observed transitions to a single van't Hoff component. To gain insights into SMDF membrane insertion, topology, and localization, we designed a YFP-SMDF fusion protein by cloning the YFP at the N terminus of the neuregulin. For this purpose, the SMDF cDNA was amplified from a human DRG cDNA library and cloned into the pEYFP-C1 vector. The subcelullar location and functional activity of both SMDF and YFP-SMDF were compared upon their transient heterologous expression in COS-7 cells. Immunocytochemical studies using the antibody anti-HGRβ3, raised against the C terminus of the neuregulin, show that both SMDF and YFP-SMDF were highly expressed in the cell surface, as depicted by the labeling of nonpermeabilized COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 A, a and e). A pattern of green fluorescence was present in YFP-SMDF- and YFP-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, b and d). As expected, anti-HGR-β3 immunoreactivity was absent in YFP-expressing cells (Fig. 1 Ac). These results suggest that YFP-SMDF is highly expressed in COS-7 cells and that a fraction of this protein is located in the plasma membrane, with the ectodomain exposed on the cell surface. SMDF is released into the extracellular medium, presumably by proteolytic processing (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Membrane release of neuregulins is an important step for their functional activity because it may be required for the efficient interaction with their receptors in target cells (1Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar,2Buonano A. Fisbach G.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated whether the YFP-SMDF fusion protein was properly processed and released to the extracellular milieu. Immunoblot analysis of culture media from SMDF- and YFP-SMDF-transfected cells disclosed a diffuse, faint band of ≈50 KDa which was recognized by the anti-HRGβ3 antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). Notice that the molecular mass of this band is smaller than the major, 83-kDa SMDF immunoreactive form observed in cellular lysates (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Because the antibody recognized the C terminus, these observations indicate that the 50 kDa band corresponds to the C-terminal ectodomain of the neuregulin which contains the EGF-like motif. Thus, the presence of the YFP protein at the N terminus did not affect the proteolytic processing of the neuregulin. We next evaluated the functional activity of both SMDF and YFP-SMDF. For this purpose, we used the epithelial cell line MCF-7, which expresses ErbB receptors (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Osheroff P.L. Tsai S.P. Chiang N.Y. King K.L., Li, R. Lewis G.D. Wong K. Henzel W. Mather J. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Functional activity of the neuregulin was determined as the extent of ErbB tyrosine autophosphorylation induced by conditioned media obtained from COS-7 cells cultures expressing either SMDF or YFP-SMDF. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, both types of conditioned medium stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 185-kDa protein in MCF-7 cells. This band corresponds to the ErbB receptors (4Ho W.H. Armanini M.P. Nuijens A. Philips H.S. Osheroff P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The extent of receptor phosphorylation decreased as a function of the dilution factor of the conditioned media from both SMDF- and YFP-SMDF-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C). This functional activity was specific because it was not detected in conditioned media from cells transfected with pEYFP-C1 or an inverted SMDF construct, but it was observed when purified recombinant GST-SMDF was used (Fig. 1 C). At variance with other neuregulins (16Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), receptor-induced phosphorylation by both SMDF and YFP-SMDF ectodomains was reversible, as evidenced by the decline of ErbB phosphorylation 2 h after removal of conditioned media (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the YFP-SMDF fusion protein reproduces all properties of the wild type III β3 neuregulin. SMDF has been proposed to belong to the group II of membrane proteins, having the N terminus facing the cytosol and the C terminus extracellularly exposed (5Schroering A. Carey J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30643-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants of this topology are still elusive. We addressed this question by evaluating the subcellular location of stepwise deletion mutants carried out on the YFP-SMDF fusion protein (Fig. 2). Because all truncations were carried out on the YFP-SMDF, we will refer to the truncated proteins as the segment deleted, indicating the first and last amino acids removed. First, we questioned the role of the potential TM domain located in the N terminus segment Ile76-Val100. For this task, we designed two truncated proteins, namely Δ65–296 and Δ108–296, which lack all of the C-terminal ectodomain from residue Glu65 and Ser108, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 3, confocal microscopy images show that deletion mutant Δ108–296 (Fig. 3 b) exhibited a cell surface labeling pattern identical to that of YFP-SMDF (Fig. 3 a). Similar results were obtained with the deletion mutant Δ1–64, where the N-terminal domain was deleted up to residue Ala64. In contrast, the N-terminal Δ65–296 and the C-terminal Δ1–101 fragments displayed a distribution of fluorescence similar to that of YFP protein. Thus, removal of the amino acid stretch Ile76-Val100 disrupts the insertion of the protein in the plasma membrane. This finding was substantiated further by biochemical and immunological analysis of subcellular fractions derived from YFP-SMDF full-length and deletion mutants transfected in COS-7 cells. Cell cultures were harvested, lysed, and enriched plasma membrane fractions were pelleted by centrifugation. To prevent contamination with peripheral proteins, plasma membrane fractions were washed with 1.0 m NaCl and/or with pH 12. Under these conditions, YFP was found in the supernatant fraction (Fig 4, P1 and S1), whereas YPF-SMDF was encountered mainly in the pelleted membrane fraction (Fig. 4, P2 and S2), consistent with its location in the cell surface. The Δ108–296 truncated protein was also largely associated with low speed pellet fractions (Fig. 4, P3 and S3). In contrast, deletion mutant Δ65–296 was only detected in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4, P4 and S4), similar to free YFP. Unexpectedly, Δ101–296, which lacks the TM segment, was found primarily in the plasma membrane-enriched fractions (Fig. 4, P5 and S5), suggesting the presence in this protein of a plasma membrane anchoring domain. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the internal hydrophobic sequence is an uncleaved, membrane insertion signal sequence and suggest the existence of an additional, previously unrecognized membrane anchoring site in the ectodomain of SMDF. Amino acid sequence and hydropathy analysis of the protein domain downstream of the TM segment did not reveal the presence of additional hydrophobic stretches that may explain the ability of C-terminal fragments to associate with membrane fractions. Accordingly, to identify this protein domain we designed additional YFP-SMDF truncated proteins that explore the role of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). Deletion mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their subcellular location was investigated with biochemical and immunological methods. As illustrated in Fig. 5, deletion up to Ala282 at the end of the EGF-like motif did not eliminate completely membrane interaction of the truncated proteins, as evidenced by the significant presence of the C-terminal fragments Δ5–142, Δ5–214, and Δ5–282 in the plasma membrane-enriched fractions (P1, S1, P2, S2, P3, and S3). This observation suggests that the C-terminal stretch (Ser283-Glu296) is able to anchor a significant portion of the YFP to cellular membranes. In support of this notion, the double truncated fusion protein Δ1–101/Δ274–296, where the TM and the C terminus have been deleted, was not found in the membrane fractions (Fig. 5, P4 and S4). As for Δ5–282, all other truncated proteins containing the segment Ser283-Glu296(Fig. 2) were detected mainly in the pellet fraction. It is interesting to note that immunocytochemical studies on intact cells using the anti-HRGβ3 antibody did not show cell surface expression of the C-terminal fragments (data not shown), indicating an intracellular location of the SMDF ectodomain. This distribution is consistent with confocal fluorescence images, showing a wide cellular distribution pattern (Fig. 3 e). Collectively, these observations imply that the C terminus of SMDF also functions as a membrane anchoring domain and indicate that the group II topology of the protein is determined by the TM located in the N terminus of the protein. The amino acid composition and sequence of the segment Ser283-Glu296 (SFYSTSTPFLSLPE) is rather polar, containing few hydrophobic residues. To evaluate whether this sequence was able to associate with membranes, we studied the interaction of the synthetic peptides WSFYSTSTPFLSLPE and SFYSTSTPWLSLPE with artificial lipid vesicles. Tryptophan residues were included in the sequence to provide intrinsic fluorescence properties to these amino acid sequences. Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements show that both peptides interact marginally with lipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (data not shown). Similarly, the thermotropic properties of lipid vesicles made of DMPC and DMPC/cholesterol were not changed significantly by the presence of the synthetic peptides (Fig. 6). Thus, peptides patterned after th"
