https://openalex.org/W1977409936,"The single-crystal elastic moduli of the modified spinel structure (beta phase) of magnesium orthosilicate (Mg(2)SiO(4)) have been measured by Brillouin spectroscopy under ambient conditions. Single crystals with dimensions up to 500 micrometers were grown at 22 gigapascals and 2000 degrees C over a period of 1 hour. Growth of crystals larger than 100 micrometers was achieved only when the pressure was within 5 percent of the pressure of the phase boundary separating the beta- and gamma-phase stability fields. A comparison of the elastic properties of the modified spinel phase with those of the olivine phase suggests that the 400-kilometer seismic discontinuity in the earth's mantle can be described by a mantle with 40 percent olivine. These results confirm that the 400-kilometer discontinuity can be due to the transition from olivine to modified spinel. The amount of olivine that must be present is less than that in a pyrolite model, although the results do not exclude pyrolite as a possible mantle model."
https://openalex.org/W2055651454,"Single-domain magnetite crystals have been isolated and characterized from tissue located in a sinus within the dermethmoid bone of the skull of the yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares. Their chemical composition, narrow size distribution, and distinctive crystal morphology indicate that these crystals are biochemical precipitates. Experiments on the interaction between particles reveal the organization of the particles in situ and suggest a possible form for candidate magnetoreceptor organelles. The consistent localization of such particles with similar arrangement within the dermethmoids of this and other pelagic fishes suggests that the ethmoid region is a possible location for a vertebrate magnetic sense organ."
https://openalex.org/W2051556717,"Sharp single peaks in the fundamental and first-overtone bands of the O-H stretching vibration in pure Mg(2)+ and Fe(2)+ amphiboles split into a maximum of four sharp peaks, corresponding to hydroxyl groups linked to 3 Fe, 2 Fe + Mg, 2 Mg + Fe, and 3 Mg, in mixed Fe(2)+-Mg(2)+ amphiboles. Within any one solid-solution series, the frequencies of these peaks can be correlated with the electronegativity of ions in the M(l) and M(3) positions, and differences between series can be correlated with the size of ions in the M(4) position. The O-H vector lies approximately normal to z in the (010) plane. The distribution of Fe(2)+ and Mg(2)+ ions between the (M(1),M(3)) and (M(2)M(4)) positions in the cummingtonite-grunerite series, and between the (M(1),M(3)) and M(2) positions in the tremolite-ferroactinolite series, has also been estimated."

https://openalex.org/W2069799544,"Geologic and radiometric-age data indicate that El Chichón was frequently and violently active during the Holocene, including eruptive episodes about 600, 1250, and 1700 years ago and several undated, older eruptions. These episodes, involving explosive eruptions of sulfur-rich magma and associated dome-growth processes, were apparently separated by intervals of approximately 350 to 650 years. Some of El Chichón's eruptions may correlate with unusual atmospheric phenomena around A.D. 1300 and possibly A.D. 623."

The abundance patterns of these elements form groups coinciding closely with groupings based on other evidence, and a fractional crystallization mechanism for change in rare earth abundance is implied."
https://openalex.org/W2016618429,"That more and larger stones were transported over a much longer time span in the Old than in the New World is obvious. The earlier arrival of the peoples of the Old World at the level of cultural development generally termed ""civilization,"" accompanied as it was by a superior technology (95), goes far to account for this fact. Similarities, even identities, in techniques employed in transporting heavy stones (for example, sledge, ramps) or beliefs about stones (for example, that stones can will themelves to move or remain fixed) are taken to be fortuitous and independent convergences of the same genre as those cultural parallels recently pointed out by Caso (96) and Rowe (97)."

https://openalex.org/W2093767090,"A general introduction to current organic photochemical research is presented. A limited survey of typical organic photochemical reactions, with an emphasis on recent studies, is given. Reactions of the n-pi* and pi-pi* type are included. Some new thoughts are included; among these is the relation of Möbius strip geometry to organic photochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2004964693,"Magnesium ion in standard I.A.P.O. sea water was measured with a magnesium-sensitive electrode. The results, presented either as magnesiumion activity (0.017) or as the amount of ionized magnesium (0.048M or about 90 percent of the total magnesium), agree well with the data from the chemical model for sea water proprosed by Garrels and Thompson."
https://openalex.org/W2068013915,"Use of the term ""water potential"" in place of ""diffusion pressure deficit"" would improve communication between botanists and scientists in other fields because the concept of potential is familiar to most scientists. Water potential, expressed as PsiW, is the difference in free energy or chemical potential per unit molal volume between pure water and water in cells at the same temperature. The potential of pure water is set at zero; hence the potential of water in cells and solutions is less than zero, or negative. The water potential of a cell is numerically equal to its diffusion pressure deficit, but has a negative sign."
https://openalex.org/W2017788303,"Although Saturn's rings are within the Roche zone, the accretion of centimeter-sized particles into large aggregates many meters in diameter occurs readily, on a time scale of weeks. These aggregates are disrupted when tidal stresses exceed their very low strengths; thus most of the mass of the ring system is continually processed through a population of large ""dynamic ephemeral bodies,"" which are continually forming and disintegrating. These large aggregates are not at all like the idealized ice spheres often used in modeling Saturn's ring dynamics. Their coefficient of restitution is low, hence they form a monolayer in the ring plane. The optically observable characteristics of the rings are dominated by the swarm of centimeter-sized particles."

https://openalex.org/W2065096622,"Television and photofacsimile constructed infrared pictures taken by the Nimbus I meteorological satellite between 28 August and 22 September 1964 were analyzed for indications of the pack-ice boundary around Antarctica. Mean ice boundaries were established around the entire continent from both TV and infrared pictures, from which were estimated pack-ice areas of 19.81 by 10(6) and16.78 by 10(6) square kilometers, respectively; the difference is attributed to difference in subjective discernment of a boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2027657236,"Scattered light produces spurious optical rotations of up to 80 milli degrees in commercial polarimeters. Even larger ""rotations,"" up to 180 milli-degrees, are observed when the sample simultaneously absorbs and scatters light.These effects may account for the optical activity reported in the Orgueil meteorite."

When the meteorites contain both kamacite and taenite, the kamacite dissolves preferentially, revealing a three-dimensional Widmanstätten pattern."

https://openalex.org/W1983430689,"Soap bubbles (also films on wire frames) have been solidified at low temperatures. At~-30 degrees C the bubbles still behave normally, that is, they can be expanded by blowing air into them and contract when the air is let out. At ~ -80 degrees C they become glassy, have very little surface tension, and cannot be blown up any more. At ~-120 degrees C they become completely solid. No further change is observed by cooling them to 90 degrees or 77 degrees K."
