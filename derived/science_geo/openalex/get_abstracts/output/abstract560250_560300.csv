Immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) expression is induced by inflammatory stimuli, and its enzyme product cis-aconitate decarboxylase catalyzes the production of itaconate from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here we identify an immunometabolic regulatory pathway that links Irg1 and itaconate production to the succinate accumulation that occurs in the context of innate immune responses. Itaconate levels and Irg1 expression correlate strongly with succinate during LPS exposure in macrophages and non-immune cells. We demonstrate that itaconate acts as an endogenous succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor to cause succinate accumulation. Loss of itaconate production in activated macrophages from Irg1−/− mice decreases the accumulation of succinate in response to LPS exposure. This metabolic network links the innate immune response and tricarboxylic acid metabolism to function of the electron transport chain.

Immune cells must sense cues from the extracellular microenvironment and respond rapidly to protect against bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens (1.Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8722) Google Scholar). An emerging hallmark of inflammation and the innate immune system of cells is metabolic reprogramming (2.Kelly B. O'Neill L.A. Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells in innate immunity.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). One of the most general metabolic changes that occurs under proinflammatory conditions is a biochemical switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (3.Krawczyk C.M. Holowka T. Sun J.

Although it is known that macrophages undergo drastic metabolic reprogramming upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, the underlying mechanisms driving this response are not completely understood. hypoxia-inducible factor tricarboxylic acid cis-aconitate decarboxylase succinate dehydrogenase bone marrow-derived macrophage 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-acetamide N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide oxygen consumption rate. Increased succinate levels in macrophages are important mediators of the inflammatory response, linking metabolism to innate immunity. In addition to its role in TCA metabolism, succinate acts as a regulatory signal enhancing Il-1β expression through stabilization of HIF-1α, which, in turn, influences the function of various other metabolic pathways (9.Tannahill G.M.

Various mechanisms have been proposed as the cause of succinate accumulation, including increased glutamine anaplerosis and oxidation in the TCA cycle or increased flux through the GABA shunt (9.Tannahill G.M.

However, the specific driver(s) of this phenomenon has/have not yet been identified. Given the central role of succinate as a metabolic signal in inflammation, elucidation of the metabolic pathway(s) involved in succinate accumulation and its/their regulation may provide new avenues for controlling this process. Metabolites are important functional triggers that can regulate the activity of enzymes via substrate/product inhibition, posttranslational modifications, or allosteric interactions (15.Wegner A. Meiser J. Weindl D. Hiller K. How metabolites modulate metabolic flux.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Beyond their direct roles as substrates and products, metabolites often serve as substrates for posttranslational modifications, as shown for succinate to succinylate proteins (9.Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J. Kelly B. Foley N.H. Zheng L. Gardet A. Tong Z. Jany S.S.

Recently, synthesis of the antimicrobial metabolite itaconate was identified in mammalian immune cells as being selectively up-regulated under proinflammatory conditions (19.Strelko C.L. Lu W. Dufort F.J. Seyfried T.N. Chiles T.C. Rabinowitz J.D. Roberts M.F. Itaconic acid is a mammalian metabolite induced during macrophage activation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 16386-16389Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Itaconate exhibits an antibiotic function (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) via inhibition of isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt needed by many bacteria to survive during infection (21.Patel T.R.

Itaconate, an isocitrate lyase-directed inhibitor in Pseudomonas indigofera.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 136-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, itaconate is produced through the decarboxylation of the TCA cycle intermediate cis-aconitate, which is catalyzed by mammalian cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD, also known as immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) protein) encoded by immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) (20.Michelucci A.

Itaconate production represents one of two characteristic TCA cycle “break points” discovered in classically activated immune cells (24.O'Neill L.A. A broken Krebs cycle in macrophages.Immunity. 2015; 42: 393-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25.Jha A.K. Huang S.C. Sergushichev A. Lampropoulou V. Ivanova Y.

Network integration of parallel metabolic and transcriptional data reveals metabolic modules that regulate macrophage polarization.Immunity. 2015; 42: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The first break occurs at isocitrate dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of citrate, the precursor for itaconate, and the second break occurs at succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which may allow for succinate accumulation. Although itaconate has been shown previously to inhibit SDH ex vivo (26.Booth A.N. Taylor J. Wilson R.H. Deeds F. The inhibitory effects of itaconic acid in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Ackermann W.W. Potter V.R. Enzyme inhibition in relation to chemotherapy.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Studies on succinate dehydrogenase: I: spectral properties of the purified enzyme and formation of enzyme-competitive inhibitor complexes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 92: 233-247PubMed Google Scholar), and LPS-activated murine macrophages produced up to 8 mm intracellular itaconate (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), a potential role of endogenously produced itaconate in succinate accumulation under inflammatory conditions has not yet been addressed and is unknown. To elucidate the role of itaconate in reprogramming immune cell metabolism, we modulated intracellular itaconate levels in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), a macrophage cell line, as well as a lung adenocarcinoma cell line. In all cell models we observed metabolic changes reminiscent of SDH inhibition, including succinate accumulation. By measuring substrate-specific mitochondrial respiration, we demonstrated the inhibition of SDH by itaconate in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, stimulated BMDMs from Irg1 KO mice failed to produce itaconate and exhibited decreased succinate accumulation compared with BMDMs from WT mice. Based on these studies, we have elucidated an Irg1-induced immunomodulatory pathway in macrophages whereby its product, itaconate, acts as an endogenously produced metabolic regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. RAW 264.7 macrophages (29.Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Functional macrophage cell lines transformed by Abelson leukemia virus.Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (ATCC, TIB-71) and A549 cells (30.Giard D.J. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Arnstein P. Kersey J.H. Dosik H. Parks W.P. In vitro cultivation of human tumors: establishment of cell lines derived from a series of solid tumors.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) (ATCC, CCL-185) were maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units·ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin, 25 mm glucose, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Purified Escherichia coli LPS was used for the activation of RAW 264.7 macrophages and BMDMs at a concentration of 10 ng·ml−1. A549 and RAW 264.7 cells and BMDMs were exposed to increasing itaconate concentrations (5, 10, and 25 mm) for 6 h. For isotopic labeling experiments, RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 4 mm [1-13C]glutamine (Cambridge Isotopes Inc.) and 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS for 24 h prior to addition of LPS for 6 h. For isotope tracing with exposure to unlabeled itaconate, RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to labeled [U-13C6]glucose and [U-13C5]glutamine tracers over a period of three subcultures and then exposed further for 6 and 24 h to 10 mm unlabeled itaconate. BMDM collection was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and was conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US National Research Council, 2010). BMDMs were isolated from femora and tibiae of C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Bones were collected in ice-cold PBS, cleaned of muscle, and flushed with 5 ml BMDM growth medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units·ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin, 25 mm glucose, 4 mm l-glutamine, 20 ng·ml−1 recombinant-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (eBioscience), and 3.4 μl·l−1 β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells on Petri dishes in 10 ml of growth medium. 5 ml of fresh growth medium was added on day 3. On day 6, BMDMs were collected and replated into 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in growth medium containing 2 ng·ml−1 recombinant-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Metabolites were extracted on day 7. For Irg1 KO versus WT BMDM experiments, all animal procedures, such as handling and euthanasia, were performed according to the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations guidelines for the use of animals in research. The Irg1 KO mice were generated by Dr. Haruhiko Koseki at the RIKEN Institute using stem cells purchased from the Knockout Mouse Project Repository under strain ID Irg1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg·kg−1 of ketamine hydrochloride and 5 mg·kg−1 xylazine hydrochloride, and bone marrow was isolated and cultured as described previously (31.Zhang X. Goncalves R. Mosser D.M. The isolation and characterization of murine macrophages.Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2008; (Chapter 14, Unit 14.1)Crossref Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from femora and tibiae of Irg1 KO and age-matched C57BL/6 WT mice, and the resultant cell suspension was passed through a 70-μm filter (Greiner Bio-One). After 10 min of centrifuging at 250 × g, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of hypotonic solution (170 mm NH4Cl) for 5 min to allow lysis of any remaining extracellular red blood cells. Bone marrow-derived cells were plated in 12-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) at 5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were cultured for 6 days at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 VLE (Very Low Endotoxin) (Biochrom FG 1415) supplemented with 10% FBS and 20% conditioned medium from macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting L929 fibroblasts. After 6 days in culture, the BMDMs were used for experiments. Metabolite levels of itaconate and TCA cycle intermediates were quantified using external standard curves (three biological replicates). For metabolite standard curves, increasing standard solutions were extracted under the conditions of sample preparation. Using the depicted standard curve, the metabolite quantity in each cell extract was calculated, taking into account cellular diameter (d, micrometers) of detached cells and cell number. We assumed a spherical shape and calculated the intracellular metabolite concentration using the following equation: [metabolite] = metabolite quantity (moles)/(((4/3000) π (d/2)3) cell number). Cell number and cell diameter were determined using a Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen). Irg1 gain-of function experiments in A549 cells were performed as described previously (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A. Buttini M. Linster C.L. Medina E. Balling R. Hiller K. Immune-responsive gene 1 protein links metabolism to immunity by catalyzing itaconic acid production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were transfected with the pCMV6-Irg1 (OriGene) overexpressing plasmid or empty plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and further incubated for 24 h. Total RNA was purified from cultured cells using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) with 1 μl (50 μm)/reaction oligo(dT)20 as primer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Individual 20-μl SYBR Green real-time PCR reactions consisted of 2 μl of diluted cDNA, 10 μl of fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 0.5 μl of each 10 μm forward and reverse primers. For standardization of quantification, L27 was amplified simultaneously. PCR was carried out in 96-well plates on an Applied Biosystems ViiaTM 7 real-time PCR system using the following program: 95 °C for 20 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s (Irg1, GCAACATGATGCTCAAGTCTG (forward) and TGCTCCTCCGAATGATACCA (reverse); L27, ACATTGACGATGGCACCTC (forward) and GCTTGGCGATCTTCTTCTTG (reverse)). Respiration was measured in adherent monolayers of RAW 264.7 macrophages or BMDMs using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer. RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well (for assays with permeabilized cells) and 4 × 104 cells/well (for assays with intact cells) and BMDMs at 5 × 104 cells/well 24 h before measurement. Intact cells were assayed in DMEM (Sigma, 5030) supplemented with 8 mm glucose, 3 mm glutamine, 3 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm HEPES. Cells were permeabilized with 3 nm perfringolysin O (commercially, XF PMP (XF Plasma Membrane Permeabilizer)) as described previously (32.Divakaruni A.S. Rogers G.W. Murphy A.N. Measuring mitochondrial function in permeabilized cells using the Seahorse XF analyzer or a Clark-type oxygen electrode.Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2014; 60: 25.2.1-25.2.16Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Phosphorylating (state 3), succinate-driven respiration in permeabilized cells was measured in cells offered 4 mm ADP, 2 μm rotenone, two different succinate concentrations (2.5 and 10 mm), and increasing itaconate concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 25 mm). When measuring respiration on different respiratory substrates, permeabilized cells were offered succinate (10 mm)/rotenone (2 μm), glutamate/malate (each 10 mm), pyruvate/malate (each 10 mm), or ascorbate (10 mm) plus N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) (100 μm) and antimycin A (1 μm). Maximal respiration was calculated as the difference between protonophore-stimulated respiration (600 nm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) and nonmitochondrial respiration (measured after addition of 1 μm antimycin A). All data are mean ± S.E. of two or three repeated experiments (with a minimum of five biological replicates per experiment) as indicated in the text. For assays with BMDMs, cells were obtained from three different mice. Polar metabolites were extracted using methanol/water/chloroform as described previously (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A. Buttini M. Linster C.L. Medina E. Balling R. Hiller K.

For medium metabolites, medium was centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 300 × g. 10 μl of supernatant was added to 80 μl of a −20 °C 8:1 methanol/water mixture, mixed for 10 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 80 μl was collected and evaporated under a vacuum at −4 °C. Metabolite derivatization was performed using a Gerstel MPS. Dried polar metabolites were dissolved in 15 μl of 2% (w/v) methoxyamine hydrochloride (Thermo Scientific) in pyridine and incubated for 60 min at 45 °C. An equal volume of 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-acetamide (MSTFA) or N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) with 1% tert-butyl dimethylchlorosilane (Regis Technologies) was added and incubated further for 30 min at 45 °C. After derivatization, MSTFA-derivatized samples were analyzed as described previously (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A. Buttini M. Linster C.L. Medina E. Balling R. Hiller K. Immune-responsive gene 1 protein links metabolism to immunity by catalyzing itaconic acid production.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 7820-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Briefly, derivatized samples were analyzed by GC-MS using a DB-35MS column (30 × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm, Agilent J&W Scientific) installed in an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer. For MTBSTFA-derivatized samples, the GC oven was held at 100 °C for 1 min, increased to 255 °C at 3.5 °C min−1, increased to 320 °C at 15 °C min−1, and held at 320 °C for 3 min. The total run time for one sample was 54.62 min. For Irg1 KO versus WT BMDM metabolite measurements, the GC oven was held at 100 °C for 2 min, increased to 300 °C at 10 °C min−1, and held at 325 °C for 3 min. The total run time for one sample was 26 min. MSTFA-derivatized metabolites were determined using the following quantification ions: itaconate (m/z 259) and succinate (m/z 247). Metabolite levels and mass isotopomer distributions of MTBSTFA-derivatized samples were analyzed by integrating metabolite fragment ions (itaconate, m/z 301–310; succinate, m/z 289–294; citrate, m/z 459–469; α-ketoglutarate, m/z 346–355; malate, m/z 419–428; and fumarate, m/z 287–292) and corrected for natural abundance using in-house algorithms.

To better understand the relationship between Irg1-mediated itaconate production and the reprogramming of TCA metabolism under LPS-stimulated conditions, we quantified the dynamics of itaconate and TCA intermediate abundances in RAW 264.7 macrophages over time. To elicit an immune response, we exposed RAW 264.7 macrophages to 10 ng·ml−1 LPS for 6 h, conditions that induce high expression of Irg1 encoding CAD, the enzyme catalyzing itaconate production from cis-aconitate (20.Michelucci A.

Intriguingly, the levels of itaconate and succinate exhibited similar trends upon activation, in contrast to the dynamics of citrate, α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate (Fig. 1a), suggesting that itaconate and succinate (or the enzymes metabolizing them) are regulated in a coordinated manner. Notably, basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) remained unchanged compared with resting macrophages (Fig. 1b). To determine whether itaconate directly contributes to succinate accumulation, we next supplemented the growth medium of resting and LPS-activated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages with increasing itaconate concentrations for 6 h and observed how intracellular itaconate levels correlated with those of various TCA cycle intermediates (Figs. 2, a–f). LPS-activated murine macrophages can produce up to 8 mm intracellular itaconate (20.Michelucci A. Cordes T. Ghelfi J. Pailot A. Reiling N. Goldmann O. Binz T. Wegner A. Tallam A. Rausell A.

https://openalex.org/W2404352591,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-induced hypertension with proteinuria that typically develops after 20 weeks of gestation. A reduction in uterine blood flow causes placental ischemia and placental release of anti-angiogenic factors such as sFlt-1 followed by PE. Although the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) model is widely used in rats, investigating the role of genes on PE using genetically engineered animals has been problematic because it has been difficult to make a useful RUPP model in mice. To establish a RUPP model of PE in mice, we bilaterally ligated ovarian vessels distal to ovarian branches, uterine vessels, or both in ICR-strain mice at 14.5 days post coitum (dpc). Consequently, these mice had elevated BP, increased urinary albumin excretion, severe endotheliosis, and mesangial expansion. They also had an increased incidence of miscarriage and premature delivery. Embryonic weight at 18.5 dpc was significantly lower than that in sham mice. The closer to the ligation site the embryos were, the higher the resorption rate and the lower the embryonic weight. The phenotype was more severe in the order of ligation at the ovarian vessels < uterine vessels < both. Unlike the RUPP models described in the literature, this model did not constrict the abdominal aorta, which allowed BP to be measured with a tail cuff. This novel RUPP model in mice should be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of PE in genetically engineered mice and for evaluating new therapies for PE."
https://openalex.org/W2402786956,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ferulic acid (FA) administered at various time points before or after 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by 7 d of reperfusion and to examine the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in the cortical penumbra. Methods FA was intravenously administered to rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg 24 h before ischemia (B-FA), 2 h before ischemia (P-FA), immediately after ischemic insult (I-FA), 2 h after reperfusion (R-FA), or 24 h after reperfusion (D-FA). Results Our study results indicated that P-FA, I-FA, and R-FA effectively reduced cerebral infarct areas and neurological deficits. P-FA, I-FA, and R-FA significantly downregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), mitochondrial Bax, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and effectively restored the phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK)/p38 MAPK ratio, phospho-90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p-p90RSK) expression, phospho-Bad (p-Bad) expression, the phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB)/CREB ratio, the cytosolic and mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax ratios, and the cytosolic Bcl-xL/Bax ratio in the cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, administered 30 min prior to ischemia abrogated the downregulating effects of I-FA on cerebral infarction, and mitochondrial Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and the upregulating effects of I-FA on the p-p38 MAPK/p38 MAPK ratio, p-p90RSK expression, p-Bad expression, and the p-CREB/CREB, and cytosolic and mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax ratios. Conclusions Our study results thus indicate that P-FA, I-FA, and R-FA effectively suppress reactive astrocytosis and exert neuroprotective effects against cerebral infarction by activating p38 MAPK signaling. The regulating effects of P-FA, I-FA, and R-FA on Bax-induced apoptosis result from activation of the p38 MAPK/p90RSK/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling pathway, and eventually contribute to inhibition of the cytochrome c-mediated caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in the cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2401913595,"Background The dengue and Zika viruses are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are most active during day light hours and feed both in and outside of the household. Personal protection technologies such as insecticide-treated clothing could provide individual protection. Here we assessed the efficacy of permethrin-treated clothing on personal protection in the laboratory. Methods The effect of washing on treated clothing, skin coverage and protection against resistant and susceptible Ae. aegypti was assessed using modified WHO arm-in-cage assays. Coverage was further assessed using free-flight room tests to investigate the protective efficacy of unwashed factory-dipped permethrin-treated clothing. Clothing was worn as full coverage (long sleeves and trousers) and partial coverage (short sleeves and shorts). Residual permethrin on the skin and its effect on mosquitoes was measured using modified WHO cone assays and quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Results In the arm-in-cage assays, unwashed clothing reduced landing by 58.9% (95% CI 49.2–66.9) and biting by 28.5% (95% CI 22.5–34.0), but reduced to 18.5% (95% CI 14.7–22.3) and 11.1% (95% CI 8.5–13.8) respectively after 10 washes. Landing and biting for resistant and susceptible strains was not significantly different (p<0.05). In free-flight room tests, full coverage treated clothing reduced landing by 24.3% (95% CI 17.4–31.7) and biting by 91% (95% CI 82.2–95.9) with partial coverage reducing landing and biting by 26.4% (95% CI 20.3–31.2) and 49.3% (95% CI 42.1–59.1) respectively with coverage type having no significant difference on landing (p<0.05). Residual permethrin was present on the skin in low amounts (0.0041mg/cm2), but still produced a KD of >80% one hour after wearing treated clothing. Conclusion Whilst partially covering the body with permethrin-treated clothing provided some protection against biting, wearing treated clothing with long sleeves and trousers provided the highest form of protection. Washing treated clothing dramatically reduced protection provided. Permethrin-treated clothing could provide protection to individuals from Ae. aegypti that show permethrin resistance. Additionally, it could continue to provide protection even after the clothing has been worn. Field trials are urgently needed to determine whether clothing can protect against dengue and Zika."
https://openalex.org/W2402393879,"The circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including the biologically active angiotensin II, is a fundamental regulatory mechanism of blood pressure conserved through evolution. Angiotensin II components of the RAS have also been identified in the brain. In addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines, neuromodulators, such as angiotensin II can induce (through angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R)) some of the inflammatory actions of brain glial cells and influence brain inflammation. Moreover, in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, where neuroinflammation occurs, increased levels of cortical AT1Rs have been shown. Still, the precise role of RAS in neuroinflammation is not completely clear. The overall aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of RAS in the modulation of glial functions and AD pathology. To reach this goal, the specific aims of the present study were a. to investigate the long term effect of telmisartan (AT1R blocker) on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1-β (IL1-β) and nitric oxide (NO) release from glial cells. b. to examine the effect of intranasally administered telmisartan on amyloid burden and microglial activation in 5X familial AD (5XFAD) mice. Telmisartan effects in vivo were compared to those of perindopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor). Long-term-exposure of BV2 microglia to telmisartan significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced NO, inducible NO synthase, TNF-α and IL1-β synthesis. The effect of Telmisartan on NO production in BV2 cells was confirmed also in primary neonatal rat glial cells. Intranasal administration of telmisartan (1 mg/kg/day) for up to two months significantly reduced amyloid burden and CD11b expression (a marker for microglia) both in the cortex and hipoccampus of 5XFAD. Based on the current view of RAS and our data, showing reduced amyloid burden and glial activation in the brains of 5XFAD transgenic mice, one may envision potential intervention with the progression of glial activation and AD by using AT1R blockers."

Methods A total of 692 workers from transportation, manufacturing and cleaning sectors wore an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the thigh for 1–4 working days. The sedentary (sit and lie), standing, walking, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time on working days was computed using validated Acti4 software. The total sedentary time and uninterrupted sedentary time spent in brief (≤5 mins), moderate (>5 and ≤30 mins), and long (>30mins) bouts, were determined for the whole day and during work and non-work time separately. The obesity indicators, BMI (kg/m2), waist circumference (cm) and fat percentage were objectively measured. Isotemporal substitution modelling was utilized to determine the linear association with obesity indicators of replacing 30 min of total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts with standing, walking or MVPA and separately replacing 30 min of long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts. Results Workers [mean (standard deviation, SD); age = 45.1 (9.9) years, BMI = 27.5 (4.9) kg/m2, %BF = 29.6 (9.5), waist circumference = 94.4 (13.0) cm] sat for 2.4 hours (~32% of the measured time, SD = 1.8 hours) across the day during work period and 5.5 hours (~62% of the measured time, SD = 1.5 hours) during non-work period. Most of the sedentary time was accrued in moderate bouts [work = 1.40 (SD = 1.09) hours] during work and in long bouts during non-work [2.7 (SD = 1.4) hours], while least in long sedentary bouts during work [work = 0.5 (SD = 0.9)] and in brief sedentary bouts [0.5 hours (SD = 0.3)] during non-work. Significant associations with all obesity indicators were found when 30 min of total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts were replaced with standing time (~1–2% lower) or MVPA (~4–9% lower) during whole day, work, and non-work periods. The exception was that a statistically significant association was not observed with any obesity indicator when replacing total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts with standing time during the work period. Significant beneficial associations were found when replacing the long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts (~3–5% lower) during all domains. Conclusion Replacing total sedentary time and long sedentary bouts, respectively, not only with MVPA but also standing time appears to be beneficially associated with obesity indicators among blue-collar workers. Additionally, replacing long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts was also beneficially associated with obesity indicators. Studies using prospective design are needed to confirm the findings."
https://openalex.org/W2400551155,"Background New Zealand (NZ) is considering transitioning from 3-yearly cervical cytology screening in women 20–69 years (current practice) to primary HPV screening. We evaluated HPV-based screening in both HPV-unvaccinated women and cohorts offered HPV vaccination in New Zealand (vaccination coverage ~50%). Methods A complex model of HPV transmission, vaccination, cervical screening, and invasive cervical cancer was extensively validated against national population-based datasets. Sixteen potential strategies for HPV screening were considered. Results Most primary HPV strategies were more effective than current practice, for both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination. The optimal strategy for both groups was 5-yearly HPV screening in women aged 25–69 years with partial genotyping for HPV 16/18 and referral to colposcopy, and cytological triage of other oncogenic types. This is predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality by a further 12–16% and to save 4–13% annually in program costs (excluding overheads). The findings are sensitive to assumptions about future adherence to initiating screening at 25 years. Conclusion Primary HPV screening with partial genotyping would be more effective and less costly than the current cytology-based screening program, in both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination. These findings have been considered in a review of cervical screening in NZ."
https://openalex.org/W2396573242,"Invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard to assess the functional coronary stenosis. The non-invasive assessment of diameter stenosis (DS) using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has high false positive rate in contrast to FFR. Combining CTA with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), recent studies have shown promising predictions of FFRCT for superior assessment of lesion severity over CTA alone. The CFD models tend to be computationally expensive, however, and require several hours for completing analysis. Here, we introduce simplified models to predict noninvasive FFR at substantially less computational time. In this retrospective pilot study, 21 patients received coronary CTA. Subsequently a total of 32 vessels underwent invasive FFR measurement. For each vessel, FFR based on steady-state and analytical models (FFRSS and FFRAM, respectively) were calculated non-invasively based on CTA and compared with FFR. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 90.6% (87.5%), 80.0% (80.0%), 95.5% (90.9%), 88.9% (80.0%) and 91.3% (90.9%) respectively for FFRSS (and FFRAM) on a per-vessel basis, and were 75.0%, 50.0%, 86.4%, 62.5% and 79.2% respectively for DS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.963, 0.954 and 0.741 for FFRSS, FFRAM and DS respectively, on a per-patient level. The results suggest that the CTA-derived FFRSS performed well in contrast to invasive FFR and they had better diagnostic performance than DS from CTA in the identification of functionally significant lesions. In contrast to FFRCT, FFRSS requires much less computational time."

Artificial intelligence approaches can be useful techniques in minimizing estimation errors within complex variations of vegetation. We evaluated the performance of Random Forest® regression tree and Artificial Neural Network procedures in modelling stem taper. Diameters and volume outside bark were compared to a traditional taper-based equation across a tropical Brazilian savanna, a seasonal semi-deciduous forest and a rainforest. Neural network models were found to be more accurate than the traditional taper equation. Random forest showed trends in the residuals from the diameter prediction and provided the least precise and accurate estimations for all forest types. This study provides insights into the superiority of a neural network, which provided advantages regarding the handling of local effects."

Further is to investigate the potential effects of PGA on corneal biomechanics. Methods In this case-control study, 35 consecutive medication naïve eyes with POAG, 34 POAG eyes with at least 2 years treatment by PGA and 19 normal eyes were included. Intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal biomechanical parameters, including deformation amplitude (DA), applanation time (AT1 and AT2), applanation length (AL1 and AL2), applanation velocity (AV1 and AV2), and peak distance and radius were measured using Corvis ST. Axial length and corneal curvature were measured with partial coherence interferometry (IOLMaster, Zeiss, Germany). General linear model analysis was performed to investigate the corneal biomechanical property changes among the normal controls, newly diagnosed POAG patients and POAG patients with long-term PGA treatment, and among the subgroups of different types of PGA treatment, including bimatoprost, latanoprost and travoprost. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni correction for least squares means were employed. Results AT1 (p<0.0001), AV1 (p<0.0001), AT2 (p = 0.0001), AV2 (p<0.0001) and DA (p = 0.0004) in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients were significantly different from those in normal subjects and in patients underwent at least 2 years topical PGA therapy after adjusting for age and gender. After adjusting for age, gender, IOP, CCT, axial length and corneal curvature, a significant difference was detected for DA between glaucoma patients without PGA treatment and patients with long-term PGA therapy (p = 0.0387). Furthermore, there were no statistical significant differences in all of the corneal biomechanical parameters among the 3 types of PGA therapy subgroups, namely bimatoprost, latanoprost and travoprost. Conclusions Significant changes in corneal deformation parameters were found among untreated POAG patients, POAG patients with long-term topical PGA therapy and normal controls. Long-term topical PGA treatment might have a direct effect on corneal biomechanical properties in addition to the indirect effect owing to the PGA-induced IOP reduction and CCT decrease on corneal dynamic properties."

This study aims to investigate the baseline nutritional intake of Malaysian adolescents by gender, body mass index, and places of residence, both urban and rural. A cohort study was conducted consisting of 794 adolescents (aged 13-years) attending 15 public secondary schools from the Central (Kuala Lumpur and Selangor) and Northern (Perak) Regions of Peninsular Malaysia. Qualified dietitians conducted a 7-day historical assessment of habitual food intakes. Facilitated by flipcharts and household measurement tools, detailed information on portion sizes and meal contents were recorded. Nutritionist Pro™ Diet Analysis software was also used to analyze the dietary records.The mean age of the adolescents was 12.86 ± 0.33 y; the mean energy intake was 1659.0 ± 329.6 kcal/d. Males had significantly (P < .001) higher energy intake than females (1774.0 ± 369.8 vs 1595.2 ± 320.6 kcal/d); adolescents in rural schools consumed more energy and cholesterol (P < .001) compared to adolescents in urban schools (1706.1 ± 377.7 kcal/d and 244.1 ± 100.2 mg/d, respectively). Obese adolescents in rural schools consumed more energy and sugar (1987.6 ± 374.0 kcal/d and 48.9 ± 23.0 g/d) (p-value <0.001).The dietary intake of normal weight versus obese adolescents differs by the location of their school. Thus, the implementation of a structured and tailored intervention is recommended to help minimize this nutritional inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2402678912,"Persistent DNA damage is considered as a main cause of cellular senescence induced by ionizing radiation. However, the molecular bases of the DNA damage and their contribution to cellular senescence are not completely clear. In this study, we found that both heavy ions and X-rays induced senescence in human uveal melanoma 92–1 cells. By measuring senescence associated-β-galactosidase and cell proliferation, we identified that heavy ions were more effective at inducing senescence than X-rays. We observed less efficient repair when DNA damage was induced by heavy ions compared with X-rays and most of the irreparable damage was complex of single strand breaks and double strand breaks, while DNA damage induced by X-rays was mostly repaired in 24 hours and the remained damage was preferentially associated with telomeric DNA. Our results suggest that DNA damage induced by heavy ion is often complex and difficult to repair, thus presents as persistent DNA damage and pushes the cell into senescence. In contrast, persistent DNA damage induced by X-rays is preferentially associated with telomeric DNA and the telomere-favored persistent DNA damage contributes to X-rays induced cellular senescence. These findings provide new insight into the understanding of high relative biological effectiveness of heavy ions relevant to cancer therapy and space radiation research."
https://openalex.org/W2396990608,"Blind people are known to have superior perceptual abilities in their remaining senses. Several studies suggest that these enhancements are dependent on the specific experience of blind individuals, who use those remaining senses more than sighted subjects. In line with this view, sighted subjects, when trained, are able to significantly progress in relatively simple tactile tasks. However, the case of complex tactile tasks is less obvious, as some studies suggest that visual deprivation itself could confer large advantages in learning them. It remains unclear to what extent those complex skills, such as braille reading, can be learnt by sighted subjects. Here we enrolled twenty-nine sighted adults, mostly braille teachers and educators, in a 9-month braille reading course. At the beginning of the course, all subjects were naive in tactile braille reading. After the course, almost all were able to read whole braille words at a mean speed of 6 words-per-minute. Subjects with low tactile acuity did not differ significantly in braille reading speed from the rest of the group, indicating that low tactile acuity is not a limiting factor for learning braille, at least at this early stage of learning. Our study shows that most sighted adults can learn whole-word braille reading, given the right method and a considerable amount of motivation. The adult sensorimotor system can thus adapt, to some level, to very complex tactile tasks without visual deprivation. The pace of learning in our group was comparable to congenitally and early blind children learning braille in primary school, which suggests that the blind's mastery of complex tactile tasks can, to a large extent, be explained by experience-dependent mechanisms."

Evidence suggests that cardiolipin molecules segregate into such microdomains, probably conferring a negative curvature to the inner plasma membrane during membrane fission upon cell division. 3′,6-Dinonyl neamine is an amphiphilic aminoglycoside derivative active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including strains resistant to colistin. The mechanisms involved at the molecular level were identified using lipid models (large unilamellar vesicles, giant unilamelllar vesicles, and lipid monolayers) that mimic the inner membrane of P. aeruginosa. The study demonstrated the interaction of 3′,6-dinonyl neamine with cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, two negatively charged lipids from inner bacterial membranes. This interaction induced membrane permeabilization and depolarization. Lateral segregation of cardiolipin and membrane hemifusion would be critical for explaining the effects induced on lipid membranes by amphiphilic aminoglycoside antibiotics.

This study showed that a 6-thioguanosine triphosphate (6-TGTP), converted in T-cells from 6-TP, targets Rac1 to form a disulfide adduct between 6-TGTP and the redox-sensitive GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif of Rac1. This study also showed that, despite the conservation of the catalytic activity of RhoGAP (Rho-specific GAP) on the 6-TGTP-Rac1 adduct to produce the biologically inactive 6-thioguanosine diphosphate (6-TGDP)-Rac1 adduct, RhoGEF (Rho-specific GEF) cannot exchange the 6-TGDP adducted on Rac1 with free guanine nucleotide. The biologically inactive 6-TGDP-Rac1 adduct accumulates in cells because of the ongoing combined actions of RhoGEF and RhoGAP.

Rac1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, and this superfamily includes both the Ras and Rho families of GTPases, which play key roles in various cellular signaling cascades (12Wennerberg K.

The Rho family of GTPases encompasses Rac (e.g. Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3), RhoA, RhoC, and Cdc42, whereas the Ras family of GTPases includes HRas, KRas, and MRas. These proteins function by cycling between the inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states (13Heo J.

This GDP/GTP cycling is controlled by various regulators such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (15Geyer M. Wittinghofer A.

Importantly, Rac GTPases continue to attract more and more clinical interest because of the emerging evidence of their role in such autoimmune disorders as inflammatory bowel disease (5Tiede I. Fritz G. Strand S. Poppe D. Dvorsky R. Strand D. Lehr H.A. Wirtz S. Becker C. Atreya R. Mudter J. Hildner K. Bartsch B. Holtmann M. Blumberg R. et al.CD28-dependent Rac1 activation is the molecular target of azathioprine in primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes.J. Clin.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A precise molecularly based mechanism for the inactivation of Rac1 mediated by 6-TGNP via the blockage of the action of Vav remains unknown. The only difference between 6-TGNP and a regular guanosine phosphate (GNP) is the C-6 atom of the guanine base, where 6-TGNP and GNP, respectively, possess a sulfur and an oxygen atom at the C-6 position (10Karran P. Attard N. Thiopurines in current medical practice: molecular mechanisms and contributions to therapy-related cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, blockage of Vav action on the 6-TGNP-bound Rac1 in T-cells is certainly because of the presence of the C-6 sulfur atom on 6-TGNP. Accordingly, configuration of the potential chemical and physical features of the sulfur-containing thiol moiety of the Rac1-bound 6-TGNP associated with Vav action is critical because it can be a thiol-based medication platform to design more effective drugs. Furthermore, lack of the precise 6-TGNP-mediated Rac1 inactivation mechanism also potentially hinders maximization of the therapeutic effects of 6-TP prodrugs. For example, if an unknown cellular factor(s) is necessary for blockage of the Vav action on the 6-TGNP-bound Rac1, ignorance of such a potential factor limits the opportunity to maximize the therapeutic applications of 6-TP prodrugs. Perhaps the most significant disadvantage of not understanding the details of this mechanism lie in what we may consequently miss. For example, our lack of understanding may hinder recognition of any side effects of 6-TGNP that may occur through its binding to other critical Rho GTPases such as RhoA and Cdc42. This notion arises because, although the previous study shows that 6-TGNP preferentially blocks the Vav action on Rac1 but not on RhoA and Cdc42 (11Poppe D. Tiede I. Fritz G. Becker C. Bartsch B. Wirtz S. Strand D. Tanaka S. Galle P.R. Bustelo X.R. Neurath M.F. Azathioprine suppresses ezrin-radixin-moesin-dependent T cell-APC conjugation through inhibition of Vav guanosine exchange activity on Rac proteins.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), Vav has a rather broad spectrum of catalytic specificity (22Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. Vav2 is an activator of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, Vav is capable of activating all of these Rho proteins, including Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42. Despite what is known, the mechanistic reason for why 6-TGNP selectively targets Rac1, rather than other Rho GTPases, remains poorly understood. Consequently, it is difficult to preclude or minimize the potential side effects of 6-TP prodrugs associated with these Rho GTPases. We have recently identified a distinct redox-sensitive GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif that is conserved in many Rho subfamily proteins such as Rac1, RhoA, RhoC, and Cdc42 (23Heo J. Campbell S.L. Mechanism of redox-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange on redox-active Rho GTPases.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31003-31010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Heo J. Raines K.W. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. Redox regulation of RhoA.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14481-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Notably, the thiol moiety of the Rac1 cysteine (Cys18, Rac1 numbering) in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif is located at the Rac1 nucleotide-binding site, but the equivalent thiol moiety of the Ras cysteine (Cys118, Harvey Ras numbering) in the NKCD motif is remote from the Ras nucleotide-binding site (13Heo J. Redox control of GTPases: from molecular mechanisms to functional significance in health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 689-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biologically relevant redox agents include nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (•NO2), and dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) as well as the superoxide anion radical (O2−·) and hydrogen peroxide (25Stubbe J. van Der Donk W.A. Protein radicals in enzyme catalysis.Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 26Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.C. De Menezes S.L.

Campbell S.L. Mechanism of free radical nitric oxide-mediated Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Of these, •NO2 and O2−· have been shown to directly target and react with these redox-sensitive residues and activate Rho proteins (13Heo J. Redox control of GTPases: from molecular mechanisms to functional significance in health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 689-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The redox-sensitive Rac1 Cys18 residue in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif also is likely susceptible to reaction with another cysteine residue of proteins or molecules that contains a thiol moiety to produce protein disulfide. This susceptibility is exemplified by the formation of an intra-protein disulfide of the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing RhoA (24Heo J. Raines K.W. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. Redox regulation of RhoA.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14481-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a disulfide cross-link between 6-TGNP and Rac1 is possible. This possibility exists because 6-TGNP, which is derived from 6-TP prodrugs (10Karran P. Attard N. Thiopurines in current medical practice: molecular mechanisms and contributions to therapy-related cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), possesses a thiol moiety and the Rac1 Cys18 is located at the GTPase nucleotide-binding site. If this potential disulfide bond formation is real, it could cause 6-TGNP to stick on the Rac1 nucleotide-binding site, disabling its displacement with the cellularly abundant GTP to produce an active GTP-bound Rac1. Although the resultant cellular effect is different, this potential mechanistic scenario, the sticking of 6-TGNP on the Rac1 nucleotide-binding site through a disulfide bond, also is observed in another Rho protein, RhoC, which also has the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif (28Heo J. Wey M. Hong I. Insight into the 6-thiopurine-mediated termination of the invasive motility of tumor cells derived from inflammatory breast cancer.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5731-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This potential disulfide bond formation between 6-TGNP and Rac1 may explain how Rac1 is rendered inactive by blocking the Vav action on it. However, other possibilities may be at work, such as the Rac1-bound 6-TGNP altering or modifying the mechanical properties of Vav. It also is unclear what effect, if any, the presence of the thiol moiety of the Rac1-bound 6-TGNP has on the catalytic function of RhoGAPs. This information is necessary to assess the overall effects of 6-TGNP on regulation of Rac1 activity. This study uses CD4+ cell-based redox biochemistry approaches to examine the mechanistic features of the 6-TGNP-mediated Rac1 inactivation. These features are associated with the activities of Vav and RhoGAP that detail a precise molecularly based mechanism for the 6-TGNP-mediated Rac1 inactivation. The results have the potential to aid further improvement of usage of 6-TP prodrugs and promote the development of potentially better drugs for immunosuppressive effects. Another advantage may be insight into the prevention or alleviation of the potential cytotoxicities of 6-TP prodrugs as immunosuppressive drugs. All chemicals used in this study were the highest grades available. Full-length Rac1 and Vav (encompassing the DH-PH-cysteine-rich domain of Vav2) constructs derived from humans were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (29Heo J. Thapar R. Campbell S.L. Recognition and activation of Rho GTPases by vav1 and vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factors.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6573-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The GST tags of the GST-tagged p21-activated kinase 1 protein-binding domain (PAK-PBD, Cytoskeleton) and the catalytic domain of RhoGAP (Cytoskeleton) were cleaved off by incubation with HRV 3C protease (Fisher) for 12 h at 4 °C. The cleaved GST tag and uncleaved GST-tagged proteins were removed by passing through the GSTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). Human CD4+ cells used in this study were from a single individual and were obtained from Astarte Biologics. Unstimulated CD4+ cells died in 2–3 days. Therefore, all CD4+ cells were stimulated with coated antibodies to CD3 (1.0 μg/ml) and soluble CD28 (1.0 μg/ml) as well as interleukin 2 (IL-2, 20 units/ml R&D Systems) for 1 day before their use as described previously (11Poppe D. Tiede I. Fritz G. Becker C. Bartsch B. Wirtz S. Strand D. Tanaka S. Galle P.R. Bustelo X.R. Neurath M.F. Azathioprine suppresses ezrin-radixin-moesin-dependent T cell-APC conjugation through inhibition of Vav guanosine exchange activity on Rac proteins.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). When necessary, CD4+ cells (1 × 104) were repeatedly treated with 6-TG (1 μm for every 12 h) and/or diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct (DETA/NO, 10 μm every 8 h) for 3 days. The CD4+ cells treated with and without 6-TG and/or DETA/NO were lysed by sonification in an extraction buffer that contains 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, and metal-free 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The cell extracts were subjected to Western analyses of Rac1, Vav, phosphorylated Vav (pVav), Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM), and actin, respectively, by using antibodies against Rac1 (monoclonal anti-Rac1, Cytoskeleton), Vav (monoclonal anti-Vav, Millipore), pVav (monoclonal anti-pVav, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERM (polyclonal anti-ERM, Cell Signaling Technology), and actin (monoclonal anti-actin, Sigma). Quantity secretions of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) from CD4+ cells were determined by using a human IFN-γ ELISA kit (Abfrontier). To examine the level of ERM phosphorylation (pERM), CD4+ cells were stimulated in a complete RPMI 1640 medium with ∼50 μCi of 32P/ml. The cells were then treated with and without 6-TG and/or DETA/NO as indicated above. The cells were sonicated to produce cell extracts. ERM was then immunoprecipitated (IPed) from the cell extracts by using a Thermo Scientific Pierce direct IP kit and the polyclonal anti-ERM antibody (Pierce) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The Rac1 activity assay was performed with a cell extract by using the Rac1 G-LISA activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton). The RhoA and Cdc42 activities in the cell extracts were determined by using RhoA-GTP and a Cdc42-GTP activation assay kit (NewEast Biosciences), respectively. Briefly, to prepare the IPed Rac1samples from CD4+ cells treated with and without 6-TG and/or DETA/NO, CD4+ cell lysates in an extraction buffer were incubated with a monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (Cytoskeleton) linked to glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h. The agarose beads were pulled down by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min). The beads were washed three times with the extraction buffer. The beads were then treated with an elution buffer to release the bead-bound Rac1 proteins. The elution buffer contained 50% methanol, 0.1% formic acid, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. The supernatant that contained proteins (i.e. Rac1) was separated by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 5 min). Note that the entire sample preparation process(es) was done without any reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or β-mercaptoethanol at 0 °C. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed to determine the feature state of Rac1 in CD4+ cells treated with and without 6-TG and/or DETA/NO. Analyses of electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the IPed samples from CD4+ cells were performed as described previously (28Heo J. Wey M. Hong I. Insight into the 6-thiopurine-mediated termination of the invasive motility of tumor cells derived from inflammatory breast cancer.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5731-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), except that preparation of the IPed sample used a monoclonal anti-Rac1 antibody (Cytoskeleton) rather than the anti-RhoC antibody. Briefly, the IPed Rac1 samples in the elution buffer were diluted 10-fold with a buffer containing 1 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The IPed Rac1 samples were then digested with trypsin for 10 h. The trypsin-treated samples were then subjected to analysis with ESI-MS and MS/MS in the positive ion mode ([molecular mass + H]+). The IPed Rac1 fractions from the CD4+ cells in the elution buffer (see above) were diluted 10-fold with a sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.01 bromphenol blue in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and denatured by heating for 1 min at 100 °C. The heat-denatured Rac1 samples were then subjected to Western analysis and probed with a monoclonal anti-6-TGNP antibody (which is an anti-6-TGNP antibody detecting both 6-TGDP and 6-TGTP, Pierce). Note that unless otherwise indicated, all potential reducing agents such as DTT or β-mercaptoethanol were excluded from all experimental processes. A fluorescence-based 6-TGNP-Rac1 adduct activity assay was performed in accordance with the previously described method (30Heo J. Campbell S.L. Ras regulation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2200-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To label Rac1 with rhodamine B dye, Rac1 (100 μm) purified from E. coli was mixed with a 5-fold excess rhodamine B in a buffer containing 20 mm GDP, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The unreacted free rhodamine B was removed by applying the mixture onto a size-exclusion column (Sephadex G-25, 1.5 × 6 cm) at room temperature. The rhodamine B-attached Rac1 was loaded with 6-TGNP to produce the 6-TGNP-bound Rac1 and then further treated with NO under aerobic conditions to produce the 6-TGNP-Rac1 adduct. When necessary, the IPed Rac1 from CD4+ cells also was labeled with rhodamine B dye by using the same method established for labeling Rac1 purified from E. coli (see above). However, after production of the rhodamine B-attached IPed Rac1, the treatment step(s) of the rhodamine B-attached IPed Rac1 with the 6-TGNP and/or NO was skipped; this omission was because the feature states of the untreated IPed Rac1 with its original 6-TGNP adduct were of interest to this research. The rhodamine B-attached 6-TGNP-Rac1 adduct or the rhodamine B-attached-IPed Rac1 (10 nm) and PAK-PBD (1 μm) were transferred into a fluorescence assay cuvette containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% deoxycholate, and metal-free 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The assay mixture was excited at 510 nm, and the change in fluorescence emission intensity at 565 nm due to the potent"

The measured MeHg concentrations in fish did not exceed the Codex guideline level of 1 mg/kg. Swordfish (0.28 ± 0.23 mg/kg) and tuna (0.14 ± 0.13 mg/kg) had the highest MeHg concentrations.

In addition, 80% of infertile women and 68% of pregnant women had MeHg concentrations in hair that exceeded the USEPA reference dose (1 mg/kg). The MeHg concentrations in hair were significantly and positively correlated with the estimated daily MeHg exposure dose.

https://openalex.org/W2395813124,"The ophiostomatoid fungi (Microascales and Ophiostomatales, Ascomycota) are common associates of Ips typographus, and include tree pathogens and species responsible for blue-stain of timber. Fungal assemblages associated with I. typographus have varied considerably between studies but few investigations have attempted to explain this variation. For this reason, we assessed the overall cultivable fungal diversity associated with I. typographus in a storm-felled spruce forest in south-eastern Finland. Fungi were isolated from the individually collected beetles as well as their phoretic mites in spring, summer and autumn, including different life stages of the beetle (hibernation, dispersal flight and first generation). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene region was used to identify the fungi. A total of 32 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found and these resided in four fungal phyla/subphyla (24 Ascomycota, 2 Basidiomycota, 5 Mucoromycotina, 1 Mortierellomycotina) in association with adult bark beetles. Ophiostomatoid species were the most commonly detected fungal associates. A generalized linear model analysis showed a clear association between fungal communities and season, indicating seasonal succession among I. typographus-associated fungi. The season of sampling appears to be an important factor that has resulted in inconsistencies between results in previous studies. Many of these fungi were also found on phoretic mites and their presence or absence could have influenced variation in patterns of association."
https://openalex.org/W2403822816,"Binding of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activates innate immune responses and contributes to development of adaptive immunity. Simultaneous stimulation of different types of PRRs can have synergistic immunostimulatory effects resulting in enhanced production of molecules that mediate innate immunity such as inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, etc. Here, we evaluated the impact of combined stimulation of PRRs from different families on adaptive immunity by generating alum-based vaccine formulations with ovalbumin as a model antigen and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist MPLA and the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) agonist MDP adsorbed individually or together on the alum-ovalbumin particles. Multiple in vitro and in vivo readouts of immune system activation all showed that while individual PRR agonists increased the immunogenicity of vaccines compared to alum alone, the combination of both PRR agonists was significantly more effective. Combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 results in a stronger and broader transcriptional response in THP-1 cells compared to individual PRR stimulation. Immunostimulatory composition containing both PRR agonists (MPLA and MDP) in the context of the alum-based ovalbumin vaccine also enhanced uptake of vaccine particles by bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and promoted maturation (up-regulation of expression of CD80, CD86, MHCII) and activation (production of cytokines) of BMDCs. Finally, immunization of mice with vaccine particles containing both PRR agonists resulted in enhanced cellular immunity as indicated by increased proliferation and activation (IFN-γ production) of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following in vitro restimulation with ovalbumin and enhanced humoral immunity as indicated by higher titers of ovalbumin-specific IgG antibodies. These results indicate that combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 receptors dramatically enhances activation of both the humoral and cellular branches of adaptive immunity and suggests that inclusion of agonists of these receptors in standard alum-based adjuvants could be used to improve the effectiveness of vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2165933554,"Background Low- and middle-income countries are often described as being at intermediate stages of epidemiological transition, but there is little population-based data with reliable cause of death assignment to examine the situation in more detail. Non-communicable diseases are widely seen as a coming threat to population health, alongside receding burdens of infection. The INDEPTH Network has collected empirical population data in a number of health and demographic surveillance sites in low- and middle-income countries which permit more detailed examination of mortality trends over time. Objective To examine cause-specific mortality trends across all ages at INDEPTH Network sites in Africa and Asia during the period 1992–2012. Emphasis is given to the 15–64 year age group, which is the main focus of concern around the impact of the HIV pandemic and emerging non-communicable disease threats. Methods INDEPTH Network public domain data from 12 sites that each reported at least five years of cause-specific mortality data were used. Causes of death were attributed using standardised WHO verbal autopsy methods, and mortality rates were standardised for comparison using the INDEPTH standard population. Annual changes in mortality rates were calculated for each site. Results A total of 96,255 deaths were observed during 9,487,418 person years at the 12 sites. Verbal autopsies were completed for 86,039 deaths (89.4%). There were substantial variations in mortality rates between sites and over time. HIV-related mortality played a major part at sites in eastern and southern Africa. Deaths in the age group 15–64 years accounted for 43% of overall mortality. Trends in mortality were generally downwards, in some cases quite rapidly so. The Bangladeshi sites reflected populations at later stages of transition than in Africa, and were largely free of the effects of HIV/AIDS. Conclusions To some extent the patterns of epidemiological transition observed followed theoretical expectations, despite the impact of the HIV pandemic having a major effect in some locations. Trends towards lower overall mortality, driven by decreasing infections, were the general pattern. Low- and middle-income country populations appear to be in an era of rapid transition."
https://openalex.org/W2395788569,"Traditional molecular methods have been used to examine bacterial communities in ginseng-cultivated soil samples in a time-dependent manner. Despite these efforts, our understanding of the bacterial community is still inadequate. Therefore, in this study, a high-throughput sequencing approach was employed to investigate bacterial diversity in various ginseng field soil samples over cultivation times of 2, 4, and 6 years in the first and second rounds of cultivation. We used non-cultivated soil samples to perform a comparative study. Moreover, this study assessed changes in the bacterial community associated with soil depth and the health state of the ginseng. Bacterial richness decreased through years of cultivation. This study detected differences in relative abundance of bacterial populations between the first and second rounds of cultivation, years of cultivation, and health states of ginseng. These bacterial populations were mainly distributed in the classes Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Sphingobacteria. In addition, we found that pH, available phosphorus, and exchangeable Ca+ seemed to have high correlations with bacterial class in ginseng cultivated soil."
https://openalex.org/W2400137219,"To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression in eukaryotes, a variety of mathematical modeling approaches have been employed, ranging from Boolean networks and differential equations to stochastic simulations. Each approach has its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a ""standard component"" modeling strategy that combines advantageous features of Boolean networks, differential equations and stochastic simulations in a framework that acknowledges the typical sorts of reactions found in protein regulatory networks. Applying this strategy to a comprehensive mechanism of the budding yeast cell cycle, we illustrate the potential value of standard component modeling. The deterministic version of our model reproduces the phenotypic properties of wild-type cells and of 125 mutant strains. The stochastic version of our model reproduces the cell-to-cell variability of wild-type cells and the partial viability of the CLB2-dbΔ clb5Δ mutant strain. Our simulations show that mathematical modeling with ""standard components"" can capture in quantitative detail many essential properties of cell cycle control in budding yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2398890338,"Objectives We sought to investigate the association of epicardial adipose tissue (eCAT) volume with plaque burden, circulating biomarkers and cardiac outcomes in patients with intermediate risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results 177 consecutive outpatients at intermediate risk for CAD and completed biomarker analysis including high-sensitive Troponin T (hs-TnT) and hs-CRP underwent 256-slice cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) between June 2008 and October 2011. Patients with lumen narrowing ≥50% exhibited significantly higher eCAT volume than patients without any CAD or lumen narrowing <50% (median (interquartile range, IQR): 108 (73–167) cm3 vs. 119 (82–196) cm3, p = 0.04). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent association eCAT volume with plaque burden by number of lesions (R2 = 0.22, rpartial = 0.29, p = 0.026) and CAD severity by lumen narrowing (R2 = 0.22, rpartial = 0.23, p = 0.038) after adjustment for age, diabetes mellitus, hyperlidipemia, body-mass-index (BMI), hs-CRP and hs-TnT. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified a significant association for both increased eCAT volume and maximal lumen narrowing with all cardiac events. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed an independent association of increased eCAT volume with all cardiac events after adjustment for age, >3 risk factors, presence of CAD, hs-CRP and hs-TnT. Conclusion Epicardial adipose tissue volume is independently associated with plaque burden and maximum luminal narrowing by CCTA and may serve as an independent predictor for cardiac outcomes in patients at intermediate risk for CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2395398689,"Introduction Over the last decade, planned home births in the United States (US) have increased, and have been associated with increased neonatal mortality and other morbidities. In a previous study we reported that neonatal mortality is increased in planned home births but we did not perform an analysis for the presence of professional certification status. Purpose The objective of this study therefore was to undertake an analysis to determine whether the professional certification status of midwives or the home birth setting are more closely associated with the increased neonatal mortality of planned midwife-attended home births in the United States. Materials and Methods This study is a secondary analysis of our prior study. The 2006–2009 period linked birth/infant deaths data set was analyzed to examine total neonatal deaths (deaths less than 28 days of life) in term singleton births (37+ weeks and newborn weight ≥ 2,500 grams) without documented congenital malformations by certification status of the midwife: certified nurse midwives (CNM), nurse midwives certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board, and “other” or uncertified midwives who are not certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board. Results Neonatal mortality rates in hospital births attended by certified midwives were significantly lower (3.2/10,000, RR 0.33 95% CI 0.21–0.53) than home births attended by certified midwives (NNM: 10.0/10,000; RR 1) and uncertified midwives (13.7/10,000; RR 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83–2.38]). The difference in neonatal mortality between certified and uncertified midwives at home births did not reach statistical levels (10.0/10,000 births versus 13.7/10,000 births p = 0.2). Conclusions This study confirms that when compared to midwife-attended hospital births, neonatal mortality rates at home births are significantly increased. While NNM was increased in planned homebirths attended by uncertified midwives when compared to certified midwives, this difference was not statistically significant. Neonatal mortality rates at home births were not significantly different in relationship to professional certification status of the birth attendant, whether the delivery was by a certified or an uncertified birth attendant."
https://openalex.org/W2400476087,"Information regarding population structure and genetic connectivity is an important contribution when establishing conservation strategies to manage threatened species. The oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a highly migratory, large-bodied, pelagic shark listed by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List as ""vulnerable"" throughout its range and ""critically endangered"" in the western north Atlantic. In 2014, the species was protected globally under Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), limiting and regulating trade. This study used partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region to determine the population genetic structure of oceanic whitetip sharks across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. 724 base pairs were obtained from 215 individuals that identifed nine polymorphic sites and defined 12 distinct haplotypes. Total nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.0013 and haplotype diversity (h) was 0.5953. The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) evidenced moderate levels of population structure (ɸST = 0.1039) with restricted gene flow between the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, and a strong relationship between the latter region and the Indian Ocean. Even though the oceanic whitetip is a highly migratory animal the results presented here show that their genetic variability is slightly below average of other pelagic sharks. Additionally, this study recommends that at least two populations in the Atlantic Ocean should be considered distinct (eastern and western Atlantic) and conservation efforts should be focused in areas with the greatest genetic diversity by environmental managers."
https://openalex.org/W2398952622,"Fibrosis is a final common pathway leading to loss of kidney function, in which the fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), plays a central role. While previous studies showed that TGF-β antagonism by various means prevents fibrosis in mouse models, clinical approaches based on these findings remain elusive. 1D11 is a neutralizing antibody to all three isoforms of TGF-β. In both adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy and NEP25 podocyte ablation nephropathy, thrice-weekly intraperitoneal administration of 1D11 from the day of disease induction until the mice were sacrificed (day 14 for ADR and day 28 for NEP25), significantly reduced glomerular COL1A2 mRNA accumulation and histological changes. Consistent with our previous findings, proteinuria remained overt in the mice treated with 1D11, suggesting distinct mechanisms for proteinuria and fibrogenesis. Podocyte numbers determined by WT1 staining were significantly reduced in NEP25-model glomeruli as expected, while WT1-positive cells were preserved in mice receiving 1D11. Even when 1D11 was administered after the onset of proteinuria on day 3, 1D11 preserved WT1-positive cell numbers in glomeruli and significantly reduced glomerular scar score (2.5 ± 0.2 [control IgG] vs. 1.8 ± 0.2 [1D11], P < 0.05) and glomerular COL1A2 mRNA expression (19.3 ± 4.4 [control IgG] vs. 8.4 ± 2.4 [1D11] fold increase over the healthy control, P < 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed loss of podocytes and denuded glomerular basement membrane in NEP25 mice with disease, whereas podocytes remained attached to the basement membrane, though effaced and swollen, in those receiving 1D11 from day 3. Together, these data suggest that TGF-β neutralization by 1D11 prevents glomerular fibrosis even when started after the onset of proteinuria. While overt proteinuria and podocyte effacement persist, 1D11 prevents total podocytes detachment, which might be a key event activating fibrogenic events in glomeruli."
https://openalex.org/W2406995154,"A high phosphorus (HP) diet causes disorders of renal function, bone metabolism, and vascular function. We previously demonstrated that DNA microarray analysis is an appropriate method to comprehensively evaluate the effects of a HP diet on kidney dysfunction such as calcification, fibrillization, and inflammation. We reported that type IIb sodium-dependent phosphate transporter is significantly up-regulated in this context. In the present study, we performed DNA microarray analysis to investigate the effects of a HP diet on the liver, which plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism. DNA microarray analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from the livers of rats fed a control diet (containing 0.3% phosphorus) or a HP diet (containing 1.2% phosphorus). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that the HP diet induced down-regulation of genes involved in hepatic amino acid catabolism and lipogenesis, while genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation process were up-regulated. Although genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis were down-regulated in HP diet-fed rats, genes important for the elongation and desaturation reactions of omega-3 and -6 fatty acids were up-regulated. Concentrations of hepatic arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were increased in HP diet-fed rats. These essential fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a transcription factor for fatty acid β-oxidation. Evaluation of the upstream regulators of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that PPARα was activated in the livers of HP diet-fed rats. Furthermore, the serum concentration of fibroblast growth factor 21, a hormone secreted from the liver that promotes fatty acid utilization in adipose tissue as a PPARα target gene, was higher (p = 0.054) in HP diet-fed rats than in control diet-fed rats. These data suggest that a HP diet enhances energy expenditure through the utilization of free fatty acids released via lipolysis of white adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2402321332,"The sequenced genome of the poly-extremophile Exiguobacterium sp. S17, isolated from modern stromatolites at Laguna Socompa (3,570 m), a High-Altitude Andean Lake (HAAL) in Argentinean Puna revealed a putative proteorhodopsin-encoding gene. The HAAL area is exposed to the highest UV irradiation on Earth, making the microbial community living in the stromatolites test cases for survival strategies under extreme conditions. The heterologous expressed protein E17R from Exiguobacterium (248 amino acids, 85% sequence identity to its ortholog ESR from E. sibiricum) was assembled with retinal displaying an absorbance maximum at 524 nm, which makes it a member of the green-absorbing PR-subfamily. Titration down to low pH values (eventually causing partial protein denaturation) indicated a pK value between two and three. Global fitting of data from laser flash-induced absorption changes gave evidence for an early red-shifted intermediate (its formation being below the experimental resolution) that decayed (τ1 = 3.5 μs) into another red-shifted intermediate. This species decayed in a two-step process (τ2 = 84 μs, τ3 = 11 ms), to which the initial state of E17-PR was reformed with a kinetics of 2 ms. Proton transport capability of the HAAL protein was determined by BLM measurements. Additional blue light irradiation reduced the proton current, clearly identifying a blue light absorbing, M-like intermediate. The apparent absence of this intermediate is explained by closely matching formation and decay kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2345596619,"Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) is a type I transmembrane protein and inhibitor of several serine proteases, including hepatocyte growth factor activator and matriptase.

The different truncated soluble forms of HAI-1 were shown to have different inhibitory activities against the natural targets matriptase and HGFA (17.Kojima K. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. Inouye K.

In a pioneering study concerning the inhibitory activity of different truncated forms of rat HAI-1, it was further hypothesized that the non-inhibitory domains (i.e. MANEC, internal domain, the LDLR class A domain, and Kunitz-2) are all important for the regulation of the inhibitory activity of HAI-1, most likely by participating in intramolecular interdomain interactions resulting in different tertiary structures with corresponding varying inhibitory activities (17.Kojima K. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. Inouye K. Roles of functional and structural domains of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 in the inhibition of matriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2478-2487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a first step to provide structural evidence of how the non-inhibitory domains of HAI-1 may contribute to the overall function of the protein, we recently completed a structural characterization of the N-terminal MANEC domain, defining it as a new subclass of the PAN/apple family of domains with numerous examples of regulatory properties as mediators of inter- and intramolecular protein-protein interactions (22.Hong Z. Nowakowski M. Spronk C. Petersen S.V. Andreasen P.A. Koźmiński W. Mulder F.A. Jensen J.K. The solution structure of the MANEC-type domain from hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 reveals an unexpected PAN/apple domain-type fold.Biochem. J. 2015; 466: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to complete the structural characterization of the N-terminal region of HAI-1, from the proposed internal domain through Kunitz-1. Our x-ray crystal structure analysis revealed that the internal domain belongs to the family of polycystic kidney disease (PKD)-like domains. More importantly, the structure presented a condensed v-shaped tertiary structure formed by interdomain interactions between the internal domain and Kunitz-1. We show that the association of the internal domain stimulates the inhibitory activity of Kunitz-1 and that the effect is independent of the target protease. Moreover, the structure provides not only a tool for structure-guide studies of the internal domain of HAI-1 but also the first structural evidence of a functional role for a non-inhibitory domain of HAI-1. Thus, we propose a new mechanism in which the association of an auxiliary domain stimulates the inhibitory capacity of a Kunitz-type inhibitor (i.e. the first structure of an intramolecular interaction between a Kunitz and another domain). Our biochemical analysis also illuminated the role of the 60-loop in matriptase as a rate-limiting factor for macromolecular access to the active site. Finally, our structure revealed the location of a potential integrin binding site in the internal domain with potential implications for the cell surface localization of HAI-1. To express protein with a well defined N terminus, a Kex2 cleavage site was inserted between the α-factor signal peptide and the protein sequence. The PCR product was subcloned into the pPICZαA expression vector (Invitrogen) using the XhoI and SalI restriction sites and linearized by SacI digestion before transformation into P. pastoris X-33 strain (Invitrogen). Protein-producing clones were stored at −80 °C in 15% glycerol. Protein production followed the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). The HAI-1 fragments internal domain (Gly168–Tyr249), IK1 (Gly161–Val303, Gly168–Val303), and K1 (Gln245–Val303) were amplified from human cDNA of full-length HAI-1 splice variant A (Uniprot accession number O43278-1). The N235Q substitution was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to remove the potential N-glycosylation site within the C terminus of the internal domain. Due to the expression tags, the resulting purified HAI-1 fragments contain a Lys-Arg extension in the N terminus and an Asp followed by His6 in the C terminus. To produce the catalytic domain of matriptase, the DNA sequence covering Val615–Val855 was amplified from the human matriptase cDNA (Uniprot accession number Q9Y5Y6). The deletion of the 60-loop (chymotrypsin template numbering) was accomplished by substitution of DDRGFR (Asp660–Arg665) with GG using site-directed mutagenesis. To introduce the StrepII tag in the C terminus of the matriptase catalytic domain, the StrepII tag (SAWSHPQFEK) was fused to the C terminus with an additional (GS)3 linker. For bacterial production of the internal domain, a purified pT7-I vector containing the human HAI-1 fragment Gly168–Tyr249 was transformed into competent BL21 (DE3). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 2× TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of matriptase was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. For the bacterial production of the catalytic domain of matriptase, a pT7 vector containing human matriptase (Gly596–Val855) was transformed into competent Rosetta BL21 (DE3), following the protocol above with the addition of 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) and sonicated on ice. The filtrated supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose containing 20 mm imidazole that had been equilibrated in equilibrium buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) by slow stirring on ice for 1 h. The bound protein was eluted with 400 mm imidazole in equilibrium buffer and dialyzed extensively against equilibrium buffer at 4 °C. A protein purity of >95% was verified by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by A280 nm using the extinction coefficient 18,350 m−1 cm−1 (ProtParam). For the refolding trials, the internal domain protein was denatured by 6 m urea and adjusted to 0.1–0.2 mg/ml. The protein sample was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) and concentrated in 3.5 kDa cut-off spin columns (Amicon). Cleared, filtrated medium from yeast was loaded onto an Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The column-bound protein was washed with equilibration buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. The eluted protein fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and concentrated before size exclusion chromatography (Superdex75 column, GE Healthcare) in the same buffer. Protein fractions were collected, pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. A protein purity of >95% was verified by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2A). Protein folding homogeneity of the proteins was verified by migrating as a single band on native PAGE (Fig. 2B). Protein concentrations of IK1 and K1 were determined by A280 nm using the extinction coefficients 13,940 and 12,090 m−1 cm−1 (ProtParam) and verified by amino acid analysis (in-house service). Cleared, filtrated medium from the yeast was loaded onto a benzamidine column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and washed with equilibration buffer. Bound protein was eluted by 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and neutralized by 10% (v/v) 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. A protein purity of >95% was verified by SDS-PAGE. Proteins containing fractions were pooled, quantified by A280 nm using the extinction coefficient 53,200 m−1 cm−1 (ProtParam), and stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA and sonicated on ice. Inclusion bodies were pelleted at 10,000 × g, washed repeatedly using wash buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100), wash buffer 2 (wash buffer 1 with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100), and wash buffer 3 (wash buffer 1 without Triton X-100), each step followed by centrifugation. The insoluble matter was resuspended in denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea) by slowly stirring on ice for 30 min. The suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose in the presence of 20 mm imidazole under slow stirring on ice for 1 h. Bound protein was eluted with 400 mm imidazole in denaturing buffer and dialyzed extensively against denaturation buffer at room temperature. The protein concentration was adjusted to 0.1–0.2 mg/ml using denaturation buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against refolding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 m urea). Complete autoactivation of the protease preparation was observed as a complete band shift on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), due to the loss of N-terminal residues 596–614 following activation cleavage, during the second dialysis step against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C overnight. The active protease was captured on a benzamidine column equilibrated with storage buffer and eluted with storage buffer supplemented with 1 m arginine. Proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 column equilibrated with storage buffer. Proteins containing fractions were pooled, quantified by A280 nm, and stored at −80 °C. A protein purity of >95% was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The E. coli produced matriptase catalytic domain behaved indistinguishably from the similar protein produced in P. pastoris and was used exclusively for the Ki determinations due to unrestricted availability. Hepsin and plasma kallikrein were prepared using a similar strategy. Protein samples of IK1(N235Q) and IK1(N235Q) extended N-terminally to Gly161 were concentrated to 11 mg/ml using 3.5 kDa cut-off spin columns (Amicon). More than 1000 premade crystallization conditions (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) were screened in a 96-well plate sitting drop setup (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) using robotics (TTP Labtech's mosquito Crystal) with 200 + 200-nl and 200 + 100-nl drops. Diffraction quality crystals were grown from two initial screen conditions after transfer to a hanging drop vapor diffusion setup at 20 °C in 24-well plates (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The IK1(N235Q) crystals appear in 2–3 days after mixing 2 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 28% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.2 m potassium bromide or 25% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m calcium acetate. For the IK1 with the extended N terminus, crystals appeared in 2–3 days after mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 22% (w/v) PEG 6000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.0. Following optimization trials, we obtained protein crystals that diffracted to a resolution of 2.1 Å (Table 1). For x-ray data collection, a single crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cryoprotectants used were either 15% glycerol, 35% (w/v) PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.2 m potassium bromide or, in the case of IK1 with an extended N terminus, 22% (w/v) PEG 6000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.0. The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the Xia2, XDS, and CCP4 program packages (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The A and B chain were kept restrained with a single non-crystallographic symmetry operator throughout the refinement. In addition, TLS was used throughout refinement. The quality of the final model was validated with the wwPDB Validation Server.

https://openalex.org/W2402524873,"Background Difficulties performing a range of physical tasks of daily living have been shown to develop in older populations in a typically observed sequence, known as the hierarchy of loss. Nearly all previous research has been undertaken using populations aged over 75. This study aimed to use cross-sectional and longitudinal data to test for evidence of the hierarchy of loss from midlife onwards. Methods The prevalence of reported difficulty undertaking 16 physical tasks in the MRC National Survey of Health and Development at age 60–64 were calculated, with Mokken scaling used to confirm the hierarchical order. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of reporting difficulty performing tasks at the bottom of the hierarchy (i.e. feeding, washing and/or toileting) at age 60–64 by reported difficulty at the top of the hierarchy (i.e. gripping, walking and/or stair climbing) at age 43. Results At age 60–64, tasks associated with balance, strength and co-ordination, such as climbing stairs, were the first tasks participants reported difficulty with and tasks associated with upper limb mobility, such as feeding yourself, were the last. In a fully-adjusted model, participants who reported difficulty at the top of the hierarchy at age 43 were 2.85 (95% CI: 1.45–5.60) times more likely to report difficulty with tasks at the bottom of the hierarchy at age 60–64. Conclusion This study presents evidence of the hierarchy of loss in a younger population than previously observed suggesting that targeted interventions to prevent functional decline should not be delayed until old age."
https://openalex.org/W2406542767,"The Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS) is a pragmatic cluster-level randomized controlled trial of the effect of an advanced cookstove intervention on pneumonia in children under the age of 5 years (under 5s) in Malawi (www.capstudy.org). The primary outcome of the trial is the incidence of pneumonia during a two-year follow-up period, as diagnosed by healthcare providers who are using the World Health Organization (WHO) integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI) pneumonia assessment protocol and who are blinded to the trial arms. We evaluated the quality of pneumonia assessment in under 5s in this setting via a cross-sectional study of provider-patient encounters at nine outpatient clinics located within the catchment area of 150 village-level clusters enrolled in the trial across the two study locations of Chikhwawa and Karonga, Malawi, between May and June 2015 using the IMCI guidelines as a benchmark. Data were collected using a key equipment checklist, an IMCI pneumonia knowledge test, and a clinical evaluation checklist. The median number of key equipment items available was 6 (range 4 to 7) out of a possible 7. The median score on the IMCI pneumonia knowledge test among 23 clinicians was 75% (range 60% to 89%). Among a total of 176 consultations performed by 15 clinicians, a median of 9 (range 3 to 13) out of 13 clinical evaluation tasks were performed. Overall, the clinicians were adequately equipped for the assessment of sick children, had good knowledge of the IMCI guidelines, and conducted largely thorough clinical evaluations. We recommend the simple pragmatic approach to quality assurance described herein for similar studies conducted in challenging research settings."
https://openalex.org/W2406067297,"Much of our understanding of the function of histone post-translational modifications in metazoans is inferred from their genomic localization and / or extrapolated from yeast studies. For example, acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3 K56Ac) is assumed to be important for transcriptional regulation in metazoan cells based on its occurrence at promoters and its function in yeast. Here we directly assess the function of H3 K56Ac during chromatin disassembly from gene regulatory regions during transcriptional induction in human cells by using mutations that either mimic or prevent H3 K56Ac. Although there is rapid histone H3 disassembly during induction of some estrogen receptor responsive genes, depletion of the histone chaperone ASF1A/B, which is required for H3 K56 acetylation, has no effect on chromatin disassembly at these regions. During the course of this work, we found that all the commercially available antibodies to H3 K56Ac are non-specific in human cells and in Drosophila. We used H3-YFP fusions to show that the H3 K56Q mutation can promote chromatin disassembly from regulatory regions of some estrogen responsive genes in the context of transcriptional induction. However, neither the H3 K56R nor K56Q mutation significantly altered chromatin disassembly dynamics by FRAP analysis. These results indicate that unlike the situation in yeast, human cells do not use H3 K56Ac to promote chromatin disassembly from regulatory regions or from the genome in general. Furthermore, our work highlights the need for rigorous characterization of the specificity of antibodies to histone post-translational modifications in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2397414769,"Children of mothers with gestational diabetes have greater risk of developing hypertension but little is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that high maternal concentrations of leptin during pregnancy, which are present in mothers with gestational diabetes and/or obesity, alter blood pressure, vascular structure and vascular function in offspring. Wildtype (WT) offspring of hyperleptinemic, normoglycemic, Leprdb/+ dams were compared to genotype matched offspring of WT-control dams. Vascular function was assessed in male offspring at 6, and at 31 weeks of age after half the offspring had been fed a high fat, high sucrose diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. Blood pressure was increased by HFD but not affected by maternal hyperleptinemia. On a standard diet, offspring of hyperleptinemic dams had outwardly remodeled mesenteric arteries and an enhanced vasodilatory response to insulin. In offspring of WT but not Leprdb/+ dams, HFD induced vessel hypertrophy and enhanced vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine, while HFD reduced insulin responsiveness in offspring of hyperleptinemic dams. Offspring of hyperleptinemic dams had stiffer arteries regardless of diet. Therefore, while maternal hyperleptinemia was largely beneficial to offspring vascular health under a standard diet, it had detrimental effects in offspring fed HFD. These results suggest that circulating maternal leptin concentrations may interact with other factors in the pre- and post -natal environments to contribute to altered vascular function in offspring of diabetic pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2400910220,"To investigate if the detrimental impact of year of entering education in preterm infants persists into adolescence.Preterm infants are often enrolled in school a year earlier than would be expected if this decision is based on their actual date of birth rather than their due date. Initially these infants appear to do disproportionately worse than those who do not 'skip' a year. However, it is unclear if this effect remains as the infants grow, to have an important effect on long term achievements in education.A cohort study, drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The exposure measurement was gestational age (defined as preterm (<37 weeks gestation) or term (37-42 weeks)). The primary outcome was a low score at the Key Stage 4 (KS4) educational assessment or receiving special educational needs support (both at age 16). We derived conditional regression models matching preterm to term infants on their date of birth (DOB), their expected date of delivery (EDD), or their expected date of delivery and year of school entry.After matching for DOB, preterm infants had an increased odds of SEN (OR 1.57 (1.33-1.86)) and the association remained after adjusting for potential confounders (OR 1.39 (1.14-1.68)). The association remained in the analysis matching for EDD (fully adjusted OR 1.43 (1.17-1.74)) but attenuated after restricting to those infants who were enrolled in school in the same year as the control infants (fully adjusted OR 1.21 (0.97-1.52)). There was less evidence for an impact of prematurity on the KS4 score (Matched for DOB; OR 1.10 (0.91 to 1.34), matched for EDD OR 1.17 (0.96 to 1.42) and EDD and same year of schooling, OR 1.00 (0.80 to 1.26)).This modifiable effect of going to school a year earlier than predicted by their due date appears to have measurable consequences for ex-preterm infants in adolescence and is likely to limit adulthood opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2399455827,"Insights gained from multilevel computational models of biological systems can be translated into real-life applications only if the model correctness has been verified first. One of the most frequently employed in silico techniques for computational model verification is model checking. Traditional model checking approaches only consider the evolution of numeric values, such as concentrations, over time and are appropriate for computational models of small scale systems (e.g. intracellular networks). However for gaining a systems level understanding of how biological organisms function it is essential to consider more complex large scale biological systems (e.g. organs). Verifying computational models of such systems requires capturing both how numeric values and properties of (emergent) spatial structures (e.g. area of multicellular population) change over time and across multiple levels of organization, which are not considered by existing model checking approaches. To address this limitation we have developed a novel approximate probabilistic multiscale spatio-temporal meta model checking methodology for verifying multilevel computational models relative to specifications describing the desired/expected system behaviour. The methodology is generic and supports computational models encoded using various high-level modelling formalisms because it is defined relative to time series data and not the models used to generate it. In addition, the methodology can be automatically adapted to case study specific types of spatial structures and properties using the spatio-temporal meta model checking concept. To automate the computational model verification process we have implemented the model checking approach in the software tool Mule (http://mule.modelchecking.org). Its applicability is illustrated against four systems biology computational models previously published in the literature encoding the rat cardiovascular system dynamics, the uterine contractions of labour, the Xenopus laevis cell cycle and the acute inflammation of the gut and lung. Our methodology and software will enable computational biologists to efficiently develop reliable multilevel computational models of biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2395021995,"β-thalasemia major (β-TM) patients often suffer from various vascular complications together with increased oxidative stress. Hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy) has been defined as a risk factor for these complications. Genetic polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T has been shown to cause Hhcy particularly in individuals with low B-vitamins. However, the status of homocysteine (hcy) in β-TM has not yet been adequately defined.To evaluate the genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677T among β-TM patients and its prospective contribution to Hhcy and related oxidative changes.Genotyping for MTHFR C677T was done by PCR-RFLP technique. Plasma hcy, vitamin B12, folate, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), total nitric oxide (NOx) and lipid profile were determined in 66 β-TM patients and 66 control subjects of matched age and sex.The prevalence of MTHFR 677TT genotype was significant among β-TM patients (12%) compared to (3%) controls (OR = 4.9, 95%CI:1.2-24.2,P = 0.03). A strong association between Hhcy and MTHFR TT genotype was observed (OR = 7.7, 95%CI:2.8-20.9) where all β-TM patients with TT genotype were hyperhomocystienemic (≥ 15 μmol/l) and having sub-optimal folate level than those with CT or CC genotypes. Hyperhomocystienemic patients have suffered from increased oxidative stress characterized by significant increase in plasma MDA and oxLDL, and a significant reduction of plasma TAC and total NOx. Lipid profile of those patients was severely affected indicated by reduction in HDL and HDL/LDL and elevation in atherogenic index as compared with CC genotype. Other measured parameters were not significantly different among β-TM patients with different MTHFR genotypes.This study suggests that Egyptian β-TM patients with MTHFR 677TT genotype could be at increasing risk of developing Hhcy particularly with folate deficiency. This state of Hhcy may account potentially for most oxidative changes and atherogenic vascular complications frequently reported in β-TM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2395792774,"Hypotheses of hybrid origin are common. Here we use next generation sequencing to test a hybrid hypothesis for a non-model insect with a large genome. We compared a putative hybrid triploid stick insect species (Acanthoxyla geisovii) with its putative paternal diploid taxon (Clitarchus hookeri), a relationship that provides clear predictions for the relative genetic diversity within each genome. The parental taxon is expected to have comparatively low allelic diversity that is nested within the diversity of the hybrid daughter genome. The scale of genome sequencing required was conveniently achieved by extracting mRNA and sequencing cDNA to examine expressed allelic diversity. This allowed us to test hybrid-progenitor relationships among non-model organisms with large genomes and different ploidy levels. Examination of thousands of independent loci avoids potential problems produced by the silencing of parts of one or other of the parental genomes, a phenomenon sometimes associated with the process of stabilisation of a hybrid genome. Transcript assembles were assessed for evidence of paralogs and/or alternative splice variants before proceeding. Comparison of transcript assemblies was not an appropriate measure of genetic variability, but by mapping reads back to clusters derived from each species we determined levels of allelic diversity. We found greater cDNA sequence diversity among alleles in the putative hybrid species (Acanthoxyla geisovii) than the non-hybrid. The allelic diversity within the putative paternal species (Clitachus hookeri) nested within the hybrid-daughter genome, supports the current view of a hybrid-progenitor relationship for these stick insect species. Next generation sequencing technology provides opportunities for testing evolutionary hypotheses with non-model organisms, including, as here, genomes that are large due to polyploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2396016354,"The efficacy and bias of signal transduction induced by a drug at a target protein are closely associated with the benefits and side effects of the drug. In particular, partial agonist activity and G-protein/β-arrestin-biased agonist activity for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, the family with the most target proteins of launched drugs, are key issues in drug discovery. However, designing GPCR drugs with appropriate efficacy and bias is challenging because the dynamic mechanism of signal transduction induced by ligand—receptor interactions is complicated. Here, we identified the G-protein/β-arrestin-linked fluctuating network, which initiates large-scale conformational changes, using sub-microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) with a diverse collection of ligands and correlation analysis of their G protein/β-arrestin efficacy. The G-protein-linked fluctuating network extends from the ligand-binding site to the G-protein-binding site through the connector region, and the β-arrestin-linked fluctuating network consists of the NPxxY motif and adjacent regions. We confirmed that the averaged values of fluctuation in the fluctuating network detected are good quantitative indexes for explaining G protein/β-arrestin efficacy. These results indicate that short-term MD simulation is a practical method to predict the efficacy and bias of any compound for GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2401520614,"Tgif1 and Tgif2 are transcriptional repressors that inhibit the transcriptional response to transforming growth factor β signaling, and can repress gene expression by direct binding to DNA. Loss of function mutations in TGIF1 are associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE) in humans. In mice, embryos lacking both Tgif1 and Tgif2 fail to complete gastrulation, and conditional double null embryos that survive past gastrulation have HPE and do not survive past mid-gestation. Here we show that in mice of a relatively pure C57BL/6 strain background, loss of Tgif1 alone results in defective axial patterning and altered expression of Hoxc6. The primary defects in Tgif1 null embryos are the presence of extra ribs on the C7 vertebra, consistent with a posterior transformation phenotype. In addition we observed defective cervical vertebrae, primarily C1-C5, in both adult mice and embryos that lacked Tgif1. The combination of Tgif1 and Tgif2 mutations increases the severity and penetrance of the posterior transformation phenotype, without altering the type of defects seen. Similarly, exposure of Tgif1 mutant embryos to retinoic acid at E8.5 increased the severity and penetrance of the Tgif1 phenotype. This suggests that Tgif1 and Tgif2 regulate axial patterning and that reduced TGIF function sensitizes embryos to the effects of retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2405186199,"Forest management could potentially affect organisms in all forest habitats. However, aquatic communities in water-filled tree-holes may be especially sensitive because of small population sizes, the risk of drought and potential dispersal limitation. We set up artificial tree holes in forest stands subject to different management intensities in two regions in Germany and assessed the influence of local environmental properties (tree-hole opening type, tree diameter, water volume and water temperature) as well as regional drivers (forest management intensity, tree-hole density) on tree-hole insect communities (not considering other organisms such as nematodes or rotifers), detritus content, oxygen and nutrient concentrations. In addition, we compared data from artificial tree holes with data from natural tree holes in the same area to evaluate the methodological approach of using tree-hole analogues. We found that forest management had strong effects on communities in artificial tree holes in both regions and across the season. Abundance and species richness declined, community composition shifted and detritus content declined with increasing forest management intensity. Environmental variables, such as tree-hole density and tree diameter partly explained these changes. However, dispersal limitation, indicated by effects of tree-hole density, generally showed rather weak impacts on communities. Artificial tree holes had higher water temperatures (on average 2°C higher) and oxygen concentrations (on average 25% higher) than natural tree holes. The abundance of organisms was higher but species richness was lower in artificial tree holes. Community composition differed between artificial and natural tree holes. Negative management effects were detectable in both tree-hole systems, despite their abiotic and biotic differences. Our results indicate that forest management has substantial and pervasive effects on tree-hole communities and may alter their structure and functioning. We furthermore conclude that artificial tree-hole analogues represent a useful experimental alternative to test effects of changes in forest management on natural communities."
https://openalex.org/W2396792185,"Survival bias may unduly impact genetic association with complex diseases; gene-specific survival effects may further complicate such investigations. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex phenotype for which little is understood about gene-specific survival effects; yet, such information can offer insight into refining genetic associations, improving replications, and can provide candidate genes for both mortality risk and improved survivorship in CAD. Building on our previous work, the purpose of this current study was to: evaluate LSAMP SNP-specific hazards for all-cause mortality post-catheterization in a larger cohort of our CAD cases; and, perform additional replication in an independent dataset. We examined two LSAMP SNPs—rs1462845 and rs6788787—using CAD case-only Cox proportional hazards regression for additive genetic effects, censored on time-to-all-cause mortality or last follow-up among Caucasian subjects from the Catheterization Genetics Study (CATHGEN; n = 2,224) and the Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study (IMHC; n = 3,008). Only after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, histories of smoking, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension (HR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.01–1.22, p = 0.032), rs1462845 conferred significantly increased hazards of all-cause mortality among CAD cases. Even after controlling for multiple covariates, but in only the primary cohort, rs6788787 conferred significantly improved survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.92, p = 0.002). Post-hoc analyses further stratifying by sex and disease severity revealed replicated effects for rs1462845: even after adjusting for aforementioned covariates and coronary interventional procedures, males with severe burden of CAD had significantly amplified hazards of death with the minor variant of rs1462845 in both cohorts (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08–1.55, p = 0.00456; replication HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05–1.49, p = 0.013). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed unique cohort-specific genotype effects on survival. Additional analyses demonstrated that the homozygous risk genotype (‘A/A’) fully explained the increased hazard in both cohorts. None of the post-hoc analyses in control subjects were significant for any model. This suggests that genetic effects of rs1462845 on survival are unique to CAD presence. This represents formal, replicated evidence of genetic contribution of rs1462845 to increased risk for all-cause mortality; the contribution is unique to CAD case status and specific to males with severe burden of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2399118569,"Background Increased understanding of the relationships between different symptom clusters involved in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) could guide empirical research and clinical practice. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether hyperarousal and avoidance mediated the relationship between re-experiencing and dysphoria in parents of children diagnosed with cancer. Methods Longitudinal data from parents of children receiving cancer therapy were used. PTSS were assessed using the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version at one week (T1), two (T2) and four months (T3) after diagnosis. Mediation analyses for multiple mediators were conducted for mothers (n = 122) and fathers (n = 121), respectively. The mediation model tested the assumption that the PTSS symptom clusters hyperarousal and avoidance mediated the relationship between re-experiencing and dysphoria. Results For fathers, none of the hypothesized mediators were significant. For mothers, hyperarousal mediated the relationship between re-experiencing and dysphoria, but avoidance did not. Conclusions Results suggest that hyperarousal is important for the development of dysphoria in mothers, supporting use of interventions targeting such symptoms in the early and ongoing period following the child’s diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2402861291,"Sequential affect dynamics generated during the interaction of intimate dyads, such as married couples, are associated with a cascade of effects-some good and some bad-on each partner, close family members, and other social contacts. Although the effects are well documented, the probabilistic structures associated with micro-social processes connected to the varied outcomes remain enigmatic. Using extant data we developed a method of classifying and subsequently generating couple dynamics using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM). Our findings indicate that several key aspects of existing models of marital interaction are inadequate: affect state emissions and their durations, along with the expected variability differences between distressed and nondistressed couples are present but highly nuanced; and most surprisingly, heterogeneity among highly satisfied couples necessitate that they be divided into subgroups. We review how this unsupervised learning technique generates plausible dyadic sequences that are sensitive to relationship quality and provide a natural mechanism for computational models of behavioral and affective micro-social processes."
https://openalex.org/W4243949213,"The search for traits that make alien species invasive has mostly concentrated on comparing successful invaders and different comparison groups with respect to average trait values. By contrast, little attention has been paid to trait variability among invaders. Here, we combine an analysis of trait differences between invasive and non-invasive species with a comparison of multidimensional trait variability within these two species groups. We collected data on biological and distributional traits for 1402 species of the native, non-woody vascular plant flora of Austria. We then compared the subsets of species recorded and not recorded as invasive aliens anywhere in the world, respectively, first, with respect to the sampled traits using univariate and multiple regression models; and, second, with respect to their multidimensional trait diversity by calculating functional richness and dispersion metrics. Attributes related to competitiveness (strategy type, nitrogen indicator value), habitat use (agricultural and ruderal habitats, occurrence under the montane belt), and propagule pressure (frequency) were most closely associated with invasiveness. However, even the best multiple model, including interactions, only explained a moderate fraction of the differences in invasive success. In addition, multidimensional variability in trait space was even larger among invasive than among non-invasive species. This pronounced variability suggests that invasive success has a considerable idiosyncratic component and is probably highly context specific. We conclude that basing risk assessment protocols on species trait profiles will probably face hardly reducible uncertainties."
https://openalex.org/W2403389385,"Orkney, north of mainland Scotland, has the world’s highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS); vitamin D deficiency, a marker of low UV exposure, is also common in Scotland. Strong associations have been identified between vitamin D deficiency and MS, and between UV exposure and MS independent of vitamin D, although causal relationships remain to be confirmed. We aimed to compare plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in Orkney and mainland Scotland, and establish the determinants of vitamin D status in Orkney. We compared mean vitamin D and prevalence of deficiency in cross-sectional study data from participants in the Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) and controls in the Scottish Colorectal Cancer Study (SOCCS). We used multivariable regression to identify factors associated with vitamin D levels in Orkney. Mean (standard deviation) vitamin D was significantly higher among ORCADES than SOCCS participants (35.3 (18.0) and 31.7 (21.2), respectively). Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was lower in ORCADES than SOCCS participants (6.6% to 16.2% p = 1.1 x 10−15). Older age, farming occupations and foreign holidays were significantly associated with higher vitamin D in Orkney. Although mean vitamin D levels are higher in Orkney than mainland Scotland, this masks variation within the Orkney population which may influence MS risk."
https://openalex.org/W2405508014,"The characteristics of the on- and off-responses in the human diabetic retina by a “long-duration” multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) paradigm were investigated. Changes in the retinal antagonistic interaction were also evaluated in the early stage of diabetes mellitus (DM). Twenty type II diabetic patients with no or mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and twenty-one age-matched healthy controls were recruited for “long-duration” mfERG measurements. A 61-hexagon mfERG stimulus was displayed under two chromatic conditions (white/black and blue/black) at matched luminance. The amplitudes and implicit times of the on-response components (N1, P1 and N2) and off-response (P2) components were analysed. The blue stimulation generally triggered greater mfERG amplitudes in P1, N2 and P2 (p<0.05) than those from white stimulation in both control and diabetic groups. The diabetic group showed significantly greater N2 amplitude than the controls under white stimulation in mid-retinal regions (Rings 2 and 4) (p<0.05). When the stimulus was changed from white to blue, the diabetic group showed a smaller percentage change in N2 amplitude than the controls in peripheral retinal region (Ring 5) (p<0.02). When a stimulus is changed from white (broad-band spectral stimulation) to blue (narrow-band spectral stimulation), a decrease in the involvement of lateral antagonism would be expected. The larger amplitude of the on-response component (N2) in the diabetic patients suggested an imbalance of lateral antagonism, and the lesser percentage change of N2 amplitude in the diabetic group may indicate an impairment of the cross-talk at the middle retinal level in early stages of DM."
https://openalex.org/W2406341484,"Background Platinum (Pt)-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, resistance is a major limitation. Reduced intratumoral drug accumulation is an important mechanism of platinum resistance. Our group previously demonstrated a significant correlation between tissue Pt concentration and tumor response to Pt-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in lung cancer. We hypothesized that increased Pt concentration in radical cystectomy (RC) specimens would correlate with improved pathologic response to Pt-based NAC in MIBC. Methods A cohort of 19 clinically annotated, archived, fresh frozen RC specimens from patients with MIBC treated with Pt-based NAC was identified [ypT0 (pathologic complete response, pCR), N = 4; ≤ypT1N0M0 (pathologic partial response, pPR), N = 6; ≥ypT2 (minimal pathologic response/progression), N = 9)]. RC specimens from 2 patients with MIBC who did not receive NAC and 1 treated with a non-Pt containing NAC regimen were used as negative controls. Total Pt concentration in normal adjacent urothelial tissue and bladder tumors from RC specimens was measured by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results Total Pt concentration in normal urothelium differed by tumor pathologic response (P = 0.011). Specimens with pCR had the highest Pt concentrations compared to those with pPR (P = 0.0095) or no response/progression (P = 0.020). There was no significant difference in Pt levels in normal urothelium and tumor between pPR and no response/progression groups (P = 0.37; P = 0.25, respectively). Conclusions: Our finding of increased intracellular Pt in RC specimens with pCR following NAC for MIBC compared to those with residual disease suggests that enhanced Pt accumulation may be an important determinant of Pt sensitivity. Factors that modulate intracellular Pt concentration, such as expression of Pt transporters, warrant further investigation as predictive biomarkers of response to Pt-based NAC in MIBC."
https://openalex.org/W2405953577,"Dictyostelium discoideum has been used largely as a model organism to study the organization and function of the endocytic pathway. Here we describe dense structures present in D. discoideum endocytic compartments, which we named pycnosomes. Pycnosomes are constitutively secreted in the extracellular medium, from which they can be recovered by differential centrifugation. We identified the most abundant protein present in secreted pycnosomes, that we designated SctA. SctA defines a new family of proteins with four members in D. discoideum, and homologous proteins in other protists and eumetazoa. We developed a monoclonal antibody specific for SctA and used it to further characterize secreted and intracellular pycnosomes. Within cells, immunofluorescence as well as electron microscopy identified pycnosomes as SctA-enriched dense structures in the lumen of endocytic compartments. Pycnosomes are occasionally seen in continuity with intra-endosomal membranes, particularly in U18666A-treated cells where intraluminal budding is highly enhanced. While the exact nature, origin and cellular function of pycnosomes remain to be established, this study provides a first description of these structures as well as a characterization of reagents that can be used for further studies."

These reconstructions were then used to calculate NLC volume. The NLC axis in each case was determined according to a polygonal model and to 2nd, 3rd and 4th degree polynomials. From these models, NLC sectional areas and length were determined. For each variable, descriptive statistics and normality tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk) were established.Time for segmentation, NLC volume, axis, sectional areas and length.Mean processing time was around 30 seconds for segmenting each canal. All the variables generated were normally distributed. Measurements obtained using the four models polygonal, 2nd, 3rd and 4th degree polynomial, respectively, were: mean canal length 14.74, 14.3, 14.80, and 15.03 mm; mean sectional area 15.15, 11.77, 11.43, and 11.56 mm2; minimum sectional area 8.69, 7.62, 7.40, and 7.19 mm2; and mean depth of minimum sectional area (craniocaudal) 7.85, 7.71, 8.19, and 8.08 mm.The method proposed automatically reconstructs the NLC on CT scans. Using these reconstructions, morphometric measurements can be calculated from NLC axis estimates based on polygonal and 2nd, 3rd and 4th polynomial models."
https://openalex.org/W2405119049,"Colonoscopy is performed on patients across a broad spectrum of demographic characteristics. These characteristics may aggregate by patient insurance provider and influence bowel preparation quality and the prevalence of adenomas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of insurance status and suboptimal bowel preparation, recommendation for an early repeat colonoscopy due to suboptimal bowel preparation, adenoma detection rate (ADR), and advanced ADR (AADR).This is a cohort study of outpatient colonoscopies (n = 3113) at a single academic medical center. Patient insurance status was categorized into five groups: 1) Medicare < 65y; 2) Medicare ≥ 65y; 3) Tricare/VA; 4) Medicaid/Colorado Indigent Care Program (CICP); and 5) commercial insurance. We used multivariable logistic or linear regression modeling to estimate the risks for the association between patient insurance and suboptimal bowel preparation, recommendation for an early repeat colonoscopy due to suboptimal bowel preparation, ADR, and AADR. Models were adjusted for appropriate covariates.Medicare patients < 65y (OR 4.91; 95% CI: 3.25-7.43) and Medicaid/CICP patients (OR 4.23; 95% CI: 2.65-7.65) were more likely to have a suboptimal preparation compared to commercial insurance patients. Medicare patients < 65y (OR 5.58; 95% CI: 2.85-10.92) and Medicaid/CICP patients (OR 3.64; CI: 1.60-8.28) were more likely to receive a recommendation for an early repeat colonoscopy compared to commercial insurance patients. Medicare patients < 65y had a significantly higher adjusted ADR (OR 1.50; 95% CI: 1.03-2.18) and adjusted AADR (OR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.15-3.44) compared to commercial insurance patients.Understanding the reasons for the higher rate of a suboptimal bowel preparation in Medicare < 65y and Medicaid/CICP patients and reducing this rate is critical to improving colonoscopy outcomes and reducing healthcare costs in these populations."
