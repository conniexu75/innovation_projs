https://openalex.org/W2004605196,"Local synthesis seems to be decisive for the selective secretion of 19S immunoglobulin M into parotid secretions. The ""transport piece"" is apparently not involved in the secretion of immunoglobulin M, for there is no association between the two components. The possible significance of the normal association of transport piece with secreted immunoglobulin A remains to be clarified."

https://openalex.org/W1669109239,"Abstract Comparative determination of high affinity binding activity for cortisol and corticosterone in the sera of various species by equilibrium dialysis indicated considerable differences, which were independent of the ratio of cortisol to corticosterone present in the blood plasma. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) was isolated from pooled rabbit serum by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, gel filtration over Sephadex G-200, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Ammonium sulfate fractionation was found useful as a preliminary purification step. A quantity of 13.5 mg of pure CBG was obtained from 2 liters of serum, with an over-all 6200-fold purification and 50 to 60% yield. The protein was homogeneous by free boundary and paper electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity at different concentrations, and diffusion. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis with antiserum to rabbit serum indicated a pure α-globulin; no precipitation was obtained with antisera to human serum, to rat serum, or to guinea pig serum. Amino acid and carbohydrate composition showed a general similarity to human CBG, in spite of distinct differences in certain residues. The extrapolated sedimentation coefficient was found to be s020,w = 3.55 S; diffusion coefficient, D20,w = 7.02 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1; electrophoretic mobility at pH 8.6, Γ/2 = 5.1 x 10-5 cm2 volt-1 sec-1; extinction coefficient at 279 mµ, E1%1 cm = 8.4; partial specific volume, v = 0.695 ml per g; and frictional ratio, f/f0 = 1.37. A molecular weight of 40,700 was calculated from sedimentation velocity and diffusion data. The pure CBG, isolated under conditions of saturation with endogenous corticosterone and added cortisol-4-14C, contained 1 mole of corticosteroid per 40,700 g of CBG; the number of high affinity binding sites was determined to be n = 1. The association constants at 4° and 37° were k = 9.0 x 108 m-1 and 4.7 x 107 m-1, respectively. Thermodynamic calculations gave negative enthalpy change and negative entropy change for the interaction. Removal of corticosteroid from the isolated pure CBG by gel filtration at 45° resulted in loss of binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519630882,"A thyroxine-binding globulin has been isolated in highly purified form from human plasma. The purification procedure consisted of the following steps: (a) fractionation of plasma with ammonium sulfate, (b) zone electrophoresis on an LKB Porath cellulose column, (c) re-electrophoresis on the Porath column, (d) chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, (e) gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 or G-200, and (f) preparative electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The isolated thyroxine-binding protein was homogeneous when analyzed by electrophoresis in starch gel, immunoelectrophoresis, and disc electrophoresis. The protein sedimented as a single component in the ultracentrifuge when analyzed by the methods of sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity. The weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 58,000; the sedimentation constant, s20, w0, is 3.92 × 10−13 sec. The thyroxine-binding globulin is a glycoprotein containing 6.70% neutral hexose, 2.38% sialic acid, 3.31% glucosamine, and 0.70% galactosamine. Based on the results of electrophoretic analysis on paper, the final product of thyroxinebinding globulin exhibited a high affinity for thyroxine, with a binding constant of the order of 109M−1. However, the maximal binding capacity of the protein for thyroxine appears to be reduced to about 25% of the expected value if binding is assumed to take place at a single strong binding site on the protein. The isolated thyroxine-binding protein was indistinguishable from endogenous thyroxine-binding α-globulin of serum when analyzed by electrophoresis in starch gel, in polyacrylamide gel, and on paper."
https://openalex.org/W1600009535,"Abstract The optical rotatory properties of a myeloma globulin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and a normal individual IgG in the far ultraviolet were investigated by rotatory dispersion, circular dichroism, and absorption spectroscopy. The optical rotatory dispersion of the myeloma immunoglobulin displayed two peaks, one at 205 mµ and the other at 210 mµ, and a trough at 228 mµ, a lesser one at 230 mµ, and a deeper one at 198 mµ. The normal individual γ-globulin displayed a peak at 208 mµ and a trough at 228 to 230 mµ. The rotatory dispersion in acid media was suggestive of the formation of right handed α helices in both immunoglobulins. Circular dichroic analysis of the myeloma IgG showed seven dichroic bands, at 202 mµ (+), 217 mµ (-), 225 mµ (-), 242 mµ (-), 265 mµ (+), 284 mµ (+), and the beginning of a negative band centered below 195 mµ (≃192.5 mµ). Application of the Kronig-Kramers transform gave an optical rotatory dispersion curve compatible with the one obtained experimentally. The peptide bond extinction, calculated from far ultraviolet absorption spectra, displayed a hypochromicity for both immunoglobulins. The far ultraviolet optical rotatory dispersion analyses of the myeloma IgG cleaved by oxidative sulfitolysis showed the disulfide bonds joining the heavy and light chains to be essential for the maintenance of certain electronic transitions present in the native protein. The major transitions, however, appeared to be unaffected by this treatment. Comparison of the Cotton effects of the sulfitolyzed product in acid with those of the whole molecule in acid (pH 2.4) showed that these S—S bonds are important in restricting conformation change in the presence of this denaturing agent."

https://openalex.org/W1492289566,"Abstract The 5 S fragments of rabbit immunoglobulin G were prepared by digestion with pepsin or with CNBr. Cleavage of these fragments with trypsin led to the localization of the positions of these splits on the heavy chain. The COOH-terminal residue released by carboxypeptidase A from the papsin-produced 5 S fragment was leucine. The pepsin-5 S fragment was reduced and aminoethylated to yield the 3.5 S fragment. Trypsin digestion of this fragment yielded two decapeptides which represent the COOH terminus of the heavy chain part of the 3.5 S fragment. The major one, obtained in 65% yield, had the sequence Ser-Lys-Pro-Thr-AE-Cys-Pro-Pro-Pro-Glu-Leu. The other decapeptide which was obtained in a smaller yield (20%), had the same amino acid composition but a different carbohydrate composition. When the CNBr-5 S fragment was digested with pepsin and then reduced and aminoethylated, it yielded a 3.5 S fragment. Digestion of the latter product with trypsin released the same decapeptides mentioned above. The COOH-terminal sequence of the CNBr-5 S fragment was shown to be Asp-Thr-Leu-homoserine. Thus, the order of the size of the various fragments produced by different cleavages is: CNBr g pepsin g trypsin. The positions of the various cleavages were correlated with the known sequence of the heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W2005221969,"Immunoglobulin A (gammaA) myeloma proteins secreted by plasma-cell tumors of mice are of two types, a common four-chain molecule and a rare two-chain (3.9S) molecule. The close similarity between two-chain gammaA molecules and four-chain gammaA molecules and their polymers is demonstrated in tryptic peptide maps of isolated polypeptide chains and by precipitin reactions with rabbit antiserums to gammaA immzunoglobulins. However, a difference between these two types is distinguishable with homologous antiserums. Homologous antiserums to two-chain gammaA immunoglobulins are specific and do not cross-react with four-chain gammaA immutnoglobulins."
https://openalex.org/W1602195126,"Abstract Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to whole body x-irradiation. One hour after 900 r and 2000 r and 2, 4, and 6 days after 900 r, their livers were perfused for 6 hours with defibrinated rabbit blood, with l-lysine-1-14C and 250 mg of glucose infused for the first 4 hours. Net synthesis of several specific plasma proteins was estimated by serological measurements of changes in their concentration in perfusate. Net synthesis of albumin was decreased a maximum of 25% 4 to 6 days after 900 r, which was essentially the same as that evidenced by livers from unirradiated rats fasted for 5 days. Net synthesis of fibrinogen, estimated by chemical as well as serological measurements, was about 1.5 times the normal rate 4 days after 900 r. Net synthesis of α1-acid glycoprotein was increased at 2, 4, and 6 days after 900 r, with approximately 5 times the normal rate at 4 days. Although α2 (acute phase)-globulin was present at low concentration in the plasma of some irradiated rats at the time of hepatectomy, no evidence was obtained for net synthesis of this protein during perfusion of their livers. Based on the premise that the half-lives of the messenger RNA for rat albumin and fibrinogen are less than 3 hours, our observation that 900 r and 2000 r of whole body x-irradiation failed to suppress synthesis of these proteins is interpreted to mean that x-irradiation in these doses does not damage the DNA of intact rats enough to interfere significantly with transcription of these species of messenger RNA. Perfusions of livers from irradiated rats did not differ from controls with regard to bile secretion, net changes in urea and α-amino acid nitrogen, oxidation of l-lysine-1-14C to 14CO2, or incorporation of 14C-lysine into plasma proteins other than albumin and fibrinogen."

https://openalex.org/W2146877887,"Abstract A method has been developed for fragmenting immunoglobulin light and heavy polypeptide chains at the cysteinyl residues that participate in intrachain disulfide bridges. The method involves the quantitative blockage of positive charges associated with lysyl and arginyl residues, the reduction and subsequent aminoethylation of disulfide bridges, and the treatment of aminoethylated, blocked chains with trypsin to yield the desired blocked peptide fragments. Lysine and arginine are modified by succinic anhydride and cyclohexanedione respectively, to yield stable trypsin-insensitive residues. The blocked peptides of heavy and light chains are separated on the basis of size by gel filtration chromatography in either 8 m urea or 0.01 m ammonium bicarbonate. The blocked peptides from a k-type Bence-Jones protein can be resolved into six chromatographic peaks. The peaks, in order of their elution, have been assigned loci within the known over-all structure of a Bence-Jones protein: E and D have not been characterized and probably represent partial digestion products; C and C' probably correspond to regions between the two intramolecular disulfide bridges; B contains the peptide corresponding to the switch region as judged by amino-terminal analysis and amino acid composition; A contains the carboxyl-terminal cysteinyl residue and corresponds to peptide fragments from the amino and carboxylterminal regions of the starting Bence-Jones protein. The peptide patterns obtained from whole normal mouse and human light chain are closely similar to the Bence-Jones profile and strongly suggest that the disulfide bridge pattern found for Bence-Jones proteins applies to the majority of κ and λ chains in the whole normal light chain population. A comparison of the gel filtration patterns of a γ2a mouse myeloma heavy chain and whole normal mouse heavy chains also indicates that a single heavy disulfide bridge pattern is largely conserved in the normal population. The similarity found between heavy and light chain peptide profiles supports the idea that heavy chains and light chains arose from a common ancestral gene as a result of gene duplications and mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2019427211,Two of the hexane-soluble products of metabolism of lindane in susceptible and resistant houseflies were tentatively identified as isomers of pentachlorocyclohexene by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. One isomer was identical with the pentachlorocyclohexene obtained by mild alkaline dehydrochlorination of lindane and is apparently the form found in previous studies of metabolism; the second is now reported for the first time.

No lesions resulted if concanavalin A was adsorbed with insoluble (a2)- macroglobulin or if mice were first treated with nitrogen mustard.

https://openalex.org/W2001828622,"The 3S (gamma1), 2S (gamma2), and 0.5S (gamma2) fractions of human plasma are heterogeneous in protein composition. Although each fraction contained a relatively small amount of protein antigenically related to the immunoglobulin light chains, most of the proteins were unrelated to immunogloublin G or its light chains. Of the 3S (gamma1)-globulins the greater part was immunochemically identical to carbonic anhydrase B and had carbonic anhydrase activity. These findings explain earlier reports of an immunochemical similarity between 3S (gamma1)-globulins and immunoglobulin light chains in spite of marked differences in amino acid and peptide composition between the two. Apparently not all plasma gamma-globulins are necessarily immunoglobulins."

Inhibition by trans-3-methyl-dl-proline was reversed by chloramphenicol. The antagonistic effects of cis-3-methyl-dl-proline were prevented or partially reversed by chloramphenicol during the first 2 hours after addition of the inhibitor but became irreversible after this time period. As indicated by experiments in which tritiated imino acid was used, the trans, but not the cis, stereoisomer was incorporated into actinomycins. In both cases the protein fraction was labeled."
