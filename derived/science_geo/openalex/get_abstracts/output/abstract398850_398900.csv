https://openalex.org/W2075345074,"The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-causing lentiviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) effectively evade host immunity and, once established, infections with these viruses are only rarely controlled by immunological mechanisms. However, the initial establishment of infection in the first few days after mucosal exposure, before viral dissemination and massive replication, may be more vulnerable to immune control. Here we report that SIV vaccines that include rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors establish indefinitely persistent, high-frequency, SIV-specific effector memory T-cell (T(EM)) responses at potential sites of SIV replication in rhesus macaques and stringently control highly pathogenic SIV(MAC239) infection early after mucosal challenge. Thirteen of twenty-four rhesus macaques receiving either RhCMV vectors alone or RhCMV vectors followed by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vectors (versus 0 of 9 DNA/Ad5-vaccinated rhesus macaques) manifested early complete control of SIV (undetectable plasma virus), and in twelve of these thirteen animals we observed long-term (≥1 year) protection. This was characterized by: occasional blips of plasma viraemia that ultimately waned; predominantly undetectable cell-associated viral load in blood and lymph node mononuclear cells; no depletion of effector-site CD4(+) memory T cells; no induction or boosting of SIV Env-specific antibodies; and induction and then loss of T-cell responses to an SIV protein (Vif) not included in the RhCMV vectors. Protection correlated with the magnitude of the peak SIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in the vaccine phase, and occurred without anamnestic T-cell responses. Remarkably, long-term RhCMV vector-associated SIV control was insensitive to either CD8(+) or CD4(+) lymphocyte depletion and, at necropsy, cell-associated SIV was only occasionally measurable at the limit of detection with ultrasensitive assays, observations that indicate the possibility of eventual viral clearance. Thus, persistent vectors such as CMV and their associated T(EM) responses might significantly contribute to an efficacious HIV/AIDS vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W1975465357,"About 25 per cent of `hot Jupiters' (extrasolar Jovian-mass planets with close-in orbits) are actually orbiting counter to the spin direction of the star. Perturbations from a distant binary star companion can produce high inclinations, but cannot explain orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum of the system. Such orbits in a stellar context can be produced through secular (that is, long term) perturbations in hierarchical triple-star systems. Here we report a similar analysis of planetary bodies, including both octupole-order effects and tidal friction, and find that we can produce hot Jupiters in orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total angular momentum. With distant stellar mass perturbers, such an outcome is not possible. With planetary perturbers, the inner orbit's angular momentum component parallel to the total angular momentum need not be constant. In fact, as we show here, it can even change sign, leading to a retrograde orbit. A brief excursion to very high eccentricity during the chaotic evolution of the inner orbit allows planet-star tidal interactions to rapidly circularize that orbit, decoupling the planets and forming a retrograde hot Jupiter."
https://openalex.org/W2021361052,"Diatoms dominate the biomass of phytoplankton in nutrient-rich conditions and form the basis of some of the world's most productive marine food webs. The diatom nuclear genome contains genes with bacterial and plastid origins as well as genes of the secondary endosymbiotic host (the exosymbiont), yet little is known about the relative contribution of each gene group to diatom metabolism. Here we show that the exosymbiont-derived ornithine-urea cycle, which is similar to that of metazoans but is absent in green algae and plants, facilitates rapid recovery from prolonged nitrogen limitation. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of a mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthase impairs the response of nitrogen-limited diatoms to nitrogen addition. Metabolomic analyses indicate that intermediates in the ornithine-urea cycle are particularly depleted and that both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycles are linked directly with the ornithine-urea cycle. Several other depleted metabolites are generated from ornithine-urea cycle intermediates by the products of genes laterally acquired from bacteria. This metabolic coupling of bacterial- and exosymbiont-derived proteins seems to be fundamental to diatom physiology because the compounds affected include the major diatom osmolyte proline and the precursors for long-chain polyamines required for silica precipitation during cell wall formation. So far, the ornithine-urea cycle is only known for its essential role in the removal of fixed nitrogen in metazoans. In diatoms, this cycle serves as a distribution and repackaging hub for inorganic carbon and nitrogen and contributes significantly to the metabolic response of diatoms to episodic nitrogen availability. The diatom ornithine-urea cycle therefore represents a key pathway for anaplerotic carbon fixation into nitrogenous compounds that are essential for diatom growth and for the contribution of diatoms to marine productivity."

https://openalex.org/W2132192325,"Protein translocation across the bacterial membrane, mediated by the secretory translocon SecYEG and the SecA ATPase, is enhanced by proton motive force and membrane-integrated SecDF, which associates with SecYEG. The role of SecDF has remained unclear, although it is proposed to function in later stages of translocation as well as in membrane protein biogenesis. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus SecDF at 3.3 Å resolution, revealing a pseudo-symmetrical, 12-helix transmembrane domain belonging to the RND superfamily and two major periplasmic domains, P1 and P4. Higher-resolution analysis of the periplasmic domains suggested that P1, which binds an unfolded protein, undergoes functionally important conformational changes. In vitro analyses identified an ATP-independent step of protein translocation that requires both SecDF and proton motive force. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that SecDF conducts protons in a manner dependent on pH and the presence of an unfolded protein, with conserved Asp and Arg residues at the transmembrane interface between SecD and SecF playing essential roles in the movements of protons and preproteins. Therefore, we propose that SecDF functions as a membrane-integrated chaperone, powered by proton motive force, to achieve ATP-independent protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2150636980,"The genomes of four Lactobacillus reuteri strains isolated from human breast milk and the gastrointestinal tract have been recently sequenced as part of the Human Microbiome Project. Preliminary genome comparisons suggested that these strains belong to two different clades, previously shown to differ with respect to antimicrobial production, biofilm formation, and immunomodulation. To explain possible mechanisms of survival in the host and probiosis, we completed a detailed genomic comparison of two breast milk-derived isolates representative of each group: an established probiotic strain (L. reuteri ATCC 55730) and a strain with promising probiotic features (L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475). Transcriptomes of L. reuteri strains in different growth phases were monitored using strain-specific microarrays, and compared using a pan-metabolic model representing all known metabolic reactions present in these strains. Both strains contained candidate genes involved in the survival and persistence in the gut such as mucus-binding proteins and enzymes scavenging reactive oxygen species. A large operon predicted to encode the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide was identified in strain 55730. Both strains were predicted to produce health-promoting factors, including antimicrobial agents and vitamins (folate, vitamin B(12)). Additionally, a complete pathway for thiamine biosynthesis was predicted in strain 55730 for the first time in this species. Candidate genes responsible for immunomodulatory properties of each strain were identified by transcriptomic comparisons. The production of bioactive metabolites by human-derived probiotics may be predicted using metabolic modeling and transcriptomics. Such strategies may facilitate selection and optimization of probiotics for health promotion, disease prevention and amelioration."
https://openalex.org/W2030811160,"Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are alterations in brain capillary architecture that can result in neurological deficits, seizures, or stroke. We recently demonstrated that CCM3, a protein mutated in familial CCMs, resides predominantly within the STRIPAK complex (striatin interacting phosphatase and kinase). Along with CCM3, STRIPAK contains the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A. The PP2A holoenzyme consists of a core catalytic subunit along with variable scaffolding and regulatory subunits. Within STRIPAK, striatin family members act as PP2A regulatory subunits. STRIPAK also contains all three members of a subfamily of Sterile 20 kinases called the GCKIII proteins (MST4, STK24, and STK25). Here, we report that striatins and CCM3 bridge the phosphatase and kinase components of STRIPAK and map the interacting regions on each protein. We show that striatins and CCM3 regulate the Golgi localization of MST4 in an opposite manner. Consistent with a previously described function for MST4 and CCM3 in Golgi positioning, depletion of CCM3 or striatins affects Golgi polarization, also in an opposite manner. We propose that STRIPAK regulates the balance between MST4 localization at the Golgi and in the cytosol to control Golgi positioning."
https://openalex.org/W2029370898,"Synthetic biological systems are currently created by an ad-hoc, iterative process of specification, design, and assembly. These systems would greatly benefit from a more formalized and rigorous specification of the desired system components as well as constraints on their composition. Therefore, the creation of robust and efficient design flows and tools is imperative. We present a human readable language (Eugene) that allows for the specification of synthetic biological designs based on biological parts, as well as provides a very expressive constraint system to drive the automatic creation of composite Parts (Devices) from a collection of individual Parts.We illustrate Eugene's capabilities in three different areas: Device specification, design space exploration, and assembly and simulation integration. These results highlight Eugene's ability to create combinatorial design spaces and prune these spaces for simulation or physical assembly. Eugene creates functional designs quickly and cost-effectively.Eugene is intended for forward engineering of DNA-based devices, and through its data types and execution semantics, reflects the desired abstraction hierarchy in synthetic biology. Eugene provides a powerful constraint system which can be used to drive the creation of new devices at runtime. It accomplishes all of this while being part of a larger tool chain which includes support for design, simulation, and physical device assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1992156297,"Many regulatory processes in biology involve reversible association of proteins with membranes. Clotting proteins bind to phosphatidylserine (PS) on cell surfaces, but a clear picture of this interaction has yet to emerge. We present a novel explanation for membrane binding by GLA domains of clotting proteins, supported by biochemical studies, solid-state NMR analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The model invokes a single “phospho-l-serine-specific” interaction and multiple “phosphate-specific” interactions. In the latter, the phosphates in phospholipids interact with tightly bound Ca2+ in GLA domains. We show that phospholipids with any headgroup other than choline strongly synergize with PS to enhance factor X activation. We propose that phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin (the major external phospholipids of healthy cells) are anticoagulant primarily because their bulky choline headgroups sterically hinder access to their phosphates. Following cell damage or activation, exposed PS and phosphatidylethanolamine collaborate to bind GLA domains by providing phospho-l-serine-specific and phosphate-specific interactions, respectively.

Ktistakis N.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the steps in the coagulation cascade require the reversible Ca2+-dependent association of clotting proteins with membrane bilayers containing exposed PS (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Releasing these proteins from the membrane surface renders them thousands of times less active. An exemplar is the initiation of clotting, triggered when the plasma protease factor VIIa (fVIIa) binds to the integral membrane protein tissue factor (TF). The resulting TF-fVIIa complex activates two membrane-bound zymogens, factors IX (fIX) and X (fX), by limited proteolysis (3Morrissey J.H. Int. J. Hematol. 2004; 79: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). fVIIa, fIX, and fX are homologous proteins that interact with PS-containing membranes via their GLA domains, so named because they are rich in γ-carboxyglutamate. GLA domains are the most common membrane-binding motif in blood clotting (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), but despite their importance, we lack a detailed understanding of their interaction with the membrane at atomic resolution. This study provides a new view of how lipids collaborate to promote the binding of GLA domains to membrane surfaces and trigger blood clotting. phosphatidylserine factor VIIa tissue factor factor IX factor X phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine Anything But Choline molecular dynamics solid-state NMR diacylglycerol palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine surface plasmon resonance magic angle spinning palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylinositol phosphatidic acid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine. A puzzling feature of TF-fVIIa is its requirement for unphysiologically high PS levels (∼30% PS) for optimal procoagulant activity when TF is incorporated into liposomes with mixtures of PS and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The answer may come from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). By itself, PE (in PE/PC liposomes) supports little to no clotting activity, but when PE is incorporated into PS/PC liposomes, it dramatically decreases the PS requirement for optimal activity of membrane-bound blood clotting reactions, including proteolytic activation of fX by the TF-fVIIa complex (4Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), inactivation of factor Va by activated protein C (5Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activation of prothrombin by the factor Va-factor Xa (prothrombinase) complex (6Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and activation of fX by the factor VIIIa-factor IXa (intrinsic tenase) complex (7Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18500-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Of the four major plasma membrane phospholipids, PC and sphingomyelin are abundant on the outer surface, whereas PS and PE are actively sequestered to the inner leaflet (see Fig. 1A). Cell lysis, damage, or activation causes externalization of PS and PE, which promotes clotting reactions (8Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 971-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). PE is considerably more abundant than PS, so the ability of small amounts of PS to support blood clotting reactions in the presence of larger amounts of PE represents a more physiologic environment for assembling clotting reactions. How PE “synergizes” with PS is not known, but Zwaal et al. (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and Gilbert and Arena (7Gilbert G.E. Arena A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18500-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have summarized the following hypotheses from the literature. 1) Being a non-lamellar phospholipid, PE induces the formation of PS-rich microdomains, which are more efficient in supporting clotting reactions. 2) Clotting proteins contain binding site(s) for PE (or a combination of PE and PS). 3) PE has hydrogen bond donors, but PC does not. When PE forms hydrogen bonds with adjacent PS molecules, it induces PS headgroup conformations that are more favorable for binding to clotting proteins. 4) The PC headgroup is so bulky and highly hydrated (9Burgess S.W. McIntosh T.J. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Murzyn K. Zhao W. Karttunen M. Kurdziel M. Róg T. Biointerphases. 2006; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that it sterically hinders access of GLA domains to adjacent PS molecules. Our previous studies demonstrated approximately one fX membrane-binding site for every six to eight PS molecules, which is about equal to a GLA domain's membrane footprint (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we present a novel general explanation for GLA domain interactions with membranes that we term the “Anything But Choline” (ABC) hypothesis, triggered by detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of GLA domains associating with PS-containing bilayers (Fig. 1B) (12Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2008; 16: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Ohkubo Y.Z. Morrissey J.H. Tajkhorshid E. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 8: 1044-1053PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ABC hypothesis proposes two key types of GLA domain-phospholipid interactions: a single “phospho-l-serine-specific” binding site per GLA domain (Fig. 1, C and D) and multiple “phosphate-specific” interactions, in which phospholipid headgroups bend to allow their phosphates to form coordination complexes with tightly bound Ca2+ in the GLA domain (Fig. 1E). The unique phospho-l-serine-specific binding site was independently identified in the crystal structure of lyso-PS bound to the prothrombin GLA domain (Fig. 1C) (14Huang M. Rigby A.C. Morelli X. Grant M.A. Huang G. Furie B. Seaton B. Furie B.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and in MD simulations of fVIIa GLA domain binding to PS bilayers (Fig. 1D) (12Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2008; 16: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proposed phosphate-specific interactions have been repeatedly observed in our MD simulations of GLA domains associating with PS-containing bilayers (12Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2008; 16: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Ohkubo Y.Z. Morrissey J.H. Tajkhorshid E. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 8: 1044-1053PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We propose that PS can provide both interactions, whereas PC can provide neither (because its bulky choline headgroup sterically hinders access of proteins to its own phosphate moiety). PE can provide phosphate-specific but not phospho-l-serine-specific interactions, explaining why PE/PC bilayers poorly support clotting, whereas PE synergizes with small amounts of PS. A strong prediction of the ABC hypothesis is that there is nothing unique about the ethanolamine headgroup in PE other than that it is not as bulky as PC. Thus, any phospholipid whose headgroup can bend to allow its phosphate to contribute phosphate-specific interactions with GLA domains should synergize with PS, a prediction inconsistent with the PE-specific hypotheses outlined above. In this study, we used a combination of biochemical techniques, solid-state NMR (SSNMR) analyses, and MD simulations to compare the predictions of the ABC hypothesis versus PE-specific hypotheses to explain how phospholipids synergize to support fX activation by TF-fVIIa.

Prothrombin fragment 1 was prepared by digestion of bovine prothrombin with human α-thrombin and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography essentially as described (17Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 123-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TF was incorporated into liposomes of varying phospholipid composition as described previously (18Smith S.A.

The initial rates of fX activation by TF-fVIIa assembled on TF-liposomes were quantified as described previously (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol.

Palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine (POPS)*/POPC Nanodisc spectra were acquired at 600 MHz with a Varian T3 HXY 3.2-mm probe at an MAS rate of 10,000 ± 3 or 13,333 ± 2 Hz. The variable temperature gas was maintained at a flow of 90 ± 10 standard cubic feet/h, and the reported sample temperatures take into account thermocouple calibration and frictional heating due to MAS, calibrated with ethylene glycol (20Van Geet A.L. Anal. Chem. 1968; 40: 2227-2229Crossref Scopus (723) Google Scholar). All experiments utilized tangent-ramped cross-polarization (21Hediger S. Meier B.H. Kurur N.D. Bodenhausen G. Ernst R.R. Chem.

Four bilayers each composed of 1188 lipids and solvated by water at an ∼43:1 water/lipid ratio were simulated. The bilayers were all composed of palmitoyloleoyl-phospholipids but with different headgroups, viz. PE, CH3-PE, (CH3)2-PE, and PC, respectively. All simulations were performed using NAMD2 (23Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput.

All simulations were performed using an NPT ensemble at 1.0 atm and 298 K with a time step of 2 fs. Constant pressure was maintained using the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method (27Feller S.E.

Non-bonded interactions were cut off after 12 Å with a smoothing function applied after 10 Å. The particle mesh Ewald method (29Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar) was used for long-range electrostatic calculations with a grid density >1 Å−3. As a measure of accessibility, the solvent-accessible surface area of the lipid phosphates was calculated in VMD (30Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar), where a probe of a specified radius representing molecular species of various sizes is rolled over the phosphate groups, and the surface available for direct contact with the probe is integrated. Molecular images were generated using VMD (30Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). The ABC hypothesis predicts that many phospholipids can synergize with PS to enhance fX activation by TF-fVIIa, whereas PE-centric hypotheses rely on specific properties of the ethanolamine headgroup. (Here, we refer to PS with the usual l-serine in its headgroup as l-PS and to PS with d-serine as d-PS.) To test these hypotheses, we measured the rates of fX activation by TF-fVIIa on TF-liposomes containing binary lipid mixtures (0–30% l-PS, balance = PC) or ternary lipid mixtures in which the sum of l-PS plus the other test lipid equaled 30% (balance = 70% PC). The lipids tested included PE, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), and d-PS. Consistent with our previous report (4Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), PE strongly synergized with l-PS to support fX activation, left-shifting the l-PS response relative to l-PS/PC liposomes (Fig. 2A). PG also strongly synergized with l-PS while supporting very low rates of fX activation in the absence of l-PS (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, PE did not synergize with PG, as the effects of these lipids were strictly additive (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the ABC hypothesis, which predicts the same role for PE and PG, i.e. providing phosphate-specific interactions. In Fig. 2 (A and B), we employed dioleoyl-phospholipids to ensure that they were always above the phase transition because palmitoyloleoyl-PE has a relatively high transition temperature. For other phospholipid mixtures, we used palmitoyloleoyl-phospholipids; the results (cf. Fig. 2, A and C) confirm that PG synergized with l-PS equally well whether palmitoyloleoyl- or dioleoyl-phospholipids were employed. Phospholipid synergy is thus independent of any subtle bilayer packing differences due to dioleoyl- versus palmitoyloleoyl-phospholipids. PA and PI also strongly synergized with l-PS while supporting very low rates of fX activation in the absence of l-PS (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the PE ethanolamine moiety is not required for phospholipid synergy, as lipids with very different headgroups synergized equally well with l-PS. Components of the prothrombinase and factor VIIIa-factor IXa complexes bind much more weakly to membranes if l-PS is replaced by d-PS (reviewed by Zwaal et al. (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar)). To our knowledge, PS headgroup stereospecificity has not been examined for fX activation by TF-fVIIa. We prepared TF-liposomes with binary lipid mixtures (0–30% l-PS, balance = PC) or ternary lipid mixtures of a total of 30% l-PS + d-PS (balance = 70% PC). d-PS poorly supported fX activation on its own, but it strongly synergized with l-PS (Fig. 2C). This is fully consistent with the ABC hypothesis because d-PS should not support phospho-l-serine-specific interactions but should provide phosphate-specific interactions with GLA domains. Multiple protein-phospholipid interactions are present when TF-fVIIa activates fX, but the dominant membrane contribution to catalysis appears to be fX binding to membranes adjacent to TF-fVIIa (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore quantified fX binding to nanobilayers using SPR as described previuosly (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, the Kd for fX binding to Nanodiscs decreased with increasing l-PS content. The l-PS dose response was left-shifted in the presence of 40% PG (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that PG synergizes with l-PS to support fX binding to bilayers. We also examined fX binding to nanobilayers containing 50% l-PS, 50% d-PS, or 25% l-PS + 25% d-PS (balance in all cases = 50% PC) (Fig. 3B). fX bound less to bilayers with 50% d-PS compared with 50% l-PS, whereas bilayers with 25% l-PS + 25% d-PS performed as well as those with 50% l-PS. Thus, d-PS synergizes with l-PS to enhance membrane binding of fX. PC differs from PE by three N-methyl groups (cf. Fig. 4). We therefore asked how the presence of one or two N-methyl groups on PE would affect synergy with l-PS using TF-liposomes containing binary lipid mixtures (0–30% l-PS, balance = PC) or ternary lipid mixtures of 0–30% l-PS plus 30% PE, 30% N-monomethyl-PE, or 30% N-dimethyl-PE (balance = PC). The results (Fig. 4A) show a progressive diminution in synergy when one or two N-methyl groups were added to PE. The experiment in Fig. 2C showed that PA synergized well with l-PS to support fX activation. We next investigated whether the PA phosphate is required by comparing the ability of PA and DAG to synergize with l-PS to enhance fX activation by TF-fVIIa. We prepared TF-liposomes containing binary lipid mixtures (0–30% l-PS, balance = PC) or ternary lipid mixtures of a total of either 30% PA + l-PS or 30% DAG + l-PS (balance = PC). DAG, which lacks a phosphate group, weakly synergized with l-PS compared with robust synergy with PA (Fig. 4B). To investigate the molecular basis of phospholipid synergy, especially in terms of the accessibility of lipid phosphate groups, four independent 40-ns MD simulations of bilayers were performed in which the lipid headgroups were progressively transformed from PE to N-monomethyl-PE, N-dimethyl-PE, and PC, paralleling the experimental setting in Fig. 4. Each simulation included 1188 lipids distributed equally in the two leaflets to provide statistically meaningful data. Analyses of solvent-accessible surface areas (Fig. 5) clearly showed that each N-methyl group diminished the accessibility of the phosphate group for all probes with radii >1.5 Å (approximately the size of water), with the difference in phosphate exposure also being evident from top view snapshots shown for representative frames taken from the simulations (Fig. 5, lower). Although protein binding to membranes may induce lipid rearrangement, these measurements clearly show that the choline headgroup of PC sterically hinders access to the PC phosphate group. Using MAS-SSNMR, we recently showed that Ca2+ induces two distinct, equally populated conformations of l-PS headgroups in close spatial proximity, consistent with Ca2+ promoting l-PS clusters (16Boettcher J.M. Davis-Harrison R.L. Clay M.C. Nieuwkoop A.J. Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Morrissey J.H. Rienstra C.M. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 2264-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed this approach to investigate PS-GLA domain binding interactions using PS with uniformly 13C,15N-labeled l-serine (termed PS*) incorporated into Nanodiscs. When l-PS engages the GLA domain's proposed phospho-l-serine-specific binding site, its headgroup should take up a unique conformation observable by SSNMR. Two-dimensional 13C-13C spectra were acquired of 30% PS* and 70% PC Nanodiscs prepared with Ca2+ in the absence (Fig. 6, blue trace) or presence (red trace) of saturating levels of prothrombin fragment 1 (which contains the GLA domain). In the presence of fragment 1, we observed a new correlation pattern at 58, 67, and 175 ppm, corresponding to a new chemical environment for l-PS headgroups, termed PS3 (Fig. 6). This is in addition to the two nearly equally populated Ca2+-induced headgroup configurations (termed PS1 and PS2) that we also observed in our previous study (16Boettcher J.M. Davis-Harrison R.L. Clay M.C. Nieuwkoop A.J. Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Morrissey J.H. Rienstra C.M. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 2264-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The individual cross-peaks made up the following fractions of the total l-PS intensities: PS1, 42 ± 3%; PS2, 41 ± 2%; and PS3, 17 ± 2%. SPR studies and MD simulations suggest that six to eight l-PS molecules constitute a GLA domain-binding site (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2008; 16: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The observation that 17 ± 2% of the l-PS headgroups are found in the PS3 chemical environment upon GLA domain binding is consistent with the idea that one l-PS molecule per GLA domain is involved in the phospho-l-serine-specific binding interaction, with the rest of the PS molecules participating in phosphate-specific interactions (as depicted in Fig. 1). The impetus for this study was to explain why PE, a relatively abundant plasma membrane phospholipid, poorly supports clotting reactions in bilayers composed of binary mixtures of PE and PC but strongly promotes clotting reactions when small amounts of PS are also included. We reasoned that solving this conundrum would allow us to develop a general mechanism for how GLA domains interact with PS-containing membranes. To investigate this question, we studied fX activation by TF-fVIIa assembled on liposomes with a wide variety of lipid compositions. Existing hypotheses to explain PE/PS synergy (hypotheses 1–4 in the Introduction) focus on specific properties of the PE ethanolamine headgroup. In contrast, the ABC hypothesis proposes that GLA domains bind to bilayers via a single phospho-l-serine-specific binding interaction together with multiple phosphate-specific interactions. In binary PS/PC mixtures, PS has to provide both types of interaction because the bulky choline moiety of PC sterically hinders GLA domains from interacting with its own phosphate group. (The same situation would also apply to sphingomyelin, whose phosphocholine headgroup is identical to that of PC. Because PC and sphingomyelin are the predominant phospholipids on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and because PS is sequestered to the inner leaflet, this explains the generally anticoagulant surface of healthy intact cells.) PE collaborates with PS to create membrane-binding sites for GLA domains because PE provides the more numerous phosphate-specific interactions, freeing up limited amounts of PS to engage in the single phospho-l-serine-specific interaction per GLA domain. We tested these hypotheses by examining how various phospholipids synergize with PS to enhance fX binding to bilayers and to enhance fX activation by TF-fVIIa in liposomes. Glycerophospholipids with a wide variety of different headgroups were fully as effective as PE in synergizing with PS, including those with myo-inositol (PI), glycerol (PG), d-serine (d-PS), or even just a bare phosphate (PA). We also found that PE did not synergize with PG in the absence of l-PS; instead, the effects of PE and PG were strictly additive. This is consistent with the ABC hypothesis, which predicts that although PE and PG can both provide phosphate-specific interactions, they cannot provide the essential phospho-l-serine-specific interaction. The fact that TF-liposomes containing binary mixtures of d-PS and PC poorly supported fX activation by TF-fVIIa recapitulates similar findings with prothrombinase and factor VIIIa-factor IXa (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). On the other hand, d-PS synergized strongly with l-PS to support TF-fVIIa activity, which is fully consistent with the ABC hypothesis because d-PS should retain the ability to enter into phosphate-specific interactions with GLA domains. Hypotheses 1–4 are inconsistent with our findings. 1) Hypothesis 1 (i.e. non-lamellar PE promotes PS-rich microdomains) cannot explain our results because both lamellar and non-lamellar phospholipids synergized with PS. Furthermore, the nanoscale bilayers in Nanodiscs preclude long-range clustering of PS into microdomains, yet they strongly supported PG/PS and d-PS/l-PS synergy for fX binding. 2) Hypothesis 2 (i.e. PE-specific binding sites in GLA domains) likewise cannot explain our finding that phospholipids with headgroups structurally unrelated to ethanolamine all strongly synergized with PS. In addition, progressive diminution of PE/PS synergy as one or two N-methyl groups were added to PE (by progressively inhibiting access to its own phosphate) is consistent with the ABC hypothesis but inconsistent with hypothesis 2, which predicts an abrupt loss of synergy when the PE ethanolamine is chemically altered. Using MD simulations, we also showed that accessibility of the phosphate groups to objects the size of amino acids or the ω-loop of GLA domains is progressively diminished as the ethanolamine moiety of PE contains one, two, or three N-methyl groups. 3) Hypothesis 3 (i.e. hydrogen bonding between PE and adjacent phospholipids alters PS headgroup conformations) is also inconsistent with our findings because the various PS-synergizing headgroups tested cannot engage in the same kind of hydrogen bonding interactions that ethanolamine can. 4) Hypothesis 4 is the most similar to the ABC hypothesis, the chief difference being that hypothesis 4 proposes that bulky PC sterically hinders access of GLA domains to adjacent PS molecules, whereas the ABC hypothesis proposes that the PC headgroup sterically hinders access of GLA domains to PC's own phosphate. Hypothesis 4 is not completely ruled out by many of the experiments presented here, but DAG (which contains no phosphate group) synergized weakly with PS compared with full synergy observed with PA. Weak PS synergy with DAG is consistent with the notion that simply removing the bulky choline reduces some steric hindrance to the bilayer in general. However, this experiment argues that lipids need to retain their phosphate moieties to synergize fully with PS, in agreement with the ABC hypothesis. Electrostatics per se cannot explain PE/PS synergy because we observed identical PS synergy with phospholipids having very different net charges, including PE (neutral); d-PS, PI, and PG (−1); and PA (−1 to −2). It is not necessary for the synergizing phospholipid to be zwitterionic or even to have an amino group, as PA, PI, and PG lack these features. The common feature required for a phospholipid to synergize with PS appears to be a phosphate unshielded by a bulky headgroup. It is possible that when l-PS engages the phospho-l-serine-specific binding site in a GLA domain, it induces a conformational change in the GLA domain that promotes the phosphate-specific interactions. (In fact, PS has been proposed to be an allosteric regulator of clotting protein function (31Lentz B.R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).) This may help explain why GLA domains bind so weakly to membranes containing relatively high amounts of anionic phospholipids other than l-PS. Our SSNMR results provide direct evidence for a unique PS headgroup environment induced when a GLA domain binds to PS-containing bilayers. The finding that approximately one-sixth of the total PS* signal intensity is in this chemical environment is fully consistent with the ABC hypothesis, which predicts that about this fraction of the PS molecules in a PS/PC bilayer will be engaged in one single phospho-l-serine-specific binding interaction per GLA domain provided that a GLA domain-binding site consists of about six or so PS molecules, a notion that is supported by both our MD simulations (Fig. 1B) (12Ohkubo Y.Z. Tajkhorshid E. Structure. 2008; 16: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Ohkubo Y.Z. Morrissey J.H. Tajkhorshid E. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 8: 1044-1053PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and SPR-based binding studies (11Shaw A.W. Pureza V.S. Sligar S.G. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the basis of these stoichiometries from Nanodisc-based studies, one might expect maximal rates of fX activation on liposomes with ∼5% l-PS + 25% synergistic phospholipid. When we examined fX activation by TF-fVIIa on TF-liposomes, maximal fX activation generally required somewhat more than 5% l-PS in combination with non-PC phospholipids. One explanation could be that l-PS is more readily clustered into nanodomains in the presence of Ca2+ than are other non-PC phospholipids. This study provides a new explanation for how plasma membrane phospholipids synergize to create binding sites for GLA domain-containing blood clotting proteins using fX activation by TF-fVIIa as the exemplar. In future studies, it will be interesting to test the predictions of the ABC hypothesis versus PE-specific hypotheses on other membrane-dependent clotting reactions, e.g. activities of the prothrombinase, factor VIIIa-factor IXa, and protein S-activated protein C complexes. The nature of the proposed phospho-l-serine-specific and phosphate-specific binding sites deserves considerably greater scrutiny and is the subject of our ongoing studies aimed at achieving an atomic-scale understanding of the binding of GLA domains to membrane bilayers.

https://openalex.org/W2099920678,"Ribosomal proteins play a critical role in tightly coordinating p53 signaling with ribosomal biogenesis. Several ribosomal proteins have been shown to induce and activate p53 via inhibition of MDM2. Here, we report that S27a, a small subunit ribosomal protein synthesized as an 80-amino acid ubiquitin C-terminal extension protein (CEP80), functions as a novel regulator of the MDM2-p53 loop. S27a interacts with MDM2 at the central acidic domain of MDM2 and suppresses MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, leading to p53 activation and cell cycle arrest. Knockdown of S27a significantly attenuates the p53 activation in cells in response to treatment with ribosomal stress-inducing agent actinomycin D or 5-fluorouracil. Interestingly, MDM2 in turn ubiquitinates S27a and promotes proteasomal degradation of S27a in response to actinomycin D treatment, thus forming a mutual-regulatory loop. Altogether, our results reveal that S27a plays a non-redundant role in mediating p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress via interplaying with MDM2."

The peptide adopts a disulfide-stabilized α-helical hairpin structure in aqueous solution and thus represents a novel fold among naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides. Micromolar concentrations of EcAMP1 were shown to inhibit growth of several fungal phytopathogens. Confocal microscopy revealed intensive EcAMP1 binding to the surface of fungal conidia followed by internalization and accumulation in the cytoplasm without disturbance of membrane integrity.

https://openalex.org/W2008828299,"CCM3 mutations give rise to cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) of the vasculature through a mechanism that remains unclear. Interaction of CCM3 with the germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) subfamily of Sterile 20 protein kinases, MST4, STK24, and STK25, has been implicated in cardiovascular development in the zebrafish, raising the possibility that dysregulated GCKIII function may contribute to the etiology of CCM disease. Here, we show that the amino-terminal region of CCM3 is necessary and sufficient to bind directly to the C-terminal tail region of GCKIII proteins. This same region of CCM3 was shown previously to mediate homodimerization through the formation of an interdigitated α-helical domain. Sequence conservation and binding studies suggest that CCM3 may preferentially heterodimerize with GCKIII proteins through a manner structurally analogous to that employed for CCM3 homodimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2029972291,"Uterine contractions during labor are discretely regulated by rhythmic action potentials (AP) of varying duration and form that serve to determine calcium-dependent force production. We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for fourteen ionic currents of USMCs: currents (L- and T-type), current, an hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated currents, two -activated current, -activated current, non-specific cation current, - exchanger, - pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area∶volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular computed from known fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modeled in relation to the time constant of changing . This integrated model is validated by its reconstruction of the different USMC AP configurations (spikes, plateau and bursts of spikes), the change from bursting to plateau type AP produced by estradiol and of simultaneous experimental recordings of spontaneous AP, and phasic force. In summary, our advanced mathematical model provides a powerful tool to investigate the physiological ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of uterine electrical E-C coupling of labor and parturition. This will furnish the evolution of descriptive and predictive quantitative models of myometrial electrogenesis at the whole cell and tissue levels."

However, the development of cisplatin resistance represents a major clinical problem, and the mechanisms of acquired resistance are not fully understood. Here we show that degradation of the Bcl-2 homology 3-only proapoptotic protein Bim plays an important role in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. Specifically, we show that treatment of ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin caused Bim phosphorylation and subsequent degradation and that its degradation is associated with cisplatin resistance. We also show that cisplatin treatment caused the activation of ERK, which correlated with Bim phosphorylation and degradation. By inhibiting ERK phosphorylation with the MEK inhibitor and knocking down ERK expression with siRNA, we show that Bim phosphorylation and degradation were blocked, which suggests that Bim is phosphorylated by ERK and that such phosphorylation is responsible for cisplatin-induced Bim degradation. We show that ERK was activated in cisplatin-resistant OV433 cells as compared with their counterpart parental OV433 cells. We also show that Bim was phosphorylated and degraded in cisplatin-resistant OV433 cells but not in the parental OV433 cells. Importantly, we show that inhibition of Bim degradation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 sensitized resistant OV433 cells to cisplatin-induced death. Taken together, our data indicate that degradation of Bim via ERK-mediated phosphorylation can lead to cisplatin resistance. Therefore, these findings suggest that cisplatin resistance can be overcome by the combination of cisplatin and the proteasome inhibitors in ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030430546,"In response to ultraviolet B damage, keratinocytes undergo apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells, thereby preventing tumorigenic transformation. Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive substance, produces complex pharmacological actions; it has been shown to be chemopreventive in non-melamona skin cancer in mice through increasing apoptosis. Here we have investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the pro-apoptotic effect of caffeine on UVB-irradiated human HaCaT keratinocytes. Pretreatment with caffeine increased UVB-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells. Caffeine blocked UVB-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. In addition, similar to the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, caffeine also inhibited phosphorylation of AKT and up-regulation of COX-2, two critical oncogenic pathways in skin tumorigenesis. However, phosphorylation of EGFR or ERK was unaffected. Inhibiting ATR pathways by siRNA targeting ATR had little effect on UVB-induced apoptosis or AKT activation, indicating that the inhibitory effect of caffeine on apoptosis and the AKT pathway does not require the ATR pathway. Inhibiting AKT by caffeine blocked UVB-induced COX-2 up-regulation. Expression of constitutively active AKT that was not inhibited by caffeine was found to protect cells from caffeine-promoted apoptosis post-UVB irradiation, indicating that AKT is an essential inhibitory target for caffeine to promote apoptosis. Caffeine specifically sensitized cells with unrepaired DNA damage to UVB-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that in HaCaT keratinocytes, inhibiting the AKT/COX-2 pathways through an ATR-independent pathway is a critical molecular mechanism by which caffeine promotes UVB-induced apoptosis of unrepaired keratinocytes for elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2082503448,"Despite aggressive therapies, the prognosis of children with high-risk medulloblastoma is still poor, thus underscoring the need to develop novel treatment strategies. Here, we report that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI), that is, MS-275, valproic acid or SAHA, provide a novel strategy for sensitization of medulloblastoma to DNA-damaging drugs such as Doxorubicin, VP16 and Cisplatin by promoting p53-dependent, mitochondrial apoptosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that single-agent treatment with MS-275 causes acetylation of the non-histone protein Ku70, an event reported to release Bax from Ku70, whereas DNA-damaging drugs trigger p53 acetylation and accumulation. Combined treatment with MS-275 and Doxorubicin or VP16 cooperates to promote binding of p53 to Bax and p53-dependent Bax activation, resulting in enhanced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 almost completely abolishes the MS-275-mediated chemosensitization, underlining the importance of the mitochondrial pathway for inducing apoptosis. Also, MS-275 cooperates with chemotherapeutics to inhibit long-term clonogenic survival. Most importantly, MS-275 increases chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in primary medulloblastoma samples, and cooperates with Doxorubicin to suppress medulloblastoma growth in an in vivo model, which underscores the clinical relevance of the findings. Thus, HDACI such as MS-275 present a promising approach for chemosensitization of medulloblastoma by enhancing mitochondrial apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These findings have important clinical implications for the design of experimental treatment protocols for medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2055670125,"Increasing demand for human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clinical and research applications necessitates expansion of HSCs in vitro. Before these cells can be used they must be carefully evaluated to assess their stem cell activity. Here, we expanded cord blood CD34(+) CD133(+) cells in a defined medium containing angiopoietin like 5 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 and evaluated the cells for stem cell activity in NOD-SCID Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice by multi-lineage engraftment, long term reconstitution, limiting dilution and serial reconstitution. The phenotype of expanded cells was characterized by flow cytometry during the course of expansion and following engraftment in mice. We show that the SCID repopulating activity resides in the CD34(+) CD133(+) fraction of expanded cells and that CD34(+) CD133(+) cell number correlates with SCID repopulating activity before and after culture. The expanded cells mediate long-term hematopoiesis and serial reconstitution in NSG mice. Furthermore, they efficiently reconstitute not only neonate but also adult NSG recipients, generating human blood cell populations similar to those reported in mice reconstituted with uncultured human HSCs. These findings suggest an expansion of long term HSCs in our culture and show that expression of CD34 and CD133 serves as a marker for HSC activity in human cord blood cell cultures. The ability to expand human HSCs in vitro should facilitate clinical use of HSCs and large-scale construction of humanized mice from the same donor for research applications."

It has been reported that CsA inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome replication, which indicates that cellular targets of CsA regulate the viral replication. However, the regulation mechanisms of HCV replication governed by CsA target proteins have not been fully understood.Here we show a chemical biology approach that elucidates a novel mechanism of HCV replication. We developed a phage display screening to investigate compound-peptide interaction and identified a novel cellular target molecule of CsA. This protein, named CsA associated helicase-like protein (CAHL), possessed RNA-dependent ATPase activity that was negated by treatment with CsA. The downregulation of CAHL in the cells resulted in a decrease of HCV genome replication. CAHL formed a complex with HCV-derived RNA polymerase NS5B and host-derived cyclophilin B (CyPB), known as a cellular cofactor for HCV replication, to regulate NS5B-CyPB interaction.We found a cellular factor, CAHL, as CsA associated helicase-like protein, which would form trimer complex with CyPB and NS5B of HCV. The strategy using a chemical compound and identifying its target molecule by our phage display analysis is useful to reveal a novel mechanism underlying cellular and viral physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2030763459,"TMEFF2 is a protein containing a single EGF-like domain and two follistatin-like modules. The biological function of TMEFF2 remains unclear with conflicting reports suggesting both a positive and a negative association between TMEFF2 expression and human cancers.Here we report that the extracellular domain of TMEFF2 interacts with PDGF-AA. This interaction requires the amino terminal region of the extracellular domain containing the follistatin modules and cannot be mediated by the EGF-like domain alone. Furthermore, the extracellular domain of TMEFF2 interferes with PDGF-AA-stimulated fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. TMEFF2 expression is downregulated in human brain cancers and is negatively correlated with PDGF-AA expression. Suppressed expression of TMEFF2 is associated with its hypermethylation in several human tumor types, including glioblastoma and cancers of ovarian, rectal, colon and lung origins. Analysis of glioma subtypes indicates that TMEFF2 hypermethylation and decreased expression are associated with a subset of non-Proneural gliomas that do not display CpG island methylator phentoype.These data provide the first evidence that TMEFF2 can function to regulate PDGF signaling and that it is hypermethylated and downregulated in glioma and several other cancers, thereby suggesting an important role for this protein in the etiology of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2052906730,"p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is regulated by multiple phosphorylation events. Three of these sites are highly conserved among AGC kinases (cAMP dependent Protein Kinase, cGMP dependent Protein Kinase, and Protein Kinase C subfamily): the activation loop in the kinase domain, and two C-terminal sites, the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif. The common dogma has been that phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif primes S6K1 for the phosphorylation at the activation loop by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Here, we show that the turn motif is, in fact, phosphorylated first, the activation loop second, and the hydrophobic motif is third. Specifically, biochemical analyses of a construct of S6K1 lacking the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain as well as full-length S6K1, reveals that S6K1 is constitutively phosphorylated at the turn motif when expressed in insect cells and becomes phosphorylated in vitro by purified PDK1 at the activation loop. Only the species phosphorylated at the activation loop by PDK1 gets phosphorylated at the hydrophobic motif by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in vitro. These data are consistent with a previous model in which constitutive phosphorylation of the turn motif provides the key priming step in the phosphorylation of S6K1. The data provide evidence for regulation of S6K1, where hydrophobic motif phosphorylation is not required for PDK1 to phosphorylate S6K1 at the activation loop, but instead activation loop phosphorylation of S6K1 is required for mTOR to phosphorylate the hydrophobic motif of S6K1."

Disease-related stress, depression, and the degree of accompanying motor disability were likewise assessed. Stress and depression were measured by Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Score and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Test. Motor disability of the affected hand was determined by Sequential Occupational Dexterity Assessment and Michigan Hand Questionnaire. Sensory changes were assessed by Quantitative Sensory Testing according to the standards of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain. Almost two-thirds of all patients exhibited spontaneous pain at rest. Hand force as well as hand motor function were found to be substantially impaired. Results of Quantitative Sensory Testing revealed a distinct pattern of generalized bilateral sensory loss and hyperalgesia, most prominently to blunt pressure. Patients reported substantial motor complaints confirmed by the objective motor disability testings. Interestingly, patients displayed clinically relevant levels of stress and depression. We conclude that chronic CRPS is characterized by a combination of ongoing pain, pain-related disability, stress and depression, potentially triggered by peripheral nerve/tissue damage and ensuing sensory loss. In order to consolidate the different dimensions of disturbances in chronic CRPS, we developed a model based on interaction analysis suggesting a complex hierarchical interaction of peripheral (injury/sensory loss) and central factors (pain/disability/stress/depression) predicting motor dysfunction and hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2020847975,"Opioids have been widely applied in clinics as one of the most potent pain relievers for centuries, but their abuse has deleterious physiological effects beyond addiction. However, the underlying mechanism by which microglia in response to opioids remains largely unknown. Here we show that morphine induces the expression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a key mediator of innate immunity and inflammation. Interestingly, TLR9 deficiency significantly inhibited morphine-induced apoptosis in microglia. Similar results were obtained when endogenous TLR9 expression was suppressed by the TLR9 inhibitor CpGODN. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by its specific inhibitor SB203580 attenuated morphine-induced microglia apoptosis in wild type microglia. Morphine caused a dramatic decrease in Bcl-2 level but increase in Bax level in wild type microglia, but not in TLR9 deficient microglia. In addition, morphine treatment failed to induce an increased levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and MAP kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6), the upstream MAPK kinase of p38 MAPK, in either TLR9 deficient or µ-opioid receptor (µOR) deficient primary microglia, suggesting an involvement of MAPK and µOR in morphine-mediated TLR9 signaling. Moreover, morphine-induced TLR9 expression and microglia apoptosis appears to require μOR. Collectively, these results reveal that opioids prime microglia to undergo apoptosis through TLR9 and µOR as well. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of TLR9 and/or blockage of µOR is capable of preventing opioid-induced brain damage."
https://openalex.org/W2076081730,"The scavenger receptor C-type lectin (SRCL) is a glycan-binding receptor that has the capacity to mediate endocytosis of glycoproteins carrying terminal Lewis(x) groups (Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc). A screen for glycoprotein ligands for SRCL using affinity chromatography on immobilized SRCL followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis revealed that soluble glycoproteins from secondary granules of neutrophils, including lactoferrin and matrix metalloproteinases 8 and 9, are major ligands. Binding competition and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed affinities in the low micromolar range. Comparison of SRCL binding to neutrophil and milk lactoferrin indicates that the binding is dependent on cell-specific glycosylation in the neutrophils, as the milk form of the glycoprotein is a much poorer ligand. Binding to neutrophil glycoproteins is fucose-dependent, and mass spectrometry-based glycomic analysis of neutrophil and milk lactoferrin was used to establish a correlation between high affinity binding to SRCL and the presence of multiple clustered terminal Lewis(x) groups on a heterogeneous mixture of branched glycans, some with poly N-acetyllactosamine extensions. The ability of SRCL to mediate uptake of neutrophil lactoferrin was confirmed using fibroblasts transfected with SRCL. The common presence of Lewis(x) groups in granule protein glycans can thus target granule proteins for clearance by SRCL. PCR and immunohistochemical analysis confirm that SRCL is widely expressed on endothelial cells and thus represents a distributed system that could scavenge released neutrophil glycoproteins both locally at sites of inflammation or systemically when they are released in the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1971290443,"The onset and progressive pathogenesis of periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by the entry of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) into periodontal tissue, especially gingival epithelium. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying such bacterial entry remains to be clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible role of Aa outer membrane protein 29 kD (Omp29), a homologue of E. coli OmpA, in promoting bacterial entry into gingival epithelial cells. To accomplish this, Omp29 expression vector was incorporated in an OmpA-deficient mutant of E. coli. Omp29(+)/OmpA(-) E. coli demonstrated 22-fold higher entry into human gingival epithelial line cells (OBA9) than Omp29(-)/OmpA(-) E. coli. While the entry of Aa and Omp29(+)/OmpA(-) E. coli into OBA9 cells were inhibited by anti-Omp29 antibody, their adherence to OBA9 cells was not inhibited. Stimulation of OBA9 cells with purified Omp29 increased the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a pivotal cell-signaling molecule that can up-regulate actin rearrangement. Furthermore, Omp29 increased the formation of F-actin in OBA9 cells. The internalization of Omp29-coated beads and the entry of Aa into OBA9 were partially inhibited by treatment with PI3-kinase inhibitor (Wortmannin) and Rho GTPases inhibitor (EDIN), both known to convey FAK-signaling to actin-rearrangement. These results suggest that Omp29 is associated with the entry of Aa into gingival epithelial cells by up-regulating F-actin rearrangement via the FAK signaling pathway."

All patients in the NDR aged 18-75 years with diabetes more than one year were eligible, but only patients starting any lipid lowering treatment with at least three prescriptions 1 July 2006-30 June 2007 were included (n = 37,182). The mean blood lipid levels in 2008 and reductions in LDL cholesterol were examined.Blood lipid levels were similar in patients treated with simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, showing similar lipid lowering effect as currently used. Users of pravastatin, fluvastatin, ezetimib and fibrate more seldom reach treatment goals. Moderate daily doses of the statins were used, with 76% of simvastatin users taking 20 mg or less, 48% of atorvastatin users taking 10 mg, 55% of pravastatin users taking 20 mg, and 76% of rosuvastatin users taking 5 or 10 mg.This observational study shows that the LDL-C levels in patients taking simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin are very similar as currently used, as well as their LDL-C lowering abilities. There is potential to intensify lipid lowering treatment to reduce the remaining high residual risk and achieve better fulfilment of treatment goals, since the commonly used doses are only low to moderate."
https://openalex.org/W2086950488,"The polyisoprenoid compound undecaprenyl phosphate is required for biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycans in gram-positive bacteria, including pathogenic Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus spp. In these organisms, the mevalonate pathway is used to produce the precursor isoprenoid, isopentenyl 5-diphosphate. Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) catalyzes formation of isopentenyl 5-diphosphate in an ATP-dependent irreversible reaction and is therefore an attractive target for inhibitor development that could lead to new antimicrobial agents. To facilitate exploration of this possibility, we report the crystal structure of Staphylococcus epidermidis MDD (1.85 Å resolution) and, to the best of our knowledge, the first structures of liganded MDD. These structures include MDD bound to the mevalonate 5-diphosphate analogs diphosphoglycolyl proline (2.05 Å resolution) and 6-fluoromevalonate diphosphate (FMVAPP; 2.2 Å resolution). Comparison of these structures provides a physical basis for the significant differences in K(i) values observed for these inhibitors. Inspection of enzyme/inhibitor structures identified the side chain of invariant Ser(192) as making potential contributions to catalysis. Significantly, Ser → Ala substitution of this side chain decreases k(cat) by ∼10(3)-fold, even though binding interactions between FMVAPP and this mutant are similar to those observed with wild type MDD, as judged by the 2.1 Å cocrystal structure of S192A with FMVAPP. Comparison of microbial MDD structures with those of mammalian counterparts reveals potential targets at the active site periphery that may be exploited to selectively target the microbial enzymes. These studies provide a structural basis for previous observations regarding the MDD mechanism and inform future work toward rational inhibitor design."
https://openalex.org/W2103800580,"DNA ligase I (LIG1) catalyzes the ligation of single-strand breaks to complete DNA replication and repair. The energy of ATP is used to form a new phosphodiester bond in DNA via a reaction mechanism that involves three distinct chemical steps: enzyme adenylylation, adenylyl transfer to DNA, and nick sealing. We used steady state and pre-steady state kinetics to characterize the minimal mechanism for DNA ligation catalyzed by human LIG1. The ATP dependence of the reaction indicates that LIG1 requires multiple Mg(2+) ions for catalysis and that an essential Mg(2+) ion binds more tightly to ATP than to the enzyme. Further dissection of the magnesium ion dependence of individual reaction steps revealed that the affinity for Mg(2+) changes along the reaction coordinate. At saturating concentrations of ATP and Mg(2+) ions, the three chemical steps occur at similar rates, and the efficiency of ligation is high. However, under conditions of limiting Mg(2+), the nick-sealing step becomes rate-limiting, and the adenylylated DNA intermediate is prematurely released into solution. Subsequent adenylylation of enzyme prevents rebinding to the adenylylated DNA intermediate comprising an Achilles' heel of LIG1. These ligase-generated 5'-adenylylated nicks constitute persistent breaks that are a threat to genomic stability if they are not repaired. The kinetic and thermodynamic framework that we have determined for LIG1 provides a starting point for understanding the mechanism and specificity of mammalian DNA ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2123759535,"The microtubule (MT) and actin cytoskeletons are fundamental to cell integrity, because they control a host of cellular activities, including cell division, growth, polarization, and migration. Proteins involved in mediating the cross-talk between MT and actin cytoskeletons are key to many cellular processes and play important physiological roles. We identified a new member of the GAS2 family of MT-actin cross-linking proteins, named G2L3 (GAS2-like 3). We show that GAS2-like 3 is widely conserved throughout evolution and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. GAS2-like 3 interacts with filamentous actin and MTs via its single calponin homology type 3 domain and C terminus, respectively. Interestingly, the role of the putative MT-binding GAS2-related domain is to modulate the binding of GAS2-like 3 to both filamentous actin and MTs. This is in contrast to GAS2-related domains found in related proteins, where it functions as a MT-binding domain. Furthermore, we show that tubulin acetylation drives GAS2-like 3 localization to MTs and may provide functional insights into the role of GAS2-like 3."
https://openalex.org/W1985743594,"Measurements on embryonic epithelial tissues in a diverse range of organisms have shown that the statistics of cell neighbor numbers are universal in tissues where cell proliferation is the primary cell activity. Highly simplified non-spatial models of proliferation are claimed to accurately reproduce these statistics. Using a systematic critical analysis, we show that non-spatial models are not capable of robustly describing the universal statistics observed in proliferating epithelia, indicating strong spatial correlations between cells. Furthermore we show that spatial simulations using the Subcellular Element Model are able to robustly reproduce the universal histogram. In addition these simulations are able to unify ostensibly divergent experimental data in the literature. We also analyze cell neighbor statistics in early stages of chick embryo development in which cell behaviors other than proliferation are important. We find from experimental observation that cell neighbor statistics in the primitive streak region, where cell motility and ingression are also important, show a much broader distribution. A non-spatial Markov process model provides excellent agreement with this broader histogram indicating that cells in the primitive streak may have significantly weaker spatial correlations. These findings show that cell neighbor statistics provide a potentially useful signature of collective cell behavior."

We investigated whether a novel intravenously injectable αvβ3 integrin-ligand coupled nanoparticle (NP) can target choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) for imaging and targeted gene therapy.CNV lesions were induced in rats using laser photocoagulation. The utility of NP for in vivo imaging and gene delivery was evaluated by coupling the NP with a green fluorescing protein plasmid (NP-GFPg). Rhodamine labeling (Rd-NP) was used to localize NP in choroidal flatmounts. Rd-NP-GFPg particles were injected intravenously on weeks 1, 2, or 3. In the treatment arm, rats received NP containing a dominant negative Raf mutant gene (NP-ATPμ-Raf) on days 1, 3, and 5. The change in CNV size and leakage, and TUNEL positive cells were quantified.GFP plasmid expression was seen in vivo up to 3 days after injection of Rd-NP-GFPg. Choroidal flatmounts confirmed the localization of the NP and the expression of GFP plasmid in the CNV. Treating the CNV with NP-ATPμ-Raf decreased the CNV size by 42% (P<0.001). OCT analysis revealed that the reduction of CNV size started on day 5 and reached statistical significance by day 7. Fluorescein angiography grading showed significantly less leakage in the treated CNV (P<0.001). There were significantly more apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) nuclei in the treated CNV.Systemic administration of αvβ3 targeted NP can be used to label the abnormal blood vessels of CNV for imaging. Targeted gene delivery with NP-ATPμ-Raf leads to a reduction in size and leakage of the CNV by induction of apoptosis in the CNV."

Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the surface expression of Nhe3 and Npt2a, which are transporters regulated by trafficking and normally reside in the renal proximal tubule brush border membrane, was significantly decreased in the Clcn5 KO mouse, and total Npt2a expression was decreased. Likewise, the proximal tubule scavenger receptor megalin was decreased in total amount and even further reduced at the apical surface (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J.

However, no systematic evaluation of the role of ClC-5 in apical domain endocytosis/exocytosis has been reported. In mice fed with a phosphate-depleted diet, parathyroid hormone-induced NHE3 endocytosis was slowed in the Clcn5 KO proximal tubule, indicating that the endocytosis in intact mice is regulated in a ClC-5-dependent manner (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, slowed endocytosis would not explain the decreased steady-state surface distribution of Nhe3 in the Clcn5 KO proximal tubule. Consequently, Jentsch and co-workers (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) hypothesized that in the Clcn5 KO mouse this was caused by a high concentration of tubular parathyroid hormone (PTH) caused by decreased reabsorption of PTH via megalin. Based on these observations, we believe that, due to the presence of both primary and secondary effects of ClC-5 in animal models, it may not be possible to fully dissect the direct role of ClC-5 in trafficking of apical membrane proteins by only using animal models. For example, in Clcn5 KO mice, changed luminal tubule levels of PTH might mask the direct function of ClC-5 on NHE3 surface expression. To further understand the effects of ClC-5 on NHE3 function and distribution, we characterized the ClC-5 dependence of basal and regulated Nhe3 activity in mouse proximal tubules and then studied basal and stimulated apical distribution and rates of endocytosis and exocytosis of NHE3 in the proximal tubule-like opossum kidney (OK) cell line using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to silence ClC-5. We show evidence that ClC-5 is necessary for NHE3 exocytosis but not endocytosis and that decreased ClC-5 lowers the amount of NHE3 on the proximal tubule apical membrane in the absence of elevated luminal PTH.DISCUSSIONSeveral striking abnormalities have been documented in the proximal tubule of the Clcn5 KO mice.

Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Although the increased urinary loss of sodium and phosphate is explained by the reduced apical expression of Nhe3 and Npt2a, the major proteins involved in the bulk of Na+ and phosphate absorption from the kidney, the mechanisms underlying the abnormal apical distribution and consequently the reduced function of the transporters have not been determined.We used two epithelial models to determine the consequences in renal proximal tubule of either absent or greatly reduced expression of ClC-5 on the activity of a transport protein, NHE3, which cycles between the endosomal system and the brush border under basal conditions and is acutely regulated primarily by changes in the rates of its endocytosis and/or exocytosis (35Donowitz M. Li X. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 825-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both in native murine proximal tubule and in a non-malignant proximal tubule cell line (OK cells), our results showed that ClC-5 was necessary to maintain basal NHE3 activity as well as for stimulation of NHE3 by short time exposure to DEX, whereas ClC-5 was not necessary for acute cAMP, elevated Ca2+, and PTH inhibition of NHE3. These changes in transport were all due to abnormal trafficking of NHE3 when examined in polarized OK cells with reduced NHE3 surface expression under basal conditions due to reduced exocytosis and a similarly reduced DEX stimulation due to failure of DEX to stimulate exocytosis of NHE3 in the absence of ClC-5. In contrast to a role for ClC-5 in basal and stimulated exocytosis, both cAMP and elevated Ca2+, both of which inhibit NHE3 at least in part by stimulating its endocytosis, caused normal percent inhibition of NHE3 in ClC-5-null mouse proximal tubule. Also PTH, which affects NHE3 by elevating both Ca2+ and cAMP in proximal tubule, caused a similar rate of endocytosis of NHE3 in WT and OK cells in which ClC-5 was knocked down. Moreover, given the prolonged half-life of NHE3 of ∼14 h (36Cavet M.E. Akhter S. Murtazina R. Sanchez de Medina F. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C2039-C2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the changes described here, which occurred over much shorter times, indicate that changes in brush border (BB) NHE3 were not related to changes in plasma membrane delivery of newly synthesized NHE3. We conclude that ClC-5 is necessary for basal and DEX-stimulated exocytosis but not for endocytosis of NHE3 in these epithelial cells.This is the first detailed examination in renal proximal tubule of the dependence on ClC-5 of trafficking of Nhe3 and examination of effects on exocytosis, although the initial study of the renal phenotype of Clcn5 KO mice identified a role for ClC-5 in proximal tubule trafficking (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). There were multiple reasons for attention to be paid first to potential effects of ClC-5 on endocytosis. Clcn5 KO mouse renal cortex exhibited a reduced BB amount of the receptor protein megalin along with reduced total expression of megalin; megalin is the major renal proximal tubule BB receptor for endocytosis (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 23Christensen E.I. Devuyst O. Dom G. Nielsen R. Van der Smissen P. Verroust P. Leruth M. Guggino W.B. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8472-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Also, the clinical manifestations of Dent disease are consistent with reduced proximal tubule endocytosis; there is reduced renal absorption of glucose, amino acids, and low molecular weight proteins, accounting for the glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and low molecular weight proteinuria that are part of this syndrome (5Guggino S.E. Nat. Clin. Pract. Nephrol. 2007; 3: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, knocking out ClC-5 reduced proximal tubule receptor-mediated endocytosis (β2-microglobulin and albumin) and fluid phase endocytosis (dextran and horseradish peroxidase) (37Wang Y. Cai H. Cebotaru L. Hryciw D.H. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F850-F862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lastly, because NaPi2a is regulated only by endocytosis and does not undergo exocytosis, it was logical that emphasis would be on the role of ClC-5 in its endocytosis (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).However, it was also recognized that reduced endocytosis would increase, not decrease, BB NHE3 and NaPi2a; this is the opposite of what was observed (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that this aspect of the pathophysiology of the lack of ClC-5 in KO mice kidney is caused by reduced PTH endocytosis/increased luminal PTH because this process is dependent on surface megalin. Thus, reduced surface NHE3 and NaPi2a were considered secondary to reduced PTH endocytosis (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, there were inconsistencies in the data supporting this hypothesis. For instance, other animal models in which megalin (38Bachmann S. Schlichting U. Geist B. Mutig K. Petsch T. Bacic D. Wagner C.A. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Willnow T.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and its chaperone receptor-associated protein (39Bacic D. Capuano P. Gisler S.M. Pribanic S. Christensen E.I. Biber J. Loffing J. Kaissling B. Wagner C.A. Murer H. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were knocked out had unaltered surface expression of NHE3. These contradictory results led us to speculate that, besides the low surface expression of megalin and consequently high concentration of tubular PTH, additional mechanism(s) might contribute to the reduced NHE3 surface expression observed in the animal model lacking ClC-5.Recent studies focusing on molecular mechanisms of ClC-5 actions indicated that ClC-5 might have a direct role in regulation of NHE3 trafficking. Drugs that abrogate vacuolar acidification (as occurs with ClC-5 KO) did not affect the rate of endocytic uptake but inhibited recycling or transfer to lysosomes (40Devuyst O. Jouret F. Auzanneau C. Courtoy P.J. Nephron Physiol. 2005; 99: p69-p73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, ClC-5 directly interacts with NHERF2, a PDZ domain-containing protein that is essential for both endocytosis and exocytosis of NHE3 (32Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Ferguson C. Lee A. Wang D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, NHE3 has a function similar to that of ClC-5 in respect to acidification of some endosomes (37Wang Y. Cai H. Cebotaru L. Hryciw D.H. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F850-F862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, in proximal tubules and intercalated ducts in several patients with Dent disease, the H+-ATPase appeared on the basolateral membrane rather than in the normal BB location (42Moulin P. Igarashi T. Van der Smissen P. Cosyns J.P. Verroust P. Thakker R.V. Scheinman S.J. Courtoy P.J. Devuyst O. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1285-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This appears to be an example of altered polarity of a specific protein, whereas the polar distribution of multiple other proteins was normal (42Moulin P. Igarashi T. Van der Smissen P. Cosyns J.P. Verroust P. Thakker R.V. Scheinman S.J. Courtoy P.J. Devuyst O. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1285-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that ClC-5, NHE3, and H+-ATPase might localize (at least partially) in a common compartment, and ClC-5 might regulate NHE3 trafficking. This evidence led us to examine in detail the role of ClC-5 in the trafficking of NHE3. Our data showed that under basal conditions (which is in the absence of high luminal PTH) surface expression of NHE3 is decreased in OK cells with reduced expression of ClC-5, which is similar to what is seen with megalin, suggesting that it is likely that ClC-5 plays a similar role in the regulation of trafficking of NHE3 and megalin. Furthermore, our direct measurements of NHE3 exocytosis and endocytosis demonstrate that, at least in OK cells, it was exocytosis and not endocytosis of NHE3 that depended on ClC-5.The similarity of the ClC-5 dependence of NHE3 trafficking in intact mouse proximal tubules and OK cells is surprising because it has been suggested that in proximal tubules NHE3 inhibition by trafficking from the microvilli is primarily to a domain just superior to the intermicrovillar clefts and does not cycle to the clathrin-coated pit area and endosomes as occurs in other epithelia, including Caco-2 cells and OK cells (43McDonough A.A. Biemesderfer D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2003; 12: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we suggest that ClC-5 is serving the same function in exocytosis in both proximal tubule and OK cells, although the nature of that comportment has not been identified in either.Concerning the mechanism by which reduced or absent ClC-5 reduces trafficking, it has been assumed that ClC-5, acting as a Cl−/H+ antiporter, neutralizes the electropositivity generated by the H+-ATPase pumping H+ ions into intracellular vesicles, thus allowing further acidification of the intracellular organelle in which both occur. Importantly, that this was the only role for ClC-5 was recently challenged by the demonstration of a role for Cl− separate from charge neutralization as well as a role for intraorganellar cations in establishing intracellular organelle acid pH (22Novarino G. Weinert S. Rickheit G. Jentsch T.J. Science. 2010; 328: 1398-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 44Steinberg B.E. Huynh K.K. Brodovitch A. Jabs S. Stauber T. Jentsch T.J. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Of note, the identity of the intracellular organelle involved in NHE3 exocytosis has not been determined. Our results suggest that an NHE3-containing recycling endosome is likely to be affected by ClC-5 reduction.As an alternative explanation to direct effects of ClC-5 on intracellular organelle function, because the NHERF multi-PDZ domain scaffolding proteins are known to be involved in inhibition of NHE3 by cAMP and Ca2+ and in dexamethasone stimulation (31Bobulescu I.A.

Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C771-C782Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was determined whether there were any changes in the level of these proteins in the Clcn5 KO. By immunoblots, there was no change in the amounts of NHERF1, -2, and -3 in Clcn5 KO lysates of renal cortex (data not shown), indicating that changes in their levels did not account for abnormal Nhe3 activity in the Clcn5 KO.A surprising result of these studies was the apparently normal rate of both basal and stimulated NHE3 endocytosis in proximal tubule of both Clcn5 KO and OK cells with ClC-5 expression knocked down. As reviewed above, there is strong evidence that multiple examples of endocytosis are ClC-5-dependent in renal proximal tubule, although many may be due to the reduced apical megalin and/or to the consequently elevated luminal PTH (2Piwon N. Günther W. Schwake M. Bösl M.R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, there has recently been recognition that there are many forms of apical endocytosis in addition to receptor-mediated/clathrin-dependent and lipid raft-dependent forms. The mechanisms by which NHE3 is endocytosed have been shown to include clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent forms, including via lipid rafts (47Li X. Galli T. Leu S. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Leung G. Cheong A. Louvard D. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 48Murtazina R. Kovbasnjuk O. Donowitz M. Li X. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that NHE3 endocytosis is not affected by reduced ClC-5, even though ClC-5 affects multiple forms of endocytosis, because NHE3 is taken up by some ClC-5-independent endocytic pathway(s).In summary, these studies have established a role for ClC-5 in exocytosis of at least one renal proximal tubule apical membrane transporter (NHE3) as well as showing that although ClC-5 is necessary for multiple example of endocytosis it is not necessary for endocytosis of all proximal tubule proteins that are regulated partially by stimulated endocytosis. Demonstration of the importance of ClC-5 in the regulation of NHE3 trafficking should allow determination of the specificity of the dependence on ClC-5 in regulated exocytosis and endocytosis of additional apical proteins as well as providing a probe to isolate and identify the intracellular compartment in which ClC-5 is involved in NHE3 exocytosis.

We recently found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cascade might convey an anchorage signal that regulates S phase entry. Here, we show that Rho-associated kinase connects this signal to the TSC1/TSC2-RHEB-mTOR pathway. Expression of a constitutively active form of ROCK1 suppressed all of the anchorage deprivation effects suppressible by tsc2 mutation in rat embryonic fibroblasts. TSC2 contains one evolutionarily conserved ROCK target-like sequence, and an alanine substitution for Thr(1203) in this sequence severely impaired the ability of ROCK1 to counteract the anchorage loss-imposed down-regulation of both G(1) cell cycle factors and mTORC1 activity. Moreover, TSC2 Thr(1203) underwent ROCK-dependent phosphorylation in vivo and could be phosphorylated by bacterially expressed active ROCK1 in vitro, providing biochemical evidence for a direct physical interaction between ROCK and TSC2."
https://openalex.org/W1975270502,"δ-Catenin is an Armadillo protein of the p120-catenin subfamily capable of modulating cadherin stability, small GTPase activity, and nuclear transcription. From yeast two-hybrid screening of a human embryonic stem cell cDNA library, we identified δ-catenin as a potential interacting partner of the caspase-3 protease, which plays essential roles in apoptotic as well as non-apoptotic processes. Interaction of δ-catenin with caspase-3 was confirmed using cleavage assays conducted in vitro, in Xenopus apoptotic extracts, and in cell line chemically induced contexts. The cleavage site, a highly conserved caspase consensus motif (DELD) within Armadillo repeat 6 of δ-catenin, was identified through peptide sequencing. Cleavage thus generates an amino-terminal (residues 1–816) and carboxyl-terminal (residues 817–1314) fragment, each containing about half of the central Armadillo domain. We found that cleavage of δ-catenin both abolishes its association with cadherins and impairs its ability to modulate small GTPases. Interestingly, 817–1314 possesses a conserved putative nuclear localization signal that may facilitate the nuclear targeting of δ-catenin in defined contexts. To probe for novel nuclear roles of δ-catenin, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library, resolving and then validating interaction with an uncharacterized KRAB family zinc finger protein, ZIFCAT. Our results indicate that ZIFCAT is nuclear and suggest that it may associate with DNA as a transcriptional repressor. We further determined that other p120 subfamily catenins are similarly cleaved by caspase-3 and likewise bind ZIFCAT. Our findings potentially reveal a simple yet novel signaling pathway based upon caspase-3 cleavage of p120-catenin subfamily members, facilitating the coordinate modulation of cadherins, small GTPases, and nuclear functions. δ-Catenin is an Armadillo protein of the p120-catenin subfamily capable of modulating cadherin stability, small GTPase activity, and nuclear transcription.

IntroductionThe means by which biological signals produce coordinate effects in varying cellular compartments is relevant to the execution of many developmental and pathological processes, and often involves events that take place at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. Canonical Wnt signaling, for example, generally occurs upon Wnt-ligand binding to cell surface receptors (e.g. Frizzled and Lrp5/6), facilitating Dishevelled-mediated inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex (composed of Axin, GSK-3β, APC, etc.). This results in cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and in activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin target genes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4062) Google Scholar). The membrane-spanning Notch receptors, on the other hand, are protease-cleaved upon the binding of ligands such as Delta or Jagged, such that the intracellular portion of Notch is liberated to enter the nucleus, associate with the CSL transcription factor complex (CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1), and modulate specific gene targets (3Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar). Both the Wnt and Notch pathways participate in multiple developmental/cellular processes and, when abnormally regulated, contribute to human disease, including cancer (4Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 5Hansson E.M. Lendahl U. Chapman G. Semin.

Together with catenins, which associate with cadherin intracellular tails and indirectly and dynamically with the actin cytoskeleton, cadherins play essential roles in establishing adherens junctions, thereby participating in tissue architecture and polarity, morphogenesis, and cell identity (6Harris T.J.

The central region of δ-catenin is composed of nine Armadillo repeats, which together form a helix of α-helices engaging in multiple protein interactions. Established functions of p120 subfamily members include their binding to cadherin juxtamembrane regions (whereas β-catenin binds a more distal site), where they stabilize the larger adhesion complex by reducing its rate of internalization (31Xiao K.

We find that cleavage of δ-catenin both abolishes its association with cadherin and impairs its ability to modulate small GTPases. To probe potential nuclear roles of δ-catenin, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening from an adult mouse brain cDNA library, resolving and then validating interaction with an uncharacterized KRAB family zinc finger protein, ZIFCAT. Our results indicate that ZIFCAT is nuclear and that it is likely to associate with DNA and act as a transcriptional repressor. Last, we report that other p120 subfamily catenins are similarly cleaved by caspase-3 and likewise bind ZIFCAT. Our findings potentially reveal a simple and novel signaling pathway based upon caspase-3 cleavage of p120-catenin subfamily members, facilitating the coordinate modulation of cadherin, small GTPases, and nuclear functions. IntroductionThe means by which biological signals produce coordinate effects in varying cellular compartments is relevant to the execution of many developmental and pathological processes, and often involves events that take place at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. Canonical Wnt signaling, for example, generally occurs upon Wnt-ligand binding to cell surface receptors (e.g. Frizzled and Lrp5/6), facilitating Dishevelled-mediated inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex (composed of Axin, GSK-3β, APC, etc.). This results in cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and in activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin target genes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4062) Google Scholar). The membrane-spanning Notch receptors, on the other hand, are protease-cleaved upon the binding of ligands such as Delta or Jagged, such that the intracellular portion of Notch is liberated to enter the nucleus, associate with the CSL transcription factor complex (CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1), and modulate specific gene targets (3Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar). Both the Wnt and Notch pathways participate in multiple developmental/cellular processes and, when abnormally regulated, contribute to human disease, including cancer (4Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 5Hansson E.M. Lendahl U. Chapman G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Classic cadherins are trans-membrane proteins best known to mediate cell-cell adhesion. Together with catenins, which associate with cadherin intracellular tails and indirectly and dynamically with the actin cytoskeleton, cadherins play essential roles in establishing adherens junctions, thereby participating in tissue architecture and polarity, morphogenesis, and cell identity (6Harris T.J.

Given that adherens junctions are dynamic structures, as made evident in development and wound repair (etc.), the regulated proteolysis of catenins may permit rapid junctional (as well as small GTPase) responses to upstream signaling events, with the generated catenin fragments conceivably having further gene-regulatory activities (11Steinhusen U.

The central region of δ-catenin is composed of nine Armadillo repeats, which together form a helix of α-helices engaging in multiple protein interactions. Established functions of p120 subfamily members include their binding to cadherin juxtamembrane regions (whereas β-catenin binds a more distal site), where they stabilize the larger adhesion complex by reducing its rate of internalization (31Xiao K. Oas R.G. Chiasson C.M. Kowalczyk A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, δ-catenin associates with small GTPases and/or their effectors, enabling the production or maintenance of discrete actin-dependent outgrowths, such as dendritic projections in neurons (32Anastasiadis P.Z.

Aside from its roles at the plasma membrane (adherens junctions) and in the cytoplasm (small GTPases), δ-catenin is intriguingly also present within nuclei in some tissues (37Rodova M. Kelly K.F.

For example, in the context of the neural-muscular junction, δ-catenin binds the transcriptional regulator Kaiso, which additionally binds p120-catenin (38Daniel J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

From the perspective of human disease, abnormal expression of δ-catenin is associated with the progression of several carcinomas, including those of the prostate, lung, and breast (42Zhang J.Y.

In this study, we present evidence that δ-catenin is a novel substrate of caspase-3, generating a fragment that exhibits enhanced nuclear localization and binds a novel zinc finger transcription factor. We find that cleavage of δ-catenin both abolishes its association with cadherin and impairs its ability to modulate small GTPases. To probe potential nuclear roles of δ-catenin, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening from an adult mouse brain cDNA library, resolving and then validating interaction with an uncharacterized KRAB family zinc finger protein, ZIFCAT. Our results indicate that ZIFCAT is nuclear and that it is likely to associate with DNA and act as a transcriptional repressor. Last, we report that other p120 subfamily catenins are similarly cleaved by caspase-3 and likewise bind ZIFCAT. Our findings potentially reveal a simple and novel signaling pathway based upon caspase-3 cleavage of p120-catenin subfamily members, facilitating the coordinate modulation of cadherin, small GTPases, and nuclear functions.

https://openalex.org/W2067113380,"Directed cell migration mediates physiological and pathological processes. In particular, immune cell trafficking in tissues is crucial for inducing immune responses and is coordinated by multiple environmental cues such as chemoattractant gradients. Although the chemotaxis mechanism has been extensively studied, how cells integrate multiple chemotactic signals for effective trafficking and positioning in tissues is not clearly defined. Results from previous neutrophil chemotaxis experiments and modeling studies suggested that ligand-induced homologous receptor desensitization may provide an important mechanism for cell migration in competing chemoattractant gradients. However, the previous mathematical model is oversimplified to cell gradient sensing in one-dimensional (1-D) environment. To better understand the receptor desensitization mechanism for chemotactic navigation, we further developed the model to test the role of homologous receptor desensitization in regulating both cell gradient sensing and migration in different configurations of chemoattractant fields in two-dimension (2-D). Our results show that cells expressing normal desensitizable receptors preferentially orient and migrate toward the distant gradient in the presence of a second local competing gradient, which are consistent with the experimentally observed preferential migration of cells toward the distant attractant source and confirm the requirement of receptor desensitization for such migratory behaviors. Furthermore, our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed cell migration patterns in different configurations of competing chemoattractant fields."

https://openalex.org/W2072876625,"Protein phosphorylation is the hallmark of checkpoint activation. Hundreds of targets of checkpoint kinases have been identified recently by genome-wide investigations. However, the complete picture of a phosphorylation network required for activation of a checkpoint pathway has not been available. The DNA replication checkpoint in Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains two major protein kinases, the sensor kinase Rad3 and the effector kinase Cds1, with the latter mediating most of the checkpoint functions. We show here that when DNA replication is arrested, efficient activation of Cds1 requires five phosphorylations that cooperate in a parallel or a sequential manner. Phosphorylation of a threonine residue (Thr(11)) in Cds1 by Rad3 occurs at a basal level in the absence of three other parallel Rad3-dependent phosphorylations on the mediator Mrc1 and Rad9 in the checkpoint clamp complex. However, the three parallel Rad3-dependent phosphorylations are all required for efficient phosphorylation of Thr(11) in Cds1 by Rad3. Phosphorylation of Thr(11) has been shown previously to promote autophosphorylation of Thr(328) in the kinase domain of Cds1, which directly activates the enzyme, leading to full activation of the checkpoint pathway. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Mrc1 by Rad3 does not require the phosphorylation of Rad9, suggesting that activation of the sensor kinase Rad3 in the replication checkpoint of fission yeast may involve a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2136932018,"As an addictive substance, nicotine has been suggested to facilitate pro-survival activities (such as anchorage-independent growth or angiogenesis) and the establishment of drug resistance to anticancer therapy. Tobacco smoking consists of a variety of carcinogens [such as benzopyrene (BP) and nitrosamine derivatives] that are able to cause DNA double strand breaks. However, the effect of nicotine on DNA damage-induced checkpoint response induced by genotoxins remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the events occurred during G1 arrest induced by γ-radiation or BP in nicotine-treated murine or human lung epithelial cells. DNA synthesis was rapidly inhibited after exposure to γ-radiation or BP treatment, accompanied with the activation of DNA damage checkpoint. When these cells were co-treated with nicotine, the growth restriction was compromised, manifested by upregulation of cyclin D and A, and attenuation of Chk2 phosphorylation. Knockdown of cyclin D or Chk2 by the siRNAs blocked nicotine-mediated effect on DNA damage checkpoint activation. However, nicotine treatment appeared to play no role in nocodazole-induced mitotic checkpoint activation. Overall, our study presented a novel observation, in which nicotine is able to override DNA damage checkpoint activated by tobacco-related carcinogen BP or γ-irradiation. The results not only indicates the potentially important role of nicotine in facilitating the establishment of genetic instability to promote lung tumorigenesis, but also warrants a dismal prognosis for cancer patients who are smokers, heavily exposed second-hand smokers or nicotine users."

SNF1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is inhibited during growth on high levels of glucose and is activated in response to glucose depletion and other stresses. Activation entails phosphorylation of Thr210 on the activation loop of the catalytic subunit Snf1 by Snf1-activating kinases. We have used mutational analysis to identify Snf1 residues that are important for regulation. Alteration of Tyr106 in the αC helix or Leu198 adjacent to the Asp-Phe-Gly motif on the activation loop relieved glucose inhibition of phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of Thr210 during growth on high levels of glucose. Substitution of Arg for Gly53, at the N terminus of the kinase domain, increased activation on both high and low glucose. Alteration of the ubiquitin-associated domain revealed a modest autoinhibitory effect. Previous studies identified alterations of the Gal83 (β) and Snf4 (γ) subunits that relieve glucose inhibition, and we have here identified a distinct set of Gal83 residues that are required. Together, these results indicate that alterations at dispersed sites within each subunit of SNF1 cause phosphorylation of the kinase during growth on high levels of glucose. These findings suggest that the conformation of the SNF1 complex is crucial to maintenance of the inactive state during growth on high glucose and that the default state for SNF1 is one in which Thr210 is phosphorylated and the kinase is active.

The mammalian AMPK α subunit has a UBA-like domain lacking the MGY/F motif, which inhibits the catalytic activity of recombinant proteins and facilitates Thr dephosphorylation in vitro (39Chen L.

To assess the contribution of sequences within the Snf1 subunit to the regulation of SNF1 in response to glucose availability, we introduced deletions and substitutions that altered the UBA domain and other features, based on sequence conservation and structural information. We expressed each mutant Snf1 subunit in snf1Δ cells and assessed regulation of the resulting mutant SNF1 protein kinase by monitoring phosphorylation of Thr210 and catalytic activity. In addition, examination of the structure of the SNF1 heterotrimer core (30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) led us to identify other residues of the Gal83 GBD that affect regulation of Thr210 phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that alterations at many sites within the SNF1 heterotrimer allow phosphorylation of Thr210 and activation of SNF1 during growth of cells on high levels of glucose, suggesting that the default state for SNF1 is one in which Thr210 is phosphorylated and the kinase is active. Snf1, Snf4, and functional Gal83-green fluorescent protein fusion were expressed from their native promoters on centromeric plasmids pCE108 (20Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Mutations were introduced into plasmids using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and confirmed by sequencing. Proteins were expressed in S. cerevisiae strains derived from W303–1A (MATa ade2 trp1 his3 can1 ura3 leu2): MCY4908 (W303–1A snf1Δ10) (42Hedbacker K. Townley R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Cultures were grown in selective synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% glucose. After reaching exponential phase (A600 of 0.7–0.8), cells were collected by rapid filtration and either frozen in liquid nitrogen or resuspended in SC plus 0.05% glucose for 10 min and then harvested by filtration and frozen. For some experiments, after incubation in 0.05% glucose, an aliquot of cells was incubated in SC plus 2% glucose for 10 min and collected. SNF1 was partially purified from two to four independent cultures as described (43Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) except with an additional washing step with 0.1 m NaCl (3 ml) before the final elution from DEAE-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Catalytic activity of SNF1 was assayed by measuring phosphorylation of SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) (44Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) as described (21Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except ATP was at 1 mm, with different protein concentrations to confirm linearity. Kinase activity is expressed as nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into the peptide/min/mg of protein (44Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Values are averages for 6–12 assays from 2–4 independent experiments. Partially purified protein samples, prepared as above, were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-Thr(P)-172-AMPK (Cell Signaling) to detect phosphorylated Thr210 or anti-polyhistidine (Sigma) to detect Snf1, which contains a stretch of His residues. ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) was used for visualization. The intensity of the bands was quantified using ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health (45Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). To assess the role of the UBA domain in regulating SNF1, we expressed mutant Snf1 proteins from the native promoter on a centromeric plasmid in snf1Δ cells. Cultures were grown to exponential phase in medium containing 2% (high) glucose and were harvested by rapid filtration to maintain the phosphorylation state of Snf1. An aliquot was resuspended in medium containing 0.05% (low) glucose for 10 min and then harvested. We partially purified SNF1 and assayed Thr210 phosphorylation and kinase activity. First, we deleted codons 347–398, encoding the UBA domain (Fig. 1, A and B). SNF1 protein kinase containing the Snf1Δ347–398 catalytic subunit showed modestly increased Thr210 phosphorylation and kinase activity, relative to wild-type SNF1, when cells were grown on high levels of glucose, and catalytic activity increased further when cultures were depleted for glucose (Fig. 1, C and D). We next introduced mutations to alter key residues. For the UBA-like domain of AMPK, alteration of the invariant Leu328 to Gln (L328Q) (Fig. 1B) increased the catalytic activity of a bacterially expressed AMPK fragment (41Pang T. Xiong B. Li J.Y. Qiu B.Y. Jin G.Z. Shen J.K. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The analogous Snf1L385Q mutant kinase was more highly phosphorylated on Thr210 and more active than wild-type kinase during growth on high glucose (Fig. 1, C and D). Substitution of the Met and Tyr residues of the MGY/F motif (Fig. 1B), which is predicted to disrupt the structure of the UBA domain in AMPK-related kinases (33Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Murphy J.M. Korzhnev D.M. Ceccarelli D.F. Briant D.J. Zarrine-Afsar A. Sicheri F. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), resulted in increased activation of Snf1M356A,Y358A on high glucose (Fig. 1, C and D). In a structure of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe kinase domain-autoinhibitory domain (KD-AID) (39Chen L. Jiao Z.H. Zheng L.S. Zhang Y.Y. Xie S.T. Wang Z.X. Wu J.W. Nature. 2009; 459: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), Leu88 in the kinase domain contributes to hydrophobic interactions with the UBA domain (called AID) involving the invariant Leu341 (equivalent to Snf1 Leu385). Leu88 is conserved in S. cerevisiae Snf1 (Leu109), as is the neighboring Leu89 (Leu110) at the end of the αC helix, and the double mutation L109A,L110A conferred a phenotype resembling that caused by alteration of Leu385 (Fig. 1, C and D). We note that the UBA domain is in a different position relative to the kinase domain in the MARK structures (38Marx A. Nugoor C. Müller J. Panneerselvam S. Timm T. Bilang M. Mylonas E. Svergun D.I. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27586-27599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Chen L. Jiao Z.H. Zheng L.S. Zhang Y.Y. Xie S.T. Wang Z.X. Wu J.W. Nature. 2009; 459: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) than in the S. pombe structure. In each of the above cases, the effect was modest, but the mutations yielded a consistent pattern indicating that the UBA domain contributes to inhibition of Thr210 phosphorylation of SNF1. Deletion of sequences extending beyond or located immediately C-terminal to the UBA domain (Δ367–415, Δ345–441, and Δ425–450) did not identify any substantial regulatory role for this region (Fig. 1D and data not shown); these deletions shorten the linker to the Snf1 segment that is bound to Snf4. Crystal structures of the Snf1 kinase domain differ with respect to the position of the αC helix (46Rudolph M.J. Amodeo G.A. Bai Y. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 1224-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 47Nayak V. Zhao K. Wyce A. Schwartz M.F. Lo W.S. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R.

Commun. 2010; 66: 999-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which is important in the activation of various protein kinases; for example, in cyclin-dependent kinase, the binding of cyclin causes movement of the αC helix toward the kinase domain, which results in activation (49Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the αC helix in Snf1 function, we introduced Ala substitutions (Fig. 2, A and B). Most of the substitutions reduced SNF1 activity but did not affect regulation of Thr210 phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, substitution of Tyr106 relieved glucose inhibition, causing substantially increased Thr210 phosphorylation and activity during growth on high glucose. Tyr is not conserved at this position; the corresponding residue in human AMPKα isoforms is Asn. Snf1Y106A provided Snf1 function in growth assays and also conferred resistance to the glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose, which prevents growth of wild-type cells on sucrose (Fig. 2H). Mutations that relieve glucose inhibition of the SNF1 pathway, such as reg1, confer resistance (50Neigeborn L. Carlson M. Genetics. 1987; 115: 247-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and addition of 2-deoxyglucose to glucose-limited cells inhibits SNF1 (51Hedbacker K. Carlson M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Structures of the Snf1 kinase domain also differ with respect to the position of the invariant Asp195-Phe196-Gly197 (DFG) motif (46Rudolph M.J. Amodeo G.A. Bai Y. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 1224-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 47Nayak V. Zhao K. Wyce A. Schwartz M.F. Lo W.S. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R.

Commun. 2010; 66: 999-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We introduced Ala substitutions for Leu198, which is conserved as a hydrophobic residue in the SNF1/AMPK family (Fig. 2C), and the next three residues. The L198A substitution virtually abolished catalytic activity (Fig. 2D), but, unexpectedly, Snf1L198A was strongly phosphorylated on Thr210 in cells grown on high levels of glucose (Fig. 2E). Alteration of residues immediately following Leu198 did not cause comparable effects, although S199A resulted in some activation on high glucose. In one structure (47Nayak V. Zhao K. Wyce A. Schwartz M.F. Lo W.S. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Structure. 2006; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Leu198 is located near Tyr106. Consistent with the lack of catalytic activity in vitro, Snf1L198A did not provide Snf1 function in vivo, as judged by growth on sucrose or glycerol plus ethanol. Gly53 is located at the N terminus of the conserved kinase domain. The mutation SNF1-G53R was repeatedly isolated as a suppressor of growth defects of the snf4Δ mutant and was shown to partially restore SUC2 expression (5Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Assays of immunoprecipitated Snf1G53R for phosphorylation of coprecipitated proteins showed elevated activity, relative to Snf1, in both snf4Δ and wild-type SNF4 strains; however, this elevated activity was still markedly Snf4-dependent (5Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies using a transcriptional activation assay confirmed that Snf1G53R has elevated catalytic activity in vivo (52Kuchin S. Treich I. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the time of the previous studies, procedures for maintaining the phosphorylation state of Snf1 Thr210 during preparation of cell extracts had not been developed, so we have revisited the properties of Snf1G53R. We found that Snf1G53R exhibits increased Thr210 phosphorylation and catalytic activity, relative to wild-type Snf1, in cells grown on high glucose, and is further activated in response to glucose depletion (Fig. 2, F and G). Cells expressing Snf1G53R exhibited resistance to 2-deoxyglucose (Fig. 2H). Previous studies reported that Snf1G53R conferred glucose-regulated SUC2 expression and transcriptional activation (5Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 52Kuchin S. Treich I. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We note that the subcellular localization of SNF1 is regulated, and its enrichment in the nucleus, where key targets are localized, is inhibited during growth on high glucose (43Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 51Hedbacker K. Carlson M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The region between the Snf1 kinase domain and the UBA domain is enriched for acidic residues (Fig. 3A), similar to the negatively charged common docking domains of MAPKs, which interact with other proteins, including kinases and phosphatases (53Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region affects phosphorylation of Thr210, we substituted Ala for four of these acidic residues, Glu residues 324, 325, 326, and 328. The resulting quadruple mutant protein, designated Snf1EA, showed normal regulation of Thr210 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Additional mutation of Asp residues 340, 342, 345, and 346 and Glu343, to yield Snf1EADA, with nine Ala substitutions, did not alter Thr210 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Thus, the negatively charged residues in this region are not required for interactions with Snf1-activating kinases or protein phosphatases. The C terminus of Snf1 includes the sequence KKSKTRWHFGIRSRSYPLDV (residues 499 through 518; distal to the regulatory sequence segment), which is completely conserved among divergent yeast species, including Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Pichia stiptis (32Amodeo G.A. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The position of the kinase domain relative to the SNF1 heterotrimer core (30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5) is not known, but Snf1 residues 1–392 interacted with residues 392–518, and not with residues 392–513, in two-hybrid assays (28Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To explore the functional importance of this region, we introduced various mutations. Snf1S511A,S513A,Y514A,P515A,L516A,D517A and Snf1S443A,S501A,T503A,S513A exhibited glucose-regulated SNF1 catalytic activity (1.1 ± 0.15 and 3.6 ± 0.59 nmol/min/mg on high glucose and 18 ± 1.8 and 20 ± 1.5 nmol/min/mg on low glucose, respectively). Alteration of basic residues in this conserved segment similarly had no effect, but we noted that these basic residues are positioned on a face of the core heterotrimer structure that has multiple positively charged residues; we therefore substituted Ala for thirteen basic residues on the Snf1 C terminus, Gal83, and Snf4 (Snf1K492A,K499A,K500A,K502A,R504A,R510A,R512A; Gal83K391A,H392A; and Snf4K51A,K52A,K246A,R263A) and expressed all three mutant proteins together in snf1Δ snf4Δ gal83Δ sip1Δ sip2Δ cells. The resulting multiply substituted SNF1 complex showed glucose-regulated SNF1 activity, 1.1 ± 0.04 and 8.0 ± 0.3 nmol/min/mg on high and low glucose, respectively; values were low when all subunits were expressed from plasmids (9.0 ± 0.07 nmol/min/mg for wild-type SNF1 on low glucose). In the structure of the SNF1 heterotrimer core (30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), Snf1 Ile477 interacts with hydrophobic residues Met189, Ile218, and Leu223 of the Sip2 GBD from another heterotrimer in the crystal. Substitution of the corresponding hydrophobic residues in Gal83M187A,I216A,L221A (Fig. 4A) caused substantial activation of SNF1 in gal83Δ sip1Δ sip2Δ cells on high glucose, with only a 2-fold increase in activity in response to glucose depletion (Fig. 4, B and C; note that Snf1 protein levels were reduced in the mutant samples). The substitution I477A caused lesser effects (Fig. 4, D and E), in accord with other evidence that the interaction in the structure is an artifact of crystal packing (32Amodeo G.A. Momcilovic M. Carlson M. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 397: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). More important, these findings identified a set of GBD residues that affect glucose regulation and are not involved in interactions with Snf4. The Lys186 residue next to Met187 was also of interest, because the orientation of the corresponding side chain differs in the structures of Sip2 GBD and mammalian AMPK β1 GBD (30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 54Polekhina G. Gupta A. van Denderen B.J. Feil S.C. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Parker M.W. Structure. 2005; 13: 1453-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Expression of Gal83K186A or Gal83K186A,M187A,I216A,L221A in gal83Δ sip1Δ sip2Δ cells caused substantial activation of SNF1 on high glucose (Fig. 4, F and G). Alteration of the highly conserved residue Trp184 in Gal83W184A did not alter regulation of Thr210 phosphorylation or SNF1 activity (Fig. 4, B and C); the analogous residue in mammalian β1 GBD, Trp100, is essential for the binding of glycogen to the GBD (54Polekhina G. Gupta A. van Denderen B.J. Feil S.C. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Parker M.W. Structure. 2005; 13: 1453-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 55Polekhina G. Gupta A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 867-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This finding is concordant with other evidence that glycogen binding to the GBD is not involved in regulation of SNF1 (13Ruiz A. Xu X. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6349-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Momcilovic M. Iram S.H. Liu Y. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that residues in different regions of the Snf1 catalytic subunit are required to maintain inhibition of SNF1 during growth of cells on high levels of glucose (Fig. 5). Substitution of Ala for Tyr106 in the αC helix of the kinase domain resulted in substantial phosphorylation of Snf1 Thr210 and catalytic activity during growth on high glucose. Substitution of Ala for Leu198 adjacent to the DFG motif in the activation loop similarly relieved glucose inhibition of Thr210 phosphorylation, although alteration of this conserved residue abolished catalytic activity. Substitution of Arg for Gly53 at the N terminus of the kinase domain increased phosphorylation and activation of SNF1 on high glucose, with yet further activation occurring in response to glucose depletion. Finally, deletion of the UBA domain, or substitution of conserved residues, led to a modest increase in Thr210 phosphorylation and SNF1 activity on both high and low levels of glucose, consistent with a role in autoinhibition. We also identified another set of residues of the Gal83 GBD that affect glucose inhibition of SNF1. Previously, we showed that the Gal83 GBD mutations W184A,R214Q and G235R, which affect interactions between residues at the interface of the GBD and Snf4 in the crystal structure of the SNF1 heterotrimer core (30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), resulted in Thr210 phosphorylation and SNF1 catalytic activity during growth on high glucose, as did deletion of the entire Gal83 GBD (23Momcilovic M. Iram S.H. Liu Y. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). R214Q disrupts interaction with Snf4 Asn177, mutation of which confers a similar phenotype (23Momcilovic M. Iram S.H. Liu Y. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we identified additional substitutions in the Gal83 GBD that have similar effects but alter residues that are not involved in interactions with Snf4 in the structure: K186A and M187A,I216A,L221A. These residues may participate in other interactions within the SNF1 complex that are not evident from the structure of the heterotrimer core, which lacks the kinase domain. Residues in distinct regions of Snf4 contribute to inhibition of SNF1 in glucose-grown cells (23Momcilovic M. Iram S.H. Liu Y. Carlson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to Asn177 and Arg169, which interact with the β subunit, residues of Snf4 that are not located near the β subunit in the crystal structure affected glucose inhibition. Notably, substitution of Asp for Gly145 (analogous to His383 in the nucleotide-binding pocket of AMPK γ2) and Tyr for Cys136, which is predicted to disrupt the structure of Snf4, caused activation of SNF1 on high glucose. Thus, alterations at dispersed sites within the SNF1 heterotrimer, in all three subunits, caused phosphorylation of Thr210 and activation of SNF1 during growth of cells on high levels of glucose. Maintenance of the dephosphorylated, inactive state in glucose-grown cells appears to require a specific conformation of the kinase complex that can be perturbed by a variety of alterations. It remains to be determined whether some of these alterations interfere with recognition of a glucose signal that acts directly on SNF1 to induce a particular conformation. The conformation assumed by wild-type SNF1 during growth on high glucose could either prevent phosphorylation or promote dephosphorylation, and either recognition of SNF1 or access to Thr210 by kinases or phosphatases could be affected. It has been reported that, under conditions of glucose limitation, Reg1-Glc7 phosphatase is active but its access to Thr210 is blocked (12Rubenstein E.M. McCartney R.R. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Shirra M.K. Arndt K.M. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 222-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, recent studies of the reg1Δ mutant (13Ruiz A. Xu X. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6349-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggest a need to revisit the evidence that Reg1-Glc7 is active in low glucose. For AMPK, the binding of AMP inhibits dephosphorylation of the activation-loop Thr in vitro (17Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 18Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) but also promotes phosphorylation by upstream kinases (19Oakhill J.S. Chen Z.P. Scott J.W. Steel R. Castelli L.A. Ling N. Macaulay S.L. Kemp B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 19237-19241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether the regulated event during growth on high glucose is phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, our findings suggest that the conformation of the SNF1 complex is crucial to maintenance of the inactive state and that the default state for SNF1 is one in which the kinase is phosphorylated and active. These findings suggest new strategies for targeting AMPK to activate the kinase. We thank Amparo Ruiz for growth assays and L. Tong and G. Amodeo for helpful discussions."

In this work, we explore the cell surface of these microorganisms using amplitude-modulation atomic-force microscopy in nearly physiological conditions. We demonstrate the presence of a regular corrugation with a periodicity of 16-20 nm attributed to the surface layer (S-layer) protein lattice, striped domains asymmetrically distributed on the cell faces and peculiar bulges correlated with the presence of intracellular granules. Besides, subsequent images of cell evolution during the drying process indicate the presence of an external capsule that might correspond to the giant protein halomucin, predicted by the genome but never before observed by other microscopy studies."

https://openalex.org/W2058554427,"PTEN is a critical gene involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. The product of this gene has dual phosphatase activity and is able to dephosphorylate the 5′ end of the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Within the cellular nucleus, this protein has been associated with regulation of the expression of many genes, although the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. In this paper, two specific oligonucleotide aptamers were developed and selected, using the SELEX procedure, according to their ability to detect the PTEN protein in different subcellular compartments of neurons. While one aptamer was able to detect PTEN in the nucleus, the other recognized PTEN in the cytoplasm. The recognition pattern of PTEN by both aptamers was confirmed using antibodies in western blots of the proteins purified from mouse cerebellar homogenates and subcellular fractions. Additionally, we demonstrated that the two aptamers recognized different epitopes of the target peptide. The results presented here could not be fully explained by the canonical phosphatase structure of PTEN, suggesting the existence of different conformations of phosphatase in the nucleus and the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2050523372,"Donor T cell transfusion, which is a long-standing approach to prevent allograft rejection, operates indirectly by alteration of host T cell immunity. We therefore hypothesized that adoptive transfer of immune regulatory host Th2 cells would represent a novel intervention to enhance cardiac allograft survival. Using a well-described rat cardiac transplant model, we first developed a method for ex vivo manufacture of rat host-type Th2 cells in rapamycin, with subsequent injection of such Th2.R cells prior to class I and class II disparate cardiac allografting. Second, we determined whether Th2.R cell transfer polarized host immunity towards a Th2 phenotype. And third, we evaluated whether Th2.R cell therapy prolonged allograft viability when used alone or in combination with a short-course of cyclosporine (CSA) therapy. We found that host-type Th2.R cell therapy prior to cardiac allografting: (1) reduced the frequency of activated T cells in secondary lymphoid organs; (2) shifted post-transplant cytokines towards a Th2 phenotype; and (3) prolonged allograft viability when used in combination with short-course CSA therapy. These results provide further support for the rationale to use “direct” host T cell therapy for prolongation of allograft viability as an alternative to “indirect” therapy mediated by donor T cell infusion."
