https://openalex.org/W2083874134,"The primitively social sweat bee, Lasioglossum zephyrum, blocks the entry into its nest of most conspecifics from other colonies. Laboratory inbreeding of these bees produced lines which showed a positive linear relationship between the coefficient of relationship of bees tested and how often they permitted non-nestmates to pass them. The most probable mechanism is a genetically determined odor coupled with a learned component by which guard bees discriminate between odors of close kin and other bees."

https://openalex.org/W2094850583,Simple exposure to Western goods may not be a sufficient explanation of why isolated village communities increase their participation in external market economies. The degree of market participation by four native villages in central Brazil is related to the difficulty of making a living from slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture as measured by the ratio of labor input to food output.
https://openalex.org/W2068815239,"Acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) live in family groups within which more than one female may lay eggs communally in a single nest. Communally nesting females are usually closely related and share evenly in nesting activities. Although birds of either sex may breed in their natal territory, reproductive inhibition of offspring by the presence of their parent of the opposite sex and dispersal by unisexual sibling units ensure that inbreeding between close relatives is rare."

An original apparatus was developed for this experiment, which allows loading of the cell at room temperature. Applications to various areas of research are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1987524678,"Although micrometeorites of cometary origin are thought to be the dominant component of interplanetary dust, it has never been possible to positively identify such micrometer-sized particles. Two such particles have been identified as definitely micrometeorites since their abundances of volatile and nonvolatile trace elements closely match those of primitive solar system material."
https://openalex.org/W2032627910,The outbursts seen on Jupiter's satellite Io have been described as volcanic eruptions. They may instead be the result of large electric currents flowing through hot spots on Io and causing evaporation of surface materials. A strictly periodic behavior would then be expected.
https://openalex.org/W1980548234,"Methane concentrations as great as 30,000 nanoliters per liter were measured on two cruises in the northwest Caribbean Sea. Such concentrations are three orders of magnitude higher than Bunsen solubilities would predict. Although shallow maxima may result from in situ microbial activity, the deeper maxima appear to result from massive seepage (estimated at 1 x 10(8) to 10 x 10(8) liters per day) along the Jamaica Ridge."
https://openalex.org/W1974450715,"More fundamental knowledge of coal (knowledge of its structure and its behavior during conversion processes) is essential before we can generate new technologies necessary for the efficient use of coal in the future. Herein are suggested specific basic research opportunities in the areas of coal characterization, gasification, combustion, and liquefaction, along with an assessment of the impact such research programs could have. Critical characterization needs include qualitative and quantitative determination of the chemical forms of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur and reliable methods for the measurement of surface area, pore volume, and weight-average molecular weights. Mechanistic studies aimed at increasing understanding of the thermal breakdown of the functionalities in coal, the behavior of coal in the presence of molecular and donor hydrogen environments, and carbon gasification and hydrocarbon synthesis reactions starting from carbon monoxide and hydrogen will lay the scientific foundation for the development of new processes for converting coal into clean usable fuels and chemicals."

The fluorine occurs as potassium fluorosilicate, which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. A closely related sponge living in the same habitat does not contain any fluorine. The habitat was found to be free of fluorine except for the small amount naturally present in seawater."
