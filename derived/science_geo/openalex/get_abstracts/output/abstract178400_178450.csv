https://openalex.org/W2110495699,"The pathogenic mechanisms underlying idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) remain enigmatic. Recent findings suggest that inflammatory processes are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. Enhanced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, has been found in association with glial cells in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. To determine the potential role for TNF-alpha in PD, we examined the effects of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a dopaminergic neurotoxin that mimics some of the key features associated with PD, using transgenic mice lacking TNF receptors. Administration of MPTP to wild-type (+/+) mice resulted in a time-dependent expression of TNF-alpha in striatum, which preceded the loss of dopaminergic markers and reactive gliosis. In contrast, transgenic mice carrying homozygous mutant alleles for both the TNF receptors (TNFR-DKO), but not the individual receptors, were completely protected against the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MPTP. The data indicate that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha is an obligatory component of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, because TNF-alpha is synthesized predominantly by microglia and astrocytes, our findings implicate the participation of glial cells in MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Similar mechanisms may underlie the etiopathogenesis of PD."
https://openalex.org/W2029659126,"Pseudovitamin D-deficiency rickets (PDDR) is an autosomal disease characterized by hyperparathyroidism, rickets, and undetectable levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Mice in which the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1alpha-hydroxylase (1alpha-OHase) gene was inactivated presented the same clinical phenotype as patients with PDDR and were used to study renal expression of the epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC1), the calbindins, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1), and Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA1b). Serum Ca2+ (1.20+/-0.05 mM) and mRNA/protein expression of ECaC1 (41+/-3%), calbindin-D28K (31+/-2%), calbindin-D9K (58+/-7%), NCX1 (10+/-2%), PMCA1b (96+/-4%) were decreased in 1alpha-OHase-/- mice compared with 1alpha-OHase+/- littermates. Feeding these mice a Ca2+-enriched diet normalized serum Ca2+ levels and expression of Ca2+ proteins except for calbindin-D9K expression. 1,25(OH)2D3 repletion resulted in increased expression of Ca2+ transport proteins and normalization of serum Ca2+ levels. Localization of Ca2+ transport proteins was clearly polarized in which ECaC1 was localized along the apical membrane, calbindin-D28K in the cytoplasm, and calbindin-D9K along the apical and basolateral membranes, resulting in a comprehensive mechanism facilitating renal transcellular Ca2+ transport. This study demonstrated that high dietary Ca2+ intake is an important regulator of the renal Ca2+ transport proteins in 1,25(OH)2D3-deficient status and thus contributes to the normalization of blood Ca2+ levels."

The crystal structure of the ClpA subunit reveals an N-terminal domain with pseudo-twofold symmetry and two AAA+ modules (D1 and D2) each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain with ADP bound in the sub-domain junction. The N-terminal domain interacts with the D1 domain in a manner similar to adaptor-binding domains of other AAA+ proteins. D1 and D2 are connected head-to-tail consistent with a cooperative and vectorial translocation of protein substrates. In a planar hexamer model of ClpA, built by assembling ClpA D1 and D2 into homohexameric rings of known structures of AAA+ modules, the differences in D1-D1 and D2-D2 interfaces correlate with their respective contributions to hexamer stability and ATPase activity.

Energy-dependent intracellular protein degradation is needed for cell growth, mediation of stress responses, and supervision of protein quality control (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proteases, such as the Clp proteases and proteasomes, are composed of a proteolytic core particle, in which the active sites are compartmentalized, and an ATP-dependent regulatory particle with ATPase and chaperone activity (2Kessel M.

InEscherichia coli ClpAP and ClpXP, the functional units are ClpP, a protease core of 14 identical subunits in two stacked heptameric rings (3Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M.

The ATPase subunits are responsible for substrate selection, protein unfolding and translocation to the proteolytic core, and allosteric modulation of the ClpP activity; they also have stand-alone chaperone activity, catalyzing limited structural remodeling of proteins and disassembly of stable protein complexes (4Wickner S.

The AAA+modules assemble into homologous or heterologous rings, with hexameric rings being most common. Structural analysis of AAA+proteins in several nucleotide states has led to models of possible conformational changes that accompany ATP hydrolysis and exchange of nucleotides and that may have a role in chaperone activity and promotion of protein degradation (18Wang J.

ClpA subunits have two non-identical AAA+ modules in tandem, similar to the autonomous molecular chaperone Hsp104 (ClpB) (19Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S.

In contrast, ClpX, like ClpY (HslU), the regulatory particle of the proteasome, and diverse others, possess a single AAA+ module. The two ATPase domains have non-equivalent roles in different AAA+ proteins; the domain most involved in hexamer assembly (D1 in ClpA) or possessing higher ATPase activity (D2 in ClpA) differs between ClpA and Hsp104 or NSF (5Singh S.K.

In proteolytic complexes, only one ring surface of ClpA interacts with ClpP, whereas the other binds protein substrates (24Ishikawa T. Beuron F. Kessel M. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4328-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Contact with ClpP is mediated in part by an exposed loop in D2 called the ClpP loop (25Singh S.K. Rozycki J.

In addition to the AAA+ modules, ClpA subunit has a unique N-terminal domain (N-domain) of 150–160 residues, which has not been definitively visualized by EM studies. Here, we report the crystal structure of the full length ClpA, the first atomic resolution structure of a complete AAA+ protein with two ATPase domains, and discuss its functional implications. The expression plasmids for the ClpA-M169L mutant protein and for the N-domain were derived from pSK39 (27Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A stop codon was introduced after the residue R143 to generate the N-domain expression vector. E. coli strains SG22176 clpA::kan (28Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) containing corresponding plasmids were grown in LB medium at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.7, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added, and cells were incubated a further 2.5 h. The cells were harvested and broken in a French press at 20,000 pounds/square inch. The crude extracts were treated with 0.05% polyethyleneimine, and the precipitates were removed by centrifugation. For full length ClpA, the supernatant after the polyethyleneimine treatment was separated on a SP Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) as described (27Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and then applied to a hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and eluted with a gradient of phosphate from 20 to 200 mm. After concentration, the protein was run over a Bio-Sil TSK250 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, and 10% glycerol. ClpA was precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved to a concentration of 12 mg/ml on ice, dialyzed against three changes of 1 liter of buffer H (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) for 24 h, and stored at −80 °C. For N-domain, the supernatant after polyethyleneimine treatment was applied to a Q Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biosciences) and a Bio-Sil TSK250 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) in sequence. The purified fractions were precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH7.5, and stored at −80 °C. For crystallization, frozen aliquots of the full length ClpA were thawed on ice, and 8 mm ATPγS or ADP and 40 mm MgCl2 were added. Optimal condition for crystallization is achieved by mixing 10 μl of protein solution with an equal amount of well solution containing HEPES (0.1 m, pH 7.5), KCl (0.5 m), glycerol (5%), isopropanol (8%), and sodium azide (0.01%). ClpA crystals up to 400 × 400 × 400 μm in size were routinely obtained after incubation at 21 °C for 1 month. ClpA crystals were soaked in a stepwise manner in cryo-protection solution containing HEPES (0.1 m, pH 7.5), KCl (0.3 m), PEG 4000 (30%), and glycerol (35%). Crystals were frozen in liquid propane. Heavy atom derivative crystals were prepared following the same protocol as the cryo-soaking, except for the last soaking cycle, at which point crystals were treated with cryoprotection solution containing 1–10 mm heavy metal compounds. In a like manner, frozen aliquots of N-domain protein were thawed on ice, and a 2 × 2 μl hanging drop was set up with the reservoir buffer containing PIPES (0.1 m, pH 7.0), PEG 8000 (35%), and sodium citrate (0.32 m). Crystals of N-domain were produced in 3 months at 21 °C. Native and derivative data sets were collected mainly at beamline X9B of NSLS (National Synchrotron Light Source), Brookhaven National Laboratory, at BioCARS and Dow-Northwestern-Dupont beamline of APS (Advanced Photon Source), Argonne National Laboratory, on ADSC 2 × 2 CCD and MAR CCD detectors. Cryo-frozen full length ClpA crystals diffracted x-rays to a maximum of 2.4-Å resolution. They have the symmetry of space group P65 and average cell dimensions ofa = b = 123.7 Å, c = 97.8 Å. Diffraction images were processed with the programs in the HKL package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Native and heavy atom derivative data sets were scaled together with the programs TRUNCATE, CAD, and SCALEIT of the CCP4 package (30Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). Difference Patterson map between the MeHgAc derivative and native2 (Table I) was calculated with the FFT program and three heavy atom sites were identified. For all other derivatives, heavy metal sites were determined by the difference Fourier technique with single isomorphous replacement phases from the single Hg derivative. Heavy atom parameters for all derivatives were refined and multiple isomorphous replacement phases were calculated with the MLPHARE program (31Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W.

Phasing statistics for the four derivatives are given in Table I. Density modification using a solvent content of 45% with the program DM (32Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The model was refined with the program REFMAC (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13869) Google Scholar) against a higher resolution native data set (Native2, Table I) with iterative manual model rebuilding. Crystals of ClpA N-domain diffracted x-rays to 1.8-Å resolution at room temperature in space group P212121 and have average cell dimensions of a = 32.0 Å, b = 52.0 Å,c = 65.1 Å. The structure was determined using a crude polyalanine tracing model from the N-domain of the full length ClpA in a molecular replacement rotational and translational search, followed by refinement of several search solutions using the CNS-solve program (35Brunger A.T.

Open table in a new tab Least-squares structure alignments of ClpA D1 to D2, and to other known AAA+ modules were performed in the program O. Buried surface area was calculated with the program AREAIMOL (36Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) in CCP4. The hexameric structures of NSF-D2 (PDB entry 1D2N) and HslU (PDB entry 1DO0) were generated by supplying appropriate crystallographic symmetry operators. To build a hexameric model of ClpA, the hexameric N-D1 and D2 models were built using the NSF hexamer and HslU hexamer as templates, respectively. The resulting N-D1 and D2 rings were energy-minimized separately with imposed 6-fold symmetry and joined together co-axially in an orientation and separation that rendered minimum van der Waals energy and a distance of 4 Å between the C-terminal residue of N-D1 domain and that of the N terminus of the D2 domain. We solved and refined the structures for both the full length ClpA in the space group P65 at 2.6-Å resolution and the N-domain of ClpA (residue 1–142) in the space group P212121at 1.8-Å resolution, respectively. Details of structure solutions are given under “Experimental Procedures,” and the statistics for crystallographic data collection, phasing, and refinement are provided in Table I. Stepwise soaking of glycerol for cryoprotection made ClpA crystals mosaic, with mosaicities in the range between 0.8° and 1.5°. The best native crystal diffracted x-rays to 2.4-Å resolution at synchrotron, but diffraction intensities fell off rapidly beyond 3.5 Å. Diffraction spots higher than 2.6 Å were not included in refinement because they failed to follow the Wilson statistics (37Wilson A.J.C. Nature. 1942; 150: 151-152Google Scholar). More than 30 heavy atom derivative data sets were collected, and four were sufficiently isomorphic to the native (Table I) to contribute to the MIR phasing. There are several disordered regions in the ClpA structure; all of them are loops connecting secondary structure elements or between domains (Fig.1 b). There appeared to be some variations in crystal packing of ClpA domains because the TLS refinement in the Refmac (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The diffraction data set for the N-domain crystal was collected at room temperature at synchrotron from a single crystal (Table I) that diffracted x-rays to 1.8-Å resolution. The data set was incomplete especially at high resolution. The N-domain structure was nevertheless refined successfully with all data included, and the final refined electron density showed characteristics of a high resolution structure. The full length ClpA subunit consists of five tandemly linked structural domains (Fig. 1 a) corresponding to three functional groups: an N-domain and two AAA+ ATPase modules. The N-domain has 142 residues; the first AAA+ ATPase module (D1) has 270 residues and the second ATPase module (D2) contains 319 residues, each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain (Fig.1 b). Both domains are larger than the conventionally defined 230 residue AAA+ module (8Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased size comes from a set of insertions or extensions, such as the transition helices (D1-HT and D2-HT) at the start of D1 and D2 by which they are connected to the preceding domains; D1-Hγ, which forms the anchor in D1 by which it is connected to D2; the ClpP loop, a function-specific insertion within D2; and the C-terminal β-strands, Sβ and Sγ. Despite these additions, the ClpA ATPase modules are markedly analogous to other AAA+ modules whose structures are known. In the ClpA crystal, the two AAA+ modules are connected head-to-tail with the longest dimension inclined with respect to the 6-fold screw axis, placing a neighboring D2 domain directly underneath the D1 domain. This arrangement differs from the model of another two-AAA+ domain protein, p97, derived from separate crystal structures for p97 N-D1 and NSF D2 fit into a cryo-EM density envelope, which indicates a tail-to-tail connection of the two AAA+ modules along the 6-fold molecular axis (14Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gown B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The different arrangements may reflect fundamental differences in the activities of these proteins. The head-to-tail order may be present in ClpA because the vectorial transfer of unfolded proteins into the degradation chamber of ClpP requires the sequential activity of the two domains. Two symmetry-related N-domains have contacts with the D1-D2 domains in the crystal. The electron density for the 25 residues connecting the N-domain and D1 was not visible, but we were able to identify the cognate N-domain based on three criteria: the distance between the C-terminal residues of the N-domains and the first determined residue of D1, the surface area buried by each N-domain-D1D2 contact, and the location of contact interface. The distances for both candidates were similar (59 Å and 55 Å), but there was a significant difference in the corresponding buried surface areas, 1371 Å2 versus 611 Å2. Furthermore, the N-domain with the larger buried surface area was exclusively in contact with the D1, similar to the interaction seen in the p97 N-D1 structure (14Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gown B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), whereas the other N-domain had most of its contact with D2. The N-domain thus assigned best fit all three criteria. Other regions for which density was not well defined included residues 252–255, residues 295–300, and notably residues 611–625 (Fig. 1 b). All three appear to be functionally important loops subject to conformational variability. In contrast, the electron density for the D1-D2 connector was visible without ambiguity. The overall structure is consistent with results of limited proteolysis (25Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and provides precise domain boundary information. The N-domain has a tightly packed helical structure (Fig. 1 c). The secondary structure consists of eight α-helices corresponding to 61% helical content (Fig. 1 b). Helices H1–H4 can be superimposed onto helices H1′–H4′ with a root mean square deviation of 1.56 Å for 58 pairs of Cα atoms. The first four helices are related to the second four by a rotation of 178°, so that the entire N-domain has pseudo-twofold symmetry. Structure based sequence alignment of the two halves of the ClpA N-domain and its homologs from different species (data not shown) reveals a weak sequence conservation to the consensus sequence for the two halves producing roughly 19 and 15% identity, respectively. In each half, all but four conserved residues are hydrophobic and are concentrated in helices, especially in H2 and H2′, which form the hydrophobic core of the N-domain (Fig. 1 c). Despite weak sequence identity, the tertiary structure conservation between the two halves is very significant, suggesting that the origin of the repeating motif is an early evolutionary gene duplication event. Searches of the protein structure data base (38Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) with either the whole N-domain or with a single repeating four-helix motif did not produce a single match of significance; therefore, the N-domain of ClpA may represent a new fold. The first half of the N-domain has an apparent Zn2+-binding site consisting of residues His-20, His-22, and Glu-63 in a spatial arrangement similar to that of metalloproteases. In an accompanying paper we report the structure of the N-domain with Zn bound at this site. 2Guo, F., Esser, L., Singh, S. K., Maurizi, M. R., and Xia, D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277,46753–46762 These residues are conserved in only a subset of ClpA proteins, suggesting that the site may be required for a ClpA-specific interaction with substrates or adaptors. We have found that the isolated N-domain of ClpA forms a tight heterodimeric complex with ClpS (data not shown), a small protein that associates with ClpA in many organisms and modulates ClpA activity (39Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The non-homologous N-domains of other AAA+ proteins, such as p97 or NSF, act in an analogous manner by binding unique adaptors that direct their activities toward specific intracellular pathways (40Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 41Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). ClpA N-domain makes contacts with the D1-small domain mainly through helix H4 with >74% of the total buried surface area, and less significantly, with the D1-large domain through helix H3′. The association at the three domain interface with 1371 Å2 of buried surface area appears weak, consistent with in vitroexperiments showing that isolated N-domains do not bind tightly to ClpAΔ153 (data not shown). These data together with the poor visibility of N-domains in EM reconstruction (25Singh S.K. Rozy"
https://openalex.org/W2072270661,"As tumors grow and invade beyond their homeostatic limits, the tumor cells are subjected to insufficient nutrient and oxygen supplies because of excessive demand for nutrition and oxygen, and insufficient vascularization. We therefore hypothesized that tolerance to nutrient deprivation as well as angiogenesis may be critical in some malignancies, including pancreatic cancers, which are seen to be a hypovascular tumor. In this study, we assessed the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a major role in protecting cells from metabolic stresses, on tumor biology under nutrient-deprived condition. Whereas hepatic cancer cells had mostly died within 48 h during glucose deprivation, most pancreatic cancer cells survived more than 48 h. The tolerance to glucose deprivation tended to correlate with the cells level of expression of AMPK α1 and α2. The introduction of AMPK antisense RNA expression vectors into pancreas cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and AsPC-1, significantly diminished their tolerance to glucose deprivation, and the stable transfection of AMPK antisense into PANC-1 cells inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. These findings indicate that AMPK expression contributes to tolerance to nutrient starvation in cancer cells. We propose AMPK as a new target for therapeutic strategies to suppress tumor growth and invasion."

Hyperacetylation of histone H3 on nucleosomes associated with the interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-5 genes was observed in developing Th2 cells but not in Th1 cells. Histone hyperacetylation on IL-5 gene-associated nucleosomes was Th2-specific but occurred with delayed kinetics, and hyperacetylation on RAD50 gene-associated nucleosomes was T cell antigen receptor stimulation-dependent but not Th2-specific. The induction of the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation was STAT6- and GATA3-dependent, and interestingly, it was accompanied by the expression of intergenic transcripts within the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci. A conserved GATA3 response element (CGRE) containing four GATA consensus sequences was identified 1.6 kbp upstream from the IL-13 gene, corresponding with the 5′-border of the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation region. The CGRE was shown to bind to GATA3, histone acetyltransferase complexes including CBP/p300, and RNA polymerase II.

Coffman R.L. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 111-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor-β and direct cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and are involved in humoral immunity and allergic reactions.

Naive CD4 T cells stimulated with antigens in the presence of IL-12 differentiate into Th1 cells, whereas the presence of IL-4 drives differentiation into Th2 cells (4Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A.

For Th1 cell differentiation, the IL-12-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 is required, whereas IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation is important for Th2 cell development (7Gately M.K.

In addition to the cytokines mentioned above, T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation by antigens is also indispensable for both Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation. We reported that efficient TCR-mediated activation of the p56lck, calcineurin, and Ras-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade was required for Th2 cell generation (10Yamashita M.

Recent studies have identified several transcription factors that control Th1/Th2 cell differentiation. Among them, GATA3 appears to be a key factor for Th2 cell differentiation. GATA3 is expressed selectively in Th2 cells, and its ectopic expression induced Th2 cell differentiation even in the absence of STAT6 (13Zhang D.H. Cohn L. Ray P. Bottomly K. Ray A. J. Biol.

Analogous to GATA3 in Th2 cell differentiation, the ectopic expression of T-bet induced IFN-γ production and suppression of Th2 cytokine expression. Changes in the chromatin structure of the Th2 cytokine (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) gene loci occur during Th2 cell differentiation (18Agarwal S. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

The highly conserved 400-bp noncoding sequence 1 (CNS1) was identified in this region (22Loots G.G. Locksley R.M. Blankespoor C.M. Wang Z.E. Miller W. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A.

More recently, a 3′-distal IL-4 enhancer (VA) containing an inducible DNase I-hypersensitive site was identified (24Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A.

We recently reported that demethylation of this region is regulated by polycomb group genes (25Kimura M. Koseki Y. Yamashita M. Watanabe N. Shimizu C. Katsumoto T. Kitamura T. Taniguchi M. Koseki H.

Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It is also well documented that the modification of histone N termini is crucial for the changes in chromatin structure seen in sites of gene expression (27Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). For example, hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 tails by histone acetyltransferases was suggested to mark the remodeling site (28Reinke H. Gregory P.D. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and to stabilize the binding of the SNF/SWI complex to nucleosomes (29Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, large domains of transcriptionally active chromatin were found to contain hyperacetylated histones and showed increased sensitivity to DNase I (30Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated histone hyperacetylation on nucleosomes associated with Th2 cytokine gene loci in developing Th2 cells. The results indicate that hyperacetylation of histones associated with the IL-4 and IL-13 gene loci but not with the RAD50 locus is Th2-specific and is dependent on GATA3. We identified a 71-bp conserved GATA3 response element (CGRE) at 1.6 kbp upstream from the IL-13 locus. The CGRE was shown to bind GATA3 in vitro andin vivo. Also, p300 and RNA polymerase II were precipitated with CGRE oligonucleotide in vitro. The roles for the CGRE in the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation of the IL-4- and IL-13-gene-associated nucleosomes are discussed. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). STAT6-deficient mice were kindly provided by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (31Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). All mice used in this study were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and were about 4 weeks old. Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of Chiba University. CD4 T cells were purified using magnetic beads and an Auto-MACS Sorter® (Miltenyi Biotec), yielding purity of >98%. Enriched CD4 T cells (1.5 × 106) were stimulated for 2 days with 3 μg/ml immobilized anti-TCR mAb (H57–597) in the added presence of 25 units/ml IL-2, 100 units/ml IL-12, and anti-IL-4 mAb 11B11 (25% culture supernatant) for Th1-skewed conditions. For Th2-skewed conditions, cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb as above but in the presence of 25 units/ml IL-2, 100 units/ml IL-4, and anti-IFN-γ mAb R4.6A2 (25% culture supernatant). The cells were then transferred to new dishes and cultured for another 3 days in the presence of only the cytokines present in the initial culture. The levels of Th1/Th2 cell generation were then assessed by intracellular cytokine staining with anti-IL-4 and anti-IFN-γ as described by Yamashita et al. (10Yamashita M. Hashimoto K. Kimura M. Kubo M. Tada T. Nakayama T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ChIP was performed using histone H3 and histone H4 ChIP assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology). Some assays employed anti-GATA3 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described under “Results.” In brief, 1 × 106 CD4 T cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were sedimented, washed, lysed with SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were sonicated to reduce DNA lengths to between 200 and 1,000 bp. The soluble fraction was diluted, precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, and then incubated with 6 μl of antiserum specific for the acetylated forms of histones H3 or H4. Then immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose. The precipitated DNA was eluted with an elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 containing 1% SDS). The eluted material was incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links, and DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform. Ethanol-precipitated DNA was solubilized in water (1 × 106 cell equivalent/100 μl). Semiquantitative PCR was performed with 3, 1, and 0.3 μl of DNA samples (a 3-fold dilution) at 27 cycles. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Images were recorded and quantified using ATTO L&S analyzer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Semiquantitative PCR was performed using the primers listed in the supplemental figure. Total RNA was isolated using Trisol reagent (Invitrogen). All samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara) at 37 °C for 30 min under the following conditions: 20 μg of RNA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 unit/μl RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 10 units of DNase I in a volume of 50 μl. Then, a phenol/chloroform extraction was performed and the RNA precipitated. Reverse transcription was done using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Control reactions were set up under identical conditions but without the inclusion of reverse transcriptase. The primers for detection of intergenic transcripts were the same as those used in ChIP assay. Purified CD4 T cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-TCR mAb for 3 days under Th2-skewed conditions. Then, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer C (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa2V03, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 1:3 with buffer D (buffer C without NaCl). The lysates were incubated with 10 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 70 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) carrying biotinylated oligonucleotides. The reaction mixtures were incubated at constant rotation for 40 min at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed twice with buffer C/buffer D (1:3). The bound protein was eluted by adding 50 ml of SDS sample buffer and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, protein was subjected to immunoblot analysis using mAbs specific for GATA3, p300, and RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Infected cells were subjected to intracellular staining with anti-IL-4 and anti-IFN-γ mAb, or to cell sorting. cDNA for human GATA3 was inserted into a multicloning site of pMX-IRES-GFP. A single copy of a 260-bp fragment spanning the CGRE site (CGRE260 WT) or CGRE260 with a single GATA binding site 3 mutation (CGRE260 M3) was cloned at the 5′ of the IL-4 promoter (−766), IL-13 promoter (−254), and IL-5 promoter (−1200) in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2Basic (Promega). M12 cells (B cell line) were used for transfection by electoroporation (960 microfarads/230 V). For transfection, 10 μg of each promoter reporter construct was used in combination with 10 μg of either a GATA3 expression vector, pcDNA3.1-GATA3, or empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). In addition, 20 ng of a Renilla luciferase reporter vector, pRL-TK (Promega), was added into each transfection as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm ionomycin (IL-4 and IL-13 reporter assay) or 10 ng/ml PMA and 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP (IL-5 reporter assay) 2 h after transfection. 24 h later, cell extracts were prepared and subjected to luciferase assay using a Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because histone acetylation is one of the factors affecting chromatin structure, we first assessed the status of histone acetylation on nucleosomes associated with Th2 cytokine genes in developing Th2 cells. The ChIP assay using antibodies specific for acetylated histone H3 (at both lysine residues 9 and 14) was employed, and the relative levels of DNA associated with the acetylated histones were determined by semiquantitative PCR assay using the specific primers shown in Fig. 1. We included promoter regions of each gene and intergenic regions of the IL-4 and IL-13 loci which were described previously as regions containing regulatory elements or DNase I-hypersensitive sites (18Agarwal S. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Bird J.J. Brown D.R. Mullen A.C. Moskowitz N.H. Mahowald M.A. Sider J.R. Gajewski T.F. Wang C.R. Reiner S.L.

The results of a ChIP assay of freshly prepared CD4 T cells and CD4 T cells stimulated under Th1- and Th2-skewed conditions for the times indicated are shown (Fig. 2 A). The intensities of bands representing the indicated DNA fragments were measured by densitometry, and the change of relative intensities is shown in Fig. 2 B. At all regions tested, histone H3 was hypoacetylated in freshly prepared CD4 T cells. After 1 day of stimulation, low but significant levels of acetylation occurred at all regions tested, and no difference between Th1 and Th2 culture conditions was noted. However, as shown in Fig. 2, A andB, the levels of histone acetylation associated with certain DNA fragments (two IL-4-related, CNS1, and two IL-13-related) were increased significantly in T cells cultured for 2–5 days under Th2-skewed conditions. The acetylation levels were clearly lower in the case of Th1-skewed cultures. Th2-specific histone H3 acetylation in the IL-5 promoter region was also detected but only after culture for 3 days. Two other primer pairs located in the promoter and intron 2 of the IL-5 gene were also examined with similar results (data not shown). Interestingly, histone H3 in RAD50-associated nucleosomes was acetylated equivalently under Th1- and Th2-skewed conditions (Fig. 2,A and B). As expected, increased hyperacetylation of histone H3 on the IFN-γ promoter was observed in developing Th1 cells but not in Th2 cells. Histone hyperacetylation of the above regions was maintained for at least 9 days after the initial stimulation (data not shown). Stimulation with IL-4 alone resulted in no detectable increase in the levels of acetylation at all region tested (data not shown), suggesting a requirement of TCR-mediated signals. The acetylation status of histone H4 (at the N terminus of all four lysines) revealed the same patterns as those of histone H3 (data not shown). To assess the levels of histone acetylation more quantitatively, further assays were performed where aliquots of the input DNA obtained were also subjected to PCR using specific primer pairs as before. The PCR product intensities obtained using input DNA were then used to normalize the signals obtained with immunoprecipitated (ChIP assay) DNA. Thus, 3-fold serial dilutions of DNA obtained from cultured T cells for 3 days under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions were subjected to ChIP assay with input DNA normalization (Fig. 2 C). The intensities of PCR bands generated by the indicated primer pairs were measured by densitometry, and the calculated ratios (immunoprecipitates with anti-acetylhistone H3/input DNA) are shown in Fig. 2 D. The ratios in IL-13 and IL-4-related gene loci were 1.0–1.5 and 3–5 times higher, respectively, in the Th2-skewed cultures compared with the Th1-skewed cultures. The ratio in the case of the IL-5 promoter in Th2-skewed cultures was about 0.3, clearly lower than that of the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci. As expected, essentially no difference was observed in RAD50 promoter groups, and an inverted pattern was observed in IFN-γ promoter groups (Fig. 2 D, bottom two groups). These results suggest that Th2-specific histone H3 hyperacetylation occurred on nucleosomes associated with the IL-4- and IL-13-related genes and also on IL-5-associated nucleosomes but with delayed kinetics. In contrast, histone hyperacetylation on RAD50 gene-associated nucleosomes was TCR stimulation-dependent but not Th2-specific. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation in the IL-4 and IL-13 gene-associated nucleosomes, we assessed the role of the STAT6 signaling pathway. CD4 T cells from STAT6-deficient mice failed to differentiate into Th2 cells, suggesting that IL-4-dependent STAT6 activation is required for Th2 cell differentiation (8Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 451-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Thus, splenic CD4 T cells from STAT6-deficient mice were stimulated under Th2-skewed conditions for 5 days and ChIP assays performed. As shown in Fig.3 A, the acetylation of histone H3 in IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 gene-associated nucleosomes was dramatically reduced in the STAT6-deficient CD4 T cells compared with wild type CD4 T cells. In contrast, the acetylation in RAD50 gene-associated nucleosomes was induced equivalently to that of wild type. The level of histone H3 acetylation in IFN-γ-associated nucleosomes was low in wild type CD4 T cells under Th2-skewed conditions and was slightly higher in STAT6-deficient T cells (Fig.3 A, bottom). Next, the role of GATA3 expression on Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation was investigated using a retroviral vector (pMX-IRES-EGFP) encoding GATA3 bicistronically with EGFP (R-GATA3-GFP). GATA3 was introduced into normal CD4 T cells stimulated under Th1-skewed conditions or STAT6-deficient CD4 T cells under Th2-skewed conditions. As reported previously, the introduction of GATA3 into developing Th1 cells results in the generation of IL-4-producing cells and down-regulation of IFN-γ-secreting cell production (Fig.3 B, upper) (15Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The infection of STAT6-deficient CD4 T cells with the GATA3 vector also induced significant levels of IL-4-producing cells (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). We sought to determine whether the ectopic expression of GATA3 would induce the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation of IL-4- and IL-13-associated nucleosomes. Introduction of GATA3 was done as described above, and GFP-positive cells were separated by cell sorting. 500,000 infected cells from each culture were subjected to ChIP assay. Significant increases in histone acetylation in the IL-4-, IL-13-, and IL-5-related nucleosomes were detected in the GATA3-infected group (Fig. 3 C). The acetylation status at the RAD50 locus was not affected by infection with the GATA3 vector. Moreover, the introduction of GATA3 into STAT6-deficient T cells resulted in increased acetylation at the IL-4 and IL-13 promoter-associated nucleosomes (Fig.3 D). The acetylation status of the RAD50 locus was not affected. Thus, the ectopic expression of GATA3 did, in fact, induce the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation. Next, the locations of Th2-specific hyperacetylation within IL-4 and IL-13 loci were analyzed more precisely. A series of primers to amplify ∼0.4-kbp DNA fragments (∼0.5-kbp interval) between the RAD50 and KIF3A genes was prepared. The real patterns of each ChIP assay (Fig. 4, bottom panels) and the ratio of band intensities in CD4 T cells from Th1- and Th2-skewed 3-day cultures (Fig. 4, middle panel) with the 52 selected primer pairs are depicted. The Th2-specific hyperacetylation was observed at least from 1.5 kbp upstream from IL-13 exon 1 (primer pair 10) to 16 kbp downstream from IL-4 exon 4 (primer pairs 45∼47). No significant Th2 specificity was observed in the groups with primers 1–9 and 48–52. These results suggest that almost all histones in the IL-4- and IL-13-associated nucleosomes, including the intergenic nucleosomes, are hyperacetylated selectively under Th2-skewed culture conditions. Previous work on the β-globin gene cluster demonstrated that intergenic transcription is required for chromatin remodeling of chromosomal domains (32Gribnau J. Diderich K. Pruzina S. Calzolari R. Fraser P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We used the PCR primer pairs shown in Fig. 4to probe for the intergenic transcripts in T cells cultured for 2 days under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions. To digest contaminating DNA, all RNA samples were treated with DNase I. In addition, control PCRs were done with RNA samples that had not been reverse transcribed (RT −, Fig.5 A). Interestingly, considerable amounts of transcription were detected when we used primers with IL-13, IL-4, and KIF3A intergenic regions (primer pairs 20, 21, 22, IL-4 enhancer, primer pair 32) but not in the intergenic region between the RAD50 and IL-13 gene loci (primer pairs 4 and 5) (Fig. 5 A). Clearly, lower levels of transcription were observed in Th1-skewed cultures. To determine whether the induction of the intergenic transcription is STAT6-dependent, STAT6-deficient CD4 T cells were also examined. Significantly decreased levels in intergenic region transcripts were observed (Fig.5 B). We also detected large amounts of IL-4 and IL-13 transcripts in developing Th2 cells (data not shown). Simultaneously, kinetics of the generation of Th2-specific intergenic transcription was assessed (Fig. 5, C and D). RT-PCR products from CNS1, IL-4 VA enhancer, and β-actin were run on the same gel to facilitate the quantification of transcription levels. The relative intensities of the intergenic transcripts (CNS1/β-actin and IL-4VA enhancer/β-actin) are shown in Fig. 5 D. At the 16-h time point, no significant difference in the levels of intergenic transcripts was detected between Th1 and Th2 culture conditions. However, the levels of transcripts of both CNS1 and IL-4 VA enhancers were increased dramatically thereafter under Th2-skewed conditio"
https://openalex.org/W1974968903,"Recent findings have shown that, in addition to the genomic action of steroids, through intracellular receptors, short-time effects could be mediated through binding to membrane sites. In the present study of prostate cancer LNCaP cells, we report that dihydrotestosterone and the non-internalizable analog testosterone-BSA increase rapidly the release of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the culture medium. Membrane testosterone binding sites were identified through ligand binding on membrane preparations, flow cytometry, and confocal laser microscopy of the non-internalizable fluorescent analog testosterone-BSA-FITC, on whole cells. Binding on these sites is time- and concentration-dependent and specific for testosterone, presenting a KD of 10.9 nM and a number of 144 sites/mg protein (approximately 13000 sites/cell). Membrane sites differ immunologically for intracellular androgen receptors. The secretion of PSA after membrane testosterone receptor stimulation was inhibited after pretreatment with the actin cytoskeleton disrupting agent cytochalasin B. In addition, membrane testosterone binding modifies the intracellular dynamic equilibrium of monomeric to filamentous actin and remodels profoundly the actin cytoskeleton organization. These results are discussed in the context of a possible involvement of these sites in cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2095974846,"Recently, we demonstrated that biomechanical stress induces apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Mayr et al., FASEB J. 2000; 15:261-270). In this article we investigated the molecular mechanisms of mechanical stress-induced apoptosis. When SMCs were subjected to cyclic strain, tumor-suppressor p53 was activated as evidenced by gel mobility shift assays and Western blot analyses. p53 activation was largely attenuated if SMCs were pretreated with SB202190, a specific p38MAPK inhibitor, or were stably transfected with dominant negative rac, an upstream signal transducer of p38MAPK pathways. Kinase assays provided direct evidence that p38MAPKs phosphorylated p53 within 30 min of cyclic strain. Additionally, mechanical stress resulted in oxidative DNA damage as detected by the presence of 8-oxoguanine. Treatment with the antioxidant U-74389G abrogated p53 activation. p53 activation was followed by expression and mitochondrial translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bax. Likewise, mechanical stress resulted in up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. However, a marked loss of mitochondrial membrane potential occurred in wild-type, but not in p53-/-, SMCs. The latter lost their ability to express Bax and showed no apoptosis in response to cyclic strain. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that SMC apoptosis induced by mechanical stress is p53-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2096925306,"5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of proinflammatory leukotrienes. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) can phosphorylate 5-LO in vitro. Efficient phosphorylation required the presence of unsaturated fatty acids and was abolished when Ser-663 was mutated to alanine. In intact HeLa cells stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA), impaired 5-LO product formation was evident in cells expressing the S663A-5-LO mutant compared with cells expressing wild-type 5-LO. For Mono Mac 6 cells, priming with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) before stimulation with ionophore was required for ERK1/2 activation and efficient 5-LO phosphorylation, in parallel with substantial AA release and 5-LO product formation. Inhibition of PKC by GF109203x or MEK1/2 by U0126 (or PD98059) abolished the 5-LO up-regulation effects of PMA. In contrast, these inhibitors failed to suppress 5-LO product formation induced by stimuli such as AA plus ionophore, which apparently do not involve the ERK1/2 pathway. Based on inhibitor studies, ERKs are also involved in AA-stimulated 5-LO product formation in PMNL, whereas a role for ERKs is not apparent in 5-LO activation induced by ionophore or cell stress. Finally, the data suggest that ERKs and p38 MAPK-regulated MAPKAPKs can act in conjunction to stimulate 5-LO by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1980957109,"Some human tumor lines do not form visible tumors when inoculated into immunosuppressed mice. The fate of these human tumor lines was followed by transfecting them with green fluorescence protein before inoculating them into mice. Although the tumor lines failed to grow progressively, they formed small dormant microscopic foci maintained at constant mass by balanced proliferation and apoptosis. Transfecting the cells with either VEGF165 or activated c-Ha-ras induced loss of dormancy, which correlated with a shift in the angiogenic balance toward increased vascularity with reduced tumor cell apoptosis. These results support a model in which loss of dormancy is controlled in part by a switch to an angiogenic phenotype. These tumor lines may serve as models for investigating the cellular mechanisms controlling dormancy and identifying those factors that promote the loss of balanced proliferation and apoptosis. Finally, these models may prove useful in the design and testing of therapies directed toward eradicating dormant tumors and preventing tumor recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2169822262,"During inflammation, functional changes occur in the vasculature, including extensive endothelial cell mitotic activity and remodeling of capillaries. Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha)is a prototypical proinflammatory cytokine. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a strong endothelial cell-specific mitogen that exerts a pivotal role in angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions. We show that IL-1alpha stimulates VEGF secretion by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) in a dose-dependent manner. This represents induction of de novo VEGF synthesis, as an induction of VEGF mRNA was observed. Also, the release of VEGF was blocked by cycloheximide. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected four VEGF splice variants in unstimulated and in IL-1alpha-stimulated PBMNCs. In vivo in mice, subcutaneously administered IL-1alpha caused a strong local angiogenic response, which was accompanied by an infiltrate of VEGF-expressing inflammatory cells. The angiogenic effect of IL-1a was blocked when the mice were treated with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) neutralizing antibodies. VEGFR-1 blocking antibodies had a marginal inhibitory effect on IL-1alpha-induced angiogenesis. These observations indicate that IL-1alpha induces angiogenesis by activating the VEGF-VEGFR-2 signaling pathway between inflammatory cells and blood vessel endothelial cells. This novel mechanism of IL-1alpha-action may enhance the shift to angiogenic phenotype in various conditions designated by excessive angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994054543,"The aim of this paper was to study the molecular mechanisms by which bcl-2 increases hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. We demonstrated that bcl-2 overexpression in M14 human melanoma cell line enhances hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA stability and promoter activation. In particular, the half-life of the message was longer in bcl-2 transfectants (approximately 330 min) than in control cells (approximately 180 min). In addition, bcl-2 overexpression increased VEGF promoter activity through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor. Increased HIF-1a protein expression and DNA binding activity were detected in bcl-2 overexpressing cells compared with control cells. An enhanced functional activity of secreted VEGF was found both in in vitro and in vivo angiogenic assays, and the use of VEGF specific antibodies validated the role of VEGF on bcl-2-induced angiogenesis. Taken together our results indicate that bcl-2 plays an important role in melanoma angiogenesis, and that VEGF mRNA stabilization and HIF-1-mediated transcriptional activity are two important control points in bcl-2/hypoxia-induced VEGF expression."
https://openalex.org/W2132594134,"The CAG/polyglutamine (polyGln)-related diseases include nine different members that together form the most common class of inherited neurodegenerative disorders; neurodegeneration is linked to the same type of mutation, found in unrelated genes, consisting of an abnormal expansion of a polyGln tract normally present in the wild-type proteins. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, or neuropil aggregates are detectable in CAG/polyGln-related diseases, but their role is still debated. Alteration of the androgen receptor (AR), one of these proteins, has been linked to spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, an X-linked recessive disease characterized by motoneuronal death. By using immortalized motoneuronal cells (the neuroblastoma-spinal cord cell line NSC34), we analyzed neuropil aggregate formation and toxicity: green fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type or mutated ARs were cotransfected into NSC34 cells with a blue fluorescent protein tagged to mitochondria. Altered mitochondrial distribution was observed in neuronal processes containing aggregates; occasionally, neuropil aggregates and mitochondrial concentration corresponded to axonal swelling. Neuropil aggregates also impaired the distribution of the motor protein kinesin. These data suggest that neuropil aggregates may physically alter neurite transport and thus deprive neuronal processes of factors or components that are important for axonal and dendritic functions. The soma may then be affected, leading to neuronal dysfunctions and possibly to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2021129421,"S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. We show that the plant AdoMetDC activity is subject to post-transcriptional control by polyamines. A highly conserved small upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the AdoMetDC mRNA 5′ leader is responsible for translational repression of a downstream β-glucuronidase reporter cistron in transgenic tobacco plants. Elimination of the small uORF from an AdoMetDC cDNA led to increased relative translational efficiency of the AdoMetDC proenzyme in transgenic plants. The resulting increased activity of AdoMetDC caused disruption to polyamine levels with depletion of putrescine, reduction of spermine levels, and a more than 400-fold increase in the level of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. These changes were associated with severe growth and developmental defects. The high level of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine was not associated with any change in 5′-methylcytosine content in genomic DNA and S-adenosylmethionine levels were more or less normal, indicating a highly efficient system for maintenance ofS-adenosylmethionine levels in plants.

Polyamines are multivalent cations implicated in a wide range of cellular physiological processes including chromatin organization, mRNA translation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Cohen S.

Spermidine is formed from putrescine and spermine from spermidine by successive addition of aminopropyl groups derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) that is generated from AdoMet by the activity of AdoMetDC. In mouse, the AdoMetDC gene is essential for embryonic development (2Nishimura K. Nakatsu F. Kashiwagi K. Ohno H. Saito T. Igarashi K.

Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sequences of the tiny and small uORFs are highly conserved between the two mRNAs and indicate that they are similarly regulated. Here we characterize the ArabidopsisAdoMetDC1 mRNA 5′ leader small uORF. Our data demonstrate that: (i) plant AdoMetDC activity is subject to post-transcriptional negative feedback regulation by polyamines; (ii) the small uORF is responsible for the translational repression of a downstream cistron in transgenic plants; (iii) abrogation of small uORF-mediated translational regulation in transgenic plants causes an increased translation of the downstream AdoMetDC ORF, resulting in increased enzyme activity and decarboxylated AdoMet levels, polyamine disruption, and severe growth perturbations.DISCUSSIONAdoMetDC is involved solely in polyamine biosynthesis but the substrate AdoMet is the main methyl donor in transmethylation reactions and in plants it also serves as a substrate for ethylene biosynthesis and allosteric activation of threonine synthase (28Chiang P.K.

It is therefore not surprising that the plant AdoMetDC might be subject to multiple levels of regulation. Two lines of evidence are presented here suggesting that the highly conserved small uORF is responsible for the translational regulation of the plant AdoMetDC. First, in leaves of stably transformed tobacco plants, elimination of the small uORF or removal of the C-terminal 28 amino acids results in translational derepression of a downstream GUS reporter ORF. It is not the presence of an uORF per se that is required for translational repression. For instance, the MUT construct replaces the small uORF with a C-terminal extended tiny uORF in a different reading frame but it is not translationally repressive. Furthermore, the small uORF amino acid sequence is highly conserved (6Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with most nucleotide changes between species occurring in the third “wobble” position of codons. However, we cannot say with the present constructs that the small uORF functions in a sequence-dependent manner. The MUT construct replaces the small uORF with a +1 reading frame, C-terminal extended tiny uORF terminating 31 nucleotides downstream of the original small uORF UGA termination codon. The region immediately downstream of the termination codon of sequence-independent uORFs is critical to their translationally repressive function (31Hinnebusch A. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar, 32Hinnebusch A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-244Google Scholar). Thus a construct that precisely alters the reading frame of the small uORF within the original boundaries of the uORF is needed to address the question of sequence-dependence.The second line of evidence implicating the small uORF in the translational regulation of AdoMetDC comes from expression of wild type and mutant forms of the Arabidopsis AdoMetDC1 cDNA in transgenic tobacco plants. Removing the AdoMetDC 5′ leader sequence or C-terminal truncating the small uORF resulted in large increases in relative translational efficiency of the AdoMetDC ORF and in AdoMetDC activity compared with plants overexpressing the wild type cDNA. Overexpression of wild type AdoMetDC cDNA did not result in significantly increased AdoMetDC activity suggesting a translational homeostatic mechanism. However, the translationally derepressed AdoMetDC causes increased enzyme activity resulting in severe growth inhibition and morphological abnormalities. In both T1 and T2 generations, overexpression of AdoMetDCthrough translational deregulation resulted in depletion of putrescine and a 2–3-fold decrease in spermine but spermidine levels were more or less maintained at normal levels. The adaptive response of the plant to excess AdoMetDC activity was to prevent accumulation of more spermidine and spermine, suggesting that excess polyamines are deleterious to growth and normal cellular physiology. This reduction in spermine levels is in contrast to the response seen when AdoMetDC was overexpressed in mouse breast cancer cell lines (33Manni A. Fischer S. Franks M. Washington S. de Arment R. Griffith J. Demers L. Vererame M. Leiby B. Mauger D. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar) and to that seen with AdoMetDC gene amplification in Chinese hamster ovary cells (34Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where most spermidine was converted to spermine. In theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants the reduction in spermine levels is partly achieved by reduction of ornithine and arginine decarboxylase activities but it will also be necessary to analyze the spermidine and spermine synthase activities and the levels of ornithine and arginine amino acids as additional contributory factors controlling spermine accumulation.The massive accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet detected in theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants could in principle cause severe problems for the plant cell. Decarboxylated AdoMet cannot act as a methyl donor but when present at high enough concentrations may act as a competitive inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase reactions (35Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research. Plenum Press, New York1988: 291-299Google Scholar). Indeed, derepression of AdoMetDC in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells because of inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity resulted in a 30-fold increase in decarboxylated AdoMet levels and was associated with a decrease of cytosine methylation (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, caution is required when interpreting these results as the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase caused the F9 cells to differentiate and the DNA demethylation observed was similar in extent to that observed when the same cells differentiated after retinoic acid treatment (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Much higher levels of decarboxylated AdoMet (several hundred-fold) were observed after inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase in transformed mouse fibroblasts (37Pegg A.E. Pösö H. Shuttleworth K. Bennett R.A. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in rat hepatoma tissue culture cells (38Mamont P.S. Danzin C. Wagner J. Siat M. Joder-Ohlenbusch A.-M. Claverie N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the untreated F9 cells the decarboxylated AdoMet content was about 2–4% of the AdoMet content, similar to the figure of 2.5% that we determined in the T2 syngenic tobacco plants. The increase in the decarboxylated AdoMet content of the transgenic plants was exacerbated by the suppression of the aminopropyl-accepting putrescine. With no aminopropyl acceptor, the decarboxylated AdoMet could not be further metabolized through the 5′-methylthioadenosine route to the methionine salvage pathway (39Pegg A.E. Williams-AshMan H.G. McCann P.P. Pegg A.E. Sjoerdsma A. Inhibition of Polyamine Metabolism: Biological Significance and Basis for New Therapies. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1987: 33-46Crossref Google Scholar).The growth and morphological abnormalities of theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants, especially the increasing severity of the phenotype in advancing generations is reminiscent of the Arabidopsis ddm1 mutant that causes a 70% decrease in methylated cytosine content (27Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Flowers S.K. Munakata K. Richards E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12406-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 40Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Richards E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was also observed with theddm1 mutant plants that there was variability of the morphological phenotype and severity among siblings in advanced generations (27Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Flowers S.K. Munakata K. Richards E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12406-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar): this is similar to the variable level of phenotype severity observed among the AdoMetDC-overexpressing siblings. The association of methylated cytosine depletion upon AdoMetDC derepression and decarboxylated AdoMet accumulation in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the similarity of the growth phenotypes of theArabidopsis ddm1 mutant and the AdoMetDC-overexpressing tobacco plants led us to the obvious conclusion that the overexpression of AdoMetDC might result in methylated cytosine depletion. However, there was no detectable difference in total methylated cytosine content of the AdoMetDC-overexpressing plants. It is possible that the increasing severity of the phenotype is because of the increasing suppression of putrescine and reduction in spermine content in successive generations. The temperature sensitivity of the AdoMetDC-overexpressing tobacco plants is also reminiscent of the temperature sensitivity of polyamine-depleted yeast cells (41Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2721-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Perhaps the most surprising observation in the plants accumulating such high levels of decarboxylated AdoMet was that the concentrations of AdoMet were relatively unaffected, revealing the remarkable capacity of plants for buffering AdoMet levels. This is not specific to plants as overexpression of AdoMetDC because of gene amplification in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in more than a 200-fold increase in decarboxylated AdoMet content but AdoMet levels remained relatively unchanged (34Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such an efficient AdoMet homeostasis makes it unlikely that AdoMet-dependent processes such as transmethylation, ethylene biosynthesis, and threonine synthase allosteric activation are adversely affected directly. It would be surprising if the severe growth defects observed in the transgenic plants did not cause indirect stress-related changes to ethylene levels.The stunting, leaf wrinkling, and delayed flowering of the transgenic plants are also reminiscent of tobacco plants treated with 2 mm α-dl-difluoromethylornithine, a suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (42Burtin D. Martin-Tanguy J. Tepfer D. Plant Physiol. 1990; 95: 461-468Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It may be that the growth abnormalities because of overexpression of AdoMetDC are due paradoxically to an adaptive response by the plant that reduces polyamine levels. However, it is equally possible that the very high level of decarboxylated AdoMet is the main cause of the growth perturbations.From this we can see that the plant AdoMetDC wild type mRNA overlapping uORF configuration is an extremely effective homeostatic mechanism for controlling AdoMetDC activity through regulation of the proenzyme translation. What remains to be shown is the relationship between the translational repression mechanism and polyamine-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of AdoMetDC. In addition, it will be necessary to identify the polyamine sensing mechanism. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; uORF, upstream open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; NL, no leader; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GUS, β-glucuronidase; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; uORF, upstream open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; NL, no leader; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GUS, β-glucuronidase; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; EC 4.1.1.50) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the polyamines spermidine and spermine. Polyamines are multivalent cations implicated in a wide range of cellular physiological processes including chromatin organization, mRNA translation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Cohen S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 1-543Google Scholar). Most plants form putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) indirectly from arginine and directly from ornithine. Spermidine is formed from putrescine and spermine from spermidine by successive addition of aminopropyl groups derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) that is generated from AdoMet by the activity of AdoMetDC. In mouse, the AdoMetDC gene is essential for embryonic development (2Nishimura K. Nakatsu F. Kashiwagi K. Ohno H. Saito T. Igarashi K. Genes Cell. 2002; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and an AdoMetDC gene deletion mutant of Leishmania donovani has an absolute requirement for exogenously supplied spermidine (3Roberts S.C. Scott J. Gasteier J.E. Jiang Y. Brooks B. Jardin A. Carter N.S. Heby O. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5902-5909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the function of polyamines in plants (4Malmberg R.L. Watson M.B. Galloway G.L. Yun W. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1998; 17: 199-224Crossref Google Scholar) but recently a spermine synthase mutant ofArabidopsis thaliana was found to be severely affected in growth and cell elongation (5Hanzawa Y. Takahashi T. Michael A.J. Burtin D. Long D. Pineiro M. Coupland G. Komeda Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4248-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Plant AdoMetDC mRNAs possess long 5′ leader sequences of at least 500 nucleotides and are remarkable for the presence of a highly conserved pair of overlapping uORFs (6Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The upstream tiny ORF and downstream small ORF consist of 3–4 and 50–54 codons, respectively, overlapping by one nucleotide, being the last base of the tiny uORF termination codon and the first base of the small uORF AUG codon. This one base overlapping arrangement predates the origin of flowering plants and the amino acid sequence encoded by the small uORF is conserved between angiosperms and Pinus taeda (6Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although uORFs occur relatively infrequently in eukaryotic mRNAs, their occurrence is more frequent in growth-related genes such as oncogenes where they are present in nearly two-thirds of genes (7Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar, 8Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). The role of uORFs in translational regulation is increasingly recognized as an important component of gene expression control (9Morris D.R. Geballe A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,10Geballe A.P. Sachs M.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 595-614Google Scholar). The mammalian AdoMetDC mRNA contains a single short uORF encoding the hexapeptide MAGDIS located 14 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ cap. MAGDIS-mediated translational regulation of the AdoMetDC mRNA depends on cell type (11Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cellular polyamine content (12Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moving the uORF to a position 47 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ cap enhances recognition of the uORF in nonlymphoid cells (13Ruan H. Hill J.R. Fatemie-Nainie S. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17905-17910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cellular polyamine levels are depleted, AdoMetDC mRNA is more efficiently loaded with ribosomes (14White M.W. Degnin C. Hill J. Morris D.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the uORF is responsible for this polyamine-mediated translational regulation (15Shantz L.M. Viswanath R. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The termination codon of the uORF is absolutely required for MAGDIS repressive activity (12Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and increased spermidine levels cause ribosome stalling at the termination codon as detected by toe-printing and expression in a gel-filtered rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (16Ryabova L.A.

The temperature sensitivity of the AdoMetDC-overexpressing tobacco plants is also reminiscent of the temperature sensitivity of polyamine-depleted yeast cells (41Balasundaram D. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2721-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Perhaps the most surprising observation in the plants accumulating such high levels of decarboxylated AdoMet was that the concentrations of AdoMet were relatively unaffected, revealing the remarkable capacity of plants for buffering AdoMet levels. This is not specific to plants as overexpression of AdoMetDC because of gene amplification in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in more than a 200-fold increase in decarboxylated AdoMet content but AdoMet levels remained relatively unchanged (34Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such an efficient AdoMet homeostasis makes it unlikely that AdoMet-dependent processes such as transmethylation, ethylene biosynthesis, and threonine synthase allosteric activation are adversely affected directly. It would be surprising if the severe growth defects observed in the transgenic plants did not cause indirect stress-related changes to ethylene levels.The stunting, leaf wrinkling, and delayed flowering of the transgenic plants are also reminiscent of tobacco plants treated with 2 mm α-dl-difluoromethylornithine, a suicide inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (42Burtin D. Martin-Tanguy J. Tepfer D. Plant Physiol. 1990; 95: 461-468Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It may be that the growth abnormalities because of overexpression of AdoMetDC are due paradoxically to an adaptive response by the plant that reduces polyamine levels. However, it is equally possible that the very high level of decarboxylated AdoMet is the main cause of the growth perturbations.From this we can see that the plant AdoMetDC wild type mRNA overlapping uORF configuration is an extremely effective homeostatic mechanism for controlling AdoMetDC activity through regulation of the proenzyme translation. What remains to be shown is the relationship between the translational repression mechanism and polyamine-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of AdoMetDC. In addition, it will be necessary to identify the polyamine sensing mechanism. AdoMetDC is involved solely in polyamine biosynthesis but the substrate AdoMet is the main methyl donor in transmethylation reactions and in plants it also serves as a substrate for ethylene biosynthesis and allosteric activation of threonine synthase (28Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Jacov T. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasarashi K. McCann P.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 29Heby O. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 737-757PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ravanel S. Gakière B. Job D. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the plant AdoMetDC might be subject to multiple levels of regulation. Two lines of evidence are presented here suggesting that the highly conserved small uORF is responsible for the translational regulation of the plant AdoMetDC. First, in leaves of stably transformed tobacco plants, elimination of the small uORF or removal of the C-terminal 28 amino acids results in translational derepression of a downstream GUS reporter ORF. It is not the presence of an uORF per se that is required for translational repression. For instance, the MUT construct replaces the small uORF with a C-terminal extended tiny uORF in a different reading frame but it is not translationally repressive. Furthermore, the small uORF amino acid sequence is highly conserved (6Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with most nucleotide changes between species occurring in the third “wobble” position of codons. However, we cannot say with the present constructs that the small uORF functions in a sequence-dependent manner. The MUT construct replaces the small uORF with a +1 reading frame, C-terminal extended tiny uORF terminating 31 nucleotides downstream of the original small uORF UGA termination codon. The region immediately downstream of the termination codon of sequence-independent uORFs is critical to their translationally repressive function (31Hinnebusch A. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar, 32Hinnebusch A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-244Google Scholar). Thus a construct that precisely alters the reading frame of the small uORF within the original boundaries of the uORF is needed to address the question of sequence-dependence. The second line of evidence implicating the small uORF in the translational regulation of AdoMetDC comes from expression of wild type and mutant forms of the Arabidopsis AdoMetDC1 cDNA in transgenic tobacco plants. Removing the AdoMetDC 5′ leader sequence or C-terminal truncating the small uORF resulted in large increases in relative translational efficiency of the AdoMetDC ORF and in AdoMetDC activity compared with plants overexpressing the wild type cDNA. Overexpression of wild type AdoMetDC cDNA did not result in significantly increased AdoMetDC activity suggesting a translational homeostatic mechanism. However, the translationally derepressed AdoMetDC causes increased enzyme activity resulting in severe growth inhibition and morphological abnormalities. In both T1 and T2 generations, overexpression of AdoMetDCthrough translational deregulation resulted in depletion of putrescine and a 2–3-fold decrease in spermine but spermidine levels were more or less maintained at normal levels. The adaptive response of the plant to excess AdoMetDC activity was to prevent accumulation of more spermidine and spermine, suggesting that excess polyamines are deleterious to growth and normal cellular physiology. This reduction in spermine levels is in contrast to the response seen when AdoMetDC was overexpressed in mouse breast cancer cell lines (33Manni A. Fischer S. Franks M. Washington S. de Arment R. Griffith J. Demers L. Vererame M. Leiby B. Mauger D. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar) and to that seen with AdoMetDC gene amplification in Chinese hamster ovary cells (34Kramer D. Mett H. Evans A. Regenass U. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2124-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where most spermidine was converted to spermine. In theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants the reduction in spermine levels is partly achieved by reduction of ornithine and arginine decarboxylase activities but it will also be necessary to analyze the spermidine and spermine synthase activities and the levels of ornithine and arginine amino acids as additional contributory factors controlling spermine accumulation. The massive accumulation of decarboxylated AdoMet detected in theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants could in principle cause severe problems for the plant cell. Decarboxylated AdoMet cannot act as a methyl donor but when present at high enough concentrations may act as a competitive inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase reactions (35Heby O. Persson L. Smith S.S. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Progress in Polyamine Research. Plenum Press, New York1988: 291-299Google Scholar). Indeed, derepression of AdoMetDC in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells because of inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity resulted in a 30-fold increase in decarboxylated AdoMet levels and was associated with a decrease of cytosine methylation (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, caution is required when interpreting these results as the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase caused the F9 cells to differentiate and the DNA demethylation observed was similar in extent to that observed when the same cells differentiated after retinoic acid treatment (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Much higher levels of decarboxylated AdoMet (several hundred-fold) were observed after inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase in transformed mouse fibroblasts (37Pegg A.E. Pösö H. Shuttleworth K. Bennett R.A. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in rat hepatoma tissue culture cells (38Mamont P.S. Danzin C. Wagner J. Siat M. Joder-Ohlenbusch A.-M. Claverie N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the untreated F9 cells the decarboxylated AdoMet content was about 2–4% of the AdoMet content, similar to the figure of 2.5% that we determined in the T2 syngenic tobacco plants. The increase in the decarboxylated AdoMet content of the transgenic plants was exacerbated by the suppression of the aminopropyl-accepting putrescine. With no aminopropyl acceptor, the decarboxylated AdoMet could not be further metabolized through the 5′-methylthioadenosine route to the methionine salvage pathway (39Pegg A.E. Williams-AshMan H.G. McCann P.P. Pegg A.E. Sjoerdsma A. Inhibition of Polyamine Metabolism: Biological Significance and Basis for New Therapies. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1987: 33-46Crossref Google Scholar). The growth and morphological abnormalities of theAdoMetDC-overexpressing plants, especially the increasing severity of the phenotype in advancing generations is reminiscent of the Arabidopsis ddm1 mutant that causes a 70% decrease in methylated cytosine content (27Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Flowers S.K. Munakata K. Richards E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12406-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 40Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Richards E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was also observed with theddm1 mutant plants that there was variability of the morphological phenotype and severity among siblings in advanced generations (27Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Flowers S.K. Munakata K. Richards E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12406-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar): this is similar to the variable level of phenotype severity observed among the AdoMetDC-overexpressing siblings. The association of methylated cytosine depletion upon AdoMetDC derepression and decarboxylated AdoMet accumulation in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells (36Frostesjö L. Holm I. Grahn B. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Heby O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4359-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the similarity of the growth phenotypes of theArabidopsis ddm1 mutant and the AdoMetDC-overexpressing tobacco plants led us to the obvious conclusion that the overexpression of AdoMetDC might result in methylated cytosine depletion. However, there was no detectable difference in total methylated cytosine content of the AdoMetDC-overexpressing plants. It is possible that the increasing severity of the phenotype is because of the increasing suppression of putrescine and reduction in spermine content in successive generations.

https://openalex.org/W2139431079,"Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) is a Ca+2-dependent enzyme that catalyzes both intracellular and extracellular cross-linking reactions by transamidation of specific glutamine residues. TGase 2 is known to be involved in the membrane-mediated events required for glucose-stimulated insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells. Here we show that targeted disruption of TGase 2 impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. TGase 2-/- mice show glucose intolerance after intraperitoneal glucose loading. TGase 2-/- mice manifest a tendency to develop hypoglycemia after administration of exogenous insulin as a consequence of enhanced insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) phosphorylation. We suggest that the increased peripheral sensitivity to insulin partially compensates for the defective secretion in this animal model. TGase 2-/- mouse phenotype resembles that of the maturity-onset diabetes of young (MODY) patients. In the course of screening for human TGase 2 gene in Italian subjects with the clinical features of MODY, we detected a missense mutation (N333S) in the active site of the enzyme. Collectively, these results identify TGase 2 as a potential candidate gene in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2114559618,"Hookworms routinely reach the gut of nonpermissive hosts but fail to successfully feed, develop, and reproduce. To investigate the effects of host-parasite coevolution on the ability of hookworms to feed in nonpermissive hosts, we cloned and expressed aspartic proteases from canine and human hookworms. We show here that a cathepsin D-like protease from the canine hookworm Ancylosotoma caninum (Ac-APR-1) and the orthologous protease from the human hookworm Necator americanus (Na-APR-1) are expressed in the gut and probably exert their proteolytic activity extracellularly. Both proteases were detected immunologically and enzymatically in somatic extracts of adult worms. The two proteases were expressed in baculovirus, and both cleaved human and dog hemoglobin (Hb) in vitro. Each protease digested Hb from its permissive host between twofold (whole molecule) and sixfold (synthetic peptides) more efficiently than Hb from the nonpermissive host, despite the two proteases' having identical residues lining their active site clefts. Furthermore, both proteases cleaved Hb at numerous distinct sites and showed different substrate preferences. The findings suggest that the paradigm of matching the molecular structure of the food source within a host to the molecular structure of the catabolic proteases of the parasite is an important contributing factor for host-parasite compatibility and host species range."

It was found that ES cells are allowed to differentiate into hepatocytes possessing high metabolic activities when hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3β-transfected ES cells are cultured in α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 in the three-dimensional cell culture system at 5% CO2. The differentiated cells induced albumin, triacylglycerol, urea, and glycogen synthesis as well as further expression of metabolic proteins and serum factors as markers of hepatocytic differentiation for at least 4 months. The cells differentiated from HNF-3β-transfected ES cells also had hepatocyte-like ultrastructural characteristics, including several endoplasmic reticula, mitochondrion, and glycogen. Our findings indicate that generation of hepatocytes maintaining high metabolic functions developed from mouse ES cells will facilitate the study of the basic mechanism for hepatogenesis and will certainly provide new opportunities for tissue transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2129202730,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduces mammary tumorigenesis in rodent models, induces apoptosis in rodent mammary tumor cell lines, and decreases expression of antiapoptotic bcl-2 in rat mammary tissue. This investigation focused on the cell mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of CLA. Changes (mRNA, protein) in expression of major proapoptotic p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, bax, bcl-Xs genes, and the antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene were observed in malignant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and in benign MCF-10a human mammary tumor cells in culture. CLA, but not linoleic acid (LA), inhibited proliferation in all cells; CLA mix was most effective. CLA increased DNA damage (apoptosis). CLA increased mRNA expression of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (three- to fivefold and twofold, respectively) but either decreased bcl-2 by 20-30% or had no effect in MCF-7 and MCF-10a cells, respectively; protein expression reflected mRNA values. In MDA-MBA-231 (mutant p53) cells, mRNA for p53 was not changed, but p21WAF1/CIP1 and bcl-2 mRNA was increased. Protein expression largely reflected mRNA changes but, surprisingly, CLA completely suppressed mutant p53 protein in MDA-MB-231 cells. Apparent antiapoptotic effects of increased bcl-2 expression in MDA-MBA-231 cells were countered by increased proapoptotic p21WAF1/CIP1, Bax, and Bcl-Xs proteins. Findings indicate that CLA elicits mainly proapoptotic effects in human breast tumor cells through both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, according to cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2061500513,"Steroids play a critical role in gonadal differentiation in birds, reptiles, and amphibia whereas gonadal differentiation in mammals is thought to be determined by genetic mechanisms. The gonads of female mice incapable of synthesizing estrogens due to disruption of the aromatase gene (ArKO) provide a unique model to test the role of estrogen in regulating the gonadal phenotype. We have shown that in the absence of estrogen, genetically female mice develop testicular tissue within their ovaries. The ovaries develop cells that possess structural and functional characteristics of testicular interstitial cells and of seminiferous tubule-like structures lined with Sertoli cells. Moreover, the ovaries express mRNA for the testis-specific Sertoli cell transcription factor Sox 9 and espin protein, which is specific for inter-Sertoli cell junctions. The development of the testicular tissue in this model can be reverted/postponed by replacing estrogen. When ArKO female mice were fed a diet containing phytoestrogens, the appearance of Leydig and Sertoli cells was postponed and reduced. Furthermore, administration of estradiol-17beta decreased the number of Sertoli and Leydig cells in the ovaries. These findings constitute definitive evidence that estrogen plays a critical role in maintaining female somatic interstitial and granulosa cells in the eutherian ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1969913785,"Nonvisual arrestins (arrestin-2 and -3) serve as adaptors to link agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors to the endocytic machinery. Although many G protein-coupled receptors bind arrestins, the molecular determinants involved in binding remain largely unknown. Because arrestins selectively promote the internalization of the α2b- and α2c-adrenergic receptors (ARs) while having no effect on the α2aAR, here we used α2ARs to identify molecular determinants involved in arrestin binding. Initially, we assessed the ability of purified arrestins to bind glutathioneS-transferase fusions containing the third intracellular loops of the α2aAR, α2bAR, or α2cAR. These studies revealed that arrestin-3 directly binds to the α2bAR and α2cAR but not the α2aAR, whereas arrestin-2 only binds to the α2bAR. Truncation mutagenesis of the α2bAR identified two arrestin-3 binding domains in the third intracellular loop, one at the N-terminal end (residues 194–214) and the other at the C-terminal end (residues 344–368). Site-directed mutagenesis further revealed a critical role for several basic residues in arrestin-3 binding to the α2bAR third intracellular loop. Mutation of these residues in the holo-α2bAR and subsequent expression in HEK 293 cells revealed that the mutations had no effect on the ability of the receptor to activate ERK1/2. However, agonist-promoted internalization of the mutant α2bAR was significantly attenuated as compared with wild type receptor. These results demonstrate that arrestin-3 binds to two discrete regions within the α2bAR third intracellular loop and that disruption of arrestin binding selectively abrogates agonist-promoted receptor internalization.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney phosphate-buffered saline adrenergic receptor luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor N-terminal C-terminal extracellular signal-regulated kinase G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling via coupling to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) (1Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). To ensure that stimuli are translated into signals of appropriate magnitude and specificity, these signaling cascades are tightly regulated. GPCRs are subject to three principal modes of regulation: desensitization, in which a receptor becomes refractory to continued stimuli; endocytosis, whereby receptors are removed from the cell surface; and down-regulation, in which total cellular receptor levels are decreased (2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Although multiple mechanisms contribute to these regulatory processes, GPCR phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and subsequent binding of arrestins plays an important role in the regulation of many GPCRs (2Krupnick J.G.

The α2aAR and α2bAR are subject to agonist-dependent phosphorylation by GRKs (24Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, previous studies have revealed a role for arrestins in agonist-promoted internalization of α2ARs with arrestin-3 promoting internalization of the α2bAR and α2cAR and arrestin-2 selectively promoting internalization of the α2bAR. Interestingly, α2aAR internalization was not promoted by either arrestin, suggesting arrestin/receptor binding specificity (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for the third intracellular loops of the α2ARs in mediating protein-protein interaction. These loops are quite large (>150 amino acids) and include sites for GRK phosphorylation (26Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Although arrestin binding to GPCRs is dependent on both the phosphorylation and activation state of the receptor (31Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the receptor domains that mediate the agonist-dependent nature of arrestin binding have not been thoroughly characterized. Because third intracellular loops mediate agonist-dependent binding and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (32Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol.

Indeed, the third intracellular loop has been implicated in arrestin interaction for a number of GPCRs including rhodopsin (34Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

The subtype-specific differences in arrestin sensitivity for the three α2ARs provides a useful model to identify specific regions involved in arrestin binding. To address this issue, we studied arrestin binding to a series of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing various regions of the third intracellular loops of the three α2AR subtypes. Our results revealed arrestin binding specificity that recapitulates the arrestin selectively observed previously in α2AR trafficking (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that arrestin-3 binds to two discrete regions within the α2bAR third intracellular loop. Moreover, disruption of arrestin binding selectively abrogated agonist-promoted internalization of the α2bAR. These studies help to address questions of specificity in GPCR/arrestin interaction that ultimately will lead to a better understanding of the role of arrestins in regulating receptor-mediated signaling. FLAG-tagged α2AAR, α2BAR, and α2CAR were cloned into pcDNA3 as described previously (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The third intracellular loops of the α2aAR (residues 218–374), α2bAR (residues 194–368), and α2cAR (residues 232–379) were amplified by PCR using the full-length receptors as template. The PCR products were cut with EcoRI/XhoI (α2bAR and α2cAR) orEcoRI/SalI (α2aAR), gel-purified, inserted into the plasmid pGEX4T-2 in-frame with GST, and sequenced. The following α2bAR third loop truncation mutants were made and cloned into pGEX4T-2 using the same strategy: N-terminal (NT) (residues 194–292), NT1 (194–214), NT2 (206–292), C-terminal (CT) (293–368), CT1 (293–312), CT2 (313–358), and CT3 (344–368). α2bAR point mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis in either the NT1 construct (K200A, R201A, K200A/R201A, S202A, N203A, R204A, R205A, R204A/R205A, P207A, and R208A), the CT3 construct (L344A/L345A, R347A, Q355A, W356A/W357A, R358A, R359A, R360A, Q362A, T364A, R365A, E366A, K367A, and R268A), or the third loop construct (K200A/R201A (KR), R204A/R205A (RR), R358A/R359A/R360A (3R), and RR/3R). PCR products were cut withEcoRI/XhoI, ligated intoEcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX4T-2, and sequenced. The K200A/R201A, R204A/R205A, and R358A/R359A/R360A mutations were also generated in full-length α2bAR by two-step PCR using the expand high fidelity PCR system according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, using pcDNA3-α2bAR as template, an N-terminal fragment of the mutant α2bAR was created using a cytomegalovirus (5′-tgt acg gtg gga ggt-3′) sense primer and a mutagenic antisense primer, and a C-terminal fragment of the mutant α2bAR was generated using a mutagenic sense primer and an Sp6 (5′-gat aag ata tca cag tgg att tac-3′) antisense primer. Mutagenic primers used were: KR sense (5′-ctg atc gcc gca gcc agc aac cgc-3′) and antisense (5′-gcg gtt gct ggc tgc gta gat cag-3′); RR sense (5′-cgc agc aac gcc gca ggt ccc agg-3′) and antisense (5′-cct ggg acc tgc ggc gtt gct gcg-3′); 3R sense (5′-ggg cag tgg tgg gct gca gcg gcg cag ctg acc cgg-3′) and antisense (5′-ggt cag ctg cgc cgc tgc agc cca cca ctg ccc-3′). PCR products were purified, and N-terminal and C-terminal products (100 ng of each) were then used as template using the cytomegalovirus and Sp6 primers. PCR products were cut withEcoRI/XhoI, purified, and ligated into pcDNA3. An RR/3R mutation in full-length α2bAR was generated as described above using RR as template for the first round of PCR and then proceeding as specified above for the 3R mutation. BL21 (De3) lysS cells transformed with a GST-α2AR fusion construct were grown overnight at 37 °C, diluted 1:100 into LB containing ampicillin, grown for 3 h at 37 °C, and then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-thiogalactyl-pyranosidase for 2 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted (3000 × g for 30 min) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1–3 ml of PBS plus protease inhibitors (per 100 ml of culture), lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and then aliquoted (0.4 ml), frozen, and stored at −80 °C until needed. Aliquots were thawed on ice, Triton X-100 (2% final) and sarcosyl (0.5% final) were added, and the cells were frozen, thawed, and centrifuged for 1 h (30,000 rpm in TLA-45 rotor). The supernatant (∼200 μl) was then incubated with 200 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose bead slurry for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed twice with PBS containing protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS with protease inhibitors. To quantify protein amounts, 20 μl of resuspended beads were incubated with SDS sample buffer and centrifuged, and the supernatant was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein levels were quantified using bovine serum albumin as standard. GST-α2AR fusion proteins (typically ∼500 ng/incubation) bound to glutathione-agarose were washed with arrestin binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.04% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and then incubated with 300 ng of purified bovine arrestin-1, -2, or -3 in arrestin binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Incubation mixtures were centrifuged (1000 ×g) for 1 min and washed three times in binding buffer, and the proteins were released with SDS sample buffer. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by immunoblotting using a general arrestin antibody (F4C1, 1:5000 dilution), an arrestin-3-specific antibody (182, 1:5000), or an arrestin-2-specific antibody (178, 1:5000). GST bound to glutathione-agarose was used in all experiments as a control. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells grown to 50–75% confluence in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 3 μg of FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant (KR, RR, 3R, RR/3R) α2bAR using 10 μl of FuGENE-6 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated with the FuGENE-DNA mixture for 5 h and then split into poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well dishes (for ERK1/2 assays) or 24-well dishes (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed 24 h after transfection as described previously (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas ERK1/2 assays were done 48 h after transfection. HEK 293 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected as described above and then split into three wells of a poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well dish. The following day, cells were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The next day, cells were stimulated with 10 μm UK14304 at 37 °C for 0–30 min and then rinsed with PBS, lysed by addition of SDS sample buffer, and scraped off the plates. Samples were boiled and then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk. Phospho-ERK1/2 was detected as described previously (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated subtype-specific differences in arrestin-promoted internalization of α2ARs with arrestin-3 enhancing internalization of α2bAR and α2cAR and arrestin-2 only acting on the α2bAR (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanistic basis of arrestin binding selectivity for α2ARs, we initially focused on the third intracellular loop of the α2ARs. The first and second intracellular loops of the α2ARs share sequence homology; however, the third intracellular loops have very divergent sequences, and this region likely directly contributes to arrestin binding specificity (27Wade S.M. Lim W.K. Lan K.L. Chung D.A. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. Mol, Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The third intracellular loops of the α2aAR (residues 218–374), α2bAR (residues 194–368), and α2CAR (residues 232–379) were expressed as GST fusion proteins, purified on glutathione-agarose, and then used in direct binding assays with purified arrestin-1, -2, or -3 (Fig. 1 A). Arrestin-1 did not bind to any of the α2AR fusion proteins (data not shown), arrestin-2 bound only to the GST-α2bAR third loop, and arrestin-3 bound to both the GST-α2bAR and the GST-α2cAR third loops but not to the α2aAR (Fig. 1 B). A dose-response analysis was next performed to determine whether there were binding differences between arrestin-2 and -3 and the α2bAR. Arrestin-3 was found to bind much more effectively to the α2bAR as compared with arrestin-2 with ∼20-fold more binding at the highest concentrations of arrestin (Fig.1 C). Overall, these results largely recapitulate the selectivity of arrestins in promoting internalization of the α2ARs (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and suggest that this selectivity is mediated by differences in arrestin binding to the third intracellular loops of these receptors. In an effort to identify specific arrestin binding domains, we further investigated the interaction of arrestin-3 with the α2bAR third loop. Initially, the third loop was bisected into NT (residues 194–292) and CT (residues 293–368) pieces and tested for arrestin binding (Fig. 2 A). These studies revealed that both the NT and CT regions of the α2bAR third loop bind arrestin-3, albeit not as well as the intact third loop (Fig. 2 B). Truncation mutagenesis of the NT construct revealed that arrestin-3 binding was primarily localized to the first ∼20 residues as NT1 (residues 194–214) bound arrestin-3 as well as NT, whereas NT2 (residues 206–292) did not bind (Fig. 2 B). Similar analysis of CT revealed that arrestin-3 binding was primarily localized to the last ∼25 amino acids since CT3 (residues 344–368) bound arrestin-3, whereas CT1 (residues 293–312), which contains a long stretch of acidic residues implicated previously in receptor desensitization (39Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and CT2 (residues 313–358) did not (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the proximal and distal ends of the third intracellular loop of the α2bAR contain the major arrestin-3 binding domains. To define specific residues within NT1 and CT3 that contribute to arrestin binding, a series of alanine point mutants were generated and tested for their ability to bind arrestin-3. Point mutations introduced into the NT1 and CT3 are indicated by an asterisk in Fig.3, A and B, respectively, whereas double mutations are underlined. These studies revealed that mutation of basic residues within the NT1 and CT3 constructs resulted in a dramatic reduction in arrestin-3 binding. Specifically, mutation of Arg-201, Arg-204, and Arg-205 in NT1 effectively disrupted arrestin-3 binding, whereas mutation of Arg-207 partially disrupted binding (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, mutation of Lys-200, Ser-202, Asn-203, Pro-205, and Arg-206 in NT1 had no significant effect on arrestin-3 binding. The placement of essential residues involved in arrestin binding was interesting given recent studies demonstrating that mutation of Lys-382 in the third loop of the parathyroid hormone receptor reduced arrestin-promoted internalization (40Vilardaga J.P. Krasel C. Chauvin S. Bambino T. Lohse M.J. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8121-8129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas residues in the LH/CG receptor important for arrestin-promoted internalization are localized within the analogous region of the third intracellular loop (38Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of CT3 also revealed the involvement of basic residues in arrestin binding with mutation of several arginines (358, 359, 360, 365, and 368) as well as Lys-367, resulting in a significant reduction in arrestin-3 binding (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, mutation of Leu-344 and -345 and Gln-355 had a partial effect on binding, whereas Gln-362, Thr-364, and Glu-366 mutations had no effect on arrestin-3 binding. The important role of the proximal and distal ends of the third intracellular loop in arrestin binding is reminiscent of the domains implicated in G protein binding and activation (27Wade S.M. Lim W.K. Lan K.L. Chung D.A. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. Mol, Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In fact, previous studies have identified a BBXXB motif (where B is a basic residue and X is any residue) in the α2AR involved in Gi activation with Lys-367 and Arg-368 contributing to this motif (27Wade S.M. Lim W.K. Lan K.L. Chung D.A. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. Mol, Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that significant overlap between the arrestin-3 and Gi binding sites on the α2bAR will likely contribute to the mechanism by which arrestin mediates desensitization (i.e. G protein uncoupling). To verify that specific arrestin binding mutations made within the NT1 and CT3 constructs were important for arrestin binding in the context of the whole third loop, a series of GST-α2bAR third loop mutants were generated. Four different GST-α2bAR fusions incorporating either the K200A/R201A (KR), R204A/R205A (RR), R358A/R359A/R360A (3R), or RR/3R mutations were used in binding assays with purified arrestin-3 and compared with the wild type third loop. The ability of the KR and 3R mutants to bind arrestin-3 was modestly reduced as compared with the wild type α2bAR (Fig.4 A). However, RR and RR/3R mutant binding to arrestin-3 was strongly attenuated with an 80–90% reduction in binding. To detect potential binding differences between the RR and RR/3R mutations, a dose-response analysis was performed. The RR mutation alone had a very similar binding pattern to RR/3R with the R204A/R205A mutation almost completely disrupting arrestin-3 binding to the α2bAR third loop (Fig.4 B). Taken together, these results suggest that the α2bAR third intracellular loop contains two arrestin-3 binding domains with the N-terminal region playing the predominant role. We next incorporated the various third loop mutations (KR, RR, 3R, and RR/3R) into the holo-α2bAR. Because arrestins are involved in agonist-promoted internalization of the α2bAR (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we anticipated that disrupting arrestin binding to the α2bAR third intracellular loop would attenuate receptor internalization. HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant α2bARs were incubated with agonist for 30 min and then analyzed for cell surface receptors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig.5). Internalization of the wild type α2bAR was ∼30% after agonist treatment, consistent with previous studies of α2bAR internalization in HEK 293 cells (41Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Internalization of the KR and 3R mutant receptors was very similar to that of the wild type α2bAR, consistent with the in vitro data showing that these mutations did not severely disrupt arrestin binding. In contrast, internalization of the RR mutant was reduced ∼50%, whereas the RR/3R mutant was decreased ∼65% as compared with the wild type receptor. These data suggest that disrupting arrestin binding to the third intracellular loop of the α2bAR has an inhibitory effect on agonist-promoted receptor internalization. These results also help to confirm the important role of arrestins in mediating internalization of the α2bAR. To ensure that the various mutations did not directly affect signaling of the α2bAR, we next analyzed the ability of the wild type and mutant α2bARs to activate ERK1/2. Our previous studies demonstrated that all three α2AR subtypes activate ERK1/2 in an agonist-dependent manner via a pathway that is Gi- and Ras-dependent but arrestin- and internalization-independent (25DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing wild type or mutant (RR, 3R, RR/3R) α2bARs were incubated with agonist for 0, 5, or 30 min and then analyzed for ERK activation by immunoblotting for phospho-ERK1/2. All receptors activated ERK1/2 from 5- to 7-fold after a 5-min treatment with agonist, suggesting that the mutations that inhibit arrestin binding and receptor internalization have no significant effect on α2bAR activation of signaling (Fig.6, A and B). Our results on the NT1 region of the α2bAR suggest the importance of a BXXBB binding motif that is essential for arrestin-3 binding. Mutation of Arg-201, Arg-204, or Arg-205 completely disrupted arrestin-3 binding, whereas mutation of surrounding residues had minimal effect on arrestin binding (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the analogous region of the α2cAR, but not the α2aAR, can also directly bind arrestin-3 (data not shown). Although the three α2ARs share significant homology within the N-terminal 20 residues of the third intracellular loops, a key basic residue present in both the α2bAR (Arg-201) and the α2cAR (Arg-234) is replaced with Gln-221 in the α2AAR (Fig.7). The absence of this particular basic residue within the α2AAR may disrupt arrestin binding. It is also interesting to note that mutation of Arg-239 (the last B in the BXXBB motif) within the NT1 region of the α2cAR completely disrupts arrestin-3 binding (data not shown), further establishing the importance of basic residues within this region for arrestin binding. Several recent studies have also suggested a role for receptor third intracellular loops in arrestin binding (30Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Evidence suggests that connexins act as tumor suppressors. We showed previously that expression of connexin-43 and connexin-32 in an indolent prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, resulted in gap junction formation and growth inhibition. To elucidate the role of connexins in the progression of prostate cancer from a hormone-dependent to -independent state, we introduced connexin-43 and connexin-32 into an invasive, androgen-independent cell line, PC-3. Expression of these proteins in PC-3 cells resulted in intracellular accumulation. Western blot analysis revealed a lack of Triton-insoluble, plaque-assembled connexins. In contrast to LNCaP cells, connexins could not be cell surface-biotinylated and did not reside in the cell surface derived endocytic vesicles, in PC-3 cells, suggesting impaired trafficking to the cell surface. Intracellular accumulation of connexins was observed in several androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. Transient expression of α-catenin facilitated the trafficking of both connexins to the cell surface and induced gap junction assembly. Our results suggest that impaired trafficking, and not the inability to form gap junctions, is the major cause of communication deficiency in human prostate cancer cell lines.

Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion is involved not only in maintaining the structural integrity of cells in tissues but also in governing a wide array of cell behavior (1Geiger B. Bershadzky A.

Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules frequently cluster at specific contact areas to form cell structures, such as adherens junctions, tight junctions, desmosomes, and focal adhesion plaques (1Geiger B.

Recent studies have shown that expression of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules is decreased in prostate cancer (PCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PCA, prostate cancer; Cx, connexin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; WT, wild type; LY, Lucifer Yellow cell lines and that impairment or loss in the expression of these molecules is associated with the malignant potential of prostate epithelial cells (6Morton R.A.

Direct support for the role of cell adhesion molecules in controlling the invasive behavior of PCA cells has come from studies showing that forced expression of α-catenin, an E-cadherin-associated protein, and C-CAM (7Ewing C.M.

These studies suggest that direct cell contact-dependent interactions among epithelial cells in prostate tumors are likely to play an important role in PCA progression. In addition to cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion junctions, epithelial cells also form a highly specialized class of cell junctions called gap junctions, which are membrane appositions that are traversed by clusters of channels through which molecules up to 1 kDa can directly pass between adjoining cells (13Loewenstein W.R. Rose B.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 59-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The channels are bicellular structures formed by the members of a family of about 20 related but distinct proteins named connexins (Cxs). Connexins first assemble into hexamers to form connexons that align and join with connexons in adjacent cells to form cell-cell channels, which get clustered to form gap junctions (14Bruzzonne R. White T.X. Paul D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 15Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.A. Annu. Rev.

In addition to its well documented role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and synchronization of cellular behavior, it has been proposed that altered gap junctional communication and/or impaired expression of Cxs may be one of the genetic or epigenetic changes involved in the initiation and progression of neoplasia (13Loewenstein W.R. Rose B.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 59-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17Trosko J.E. Ruch R.C. Front.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24710-24716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showing that forced expression of Cx genes in several Cx-deficient tumor cell lines attenuates their malignant phenotype. A recent study (25Temme A. Buchmann A. Gabriel H.-D. Nelles E. Schwarz M. Willecke K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) showed that transgenic mice deficient in Cx32, a Cx abundantly expressed in liver, developed a higher incidence of age-related liver tumors and were more susceptible to the tumor-promoting effect of liver-specific chemical carcinogens. Although a number of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have been implicated in the development of PCA, no consistent genetic or epigenetic changes are known to be associated with its initiation and progression. What is clear, however, is that the incidence of PCA increases with age and is characterized by the progression from an indolent, slow-growing, and hormone (androgen)-dependent state to an invasive, hormone-independent state (10Isaacs J.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1511-1521PubMed Google Scholar, 11Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 26: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of cellular and molecular events that play formative roles in driving the expansion and clonal selection of incipient PCA cells from an androgen-dependent state to an androgen-independent state is essential for understanding PCA progression and designing strategies for its intervention (11Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 26: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that, compared with normal prostate epithelial cells, gap junctional communication in PCA cell lines was either absent or reduced (27Mehta P.P. Lokeshwar B.L. Schiller P.C. Bendix M.V. Ostenson R.C. Howard G.A. Roos B.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and that forced expression of Cx32 and Cx43, the two Cxs expressed by the well differentiated epithelial cells of the prostate, into an indolent, androgen-dependent and Cx-deficient human PCA cell line, LNCaP, inhibited growth, retarded tumorigenicity, and induced differentiation (20Mehta P.P. Perez-Stable C. Nadji M. Mian M. Asotra K. Roos B.A. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 91-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies also showed that Cxs were localized at cell-cell contact areas in epithelial cells of well differentiated prostate tumors, and they began to accumulate intracellularly as the tumors progressed to more invasive and undifferentiated stages with an eventual loss of expression in advanced stages (20Mehta P.P. Perez-Stable C. Nadji M. Mian M. Asotra K. Roos B.A. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 91-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prostate epithelial cells from the most invasive forms of human androgen-independent prostate carcinomas show frequent impairment and/or deletion of cadherins and their associated proteins, such as α-, β-, and γ-catenins (10Isaacs J.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1511-1521PubMed Google Scholar, 11Isaacs J.T. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 26: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Because bi-directional signaling between cell adhesion molecules and Cxs may be important in initiating the formation of gap junctions, we investigated if forced expression of Cx43 and Cx32 into an invasive, androgen-independent PCA cell line PC-3, with deficient cadherin-mediated adhesion due to the deletion of the α-catenin gene (7Ewing C.M. Ru N. Morton R.A. Robinson J.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Barrett J.C. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4813-4817PubMed Google Scholar), would abrogate its malignant phenotype in a manner similar to that of LNCaP cells, which have functional cadherin-mediated adhesion. Our findings showed that, in contrast to androgen-dependent PCA cell lines, expression of Cx43 and Cx32 in PC-3, and several other androgen-independent cell lines, resulted in the intracellular accumulation of Cxs due to defective trafficking and that transient expression of α-catenin, a cadherin-associated protein, triggered trafficking and assembly of Cxs into gap junctions.

For colocalization studies, serial z sections (0.5 μm) were collected and analyzed using image processing software (Openlab 3.01; Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Plasmids containing cDNAs for various Cxs were obtained from several sources as described previously (20Mehta P.P. Perez-Stable C. Nadji M. Mian M. Asotra K. Roos B.A. Dev.

Retroviral vector LXSN (33Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Dusty A. Miller (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). Retroviral vectors containing rat Cx43 and Cx32 in sense orientation were constructed as described (20Mehta P.P. Perez-Stable C. Nadji M. Mian M. Asotra K. Roos B.A. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 91-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and designated LXSNCx43S and LXSNCx32S, respectively. The retroviral 5′ long terminal repeat and SV40 virus promoter drive the expression of Cx cDNAs and neomycin phosphotransferase, respectively (33Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pECFP-N1, pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N3, and PEYFP-N1 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Chimeras of these fluorescent proteins fused to the carboxyl termini of Cx43 and Cx32 were constructed according to the standard molecular biology methods. The details of these constructs and their function and assembly into functional gap junctions will be described elsewhere. 2P. P. Mehta and R. Govindarajan, manuscript in preparation. Plasmid pcDNA3-α-catenin (chicken) was constructed by cloning a chicken 3.5-kb HindIII to XbaI fragment, encompassing the coding range of chicken α-catenin cDNA from pUC21 vector, into the HindIII and XbaI site of pcDNA3. Control and recombinant retroviruses harboring Cx cDNAs were produced in an amphotropic packaging cell line PA317 and, to improve the efficiency of retroviral mediated gene transfer into human cells, in gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope-based packaging cell line PG13 as described previously (20Mehta P.P.

PC-3 cells were infected with equivalent titer (4 × 105 colony-forming units/ml) of recombinant retroviruses LXSN (Neo control), LXSNCx32S and LXSNCx43S, and selected in G418 (400 μg/ml, active) for 2–3 weeks as described previously (20Mehta P.P.

Glass cylinders were used to isolate individual G418-resistant clones, which were expanded, frozen, and maintained in G418 (200 μg/ml). Total RNA was extracted from two 10-cm dishes of confluent cells using Trizol reagent as described previously (29Mehta P.P. Yamamoto M. Rose B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ten to 20 μg of RNA was analyzed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon filters, pre-hybridized, and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes for various Cxs or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, washed in 0.1× SSC at 65 °C for 1–2 h, and the membranes exposed to Fuji-RX x-ray film for 1–24 h. The labeled DNA probes were prepared using gel-purified fragments (100 ng) and a random priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probes were labeled to a specific activity of 108–109 cpm/μg DNA and used at 106 cpm/ml hybridization buffer. Triton X-100 solubility/insolubility of Cxs was assayed essentially as described by Musil and Goodenough (34Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 35Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analysis of Cxs was as described previously (20Mehta P.P. Perez-Stable C. Nadji M. Mian M. Asotra K. Roos B.A. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 91-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mehta P.P. Lokeshwar B.L. Schiller P.C. Bendix M.V. Ostenson R.C. Howard G.A. Roos B.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 50 min on a tabletop Beckman ultracentrifuge (model TL-100) to separate Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions, the Triton X-100-insoluble pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (70 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 2.5% SDS, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol). Total Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were mixed with 4× Laemmli buffer to a final concentration of 1× and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min (Cx43) or incubated at room temperature for 60 min (Cx32) before separating by SDS-PAGE. Cells were seeded in 6-well clusters containing glass coverslips as described above (see “Antibodies and Immunostaining”), allowed to grow to confluence, and were washed once with PBS at room temperature. Half of the coverslips were extracted with 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100 (weight/weight) in solution B (30 mm HEPES; 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mmglucose) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C with occasional gentle shaking. Control cells were treated identically except for the omission of 1% Triton X-100. Cells were immunostained with the antibodies against Cx43 and Cx32 as described above (see “Antibodies and Immunostaining”). PC3 and LNCaP cells (2.5 × 105) were seeded on 6-cm dishes and grown to 80–90% confluence. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (pulse medium), and labeled with 0.15 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C (2.5 ml per dish). Cells were chased in normal cell culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mm methionine and 0.5 mm cysteine (chase medium) at 37 °C. Arrival of newly synthesized Cxs at the cell surface at various time intervals was assayed by incubating cells in freshly prepared EZ-LinkTMSulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin reagent (Pierce) in PBS at 0.5 mg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C and quenched with 15 mm glycine. Lysis of monolayers, immunoprecipitation of Cxs, and the recovery of biotinylated Cxs were done essentially as described by VanSlyke and Musil (36VanSlyke J.K. Musil L.S. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 2000; 20: 156-164Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the following modification. After cell lysis, 1/5th of the total immunoprecipitate was used for detecting the total and 4/5th for detecting the biotinylated fraction of Cxs at various time intervals. The samples were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Quantitation was done by PhosphorImaging (STORM 840, Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were seeded on glass coverslips as described above (see “Antibodies and Immunostaining”) and grown to 60–70% confluence. Endocytosis of dextrans was achieved by incubating cells with 10 mg/ml of Alexa Fluor 594-Dextran (M r 10,000, lysine-fixable, Molecular Probes) in DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed briefly with PBS and incubated with DMEM without dextrans for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed again three times with PBS before fixing (with 2% paraformaldehyde), and immunostained for connexins as described (see “Antibodies and Immunostaining”). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was used to transfect cells with various plasmids mentioned above according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (5 × 104) were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates (for immunostaining) or 100-mm dishes (for Western blotting) containing 2 and 12 ml of complete medium, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C. After 16 h, cells were transfected with various plasmids using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent: 1 μg of DNA complex in 100 μl of serum-free medium. The transfection complex was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature before transfection. The medium was replaced by fresh medium 5 h after transfection, and cells were fixed for immunostaining or lysed for Western blotting (see above) after 24–48 h. Gap junctional communication was assayed either by microinjecting fluorescent tracer Lucifer Yellow (443 Da, 5% aqueous solution) as described previously (28Mehta P.P. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Rose B. Shalloway D. Loewenstein W.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 124: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 38Mehta P.P. Bertram J.S. Loewenstein W.R.

Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Briefly, LY was microinjected into test cells by Eppendorf InjectMan and FemtoJet microinjection systems (models 5271 and 5242, Brinkmann Instruments) mounted on a Leica DMIRE2 microscope. The microinjected cells were viewed with the aid of Sony 3 CCD color video camera (Sony Corp., Japan) and the number of fluorescent cells (excluding the injected one) scored ∼10 min after injection served as an index of junctional transfer. For scrape loading, cell culture medium from freshly confluent 6-cm dishes was removed and replaced with 2.5 ml of medium containing rhodamine-conjugated fluorescent dextrans (10 kDa, 1 mg/ml; fixable) and LY (0.05%). We chose PC-3 cells for these studies because they are well characterized, highly invasive, and androgen-independent cells (10Isaacs J.T. Am. J.

Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the human TSG101cDNA revealed that the mouse and human genes encode proteins with 94% similarity (2Li L., Li, X. Francke U. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The similarity is even higher because both the mouse and human cDNAs encode 10 additional amino acids at the N terminus that are entirely conserved. Implications for a significant role of human TSG101 in tumor formation came from mapping of the gene locus to chromosome 11 p15.1-p15.2. This genomic region is known to be associated with a loss of heterozygosity in several human tumor types (3Ali I.U. Lidereau R. Theillet C. Callahan R. Science. 1987; 238: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 4Reeve A.E. Sih S.A. Raizis A.M. Feinberg A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1799-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, rearrangements and somatic mutations within the TSG101 gene locus could not be identified (5Steiner P. Barnes D.M. Harris W.H. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aberrant splice variants are found frequently in different tumor types, suggesting a role for TSG101 in cellular transformation (5Steiner P. Barnes D.M. Harris W.H. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Gayther S.A. Barski P. Batley S.J., Li, L. de Foy K.A. Cohen S.N. Ponder B.A. Caldas C.

Puisieux A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the human and the mouse Tsg101 gene structure later showed that many of the previously described aberrant transcripts were in fact alternative splice forms generated solely by exon skipping (10Wagner K.U. Dierisseau P. Rucker E.B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The significance of these Tsg101 splice forms in cell function and tumorgenesis remains elusive. Several reports show that Tsg101 may influence cell cycle control. Tsg101 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but upon cell cycle progression it can be found in the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. Depletion of Tsg101 by specific antibodies results in cell cycle arrest (11Zhong Q. Chen Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2699-2702PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, strong overexpression of Tsg101 in vitro also leads to the inhibition of cell division and cell death, suggesting that the amount of Tsg101 within a cell is critical for its function (11Zhong Q. Chen Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2699-2702PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xie W., Li, L. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tsg101 has several conserved protein domains that can exhibit cell cycle regulatory functions. The C-terminal coiled-coil domain of Tg101 was predicted to interact with the cell growth regulating protein stathmin (13Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and this region of Tsg101 is also involved in a potential co-repressor activity (14Watanabe M. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a proline-rich domain in Tsg101 was found to act as an activation domain in transcriptional regulation (1Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Tsg101 is similar to a domain found in inactive forms of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, proteins that can serve as dominant negative regulators of cell cycle control (16Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Ponting C.P. Cai Y.D. Bork P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This domain is suggested to interact directly with the key cell cycle regulator Mdm2, thereby stabilizing the protein (18Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21waf1/cip1 was also identified as a potential binding partner for Tsg101 (19Oh H. Mammucari C. Nenci A. Cabodi S. Cohen S.N. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5430-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) although the exact interacting region between Tsg101 and p21waf1/cip1 has not been determined. Analysis of the murine Tsg101 gene promoter revealed features of a housekeeping gene (10Wagner K.U. Dierisseau P. Rucker E.B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In mice, mRNA transcripts were identified in all embryonic and adult tissues examined, even as early as embryonic 1-cell and 2-cell stages. Based on these findings we hypothesized that deletion of Tsg101 using a conventional knockout approach would result in embryonic lethality (10Wagner K.U. Dierisseau P. Rucker E.B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This assumption was confirmed recently in a mouse model that carries a deletion of exons 8 and 9 (21Ruland J. Sirard C. Elia A. MacPherson D. Wakeham A., Li, L. Luis D.L.P. Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have chosen the Cre-loxP strategy to study the loss-of-function of Tsg101 during proliferation and differentiation in vivo andin vitro. In this report, we show that Tsg101 is an essential factor for cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and cell survival. Tsg101-deficient cells arrest and die during G1/S transition. The cell cycle arrest is caused by inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 2. We also demonstrate that p53 is not a mediator of cell death in Tsg101-deficient cells. Furthermore, the Tsg101 null mutation does not result in neoplastic transformation suggesting that Tsg101 is not a primary tumor suppressor gene. TheTsg101 cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. Cohen, Stanford University) was amplified by PCR, cloned into the pJ3H vector in-frame with the hemagglutinin (HA)1tag, and sequenced. This vector was cut with SalI, blunted, and cut again with EcoRI to release the taggedTsg101 cDNA. This fragment was cloned directionally into the blunted BamHI and sticky EcoRI sites of the retroviral vector pBabe-puro. A pBabe-GFP retroviral vector was cloned by releasing the puromycin coding sequence with HindIII andClaI from pBabe-puro and replacing it with the enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA, which was amplified by PCR from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Inc.). To generate a retroviral vector expressing the HA-tagged Tsg101 protein and the GFP marker from the same construct, we exchanged the entire SV40-puro cassette (SalI-NheI fragment) of the pBabe-HA-Tsg101-puro vector with the SV40-EGFP cassette from the pBabe-GFP plasmid. TheCre coding sequence from vector pBS185 (a kind gift of Dr. Sauer, NIDDK, to Dr. Hennighausen, NIDDK) was cloned as anXhoI-MluI(blunt) fragment into theEcoRV-XhoI sites of pZero (Invitrogen). The pBabe-Cre-puro retroviral vector was constructed by subcloning theCre recombinase cDNA as anXhoI(blunt)-EcoRI fragment into theBamHI(blunt) and EcoRI sites of pBabe-puro. We have used the helper-free 293Φ packaging cell line (a kind gift of Dr. Ouellette, University of Nebraska Medical Center) to generate replication deficient viral particles of our pBabe derivatives. Human papilloma E6 retrovirus was a kind gift of Dr. Sgagias, University of Nebraska Medical Center. The construction of theTsg101 fl/fl targeting construct and the production of transgenic animals will be described elsewhere. 2K.-U. Wagner, A. Krempler, Y. Qi, K. Park, M. D. Henry, A. A. Triplett, G. Riedlinger, E. B. Rucker III, and L. Henninghausen, submitted for publication. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from 14.5-day-old Tsg101 fl/fl,Tsg101 +/+, orTsg101 fl/flp53−/− embryos were explanted and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For retroviral infection, cells at passage 2–4 were plated at a density of 3–4 × 105 cells per 10-cm culture dish. Infection with retroviral vectors was performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Forty-eight hours later, cells were selected in complete medium containing 7 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). ImmortalizedTsg101 fl/fl cells were obtained from primary MEFs through application of a 3T3 protocol. For flow cytometry analysis, 1–2 × 106 cells were harvested at various time points after puromycin selection, pelleted, and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min, washed again in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with propidium iodide as described previously (22Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. Cell Prolif. 1991; 24: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed with FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). The software packages CELLquest (BD Biosciences) and Modfit LT (Verity) were used for data acquisition and data analysis, respectively. To determine the proliferative capacity, cells were incubated for 1 h with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling reagent, fixed in ethanol/acetic acid, and incorporated BrdUrd was visualized by immunohistochemistry according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was estimated by counting 1000 cells of two slides of each genotype. Staining for chromatin-tethered proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed as described previously (23Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PCNA antibody (PC-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:700 dilution. Cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and 1000 cells per coverslip were counted to estimate the percentage of cells that contain DNA bound PCNA protein. MTT growth assay was performed as described earlier (24van de Loosdrecht A.A. Beelen R.H. Ossenkoppele G.J. Broekhoven M.G. Langenhuijsen M.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). MTT was obtained from Sigma. Of each cell type 2 × 104 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with an Elx 808 (Bio-Tek Instruments) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. MEFs from 15-cm culture dishes infected with pBabe-Cre or pBabe were pelleted and digested at 56 °C in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 1% SDS, 500 μg/ml proteinase K). The genomic DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted, and 15 μg was digested withXbaI at 37 °C overnight. The DNA was separated on a 0.5% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and probed with the32P-labeled 3′ internal probe. Membranes were washed and exposed for 6 h to a Kodak X-Omat AR film. Twenty micrograms of total RNA, which was isolated from cell pellets of two 15-cm culture dishes as described previously (10Wagner K.U. Dierisseau P. Rucker E.B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was separated on a 1.5% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane.Tsg101 transcripts were detected by probing the membranes with 32P-labeled full-length mouse Tsg101cDNA. Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets of two T75 culture flasks as described previously (10Wagner K.U. Dierisseau P. Rucker E.B. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with the Superscript II RT system (Invitrogen) using poly(dT) (18Li L. Liao J. Ruland J. Mak T.W. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1619-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as a primer. Primers p53fwd 5′-ATGACTGCCATGGAGGAGTCAC-3′ and p53rev 5′-GCAGAGGCAGTCAGTCTGAGTC-3′ were then used to amplify the 1166-bp region of the p53 cDNA. PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced in both directions on a Beckman-Spinco CEQ2000XL automated sequencer. Cell pellets were lysed on ice for 30 min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovandate. Protein was quantified using a Bradford assay (Pierce). Twenty to fifty micrograms of protein per lane was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% dry milk. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight, washed three times for 15 min in washing buffer (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed again three times in washing buffer and once for 15 min in 1× TBS without Tween 20. Protein bands were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit for Western blot analysis (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped using 0.2 m NaOH for consecutive detection of various proteins. The following antibodies were used: α-ActB (I-19), α-Tsg101 (C-2), α-cyclin E (M-20), α-cyclin B1 (M-20), α-cyclin A (C-19), and α-p27 (F-8) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology as well as α-p21 (SX118) from Pharmingen and α-p19ARF (Ab-1) from Oncogene at a 1:1000 dilution. The α-cyclin D1 antibody (1:3000 final dilution) was a kind gift from Dr. Diehl (University of Pennsylvania). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Cdk2 kinase assay was performed using standard procedures and cdk2 (M-2) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Histone H1 (1 μg/μl) and protein A were purchased from Sigma. We generated conditional knockout mice to delete the first coding exon and part of the Tsg101promoter through Cre-mediated recombination (Fig.1 A). A detailed description of the construction and the phenotypes of the knockout mice will be published elsewhere.2 Initially, we tested the efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination at the floxed Tsg101 locus. We hypothesized that the deletion of exon 1 and the promoter region would efficiently inhibit transcription and translation of Tsg101. For this purpose, we established primary embryonic fibroblast cultures (MEFs) from the conditional knockout mice, and infected them with a retroviral vector expressing Cre recombinase (pBabe-Cre). The unmodified retroviral vector (pBabe) served as a negative control. Infected cells were selected by adding puromycin to the growth medium. Cells were harvested 3 to 4 days after infection to isolate DNA, RNA, and total protein. Cre-infected cells showed a single 2.1-kbXbaI fragment in Southern blots, indicating complete recombination of the targeted locus (Fig. 1 B). This leads to undetectable levels of Tsg101 mRNA and protein in these cells (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, high levels of Tsg101 were observed in controls. Interestingly, the originally described NIH3T3 Tsg101 knockout cell line (SL6) (1Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), which was intended to serve as a negative control, showed a significant amount of Tsg101 protein, suggesting that the conventional antisense approach did not entirely inhibit translation of this protein (Fig.1 D). The results demonstrate that both floxed alleles in the MEFs were successfully converted into null alleles in the presence of Cre recombinase. Subsequently, this leads to a complete depletion of Tsg101 protein in these cells. It was reported previously that the functional inhibition of Tsg101 in immortalized fibroblasts leads to accelerated growth and instant neoplastic transformation (1Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the homozygous deletion ofTsg101 in MEFs from conditional knockout mice should result in transformation and the generation of Tsg101-deficient tumor cell lines. Tsg101 fl/fl MEFs and their wild type controls (Tsg101 +/+) were infected with pBabe-Cre and grown for a prolonged period in the presence of puromycin. In contrast to the previous report, the conditional deletion of the Tsg101 gene was deleterious (Fig.2 A). As determined by MTT growth assay, cell numbers in Tsg101 fl/fl MEFs infected with Cre recombinase rapidly declined within 7 days after introduction of the virus (Fig. 2 B). After prolonged incubation (>10 days) very few survivingTsg101 fl/fl cells were observed. Clonal expansion of these cells revealed that they had acquired puromycin resistance without expressing Cre recombinase. A recombined Tsg101 null allele was not detected by PCR in these clones. 3A. Krempler, M. D. Henry, A. A. Triplett, and K.-U. Wagner, unpublished observation. Wild type (Tsg101 +/+) MEFs infected with the same Cre retroviral vector and selected with puromycin only exhibited slight growth retardation within the first days of selection and resumed normal cell growth thereafter (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that a low-level expression of Cre from the retroviral vector did not inhibit cell growth in our experimental setting. Therefore, toxicity of Cre recombinase can be excluded as a possible factor for the deleterious phenotype caused by Tsg101deficiency in the conditional knockout model. Besides cytotoxicity of Cre recombinase, it was feasible to hypothesize that the deleterious phenotype in Tsg101-deficient MEFs was caused by an unintentional inhibition of genes on chromosome 7 in proximity to the Tsg101 locus. It is known that the insertion of the phosphoglycerine kinase-neomycin cassette can alter the transcriptional regulation of other loci in the vicinity of the insertion site (25Pham C.T. MacIvor D.M. Hug B.A. Heusel J.W. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13090-13095Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed a rescue experiment to demonstrate that Tsg101 deficiency alone was the cause for the severe growth retardation and cell death in the conditional knockout model (Fig. 3 A).Tsg101 fl/fl MEFs were infected simultaneously with two viral vectors expressing Cre recombinase (pBabe-Cre) or the full-length mouse Tsg101 cDNA (pBabe-HA-Tsg101-GFP). Individual puromycin-resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for the presence of GFP, which correlated with expression of exogenous Tsg101 (Fig. 3, B and C). Western blot analysis with an anti-Tsg101 antibody verified the expression of exogenous Tsg101 in all GFP-positive clones. Transgenic Tsg101 that was fused to a HA tag had a slightly different mobility. This feature was useful to distinguish the exogenous HA-tagged protein from endogenous Tsg101. Endogenous Tsg101 was not detected in these individual clones (Fig.3 D). Exogenous Tsg101 from a transgenic vector is able to inhibit translation and stability of the endogenous protein (26Feng G.H. Lih C.J. Cohen S.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that these clones had lost both endogenous Tsg101alleles, we performed Southern blot analysis on two selected clones (clone number 6, low expression; and number 10, high expression of HA-Tsg101). Both clones showed a single 2.1-kb band indicating complete recombination of the endogenous Tsg101 locus (Fig.3 E). In summary, the expression of the HA-tagged Tsg101 from a retroviral vector was able to revert the deleterious effects of the loss of both endogenous Tsg101 alleles. This rescue experiment suggests the deleterious phenotype was caused solely by Tsg101 deficiency. Therefore, inhibition of genes other thanTsg101 can be excluded as a possible cause for growth inhibition and cell death in the Tsg101 conditional knockout model. Tsg101 deficiency in the conditional knockout model resulted in the perturbation of cell growth and in cell death. Because it was suggested earlier that this gene plays a role in cell growth (11Zhong Q. Chen Y. Jones D. Lee W.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2699-2702PubMed Google Scholar, 18Li L. Liao J. Ruland J.

Cohen S.N. Mak T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Tsg101 deficiency leads to cell cycle arrest at one of the major checkpoints before cell death is initiated. We examinedTsg101 fl/fl MEFs expressing Cre recombinase and their controls (pBabe-Cre Tsg101 +/+ andTsg101 fl/fl) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the DNA content (Fig.4, A and B). Tsg101-deficient cultures contained significantly fewer cells in S-phase (3.5% in the knockouts versus 15.9 and 16.5% in the controls). This reduction in the number of cells in S-phase persisted for at least 4 days (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the low number of replicating cells was comparable with the percentage of S-phase cells in serum-starved MEFs, which are normally arrested in G1/G0 of the cell cycle. Neither the retroviral transfer nor the expression of Cre had an effect on cell cycle progression in the controls. To address whether Tsg101-deficient cells enter S-phase and proceed through DNA replication, we examined the incorporation of BrdUrd. Tsg101-deficient cells exhibited a dramatic reduction in BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 5 A). Whereas 23 to 26% of the nuclei were labeled in the controls, only 5% of the Tsg101 knockout cells had incorporated BrdUrd. In addition, the intensity of the BrdUrd staining in most of theseTsg101 −/− cells was lower than in the controls, indicating incomplete replication of the genome. Successful initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of several proteins at the DNA replication fork prior to binding of DNA polymerase. One of the key proteins in these complexes is PCNA, which recruits DNA-polymerase δ (27Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Tethering of PCNA to DNA is therefore an excellent indicator for initiation of DNA replication. To test whether the DNA replication complex was assembled at the replication fork, we stained Tsg101-deficient and control cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-PCNA antibody. Unbound PCNA was removed from the cells by an extraction technique (23Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA bound PCNA was significantly reduced in Tsg101 −/− cells. Less than 2% of all conditional knockout cells contained DNA bound PCNA, whereas 14% of the cells were labeled in the controls (Fig.5 B). These numbers were consistent with the BrdUrd staining results and with the FACS analysis shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, loss of Tsg101 in primary fibroblasts results in cell cycle arrest late in G1 or at the transition from G1 to S and subsequently prevents initiation of DNA replication. Cell cycle progression is dependent on the sequential expression of stage-specific cyclins and on the activity of their respective cdks. Based on the FACS analysis, Tsg101 conditional knockout cells seemed to arrest at the G1 checkpoint or during G1/S transition. Therefore, we predicted that the expression of major cyclins, which are responsible for S-phase and G2/M transition, were deregulated in the Tsg101-deficient cells. In accordance with the observed cell cycle arrest, the G1 and G1/S phase cyclins D1 and E did not show any differences between pBabe-Cre infectedTsg101 fl/fl MEFs and their controls. In contrast, S and M phase cyclins (cyclins A and B) were markedly down-regulated in the knockout cells (Fig. 6 A). As verified by Northern blot, the down-regulation of cyclin A occurred on the transcriptional level and not through increased degradation of the proteins (Fig. 6 B). As cyclin E expression was not altered in the Tsg101knockout cells, it was feasible to hypothesize that an inactive cyclin E-associated kinase could be the cause for the profound cell cycle arrest in Tsg101 −/− cells. Cdk2 associates with cyclin E and is activated shortly before entry into S phase (28Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar,29Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar). To study the activity of cdk2 in Tsg101 knockout cells, we performed a histone H1 kinase assay with immunoprecipitated cdk2. The ability of cdk2 to phosphorylate histone H1 was greatly impaired in pBabe-Cre-infected Tsg101 fl/fl MEFs, whereas cdk2 from control lysates could strongly phosphorylate histone H1 (Fig.6 C). Therefore, the cell cycle arrest imposed by loss of Tsg101 cells is a consequence of reduced cdk2 kinase activity in our primary cells. The activity of the cyclin E-cdk2 complex is regulated by various mechanisms. One of the negative regulators of this complex is p21waf1/cip1 (30Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The expression of this cell cycle inhibitor is regulated by p53 (31el Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E.

Tumor angiogenesis is dependent on the interplay between tumor-derived angiogenic factors and stromal cells. Recently, it has been shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Moreover, there is evidence that patients with schizophrenia have a hyperreactive dopaminergic system and are relatively protected from cancer. We hypothesized that hyperreactivity of the dopaminergic system is related to reduced angiogenesis and tumor development. Therefore, we investigated tumor growth and angiogenesis in two lines of Wistar rats with high (APO-SUS) or low (APO-UNSUS) dopaminergic reactivity. Subcutaneous implants of mammary adenocarcinoma cells (MADB106) in matrigel remained 35% smaller in APO-SUS rats than in APO-UNSUS rats (P<0.01). Moreover, APO-SUS rats developed less lung metastases after i.v. administration of MADB106 tumor cells. Furthermore, hemoglobin content (APO-SUS: 40.6+/-7.6; APO-UNSUS: 76.9+/-13 mg/dl, P<0.05) and expression of the endothelial determinant PECAM-1 in tumors from APO-SUS rats were reduced (APO-SUS: 37+/-18; APO-UNSUS 69+/-25 units, P<0.01), indicating that reduced angiogenesis is responsible for reduced tumor development in APO-SUS rats. These results suggest a novel link between dopaminergic reactivity, angiogenesis, and tumor development and may explain part of the individual differences in cancer progression."

Several of these factors (“molecular chaperones”) promote the folding of cytoplasmic proteins by binding promiscuously to exposed hydrophobic surfaces and preventing aggregation (reviewed in Ref. 1Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). DnaK, a member of the highly conserved hsp70 family of chaperones, promotes protein folding at an early stage by binding to short, extended peptides in an ATP-dependent cycle that is regulated by two co-chaperones. Substrate folding progresses in a stepwise fashion through release and repeated rebinding. Proteins that have not completely folded after interaction with DnaK but that have acquired considerable secondary structure are subsequently transferred to GroEL, another ubiquitous chaperone. GroEL is a tetradecameric complex that also utilizes an ATPase cycle regulated by a co-chaperone to drive protein folding. By binding to exposed hydrophobic surfaces, molecular chaperones also “target” nascent and newly synthesized presecretory proteins to the inner membrane (IM)1 (2Bernstein H.D. Rapoport T.A. Walter P. Cell. 1989; 58: 1017-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chaperones maintain presecretory proteins in a loosely folded conformation, which is required for their transport across the IM and to keep signal peptides accessible to gate open the channel that mediates the translocation reaction (the SecY complex or “translocon”). A subset of presecretory proteins are targeted to the E. coli IM by SecB, a nonessential “export-specific” chaperone found only in Gram-negative bacteria (3Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the hsp70 family, DnaK promotes protein export and can at least partially substitute for SecB (4Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,5Wild J. Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 78: 3608-3613Crossref Google Scholar). 2H.-Y. Qi, J. B. Hyndman, and H. D. Bernstein, manuscript submitted for publication. GroEL may also play a role in protein sorting (6Bochkareva E.S. Lissin N.M. Girshovich A.S. Nature. 1988; 336: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 7Kusukawa N. Yura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3517-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Despite a similarity in function, SecB differs considerably from DnaK and GroEL in its structure and mechanism of action. SecB is a homotetramer that interacts with ∼150-amino acid polypeptide segments via an ATP-independent kinetic partitioning mechanism (8Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of SecB suggests that substrates are accommodated in a long continuous channel on the surface of the tetramer (9Xu Z. Knafels J.D. Yoshino K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another factor, the signal recognition particle (SRP), specifically promotes the insertion of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) into the IM (reviewed in Ref. 10de Gier J.-W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). SRP is an essential ribonucleoprotein complex that, like DnaK and GroEL, is universally conserved. E. coliSRP, which is much smaller than its eukaryotic counterpart, consists of a single protein (Ffh) and a ∼100-nucleotide RNA (4.5 S RNA). Strictly speaking, SRP is not a chaperone in that it recognizes substrates with much greater specificity than factors like DnaK (2Bernstein H.D. Rapoport T.A. Walter P. Cell. 1989; 58: 1017-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although mammalian SRP binds to both signal peptides of presecretory proteins and the initial transmembrane segments of polytopic membrane proteins (which often lack cleaved signal peptides) as they emerge from translating ribosomes, E. coli SRP binds primarily to the latter class of targeting signals (11Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.-G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). SRP targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the IM and then releases its cargo upon interaction with a peripheral membrane receptor (FtsY) in a GTP-dependent reaction (13Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.-W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Like proteins targeted by chaperone-based mechanisms, SRP substrates are transported across the IM by the SecY complex. Trigger factor (TF), an abundant ∼50-kDa protein found in all eubacteria, is the least understood of all the E. colinascent chain binding factors. Although TF was first purified as a ribosome-associated factor that can stabilize the translocation-competent form of a secretory precursor in vitro (15Crooke E. Guthrie B. Lecker S. Lill R. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), subsequent experiments indicated that it is not essential for either cell viability or protein export in vivo (17Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In biochemical assays, TF can be cross-linked to virtually all nascent secretory and cytoplasmic proteins (18Valent Q.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Unlike typical molecular chaperones, however, TF does not appear to recognize exposed hydrophobic surfaces (21Patzelt H. Rüdiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vonderwülbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TF is also homologous to FK506-binding proteins and displays a peptidyl-prolyl-cis-isomerase activity (19Hesterkamp T. Hauser S. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Stoller G. Rücknagel K.P. Nierhaus K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) of unknown significance. The first important insights into the function of TF in vivo emerged from the observation that null alleles of the trigger factor gene (tig) anddnaK are synthetically lethal (23Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 24Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A large number of cytosolic proteins aggregate in cells that lack both DnaK and TF. Deletion of tig also results in an increase in the number of nascent polypeptide chains that associate with DnaK. These results suggest that TF and DnaK “cooperate” in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, but the molecular basis for this cooperation is unclear. Because TF can be cross-linked to very short nascent chains, it may function upstream of DnaK. Intriguingly, eukaryotic cells contain a factor called the nascent chain-associated complex that can be cross-linked to nascent chains as short as 17 amino acids (25Wang S. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Despite a complete lack of sequence homology, it is conceivable that nascent chain-associated complex and TF fulfill similar roles in protein folding. A recent study that we conducted on the mechanism by which different classes of proteins are routed into distinct targeting pathways led to the more extensive examination of TF function described in this report.In vitro cross-linking data suggested that E. coli SRP fails to recognize signal peptides because TF interacts with sequences near the N terminus of the mature region of presecretory proteins and occludes SRP binding (26Beck K., Wu, L.-F. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Experiments using modified presecretory proteins, however, led to the conclusion that the targeting pathway of E. coli proteins under physiological conditions is dictated by the hydrophobicity of their targeting signals and not by the binding of TF (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the present study we initially set out to corroborate this conclusion. Surprisingly, during the course of our investigation we found that unlike typical molecular chaperones, TF impedes protein export. Our data suggest that TF sequesters both nascent presecretory and cytoplasmic proteins in a distinctive fashion. The results not only provide novel insights into protein targeting, but may also yield important clues about the relationship of TF and DnaK in protein folding.

The pgkgene was amplified and HA-tagged using the oligonucleotides 5′-TGCTAACCGAATGCTCTAGACGACGTTAGCTA-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTACAGGCTCGCATAATCCGGCACATCGTACGGATAACACTTCTTAGCGCGCTCTTCGAGCATC-3′. The amplified DNA was digested with XbaI andHindIII and cloned into pTRC99a to produce pHL32. The tagged version of pgk was then reamplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATTCACCATGTCTGAGATCTTGATGACCGATC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTACAGGCTCGCATAATC-3′ and pHL32 as a template. To construct pHL33, the PCR product was digested with BglII andHindIII and cloned into a derivative of pMAL-p2x (New England Biolabs) containing a BglII site at position 1607. Plasmid pHL36 was constructed by cloning anEcoRI-HindIII fragment of RB11-OmpA-HA (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) containing an HA-tagged version of ompA into pTRC99a. An I8N mutation was then introduced into the ompA gene in pHL36 as described above to generate pHL37. For most experiments, cells were grown in M9 medium containing 0.2% glucose. For experiments using HDB37 and HDB38, cultures were grown in M9 containing 0.2% glycerol. Overnight cultures were washed and diluted into fresh medium atA 550 = 0.025. When cultures reachedA 550 = 0.2–0.3 (after 4–5 h), cells were either radiolabeled or an inducer was added to drive the expression of a plasmid-borne gene. The synthesis of TM-OmpA, wild-type DnaK, MBP, and TF was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG, 100 μm IPTG, 50 μm IPTG, and 0.2% arabinose, respectively, and cells were radiolabeled 1 h later. The synthesis of OmpA-HA was induced by the addition of 50 μm IPTG and cells were radiolabeled 30 min later. Likewise, the synthesis of dominant negative alleles of ftsY and dnaK were induced by the addition of 2 mm and 100 μmIPTG, respectively, and cells were radiolabeled 40 min later. In temperature shift experiments, cultures were shifted to 22 °C when they reached A 550 = 0.2–0.3 and radiolabeled 1 h later. In some experiments, chloramphenicol (0.3–30 μg/ml) was added to cultures 15 min prior to labeling or sodium azide (2 mm) was added 2 min prior to labeling. In all pulse labeling experiments, cultures were radiolabeled for 30 s with 30 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN). In pulse-chase experiments, cultures were radiolabeled for 20 s. Cold cysteine and methionine (1 mm) were then added and incubation was continued for the indicated time. Proteins were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, and immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (30Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The membrane insertion of newly synthesized TM-OmpA was assessed as previously described (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The localization of OmpA was analyzed using an established gel mobility assay (31Freudl R. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.-D. Gamon R. Hindennach I. Henning U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11355-11361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Pulse-labeled cells were first converted to spheroplasts (28Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and 2% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were then added. Following a 5-min incubation on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 20,800 × g in a microcentrifuge, the supernatants were divided in half, and anti-OmpA was added. Antibody-antigen complexes were bound to protein A-agarose beads, the beads were washed as described (30Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and OmpA was eluted by incubating the samples at either 60 °C for 20 min or 99 °C for 5 min. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% minigels (Novex). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Fuji BAS 2500 PhosphorImager, and percent protein export was calculated using a previously described formula (32Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (28Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Whereas SecB is normally required for the efficient export of many outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and a few periplasmic proteins such as MBP, we found that these proteins could be diverted into the SRP pathway simply by increasing the hydrophobicity of their signal peptides (12Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we inferred that chaperones provide a default targeting mechanism for proteins that are bypassed by SRP and that TF does not play an active role in targeting pathway selection. To obtain direct evidence that TF is not involved in protein targeting, we examined the export of a variety of presecretory proteins in tig− strains. We predicted that proteins whose export is SecB-dependent in wild-type cells, for example, would remain SecB-dependent in the absence of TF. Contrary to our expectation, we found that the SecB requirement in the export of several different proteins was partially or completely suppressed by inactivation of the tig gene. Wild-type MC4100 and secB−, tig−, andsecB−/tig− derivatives (HDB55, HDB56, and HDB57, respectively), which all grew at essentially the same rate under our experimental conditions, were pulse-labeled and OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, or MBP were immunoprecipitated. In these experiments export efficiency was assessed by comparing the relative amounts of the precursor and mature forms of each protein. As observed in many other studies, >90% of all four proteins was exported in wild-type cells within the pulse labeling period (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). By contrast, the vast majority of each protein was retained in the cytoplasm of secB− cells (Fig.1 A, lane 2). Consistent with a previous study in which OmpA was used as a model presecretory protein (17Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all of the proteins were rapidly exported in tig− cells (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Interestingly, the small amount of pro-OmpA, pro-OmpC, and pro-OmpF observed in MC4100 was not detected in HDB56. This highly reproducible result (see Figs.2 A, 3, 4, and 6 D) raised the possibility that the OMP precursors were exported faster in the tig− strain than in the wild-type strain (see below). Surprisingly, >95% of each OMP and about half of the MBP appeared to be exported in HDB57 (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). To confirm that the presecretory proteins were properly translocated across the IM in the secB−/tig− strain, we assessed the localization of OmpA using an independent assay. Cells were pulse-labeled and OmpA was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions. Previous work has shown that integration of OmpA into the OM produces an altered conformation that is stable at moderate temperatures (31Freudl R. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.-D. Gamon R. Hindennach I. Henning U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11355-11361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This form of the protein (OmpA*) migrates rapidly on SDS-PAGE. The finding that only OmpA* was detected in HDB57 when the sample was heated at 60 °C (Fig. 1 B, lane 7) provides direct evidence that SecB substrates are efficiently exported in the secB−/tig− strain. In addition, Western blot analysis showed that tig inactivation did not suppress the SecB requirement by stimulating the production of SecY or SecA, two key components of the translocation machinery (Fig. 1 C). These results are remarkable in that the elimination of multiple chaperones and chaperone-like factors usually compounds, rather than ameliorates, export defects.Figure 2Disruption of tig enhances Bla export in SRP-deficient cells. A, MC4100, HDB55, HDB56, and HDB57 were transformed with pTRC-ftsY (G385A). Cultures were divided in half, and IPTG was added to one portion to induce expression of the mutant ftsY allele. Cells were pulse-labeled and OmpA and Bla were immunoprecipitated. B, sodium azide (NaN3) was added to MC4100 and HDB56 transformed with pTRC99a 2 min prior to labeling.

A, HDB37 (MC4100 Δara) was transformed with pJH42 (PBAD -tig) and pJH48 (encoding AP) (top panel), pJH42 alone (middle panel), or pJH43 (PBAD -tig) and pJH28 (encoding MBP) (bottom panel). Cultures were divided in half and arabinose was added to one portion (+Ara) to induce expression of tig. Cells were pulse-labeled and the indicated protein was immunoprecipitated. B, HDB38 (HDB37 tig−) was transformed with pJH42 or pHL22 (PBAD -tig F233Y) and arabinose was added to half of the cells as in A to induce overproduction of either wild-type TF (WT) or the TF F233Y mutant (F233Y). Cells were pulse-labeled and incubated for the indicated chase period, and OmpA was immunoprecipitated.C, HDB37 was transformed with pJH42 and pHL12 (encoding TM-OmpA) and arabinose was added to half of the cells as inA. Pulse-labeled cells were converted to spheroplasts and treated with proteinase K. TM-OmpA was immunoprecipitated along with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which served as a cytoplasmic marker. Proteinase K was added to the samples inlanes 1 and 3. D, MC4100 and HDB56 were transformed with pHL20 (Ptrc -dnaK). Cultures were divided in half and IPTG was added to one portion (+IPTG) to induce expression of dnaK. Cells were pulse-labeled and the indicated protein was immunoprecipitated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the possibility that tig inactivation suppresses the SecB requirement by relaxing the constraints on protein export and permitting the translocation of proteins that would normally remain in the cytoplasm, we examined the fate of an OmpA signal peptide mutant insecB−/tig− cells. MC4100 and HDB57 were transformed with a plasmid that encodes an HA-tagged version of wild-type OmpA (pHL36) or the OmpA I8N mutant (pHL37). The kinetics of export are monitored by pulse-chase analysis. As previously observed (33Goldstein J. Lehnhardt S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14413-14417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only a tiny fraction of the OmpA I8N mutant was exported in MC4100 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 5–8). A slightly greater percentage of the protein was exported in HDB57, perhaps because presecretory proteins are targeted to the IM earlier intig− cells and therefore have a longer opportunity to interact effectively with the translocon (see below). In any case, the results imply that the absence of TF does not fundamentally alter the fidelity of the export process. We next used β-lactamase (Bla) as a model protein to examine the effect of tig inactivation on the fate of proteins whose export does not require SecB. Although the Bla targeting pathway(s) has never been clearly identified, previous studies have shown that a variety of physiological insults that increase the presence of abnormal proteins (and that likely induce the heat shock response) lead to Bla export defects (7Kusukawa N. Yura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3517-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 34Izard J.W. Rusch S.L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21579-21582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These and other results (5Wild J. Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 78: 3608-3613Crossref Google Scholar) suggest that Bla is targeted by one or more heat shock-regulated chaperones such as DnaK or GroEL. Inactivation of the SRP pathway has often been observed to delay Bla export, but as previously proposed (35Poritz M.A. Bernstein H.D. Strub K. Zopf D. Wilhelm H. Walter P. Science. 1990; 250: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) this effect is probably an indirect consequence of perturbing the function of heat shock proteins. Analysis of Bla export in tig− cells yielded additional unexpected results. To inhibit Bla export, we first transformed MC4100, HDB55, HDB56, or HDB57 with pTRC-FtsY(G385A), a plasmid that contains the dominant negative ftsY G385A allele under control of the strong IPTG-inducible trc promoter. The SRP pathway was then inactivated by overexpression of the mutant ftsY allele and cells were pulse-labeled. In the absence of IPTG, Bla was exported rapidly in every strain (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). As previously observed (29Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), the addition of IPTG slightly inhibited Bla export in MC4100 (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Overexpression of ftsY G385A in HDB55, however, resulted in the retention of almost half of the pre-Bla in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 A, lane 6). Because Bla is not a SecB substrate, the stronger e"

Epidemiological studies implicate the phospholipase A2/arachidonic acid cascade in the mechanism by which smoking causes heart disease. However, specific components of cigarette smoke that activate this pathway have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contained in cigarette smoke on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and apoptosis of human coronary artery endothelial cells. 1-methylanthracene (1-MA), phenanthrene (PA), and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) caused significant release of 3H-arachidonate from endothelial cells. 1-MA and PA, but not B(a)P, also caused significant release of 3H-linoleic acid. Release of fatty acids from membrane phospholipids preceded the onset of apoptosis. 3H-arachidonate release and apoptosis induced by 1-MA, B(a)P, and PA were inhibited by methylarachidonoyl-fluorophosphonate, an inhibitor of Groups IV and VI PLA2s. Bromoenol lactone, an inhibitor of Group VI enzymes, inhibited both 3H-arachidonate release and apoptosis induced by 1-MA and PA, but not B(a)P. MJ33, an inhibitor of the acidic calcium-independent PLA2, attenuated 3H-arachidonate release and apoptosis by PA, but not 1-MA or B(a)P. The presence of Groups IV and VI and the acidic iPLA2 in endothelial cells was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western analysis. These data suggest that 1-MA, B(a)P and PA induce apoptosis of endothelial cells by a mechanism that involves activation of these three distinct isoforms of PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W2039590367,"Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition where previous exposure to hydrophobic organic solvents or pesticides appears to render people hypersensitive to a wide range of chemicals, including organic solvents. The hypersensitivity is often exquisite, with MCS individuals showing sensitivity that appears to be at least two orders of magnitude greater than that of normal individuals. This paper presents a plausible set of interacting mechanisms to explain such heightened sensitivity. It is based on two earlier theories of MCS: the elevated nitric oxide/peroxynitrite theory and the neural sensitization theory. It is also based on evidence implicating excessive NMDA activity in MCS. Four sensitization mechanisms are proposed to act synergistically, each based on known physiological mechanisms: Nitric oxide-mediated stimulation of neurotransmitter (glutamate) release; peroxynitrite-mediated ATP depletion and consequent hypersensitivity of NMDA receptors; peroxynitrite-mediated increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, producing increased accessibility of organic chemicals to the central nervous system; and nitric oxide inhibition of cytochrome P450 metabolism. Evidence for each of these mechanisms, which may also be involved in Parkinson's disease, is reviewed. These interacting mechanisms provide explanations for diverse aspects of MCS and a framework for hypothesis-driven MCS research."

Linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing the MCAT core motif was compared with DNA containing random nicks (discontinuous or dcDNA). The dsDNAs activated trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) about 5 times more effectively than dcDNA as measured by V max. Activation of auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) by dcDNA was 10 times greater than by dsDNA. The affinity of PARP I toward dcDNA or dsDNA in the auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) was at least 100-fold lower than in trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) (K a = 1400versus 3–15, respectively). Mg2+ inhibited trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) and so did dcDNA at concentrations required to maximally activate auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation). Mg2+ activated auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) of PARP I.

Richter C. Mol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemical analysis of normal adult rat tissues for poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPR) showed that 99% of covalently bound polymer was found in the non-histone fraction of nuclear proteins, with histone H1 being the major acceptor among the remaining 1% (2Minaga T. Romaschin A.D. Kirsten E. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9663-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actual quantities of protein-bound pADPR in normal tissues, however, are small (200–250 ng/g, dry weight) as compared with the large abundance of PARP I protein itself (0.5 × 106copies/cell (cf. Ref. 4Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This difference suggests that PARP I activity in vivo is highly regulated. The secondary structure of pADPR (3Minaga T. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 725-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that binding of modified proteins to other proteins or to DNA will be altered by poly(ADP-ribosylation). Furthermore, unmodified PARP I avidly binds to a large number of nuclear proteins (4Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), an association that is completely blocked by added histone H1. In addition, an assortment of transcription factors was shown to bind to PARP I (cf. Ref.5Kun E. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar), and a transcriptional regulatory role of PARP I in muscle differentiation has been identified (6Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The MCAT element derived from this work (cf. Ref. 6Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) served as a basic DNA sequence for the construction of dsDNAs studied in the present experiment. Recently the topology of the direct binding of PARP I to Topo 1 has been demonstrated in detail (7Bauer P.I. Chen H-J. Kenesi E. Kenessey I. Buki K.G. Kirsten E. Hakam A. Hwang J.I. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The binding of PARP I to histone H1 induces conformational changes in the latter coinciding with new phosphorylation sites for Cdc2-kinase (8Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Kun E. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 691-693PubMed Google Scholar). Although the enzymatic transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to PARP I and to several nuclear proteins has been well established (1Althaus F.R. Richter C. Mol. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 37: 1-237PubMed Google Scholar), it has remained unclear what factors determine protein auto- or heteromodification by poly(ADP-ribose). The large activation of PARP I by randomly broken dcDNA, both in vitro and in vivo, created the prevalent impression that only apparently nonphysiologic forces, which cause DNA damage, regulate the intracellular activity of PARP I (9DeMurcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death: Poly(ADP-ribosylation) Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar). These results fail to explain a potentially physiologic cellular role of PARP I in the absence of such DNA damage (e.g. Refs. 5Kun E. Int. J. Mol.

Oncol. 1996; 8: 239-252PubMed Google Scholar). A more detailed knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism involved in auto- and trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation), as outlined in this report, is prerequisite to the understanding of the cellular physiology of PARP I. The research leading to the present studies is summarized as follows. We have shown in 1990 (11Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that dimerization of PARP I molecules is a prerequisite to auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation), a conclusion supported by enzyme kinetic analyses (12Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of the formation of higher oligomers of PARP I was deduced from enzyme kinetics of the activation of Topo 1 by PARP I (13Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Comstock J.A. Kun E. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 533-540PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct role of a catalytic function of PARP I monomer and the exclusive acceptor role of the second associating PARP I molecule in the homodimer were further clarified in 1994 (14Panzeter P.L. Althaus F.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9600-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transfer of ADP-ribose from PARP I to an acceptor protein was shown to occur via an unstable imidazolyl ADP-ribose intermediate (15Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The unique role of randomly broken dcDNA (coDNA) to serve as a coenzyme of PARP I (9DeMurcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death: Poly(ADP-ribosylation) Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar) was challenged by our previous results, which show a strong binding of PARP I to unusual DNA structures (16Sastry S.S. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1505-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sastry S.S. Buki K.G. Kun E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5670-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Sastry S.S. Kun E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, the recent demonstration of sequence-specific DNA binding interactions among PARP I, members of the transcription enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1) family of transcription factors, and the MCAT 1 transcriptional regulatory element (6Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) suggested physiologic circumstances in which linear double-stranded DNA may serve as coenzyme for PARP I. These results are expanded in the present study, which demonstrates that dsDNAs containing neither free termini nor discontinuities (breaks) activate trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) more effectively than randomly damaged “coenzymic” DNA. Thus the unique role of artificially damaged DNA in the regulation of PARP I is questioned, and the basis for a physiologic role for PARP I through binding to linear, double-stranded chromosomal DNA is supported by these studies. Synthesis of DNAs as single strands was carried out by Operon Technologies and purified (to more than 95% purity) by high pressure liquid chromatography, and homogeneity was assayed by PAGE. Single-strand DNA oligonucleotides were annealed in 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Single-strand nicks resulting from annealing of loop-stem-loops were repaired with T-4 ligase (overnight at 4 °C), and traces of incomplete ligation were removed by Exo III digestion and checked in native acrylamide gels. Table I illustrates the composition of dsDNAs used in enzymatic assays. The MCAT core motif is underlined. Homogeneous calf thymus PARP I was isolated as reported (7Bauer P.I. Chen H-J. Kenesi E.

Biotinylated NAD and human PARP I were purchased from Trevigen Co. Electrophoretically homogeneous histone H1 and H3 were obtained from Roche, and ultrapure NAD was from Sigma.Table IOligonucleotide sequence and modificationCurveOligonucleotide sequenceEnd modification2 (a)O-5′-CAAGTGTTGCATTCCTCTCTGGG-3′-ONoneO-3′-GTTCACAACGTAAGGAGAGACCC-5′-ONone2 (b)O-5′-CCTGACACACATTCCTCAGCTGG-3′-ONoneO-3′-GGACTGTGTGTAAGGAGTCGACC-5′-ONone4F-5′-CAAGTGTTGCATTCCTCTCTGGG-3′-BBLKB-3′-GTTCACAACGTAAGGAGAGACCC-5′-TBLK3F-5′-CACAAGTGTTGCATTCCTCTCTGAAGTTAAGACCTATGCAGAGAGGAATGCAACACTTGTG-3′-DSLB1O-5′-GAATGCAACACTTGGTAGATAACCTCCAAGTGTTGCATTCCTCTCTGGGTTTATTGGGCGACCCAGAGAG-3′-OLSLThe abbreviations of chemical end blockers are as follows: B, biotin; D, dabcyl [4(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl]; F, fluorescein; T, Tamra (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine); O, free ends; BLK, block; SLB, stem-loop block; LSL, loop-stem-loop.

Auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) of PARP I was assayed as reported (4Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by the incorporation of 32P-labeled ADP-ribose (from NAD) into acid-precipitable PARP I-bound polymers. Trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) from NAD to histone H1-PARP I heterodimers was assayed by two methods described in the following paragraphs. The first method is a colorimetric technique for the determination of biotinylated poly(ADP-ribose) bound to histone H1 coats (a modification of the assay described by Trevigen Inc.). Histone H1 was coated to the wall of 96-well plates by adding 0.1 mg/ml histone solution (in 50 μl of PBS), allowed to stand at 4 °C for 20 h, and then dried after washing with PBS. The enzymatic trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) system (50 μl, final volume) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 400 μm NAD to which biotinylated NAD was added (at a final concentration of 50 μm) and DNase I-treated DNA (coDNA) (Fig. 1, inset) or dsDNAs at varying concentrations, as indicated in Figs. 1 and2. The reaction was initiated by adding diluted PARP I (50 ng/well) and allowed to proceed at 23 °C for exactly 10 min when it was stopped by rapid decanting followed by 4 washes with 100 μl of PBS per well. The biotinylated poly(ADP-ribose) attached to the histone H1 coat was quantitated by reacting it with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Trevigen) for 30 min, washed 4 times as before, and then incubated in the dark for 10 min with peroxidase substrate. Then 50 μl of 0.2 n HCl was added and absorbance was recorded at 450 nm. This assay gave linear rates with time during a 10-min reaction, but prolonged kinetics was limited by the amount of chromogen. The two PARP I preparations gave identical results.Figure 2Poly(ADP-ribosylation) assays consisting of the incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose from radiolabeled NAD into 20% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods” (second method). Compositions of the 50-μl reaction mixtures are shown (second method). Reaction times (at room temperature) were 10 min in all cases. All measurements were done in triplicate with an S.D. of ±20%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The second method is a trans- and auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) with [32P]NAD as ADP-ribose donor. Histone H1 was added to a concentration of 5 μg/50 μl of reaction volume, which was a 100-fold excess over PARP I concentration. The formation of PARP I-histone heterodimers was complete within 10 min at room temperature. The 50-μl reaction system contained the same buffer as described in the previous paragraph. The poly(ADP-ribosylation) reaction was initiated by 32P-labeled NAD (400 μm final concentration) and terminated by 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by the addition of 0.3 mg of bovine serum albumin (in 30 μl); then after three centrifugal washings (1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid each) radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of the pellets. The coenzymic activity for trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) of randomly broken dsDNA (discontinuous or dcDNA) and four synthetic oligonucleotides (Table I) is shown in TableII and Fig. 1. In all cases Michaelis-Menten kinetics was obtained, and it was evident that the synthetic oligonucleotides were about 300–400% more effective in the trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) reaction than randomly broken dcDNA in terms of V max (Table II, A). Even more strikingly, the affinity (K a) of DNAs toward PARP I was far lower in the auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) reaction (Table II, B) than in the trans reaction, questioning the physiologic importance of the former.Table IIVmax and Ka values in trans- and auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) using various coenzymic DNAsCoenzymic DNA typeV maxK aA.

All K a values are given as nanograms of DNA per ml. Numbering in A corresponds to Table I and Fig.1. The activation of histone H1 trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) and PARP I auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) by both dcDNA and by the end-blocked synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotide 4 (see Fig. 1) was also analyzed by the second method, which permits the simultaneous determination of both poly(ADP-ribosylation)s by kinetic analysis that were linear over 20 min (n = 3). As illustrated in Fig.2, v init as 10-min rates are shown in all assays for comparison. The specificity of histone H1 as poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor in the trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) reaction was tested by replacing histone H1 with H3 (4Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). No transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to histone H3 occurred (not shown), confirming earlier results (4Buki K.G. Bauer P.I. Hakam A. Kun E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3370-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) which demonstrated that incorporation of histone H3 into nucleosomes was a prerequisite for poly(ADP-ribosylation) of histone H3 by PARP I. The cell biological importance of trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) of histones contained in nucleosomes is the subject of further research. Since a significant catalytic activation of poly(ADP-ribosylation) by Mg2+ has been described in 1979 (19Farzaneh F. Pearson C.K. Dev. Biol. 1979; 72: 254-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we reinvestigated the role of Mg2+ in both trans- and auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) reactions. As shown in Fig. 2 A, histone H1trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) was dramatically inhibited by Mg2+. There was also a large inhibition of trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) by randomly broken “coenzymic” DNA (dcDNA) at a concentration that is required to maximize auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation). This explains the apparent absence of trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) in results obtained by most experimentalists in this field (cf. Ref. 9DeMurcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death: Poly(ADP-ribosylation) Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar) who used high concentrations of artificially fragmented DNA as a coenzyme to detect poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation), on the other hand, was markedly activated by Mg2+, an effect observed with either 7 or 70 ng of dsDNA per test (Fig. 2 B) but was maximal with the artificially fragmented dcDNA as a coenzyme. Based on these results (compare Fig. 2, A and B) we conclude that Mg2+ can discriminate between trans- and auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation)s by inhibiting the former and activating the latter. From results obtained in this study the specific activity of PARP I can be calculated for both auto and histone H1trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) reactions. The specific activity for trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) (picomoles of ADP-ribose incorporated into polymers per pmol of PARP I × minutes) was 106 (±30%) (n = 3) and for auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) 50 (±20%) (n = 3). According to prevailing opinion (cf. Ref. 9DeMurcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death: Poly(ADP-ribosylation) Reactions. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar), the complex interplay of poly(ADP-ribosylation) of proteins may regulate,e.g. transcription of cell-specific genes, or influence availability of genes for transcription via chromatin modifications. These events were previously presumed to be initiated by some random DNA damage. That scenario seems counterintuitive if it is assumed that an organized cell function reflects normal cell physiology. This difficulty is alleviated by results reported here because linear and stem-loop DNA structures that are known to exist in normal cells provide a much more powerful activator of PARP I than damaged DNA without invocation of pathophysiology. Although the unique structural features of these activating DNAs and their exact molecular mode of action on PARP I are still under investigation, the generation of PARP I binding DNA structures (e.g. Ref. 18Sastry S.S. Kun E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) during DNA replication has been established (20Yao N. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1421-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); thus the assumption of their physiologic existence is feasible. Present results lend support to an early observation reported in 1987 (21Hakam A. McLick J. Buki K.G. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which illustrates different modalities of activation of PARP I by octadeoxyribonucleotides of differing base sequence."

HNF4α7 and HNF4α1 differ only in their N-terminal domains, and their expression in the liver is regulated developmentally. We show that the N-terminal activation function (AF)-1 of HNF4α1 possesses significant activity that can be enhanced through interaction with glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) and cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP). In striking contrast, HNF4α7 possesses no measurable AF-1, implying major functional differences between the isoforms. Indeed, although HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 are able to interact via AF-2 with GRIP-1, p300, and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), only HNF4α1 interacts in a synergistic fashion with GRIP-1 and p300. Although both isoforms interact physically and functionally with SMRT, the repression of HNF4α7 is less robust than that of HNF4α1, which may be caused by an increased ability of the latter to recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to target promoters. Moreover, association of SMRT with HDACs enhanced recruitment of HNF4α1 but not of HNF4α7. These observations suggest that NR isoform-specific association with SMRT could affect activity of the SMRT complex, implying that selection of HDAC partners is a novel point of regulation for NR activity.

Their effects are elicited by either activation or repression of a set of genes that harbor DNA motifs recognized by NRs. Although mechanisms of activation are well understood today, repression is beginning to be recognized as a key player in homeostasis (2Gelmetti V. Zhang J. Fanelli M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7185-7191Google Scholar, 3Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C.

Gene activation is generally associated with relaxed chromatin structure, which is facilitated by acetylation and methylation of histone N-terminal tails through the recruitment of acetyltransferases or methyltransferases (5Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3014-3020Google Scholar, 6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Google Scholar). Recruitment of these coregulators to target promoters occurs mainly through direct physical interaction with one of the two activation function modules of NRs, the ligand-dependent AF-2 (7Torchia J. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Google Scholar). The role of the other AF, AF-1, is less well studied. Nevertheless, increasing evidence suggests that AF-1 is involved in recruitment of coactivators such as Src-1, GRIP-1, and CBP (8Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A. J. Biol.

The mechanisms of cooperative action of the two AFs within a single NR are by and large poorly understood, but it has been shown for estrogen receptor α that the transcription intermediary factor TIF2 mediates such cooperation (12Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Google Scholar). Gene repression is associated with recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remove acetyl groups from histones, provoking the recondensation of chromatin (5Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3014-3020Google Scholar, 6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Google Scholar). Repression is achieved by recruiting corepressors to regulatory regions through direct physical association with NRs or other transcription factors (13Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

The corepressors SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) and NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) contain two receptor interacting domains (RID1 and RID2) that mediate interactions with NRs (18Li H.

In most cases, interaction with the RIDs occurs in the absence of the corresponding ligand (20Privalsky M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 117-136Google Scholar). Moreover, different NRs exhibit a preference for association with NCoR or SMRT (21Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Leon Del-Rio A. Ricote M. Ngo S.D. Gemsch J.

SMRT and NCoR tether additional components of the corepressor complexes, including HDACs, through their silencing domains (4Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.

Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Google Scholar). The search for partners of SMRT and NCoR has revealed an increasing number of HDACs. HDACs have been classified on the basis of their relatedness to yeast homologs. The mammalian class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, and 3) are related to RPD3, and HDACs of class II (HDAC4, 5, 6, and 7) share similarities with HDA1 (25Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Google Scholar, 26Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66Google Scholar, 27Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M.

There seems to be a selectivity for association with HDACs because it has recently been established that SMRT functions as an activating cofactor for HDAC3 but not for HDAC4, 5, or 7 (29Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Google Scholar, 30Guenther M.G. Barak O. Lazar M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Google Scholar). Instead, HDAC4 needs to be bridged to a SMRT·HDAC3 complex to become active (29Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M. Voelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Google Scholar). Regulated binding of HDACs might play a role in determining SMRT corepressor activity on promoters, thereby constituting a critical level of regulation for NR activity which integrates the diversity of HDACs in the current model for repression of transcription. No data concerning the occurrence and consequences of recruitment of HDAC family members to different promoters have been documented. HNF4α is a member of the NR superfamily and is highly expressed in the liver (31Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Google Scholar). A key role for HNF4α in development and hepatic differentiation and homeostasis has been demonstrated unambiguously (32Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Google Scholar, 33Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Google Scholar, 34Li J. Ning G. Duncan S.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 464-474Google Scholar). A number of isoforms of HNF4α resulting from alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage have been identified (35Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Diseases. Academic Press, London2001Google Scholar), but their roles in development and differentiation have not been examined. The activity of HNF4α1, the first isoform identified, has been shown to be repressed by SMRT (36Ruse Jr., M.D. Privalsky M.L. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1626-1638Google Scholar) and enhanced by association with CBP/p300 and GRIP-1 (37Dell H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9013-9021Google Scholar, 38Sladek F.M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Google Scholar). HNF4α2, a C-terminal splice variant, exhibits enhanced interaction with coactivators (38Sladek F.M. Ruse Jr., M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Google Scholar). We showed recently that HNF4α7, resulting from alternative promoter usage, is expressed during the early stages of liver development, prior to HNF4α1, and that it exhibits transcriptional activity different from that of HNF4α1 (40Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Google Scholar). Beyond these findings, nothing is known about functional differences in the HNF4α isoforms. To contribute to understanding the mechanisms governing the regulation of NR function, we have compared the parameters of activation and repression of the two isoforms of HNF4α which differ only in their N-terminal domains. We show here that the N-terminal AF-1 of HNF4α1 possesses significant activity that can be enhanced through interaction with GRIP-1 and CBP. In striking contrast, HNF4α7 possesses no measurable AF-1, implying major functional differences between isoforms. Indeed, we were able to show that although HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 are both able to interact via the AF-2 with GRIP-1, p300, and SMRT, only HNF4α1 is able to interact in a synergistic fashion with both GRIP-1 and p300. Although both factors show physical and functional interaction with SMRT and HDACs, the repression of HNF4α7 is less robust than that of HNF4α1. Our determination that they recruit HDAC activity in a different fashion suggests a biochemical basis for their different roles in transactivation of target genes. Our observations strongly suggest that both qualitative and quantitative differences ranging from the nature of the recruited coregulator to the selectivity of its association with direct effectors of histone modification such as HDACs can act simultaneously to modulate transcriptional activity of NRs.

A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Google Scholar) are described elsewhere. The pSG424 plasmid contains the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the yeast GAL4 protein (50Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Google Scholar), and the reporter plasmid Tp1.GAL4.Luc (51Manet E. Allera C. Gruffat H. Mikaelian I. Rigolet A. Sergeant A. Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 49-59Google Scholar) harbors 10 GAL4 binding sites in front of the Tp1 minimal promoter driving expression of the luciferase gene. The two GAL4.HNF4α.A/B constructs were prepared by inserting the sequence encoding the A/B domains of rat HNF4α1 or HNF4α7 in-frame into theEcoRI sites of the pSG424 vector. For the GAL4.HNF4α.ΔF constructs, rat cDNAs encoding truncated HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 proteins were cloned into the EcoRI sites of the pSG424 plasmid. The constructions were verified by sequencing. The CMV.β-gal plasmid (California Biotechnology Inc.) contains the lacZgene under control of the CMV promoter. The pSET.HNF4α1.6His and pSET.HNF4α7.6His vectors contain the full-length cDNA of rat HNF4α1 and HNF4α7, respectively. These plasmids were constructed as follows. The cDNAs for each of the isoforms was amplified by PCR and ligated into the HindIII site of the pGEX-3x-6His vector (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA with the 6His tag in 3′ derived from the pGEX-3x-6His vector was then excised by EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the pRSET5d vector (52Schoepfer R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 83-85Google Scholar). The constructs were verified by sequencing. The GST-SMRT fusion proteins constructs, GST-SMRT.RID1 (amino acids 1055–1291) and GST- SMRT.RID2 (1291–1495), from human SMRT have been described previously (19Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell.

Seidel S.D. Wei G. Liu X. Sladek F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 402-410Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transient transfection assays, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in six-well plates and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure the next day using 1 μg of reporter, 100 ng of CMV.β-gal, and various amounts of expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. Equivalent molar amounts of empty vector were added to equalize the DNA amount. Glycerol shock was carried out 5 h later, and cells were harvested 24 h after the shock. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the standard colorimetric method, and luciferase activity was determined with a Berthold Luminometer 9501 as described (54Thompson J.F. Hayes L.S. Lloyd D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 171-177Google Scholar). For the one-hybrid assay, the indicated amounts of the pSG424 or the GAL4.HNF4α plasmids along with 1 μg of Tp1.GAL4.Luc, various amounts of CMV.SMRT, and 100 ng of CMV.β-gal were used. For TSA treatment, 100 ng of trichostatin A (Sigma) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added 8 h before harvesting. For immunoprecipitations, 6 × 106 cells were seeded 1 day before transfection and were transfected by the same procedure with 15 μg of expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. Transfected cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 1 h with either the α445 antiserum (31Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Google Scholar) directed against the C-terminal region of HNF4α1/α7, or with an anti-SMRT antibody (sc-1612, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then overnight with protein A or protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with the same buffer. For the double pulldown experiments, the lysis buffer was 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with 0.01% Nonidet P-40 NET-N (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). Whole cell extracts and immunocomplexes were subjected to Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The primary antibodies were a monoclonal anti-VSV antibody coupled to peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the α445 antiserum, the anti-SMRT antibody, and an anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (sc-577, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). When required, goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase antibodies were used. Peroxidase activity was detected by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). All protein-protein interaction analyses were performed as described previously (38Sladek F.M. Ruse Jr., M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Google Scholar) using agarose-immobilized GST fusion proteins. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were produced with the TNT system (Promega) using pSET.HNF4α1.6His, pSET.HNF4α7.6His, pEV589.HDAC3.FLAG (48Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Google Scholar), or pL67.HDAC4.FLAG (49Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Google Scholar) plasmid. Where indicated, 2 μl of the TNT product was incubated for 10 min on ice with 200 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides in 100 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% Ficoll. The sequence of the apoC-III oligonucleotide used is 5′-TCGAGCGCTGGGCAAAGGTCACCTGC. Protease digestion assays of35S-HNF4α1 and 35S-HNF4α7 withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) were performed by the addition of the indicated amounts of trypsin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min and was stopped by adding SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and analyzed by autoradiography. Extracts of ∼8 × 108transfected 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with the α445 antiserum. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in TBS buffer, and HDAC activity was determined as described by Taunton et al. (28Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Google Scholar). HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 are isoforms of HNF4α resulting from alternative promoter usage leading to the transcription of alternative coding first exons (Fig. 1 A). The two promoters are sequentially transcribed during development (40Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Google Scholar). Distal to the amino acids encoded by the first exon, the two proteins are identical, and they differ in their amino acid compositions only within the A/B domain (Fig. 1 B) (55Nakhei H. Lingott A. Lemm I. Ryffel G.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 497-504Google Scholar). We showed previously that HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 exhibit different transactivation activities in transient transfection assays depending on the target gene (40Torres-Padilla M.E. Fougere-Deschatrette C. Weiss M.C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 183-193Google Scholar). We now explore the mechanisms whereby these isoforms behave differently as transactivators. Because both isoforms share the same DBD, likely showing the same DNA binding properties, we reasoned that functional interactions with coregulators might account for the differences. The A/B domain of NRs is located at the N-terminal region and harbors AF-1 (Fig. 1 B), one of the two activation function modules. The AF-1 of HNF4α1 has been shown to interact with members of the basal machinery and with CBP (8Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Google Scholar), providing a surface of contact with transcriptional coregulators. The A/B domain of HNF4α1 consists of 49 amino acids, and its AF-1 has been mapped to amino acids 1–24 (56Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Google Scholar). The AF-1 exhibits an overall negative charge and shows autonomous transactivation accounting for 40% of HNF4α1 activity as tested by the one-hybrid assay (56Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the corresponding region in HNF4α7 contains completely unrelated noncharged amino acids. Thus, we first questioned whether the A/B domain of HNFα7 possesses an AF-1 function. The regions corresponding to the A/B domains of HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 were fused to the DBD of GAL4, and one-hybrid assays were performed to test transactivation potentials. 293T cells were transfected with 300 ng of one or the other of the GAL4.HNF4α.A/B constructs and a reporter for GAL4. As has been shown previously, the A/B domain of HNFα1 showed a robust transactivation activity in this assay, provoking a 120-fold activation compared with the GAL4 construction (Fig. 1 C). This activity is caused entirely by the presence of the AF-1 domain (8Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Google Scholar). In striking contrast, the HNF4α7 A/B construct showed no activity, and increasing the GAL4.HNFα7.A/B plasmid amount up to 5 μg still did not result in transactivation of the reporter gene (data not shown). Nonetheless, it is possible that the A/B domain of HNF4α7 is constitutively repressed by endogenous HDAC activity. To exclude this possibility we measured the transcriptional activity of the GAL4.HNF4α7.A/B construct in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor TSA and still failed to detect transactivation (data not shown). The lack of activity was not the result of the absence of the protein because the two fusion proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (Fig. 1 D). These experiments demonstrate unambiguously that HNF4α7 does not contain an AF-1 function. It could not be ruled out, however, that the A/B region of HNF4α7 tethers coactivators to target promoters. To test this hypothesis we performed the same one-hybrid experiments in the presence of CBP or GRIP-1, which belong to different families of coactivators. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with 500 ng of pSG424, GAL4.HNF4α1.A/B, or GAL4.HNF4α7.A/B plasmid, the Tp1.GAL4.Luc reporter, and 5 μg of an expression vector for GRIP-1 or CBP. CBP elicited a modest but reproducible increase in the transcriptional activity of the GAL4.HNF4α1.A/B construct (Fig.2 A, left panel). In contrast, even in the presence of CBP, the A/B domain of HNF4α7 failed to display substantial activity (Fig. 2 A). In the case of the p160 family member GRIP-1, an increase of 5.9-fold of activity was elicited for the construct containing HNF4α1 A/B, but no stimulation of activity of the GAL4.HNF4α7.A/B construct was observed (Fig. 2 A, right panel). The AF-2 module of NRs is located in the E domain and, in the case of HNF4α1, has been shown to interact functionally with GRIP-1 (38Sladek F.M. Ruse Jr., M.D. Nepomuceno L. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6509-6522Google Scholar). To verify that the AF-2 of HNF4α7 is functional and can be coactivated, we used a longer fusion protein, GAL4.HNF4α7.ΔF, which includes the A/B through the E domains (Fig. 2 B). NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with GAL4, GAL4.HNF4α7.A/B, or GAL4.HNF4α7.ΔF with various amounts of GRIP-1 expression vector and the Tp1.GAL4.Luc plasmid. Again, the A/B domain fused to GAL4 failed to induce any transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 C). However, the GAL4.HNF4α7.ΔF construct did elicit a transcriptional activity that was augmented in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of increasing amounts of GRIP-1. Thus, GRIP-1 is able to coactivate HNF4α7, but only through the E domain, and presumably AF-2. For the estrogen receptor α and glucocorticoid receptor, for which the agonists are well characterized, the AF-1 and AF-2 modules have been shown to synergize through the action of coregulators (9Hittelman A.B. Burakov D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Google Scholar, 12Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Google Scholar). We wondered whether the AF-1 and AF-2 of HNF4α are able to synergize via the p160 and p300 coactivators. Moreover, if the AF-1 is necessary for the simultaneous action of these two families of coregulators, then no synergy should be observed for HNF4α7 in the presence of GRIP-1 and p300. 293T cells were cotransfected with the CMV.HNF4α1.VSV or CMV.HNF4α7.VSV plasmid encoding full-length proteins, expression vectors for p300 and/or GRIP-1, and the apoA-I reporter plasmid. Both HNF4α1 and HNF4α7 transactivated the apoA-I reporter (Fig.3). p300 coactivated both isoforms by 9-fold and 8-fold for HNF4α1 and HNF4α7, respectively (Fig. 3). GRIP-1 showed similar behavior, coactivating both isoforms, HNF4α1 by 2-fold and HNF4α7 by 4-fold (Fig. 3). When both coactivators were cotransfected with the reporter, HNF4α1 activity was increased 15-fold, which represents a synergistic rather than an additive effect compared with the effects provoked by either coactivator alone. In the case of HNF4α7, activity was increased 12-fold, which corresponds to the additive value for the induction elicited by each coactivator alone. Thus, through the combined action of GRIP-1 and p300, the two AF modules of HNF4α1 appear to synergize. However, this is not the case for HNF4α7, which possesses only one activation function module. Hence, synergy seems to be dependent on the presence of the AF-1 in HNF4α1. Moreover, the synergistic effect was lost when a construct bearing a mutation in the NR boxes of GRIP-1 was used (Fig. 3, GRIP-1 mut), thus indicating that the synergy is also dependent on the NR boxes th"

We examined the hypothesis that opioids and volatile anesthetics potentiate cardiac K(ATP) channel opening, thereby enhancing cardioprotection. Rats were treated with the delta opioid agonists, TAN-67 or BW373U86, or isoflurane, together or alone with and without diazoxide, a mitochondrial K(ATP) channel opener. Glibenclamide, a non-selective K(ATP) channel blocker, was used to further characterize the signaling mechanism involved. Myocardial infarct size (IS) was determined by tetrazolium staining and was expressed as a percent of the area at risk (AAR). High doses of TAN-67 (10 mg/kg), diazoxide (10 mg/kg), and isoflurane (1 MAC) produced a significant reduction in IS compared with the control group (30+/-3%, 36+/-5%, and 42+/-2 vs. 58+/-2%, respectively), whereas lower doses of the drugs had no effect except for the low dose of isoflurane (0.5 MAC). The combination of TAN-67 and diazoxide or isoflurane and diazoxide resulted in a marked reduction in IS compared with controls in the presence of high (9+/-3% and 14+/-3%) and low (17+/-7% and 31+/-7%) dose combinations, respectively. The combination of TAN-67 or BW373U86 and isoflurane also caused a striking reduction in IS/AAR (16+/-7% and 7+/-2%, respectively). To date, this is the first demonstration that opioids and volatile anesthetics work in conjunction to confer protection against myocardial infarction through potentiation of cardiac K(ATP) channel opening."

More detailed characterization in AP-1 cells using organelle-specific markers showed that NHE5 co-localized with internalized transferrin, a marker of recycling endosomes. Transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin-1, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, blocked uptake of transferrin as well as internalization of NHE5. Likewise, wortmannin inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, a lipid kinase implicated in endosomal traffic, induced coalescence of vesicles containing NHE5 and caused a pronounced inhibition of plasmalemmal Na+/H+ exchange. By contrast, disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D increased cell surface NHE5 activity and abundance.

Hence, fine pH control of the neural milieu is a vital biological process. Maintenance of acid-base homeostasis in the central nervous system is complex and involves the coordinated activities of several distinct plasma membrane ion transporters, including Na+-HCO 3− cotransporters, Na+-dependent and -independent Cl−/HCO 3− exchangers, and Na+/H+ exchangers (for an overview, see Ref.5Putnam R.W.

NHE1 is ubiquitously expressed and is noted for its high sensitivity to inhibitory drugs such as amiloride. It is chiefly responsible for restoration of steady-state pHi following cytosolic acidification and for maintenance of cell volume.

Moreover, hippocampal CA1 neurons isolated from these animals display enhanced membrane excitability and increased Na+ current density, implicating a functional association between NHE1 and voltage-sensitive Na+ channels that seemingly contributes to neural dysfunction when disrupted (20Gu X.Q. Yao H. Haddad G.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C496-C503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular nature of this relationship is unknown. By comparison, NHE2 to -4 are predominantly expressed in epithelia of the kidney and gastrointestinal tract (15Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) but are also detected at low levels in discrete regions of the brain (13Ma E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The best studied of these is the amiloride-resistant isoform, NHE3. In epithelia, NHE3 resides along the apical membrane as well as in recycling endosomes and fulfills an important role in luminal Na+ and HCO 3− (re)absorption; the latter effected by H+ extrusion (21Biemesderfer D.

These kinases act on NHE3 by direct phosphorylation or through intermediary effectors and alter one or more of its biological parameters including proton affinity, cell surface abundance, and/or association with the actin cytoskeleton. In brain, NHE3 is present primarily in cerebellar Purkinje and glial cells (13Ma E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) but is also detected in chemosensitive neurons of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, where it has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of breathing rhythm (35Wiemann M.

This isoform is found in multiple regions of the brain including the dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus but not in glia-enriched structures such as the corpus callosum, suggesting that NHE5 might be neuron-specific (38Baird N.R.

Structurally, it is most closely related to NHE3 (∼50% amino acid identity) and shares similar pharmacological (39Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C1146-C1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) properties. These observations have led to the suggestion that NHE5 may be the amiloride-resistant Na+/H+ exchanger reported in hippocampal neurons (42Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from these few reports, however, little else is known about the functional properties of NHE5. Information regarding its subcellular distribution and regulation are hampered by the absence of isoform-specific antibodies and by the difficulties of isolating, maintaining, and transfecting neurons in primary culture. Additionally, the presence of multiple NHE isoforms in neurons further complicates interpretation of functional measurements. To gain further insight into the sorting and regulation of NHE5, we have stably expressed an epitope-tagged version of human NHE5 cDNA in a subline (AP-1) of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that lacks endogenous plasmalemmal NHE activity, thereby facilitating transport measurements. The usefulness of this cell line for studying membrane proteins normally resident in polarized cells is bolstered by studies showing that undifferentiated cells, such as CHO cells, contain both regulated and constitutive secretory as well as endocytic vesicles analogous to those found in more specialized cell types such as epithelia and neurons (43Cameron P.L.

In this report, we show that NHE5, like NHE3, is present both in the plasma membrane and in clathrin-associated recycling endosomes that are regulated by PI3-K when expressed in AP-1 cells. Pharmacological disruption of the actin cytoskeleton leads to increased rates of transport and cell surface-exposed NHE5, possibly by blocking internalization. Interestingly, this latter finding is in marked contrast to that observed for NHE3, which is inhibited under comparable conditions (50Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szászi K. Ramjeesingh R. Orlowski J.

Although characterized less extensively, a comparable subcellular distribution of NHE5 was also observed in transiently transfected neuroendocrine PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons in primary culture. Carrier-free 22NaCl (range of specific activity, 900–950 mCi/mg; concentration, ∼10 mCi/ml) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Glass coverslips were purchased from Thomas Scientific (Swedesboro, NJ). Nigericin, the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and rhodamine-conjugated human transferrin (r-Tfn) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

FuGENE6TM was acquired from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to α-mannosidase II was a kind gift from Drs. K. W. Moremen and M. Farquhar (University of California at San Diego). Monoclonal antibodies to a decapeptide derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) were purchased from Babco (Berkeley, CA). Cy-3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.

(St. Laurent, Canada) or Fisher and were of the highest grade available. Bicarbonate-free medium RPMI 1640 was buffered with 25 mmHEPES to pH 7.4 at 37 °C. Phosphate-buffered saline consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 8 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The isotonic Na+-rich medium used in the fluorimetric pH measurements contained 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Isotonic K+-rich medium had the same composition as Na+-rich medium, except that NaCl was replaced by KCl. All solutions were nominally bicarbonate-free and adjusted to 290 ± 10 mosm with the major salt. To allow for immunological detection of human NHE5, a triple influenza virus HA epitope YPYDVPDYA(G/A) was engineered into the first predicted exomembranous loop of NHE5. Briefly, a unique NotI restriction endonuclease site was inserted into the coding region of this loop, which altered amino acid residues at positions 36 and 37 from Leu-Phe to Arg-Gly (35ELFR to 35ERGR). ANotI-NotI DNA fragment encoding a triple HA epitope (residues encoded by NotI sites are underlined;rgrifypydvpdyagypydvpdyagsypydvpdyaaqcgr) was then inserted into the NotI site (tag inserted between amino acids Glu35 and Arg38), and the modified cDNA-protein was called NHE536HA3. All constructs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV under the control of the enhancer/ promoter region of the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus. In control experiments, these modifications had no obvious effect on the functional properties of NHE5 when expressed in AP-1 cells. The cDNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and to ensure that other random mutations were not introduced.

AP-1 cells are CHO cells devoid of endogenous plasmalemmal NHE activity (52Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were generated by chemical mutagenesis followed by selection using the H+ suicide technique (53Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several clonal cell lines were screened for NHE536HA3expression by measuring amiloride-inhibitable H+-activated22Na+ influx. The cells were maintained in complete α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, and incubated in an humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transient transfections, DNA was introduced into cells plated on coverslips by transfection using FuGENE6 as recommended by the manufacturer using 1 μg of the mito-GFP, KDEL-GFP, or Rab7-GFP constructs. For cotransfection of DynK44A and enhanced green fluorescent protein, a 5:1 ratio was used (1.5 μg of DynK44A plus 0.3 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA/coverslip). Cells were analyzed 24–48 h following transfection. The pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line was cultured in 35-mm dishes on laminin/poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For transient expression of NHE536HA3, DNA was introduced into subconfluent, undifferentiated cells by transfection using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Following transfection, cells were induced to differentiate by inclusion of 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) in the culture medium for the indicated times. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as previously described (57Wheeler D.G. Cooper E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31978-31985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi from 3–4-day-old rats were dissociated using papain (Worthington) and triturated using a glass pipette (58Huettner J.E. Baughman R.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3044-3060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 min, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105cells/35-mm dish containing laminin/poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in Neurobasal™ medium supplemented with B-27, penicillin, streptomycin, and 0.5 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen). The cells were kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Half the medium was replaced every 3 days.l-Glutamic acid (25 μm) was included for the first 4 days and cytosine arabinoside (5 μm) from days 2–5 to arrest nonneuronal cell proliferation. On day 4 after plating, cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions for primary neuron cultures. Following transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium supplemented with 20 mm KCl. Transient incubation in high K+ has been reported to enhance expression from vectors using the human cytomegalovirus promoter (57Wheeler D.G. Cooper E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31978-31985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). NHE536HA3 stable transfectants were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes and lysed with 1% Triton X-100. Total cellular protein extracts were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were briefly rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (dilution 1:5000). After extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:50,000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) recorded on x-ray film. For immunolabeling experiments, NHE536HA3 transfectants were plated and grown on glass coverslips to ∼70% confluence and then incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 3 h prior to the experiment. The cells were then untreated or treated as indicated prior to immunostaining. Various conditions were used to stain different subcellular pools of NHE536HA3. To label plasmalemmal exchangers, cells were chilled and incubated at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (1:1000) in RPMI for 1 h in the absence or presence of the indicated drug. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Paraformaldehyde was quenched for 10 min with 100 mm glycine in PBS, followed by blocking with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse second antibody for 1 h in PBS, washed extensively with PBS, and finally mounted on slides using DAKO mounting medium (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). To visualize the total cellular distribution of NHE536HA3, cells were fixed for 15 min using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, incubated with 100 mm glycine, and then permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, all at room temperature. To reduce nonspecific binding, the cells were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody for 1 h. The coverslips were next washed four or five times with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h. After incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed 3–5 times over a 15-min period with PBS and then mounted onto glass slides with DAKO mounting medium. Where specified, F-actin was labeled by incubating fixed and permeabilized cells with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. To assess internalization of the antiporter, cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:1000) at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with cold PBS. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and labeled with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody as above. Cells were visualized using the 100× objective of a Leica DM1RB fluorescence microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a Micromax cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ), operated from a Dell computer using Winview® software (Princeton Instruments). Where indicated, cells were also visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Serial optical slices (0.5 μm thick) were acquired using the LSM 510 software. Digitized images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). All images are representative of at least three separate experiments. A radioisotopic method was used to quantify surface expression of external epitope-tagged NHE5. AP-1 cells stably expressing NHE536HA3 were plated onto 12-well plates and grown to ∼70% confluence. Cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis in HEPES-buffered RPMI medium supplemented with 10% goat serum. After washing the cells six times with cold medium to remove excess unbound antibody, the cells were incubated with125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (0.4 μCi/sample) in HEPES-buffered RPMI with 10% goat serum for 45 min at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, they were washed three times with HEPES-buffered RPMI to remove unbound radiolabel and detached from the plates using PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity was counted with a 1282 Compugamma LKB counter. The radioactivity bound to cells exposed only to 125I-IgG without prior incubation with anti-HA antibody was also determined and subtracted from al"
https://openalex.org/W2060418052,"We have previously shown that the anti-apoptotic transcription factor, Brn-3a and the pro-apoptotic p53 factor have antagonistic effects on the promoter of the gene encoding the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, with p53 abolishing activation by Brn-3a. Here we demonstrate that this antagonism is also observed on the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic Bax protein with Brn-3a abolishing the ability of p53 to activate the Bax promoter and induce Bax protein expression. In contrast, Brn-3a and p53 co-operative to induce maximal activation of another p53 target gene encoding the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(CIP1/Waf1). These differential effects of Brn-3a on p53-inducible genes involved in apoptosis or growth arrest are paralleled by its effects on these processes themselves. Thus, we show that Brn-3a antagonises the anti-apoptotic effect of p53 but co-operates with p53 to induce cell cycle arrest. The potential role of Brn-3a in determining the outcome of enhanced p53 levels is discussed."

However, recent results also point at type III transporters as playing specific roles in chondroblastic and osteoblastic mineralization (9Nielsen L.B. Pedersen F.S. Pedersen L.

The mechanisms underlying the bone-forming roles of type III NaPi transporters are presently not known. Recent results, however, showed that high extracellular Pi levels can induce expression of the gene for osteopontin and that the induction is dependent on Na+-dependent Pi uptake across the plasma membrane (12Beck Jr., G.R. Zerler B. Moran E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8352-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).

The human gene SLC20A1encoding Pit1 was cloned as a receptor for gibbon ape leukemia virus (4O'Hara B. Johann S.V. Klinger H.P. Blair D.G. Rubinson H. Dunn K.J. Sass P. Vitek S.M. Robins T.

Virol. 1994; 68: 8270-8276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, substantial insight into the receptor functions of Pit1 and Pit2 for their cognate viruses has been obtained (reviewed in Refs.20Overbaugh J. Miller A.D. Eiden M.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 21Sommerfelt M.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).We speculated that the retroviral receptor function might provide a functional assay for proper processing and folding of mutant type III NaPi transporters with knocked out NaPitransport function thus allowing for identification of amino acids critical for transport function. We here show that it is possible to uncouple human Pit2 retroviral receptor function from NaPitransport function and to exploit the dual function of Pit2 as NaPi transporter and retroviral receptor for identification of amino acids critical for NaPi transport. Doing this, we identified two Pit2 glutamate residues Glu55 (E55) and Glu575 (E575) as critical for Na+-dependent Pi transport function. The glutamates are positioned in putative transmembranic domains and are conserved in type III NaPi cotransporters, in NaPi cotransporters PHO-4 from Neurospora crassa (22Versaw W.K. Metzenberg R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3884-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Pho89 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(23Martinez P. Persson B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and in a number of known and putative phosphate permeases from other species (see on-line supplemental material) strongly suggesting that they also are critical for the physiological function of these transporters.DISCUSSIONType III NaPi cotransporters, Pit1 and Pit2, exhibit dual function. Here we have shown that it is possible to knock out Pi transport function of human Pit2, leaving its retroviral receptor function undisturbed. Thus, it is possible to exploit the retroviral receptor function of Pit2, and possibly of Pit1, as a control for processing and folding of mutant proteins with knocked out transport function. Doing this, we identified two glutamate residues, E55 and E575 in human Pit2, as critical for Pit2 Pitransport function. This is the first time amino acids critical for Pi transport of a type III NaPi cotransporter have been identified. The two glutamates are both highly conserved in type III NaPi cotransporters and in a number of known and putative phosphate permeases from other species (see supplemental material) strongly suggesting that they also are critical for the physiological function of these transporters.The strength of employing retroviral receptor function as a control for correct processing and folding of mutant Pit2 proteins rather than relying on protein expression in outer membranes is illustrated with the mutant QQQ. It exhibited severely impaired transport function, which could not be explained by the protein not being present in the oocyte outer membrane, but it did, however, also show significantly impaired receptor function. It is possible that impaired receptor function can be due to involvement in retroviral entry of the amino acids analyzed; however, in this case, it is not likely, because mutant proteins like QEE, EQE, QEQ, KEE, EEK, and KEK were fully functional receptors, rather we suggest that the QQQ mutant proteins in the plasma membrane exhibit disturbed processing and/or folding.The question arises whether viral receptor function will be applicable as control when studying involvement of extracellular loop positioned amino acids in transport function of type III transporters. It is in this connection noteworthy that the amino acids so far identified as critical for retroviral receptor function of Pit1 and Pit2 orthologs are those highly variable between Pit1 and Pit2 and the NaPi transporter PHO-4 from N. crassa(19Miller D.G.

Virol. 2000; 74: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the amino acids critical for NaPi uptake are expected to be found among the residues conserved in Pit1, Pit2, and related proteins from other species as shown in the present work. In line with this, we have recently shown that a Pit1 mutant with abolished receptor functions showed no impairment in Pi transport function as analyzed inXenopus oocytes. 2M. D. Lundorf, P. Bøttger, and L. Pedersen, unpublished data. Thus, it is possible that there in general is no overlap between Pit sequences critical for Pi transport function and Pit sequences critical for receptor function.We do not know the exact role of Pit2 residues E55 and E575 in Pi transport. However, the observation that changing either E55 or E575 for lysine was sufficient to knock out Pitransport function leaving receptor function undisturbed is indeed in agreement with these residues being involved in NaPitransport function, rather than fulfilling structural roles. It is possible that E55 and E575 are involved in function-dependent conformational changes of the transporter. Our data are, however, also consistent with these glutamates being parts of a cation liganding site created by residues from different transmembrane regions as has been implicated for negatively charged residues of the melbiose permease ofEscherichia coli, the rabbit Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC-1, Na+/H+ exchangers, thec subunit of the Propionigenium modestumF1/F0-ATP synthase and Na+,K+-ATPases (29Dibrov P.

However, a Na+-liganding site may contain only one acidic residue, the other residues being, e.g. glutamine and serine (44Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this context it is worthy to note that at least some of the mutant Pit2 proteins with Gln for Glu substitutions in only one of the positions E55 or E575 (mutants QEE, EEQ, and EQQ) still supported low levels of NaPi uptake (Fig. 1 A).In recent years, a number of transport proteins have been identified that have dual function as transporters and retroviral receptors (4O'Hara B.

Willett B.J. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For murine CAT1, which is a Na+-dependent cationic amino acid transporter, it has also been shown that a glutamate residue in a putative transmembrane region was critical for the transport function but not for retroviral receptor function of the protein (49Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on the data presented here and that of Wang et al. (49Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we suggest that for proteins exhibiting dual function as transporters and retroviral receptors, their viral receptor function might in general be exploited for identification of amino acid residues critical for transport function. Using a transient transfection-infection assay, which is a fast and reliable method, for analyzing the viral receptor function as described here, indeed makes it a highly feasible approach to analyze processing/overall topology of mutant proteins by investigating their receptor function.The presented data also have implications for understanding the role of Pit2 in retroviral entry. Addition of sulfhydryl reagents to cells was previously shown to impair Pit2 Pi transport and AM-MLV infection but not virus binding (50Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the authors, these data suggest that Pi-induced conformational changes in Pit2 are involved in AM-MLV entry via Pit2 (50Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are not in direct conflict with this interpretation, but they do show that viral receptor function is not dependent on Pi transport functionper se. Indeed, comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 2reveals that there is no correlation between Na+-dependent Pi transport function and retroviral receptor function of Pit2. We suggest that further important insight into both functions of the type III NaPitransporters can be achieved by combining studies on transport and receptor functions as presented here. Inorganic phosphate (Pi)1 is essential for cellular metabolism and skeletal mineralization. Moreover, it serves as the source of phosphate for organic cell constituents, e.g. nucleotides and a variety of phosphorylated metabolic intermediates. Two proteins that show the same transport characteristics as Pi uptake across the plasma membrane in animal cells have been identified (1Kavanaugh M.P. Miller D.G. Zhang W. Law W. Kozak S.L. Kabat D.

Genet. 1998; 258: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and in a number of known and putative phosphate permeases from other species (see on-line supplemental material) strongly suggesting that they also are critical for the physiological function of these transporters. DISCUSSIONType III NaPi cotransporters, Pit1 and Pit2, exhibit dual function. Here we have shown that it is possible to knock out Pi transport function of human Pit2, leaving its retroviral receptor function undisturbed. Thus, it is possible to exploit the retroviral receptor function of Pit2, and possibly of Pit1, as a control for processing and folding of mutant proteins with knocked out transport function. Doing this, we identified two glutamate residues, E55 and E575 in human Pit2, as critical for Pit2 Pitransport function. This is the first time amino acids critical for Pi transport of a type III NaPi cotransporter have been identified. The two glutamates are both highly conserved in type III NaPi cotransporters and in a number of known and putative phosphate permeases from other species (see supplemental material) strongly suggesting that they also are critical for the physiological function of these transporters.The strength of employing retroviral receptor function as a control for correct processing and folding of mutant Pit2 proteins rather than relying on protein expression in outer membranes is illustrated with the mutant QQQ. It exhibited severely impaired transport function, which could not be explained by the protein not being present in the oocyte outer membrane, but it did, however, also show significantly impaired receptor function. It is possible that impaired receptor function can be due to involvement in retroviral entry of the amino acids analyzed; however, in this case, it is not likely, because mutant proteins like QEE, EQE, QEQ, KEE, EEK, and KEK were fully functional receptors, rather we suggest that the QQQ mutant proteins in the plasma membrane exhibit disturbed processing and/or folding.The question arises whether viral receptor function will be applicable as control when studying involvement of extracellular loop positioned amino acids in transport function of type III transporters. It is in this connection noteworthy that the amino acids so far identified as critical for retroviral receptor function of Pit1 and Pit2 orthologs are those highly variable between Pit1 and Pit2 and the NaPi transporter PHO-4 from N. crassa(19Miller D.G.

In line with this, we have recently shown that a Pit1 mutant with abolished receptor functions showed no impairment in Pi transport function as analyzed inXenopus oocytes. 2M. D. Lundorf, P. Bøttger, and L. Pedersen, unpublished data. Thus, it is possible that there in general is no overlap between Pit sequences critical for Pi transport function and Pit sequences critical for receptor function.We do not know the exact role of Pit2 residues E55 and E575 in Pi transport. However, the observation that changing either E55 or E575 for lysine was sufficient to knock out Pitransport function leaving receptor function undisturbed is indeed in agreement with these residues being involved in NaPitransport function, rather than fulfilling structural roles. It is possible that E55 and E575 are involved in function-dependent conformational changes of the transporter. Our data are, however, also consistent with these glutamates being parts of a cation liganding site created by residues from different transmembrane regions as has been implicated for negatively charged residues of the melbiose permease ofEscherichia coli, the rabbit Na+/dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC-1, Na+/H+ exchangers, thec subunit of the Propionigenium modestumF1/F0-ATP synthase and Na+,K+-ATPases (29Dibrov P.

However, a Na+-liganding site may contain only one acidic residue, the other residues being, e.g. glutamine and serine (44Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P.

In this context it is worthy to note that at least some of the mutant Pit2 proteins with Gln for Glu substitutions in only one of the positions E55 or E575 (mutants QEE, EEQ, and EQQ) still supported low levels of NaPi uptake (Fig. 1 A).In recent years, a number of transport proteins have been identified that have dual function as transporters and retroviral receptors (4O'Hara B.

For murine CAT1, which is a Na+-dependent cationic amino acid transporter, it has also been shown that a glutamate residue in a putative transmembrane region was critical for the transport function but not for retroviral receptor function of the protein (49Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on the data presented here and that of Wang et al. (49Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we suggest that for proteins exhibiting dual function as transporters and retroviral receptors, their viral receptor function might in general be exploited for identification of amino acid residues critical for transport function. Using a transient transfection-infection assay, which is a fast and reliable method, for analyzing the viral receptor function as described here, indeed makes it a highly feasible approach to analyze processing/overall topology of mutant proteins by investigating their receptor function.The presented data also have implications for understanding the role of Pit2 in retroviral entry. Addition of sulfhydryl reagents to cells was previously shown to impair Pit2 Pi transport and AM-MLV infection but not virus binding (50Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the authors, these data suggest that Pi-induced conformational changes in Pit2 are involved in AM-MLV entry via Pit2 (50Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are not in direct conflict with this interpretation, but they do show that viral receptor function is not dependent on Pi transport functionper se. Indeed, comparison of the data in Figs. 1 and 2reveals that there is no correlation between Na+-dependent Pi transport function and retroviral receptor function of Pit2. We suggest that further important insight into both functions of the type III NaPitransporters can be achieved by combining studies on transport and receptor functions as presented here. Type III NaPi cotransporters, Pit1 and Pit2, exhibit dual function. Here we have shown that it is possible to knock out Pi transport function of human Pit2, leaving its retroviral receptor function undisturbed.

https://openalex.org/W2029150849,"Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in several diseases. Various effects of TNF-alpha are mediated by the induction of a cellular state consistent with oxidative stress. Glutathione (GSH) is a major redox-buffer of eukaryotic cells and is important in the defense against oxidative stress. We hypothesized that persistent TNF-alpha secretion could induce oxidative stress through modulation of GSH metabolism. This hypothesis was examined in a transgenic mouse model with low, persistent expression of human TNF-alpha in the T cell compartment. Major findings were i) marked tissue-specific changes in GSH redox status and GSH regulating enzymes, with the most pronounced changes in liver; ii) moderate changes in GSH metabolism and up-regulation of GSH-regulating enzymes were observed in lung and kidney from transgenic mice; and iii) liver, lung and kidney from transgenic mice had decreased levels of total glutathione, whereas splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells had a marked increase in oxidized glutathione as the major change. Oxidative stress induced by persistent low-grade exposure to TNF-alpha in transgenic mice appears to involve marked organ-specific alterations in glutathione redox status and glutathione-regulating enzymes with the most pronounced changes in the liver. These mice constitute a useful model for immunodeficiency syndromes and chronic inflammatory diseases involving pathogenic interaction between TNF-alpha and oxidative stress."

The slow form shows subtle differences compared with the currently available structures of the Na+-bound fast form that carry inhibitors at the active site or exosite I. The most notable differences are the displacement of Asp-189 in the S1 specificity pocket, a downward shift of the 190–193 strand, a rearrangement of the side chain of Glu-192, and a significant shift in the position of the catalytic Ser-195 that is no longer within H-bonding distance from His-57. The structure of the slow form explains the reduced specificity toward synthetic and natural substrates and suggests a molecular basis for its anticoagulant properties.

The structure of the slow form explains the reduced specificity toward synthetic and natural substrates and suggests a molecular basis for its anticoagulant properties. Thrombin is a Na+-activated allosteric enzyme (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar) that carries out diverse and even opposing functions in the blood. The Na+-bound fast form is responsible for the procoagulant and prothrombotic roles of thrombin and shows high specificity toward fibrinogen and the platelet receptor PAR1 (2Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Na+-free slow form cleaves fibrinogen and the platelet receptors with low specificity but retains high specificity toward the anticoagulant protein C (2Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Google Scholar). The partitioning of thrombin functions between the anticoagulant slow and procoagulant fast forms is of enormous physiologic importance. In fact, under physiologic conditions of pH and temperature, the K d for Na+binding is 110 mm (3Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8800-8804Google Scholar) and approaches the concentration of NaCl in the blood (145 mm). This makes the slow and fast forms almost equally populated in vivo (2:3 ratio) and ensures that the slow ↔ fast equilibrium is optimally posed for allosteric regulation by cofactors like fibrin (procoagulant) and heparin (anticoagulant). Indeed, natural mutations that alter the slow ↔ fast equilibrium by compromising Na+ binding are associated with bleeding phenotypes (4Di Cera E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 340-350Google Scholar), and practically every mutant of thrombin reported to date with reduced Na+ binding capabilities shows compromised fibrinogen clotting and PAR1 activation but little effect on protein C activation (4Di Cera E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 340-350Google Scholar, 5Di Cera E. Cantwell A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 133-146Google Scholar). As an important validation of the allosteric nature of the enzyme and the role of Na+ binding in switching the specificity from anticoagulant (protein C) to procoagulant (fibrinogen) substrates (6Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Google Scholar), thrombin can be rationally engineered to act predominantly or exclusively on protein C by abrogating its Na+ binding capabilities (7Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M., Li, W.X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K. Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Google Scholar, 8Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar, 9Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Google Scholar). Some of these mutants, stabilized in the slow form, function as potent anticoagulants and antithrombotics in vivo (7Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M., Li, W.X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K. Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Google Scholar, 10Gruber A. Cantwell A.M., Di Cera E. Hanson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27581-27584Google Scholar). Although almost half of the thrombin molecules in vivo exist in the Na+-free slow form, structural studies have so far been confined exclusively to the Na+-bound fast form. Pioneering structures of thrombin inhibited at the active site with the substrate analog H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK) 1The abbreviations used are: PPACK, H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol. (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) or at exosite I with the hirudin C-terminal fragment hirugen (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar) have been of paramount importance in our understanding of thrombin interactions with substrates and inhibitors. These structures have been solved in the presence of Na+. The number of thrombin structures currently deposited in the Protein Data Bank exceeds 150, but not a single one of them was obtained in the absence of Na+, inhibitors, or effector molecules. The presence of inhibitors, either at the active site or exosite I, is made necessary by the tendency of thrombin to cleave itself at Arg-77a in exosite I (13Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Google Scholar). The cleavage initiates a cascade of autoproteolytic steps that culminates in the excision of the Arg-67–Arg-77a fragment of exosite I and the conversion of the native α-thrombin into γ-thrombin. Proteolytic digestion hinders stability of the sample under crystallization conditions and rapidly degrades or even impairs crystal growth. On the other hand, the reason Na+ was used in the buffer of practically all published structures of thrombin is less clear, as it is not obvious that this cation is needed for crystallization. To eliminate the need for inhibition of the enzyme by synthetic or natural inhibitors, the thrombin mutant S195A inactivated at the active site Ser-195 has been crystallized recently (14Krishnan R. Sadler J.E. Tulinsky A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 406-410Google Scholar). However, the S195A mutant of thrombin has shown appreciable catalytic activity over the long time frame required for crystallization (14Krishnan R. Sadler J.E. Tulinsky A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 406-410Google Scholar), thereby preventing its use as a viable reagent for further crystallization studies without inhibitors. In this study, we made thrombin resistant to proteolytic digestion by replacing Arg-77a in exosite I with Ala. This enabled the structure of the enzyme to be solved without inhibitors for the first time. In addition, crystals were grown in a buffer free of NaCl and monovalent cations, from which the unprecedented structure of the anticoagulant slow form of thrombin in the free state could be resolved. Site-directed mutagenesis of human α-thrombin was carried out in a HPC4-pNUT expression vector, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Expression of the R77aA mutant was carried out in baby hamster kidney cells (8Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Google Scholar, 9Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Google Scholar). The enzyme was activated with the prothrombinase complex for 30 min at 37 °C and was purified to homogeneity by FPLC using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m choline chloride, 5 mm MES, pH 6, at room temperature. The mutant was checked for incomplete activation and/or autolytic digestion by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The active site concentration was determined by titration with hirudin and was found to be 99%. The R77aA mutant was concentrated to 5.6 mg/ml in 50 mmcholine chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Crystallization was achieved at 25 °C by vapor diffusion against 14% PEG 2000-monomethyl ether, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6. Equal volumes of the protein sample and reservoir solution were mixed (1 μl each) to prepare the hanging drops. Diffraction quality crystals of R77aA (∼0.4 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm) were grown after 7 days. Crystals were cryoprotected in 23% PEG 2000-monomethyl ether, 0.1 mTris, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol prior to flash-freezing. Data were collected from a single crystal at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline SBC/19, Argonne National Laboratory) and processed using the HKL2000 package (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The crystals were orthorhombic of space group P212121 and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit. Minor crystal contacts involved Phe-34 and Tyr-76 of one molecule with Ile-14k, Glu-127, Ser-129b, Tyr-134, and Phe-240a of the other molecule in the asymmetric unit, without affecting the active site and the Na+ binding environment. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the thrombin-PPACK complex (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) and the program package CNS (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallog. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinement was carried out by simulated annealing and conjugated gradient minimization using CNS, and model building was performed with the program “O” (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used throughout refinement, with heavy restraints (500 kcal/mol/Å2) applied to the core structure and lighter weights (100 kcal/mol/Å2) applied to the loop regions and areas of relatively high disorder. Residues 1h–1c, 14l–15, 148–149e, and 246–247 could not be resolved and were not included in subsequent refinement. Water molecules were added in the final stage of the refinement process. They were subject to visual inspection to check their positioning in electron density and allowed to refine freely. Water molecules with temperature factor (B-factor) higher than 70 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement steps. Coordinates of the structure of the R77aA thrombin mutant have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1MH0). The mutant R77aA is functionally equivalent to wild-type in all interactions that do not involve exosite I (18Ayala Y.M. Rose T. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar, 19Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Google Scholar). Cleavage of H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide and protein C are the same as in wild-type and so is Na+ binding. On the other hand, cleavage of fibrinogen or PAR1 and binding of thrombomodulin are affected up to 10-fold. The properties of the R77aA mutant are therefore consistent with a modest, highly localized perturbation of exosite I that does not affect the active site and the Na+ binding environment. We therefore expected the R77aA mutant to be an excellent reagent for crystallization studies in the absence of inhibitors and Na+. The structure of R77aA was solved at 2.8-Å resolution (TableI) by molecular replacement using the coordinates of PPACK-inhibited thrombin PDB entry 1PPB (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar). The overall fold of the R77aA mutant in the Na+-free slow form is practically identical to that of the fast form inhibited with PPACK and the backbone root mean square deviation between the two structures is 0.5 Å (Fig. 1). The autolysis loop is quite disordered, as usually found in thrombin structures, and the segment 148–149e could not be traced from the electron density map. With this exception, the backbone of the R77aA mutant is intact and shows no signs of proteolytic cleavage. The crystal packing does not block the active site and puts no significant constraints on the conformation of the enzyme. This proves for the first time that thrombin can be crystallized in the absence of inhibitors, once proteolytic cleavage at Arg-77a in exosite I is prevented.Table ICrystallographic data for the thrombin mutant R77aAData collectionWavelength (Å)0.9780Space groupP212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 60.5, b = 72.9,c = 161.5Resolution range (Å)30–2.8Number of observations70,807 (16,577)Completeness90.9 (78.0)R sym(%)11.1 (45.3)I/ς(I)10.3 (1.8)RefinementResolution (Å)30.0–2.8‖F‖/ς(‖F‖)>0R cryst, R free0.219, 0.275Reflections (working set/test set)14,311/1,056Protein atoms4,470Number of solvent molecules111Rmsd bond lengthsaRoot mean square deviation (Rmsd) from ideal bond lengths and angles and Rmsd in B-factors of bonded atoms.(Å)0.008Rmsd anglesaRoot mean square deviation (Rmsd) from ideal bond lengths and angles and Rmsd in B-factors of bonded atoms.(°)1.4Rmsd B values (main chain/side chain) (Å2)1.4/1.8a Root mean square deviation (Rmsd) from ideal bond lengths and angles and Rmsd in B-factors of bonded atoms. Open table in a new tab Because Na+ or other monovalent cations were not included in the crystallization buffer, the structure of the R77aA reports the conformation of the anticoagulant slow form of thrombin. This conformation differs little from that of the fast form inhibited with PPACK (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) or hirugen (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar) at the level of the backbone traces but bears a number of subtle changes that fully explain its functional properties. At the resolution limits of the crystal, the Na+ environment shows a conspicuous paucity of solvent molecules (Fig. 2 A), especially in the channel embedding the S1 specificity site that is highly hydrated in the fast form (20Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Fütterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Google Scholar). Well defined density however exists for the backbone around the loop segments 220–224 and 186–187 that define the Na+ binding site (21Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar). These loops assume the same conformation as in the fast form, suggesting an intrinsic rigidity that is not altered by the slow → fast transition. The absence of Na+ has a direct effect on the conformation of Asp-189 at the bottom of the primary specificity pocket S1 (Fig. 2,A and B). In the fast form, a water molecule bridges the bound Na+ to the O-δ2 atom of Asp-189 (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar,21Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar), providing an important structural link between the cation and the primary arbiter of thrombin specificity. In the slow form, this linking water molecule and Na+ are replaced by water-708 (Fig.2 A) positioned 5.5 Å from the side chain of Asp-189. As a result, the side chain of Asp-189 bends toward the cavity that hosts Na+ to compensate for the room left by the missing cation (Fig. 2 A). The carboxyl O atoms of Asp-189 rotate 70° around the C-γ atom and move out of the plane of optimal interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg at P1 of either PPACK or physiologic substrates (Fig. 2 B). This movement displaces the O-δ1 atom more than 1 Å relative to the position in the fast form, presaging a significantly weaker ionic interaction between the incoming P1 residue and the primary specificity pocket. The changes observed at the level of Asp-189 are not due to the absence of inhibitor in the active site, because in the fast form inhibited at exosite I with hirugen and with the active site free, Asp-189 is oriented as in the fast form inhibited with PPACK (Fig. 2 B). The changes around Asp-189 are therefore due to the absence of Na+ and pertain to the slow form of thrombin. The β-strand supporting Asp-189 up to Glu-192 located on the south border of the entrance to the active site bears other significant structural changes in the slow form. The perturbation around Asp-189 extends to the backbone of the 190–192 segment that shifts downward >1 Å relative to the fast form (Fig. 2 A). The perturbation is accompanied by a reorientation of the side chain of Glu-192 (Fig.2 B) that moves 3 Å relative to the position in the fast form inhibited with PPACK (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar). This movement goes in the direction of the conformation of Glu-192 seen in the fast form inhibited with hirugen (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar). The downward shift of the 190–193 backbone propagates to the critical residue Ser-195 of the catalytic triad (Fig.3 A). Notably, the O-γ of Ser-195 rotates 54° and moves 1.2 Å relative to the position in the fast form inhibited with PPACK. Again, this change pertains to the slow form because it is not seen in the structure of the fast form inhibited with hirugen at exosite I (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar). The shift in the position of Ser-195 breaks the all important H-bond with His-57 (Fig.3 B), which is a structural hallmark of serine proteases (22Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar). The interatomic distance between the O-γ of Ser-195 and the N-ε2 of His-57 is 3.6 Å in the slow form as opposed to 2.9 Å in the fast form. Finally, the shift in the position of Ser-195 brings the O-γ within steric clash with the C-α of the P1 residue of incoming substrate (Fig. 3 B), again presaging a less than optimal interaction with substrate. The results reported in this study fill an important gap in our understanding of the structural components of thrombin function. The structure of the R77aA mutant reveals for the first time the conformation of the Na+-free slow form of thrombin in the absence of any inhibitor. Overall, the structure of the free slow form of thrombin shows little changes compared with the fast form bound at the active site (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) or exosite I (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar). These changes affect regions that have long been recognized to be crucial for substrate recognition and to fine-tune specificity in the entire class of serine proteases (22Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar). Residue Asp-189 defines and controls S1 specificity. The release of Na+ from its site nestled between the 220 and 186 loops (21Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Google Scholar) causes the side chain of Asp-189 to slightly bend into the cavity hosting the cation and to rearrange in a way that would weaken the electrostatic coupling with the guanidinium group of the Arg at P1 of an incoming substrate. This change, never before documented in a thrombin structure, would suffice to explain the reduced specificity of the slow form toward synthetic and natural substrates that penetrate the S1 pocket (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar, 2Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Google Scholar). The perturbation originating at Asp-189 extends to Glu-192, which shifts its side chain away from its orientation in the PPACK-inhibited fast form (11Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Google Scholar) to assume a conformation similar to that seen in the hirugen-inhibited fast form (12Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Google Scholar). The perturbation then extends to the active site Ser-195 and breaks the crucial H-bonding interaction with His-57. Some structural changes seem necessary to correct this “relaxed” conformation of Ser-195 and restore the H-bond with His-57 and perhaps are induced by the binding of substrate itself. The energetic cost of these changes should contribute to the lower substrate specificity of the slow form. The reduced electrostatic coupling due to rearrangement of Asp-189 and the energetic cost of realigning Ser-195 for optimal substrate docking and catalysis should result in weaker substrate binding and acylation in the slow form. Indeed, the kinetic signatures of the slow → fast conversion of thrombin include a drastic increase in the rate of diffusion of substrate into the active site and a significant enhancement in the rate of acylation (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Google Scholar, 23Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Google Scholar). The rearrangement of Asp-189 and the changes around Ser-195 point to a concerted conformational change that explains the reduced specificity of the slow form toward synthetic substrates, fibrinogen, and PAR1. The structure of the slow form of thrombin also provides a possible explanation for the peculiar properties of this form toward protein C. The most remarkable property of the slow form is in fact its ability to retain specificity toward the anticoagulant protein C, with or without thrombomodulin, whereas cleavage of fibrinogen and PAR1 is compromised up to 40-fold (2Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Google Scholar, 6Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Google Scholar). There is currently no structural information on thrombin bound to protein C and it is difficult to assess if protein C binds to the active site of thrombin in a way that can offset the more demanding environment of the S1 site in the slow form. On the other hand, the observed shift in the side chain of Glu-192 reveals the strategy used by thrombin to maintain specificity toward protein C in the slow form. This residue has been suggested to hinder protein C activation by providing electrostatic repulsion to residues Asp-167 and Asp-172 at the P3 and P3′ positions of protein C (24Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu-192 to Gln, the residue found in trypsin, results in a 20-fold enhancement of protein C cleavage by thrombin in the absence of thrombomodulin (24Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that thrombomodulin binding relieves the unfavorable electrostatic coupling between Glu-192 of thrombin and the P3 and P3′ residues of protein C, perhaps by reorienting the side chain of Glu-192. The results emerging from the slow form of thrombin in the absence of any inhibitor or ligand bound to the active site or exosite I suggests that this conformation of thrombin is pre-configured for optimal interaction with protein C, with the side chain of Glu-192 moved away from potential electrostatic clash with the P3 and P3′ residues of protein C. If the rearrangement of Glu-192 enhances protein C activation as seen in the E192Q mutant (24Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Google Scholar), then a compensation is created for the decrease in specificity caused by the structural changes around Asp-189 and Ser-195. This would result in an enzyme that has practically the same specificity for protein C in either the slow or fast forms (2Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Google Scholar, 6Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2034300049,"Metabolic incorporation of 3H-thymidine into cellular DNA is a widely used protocol to monitor rates of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. However, this radiochemical has also been reported to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in addition to DNA damage. Using stable isotope-labeled thymidine, we demonstrate that 3H-thymidine induces dose-dependent inhibition of the rate of DNA synthesis. This inhibition occurred within the first round of replication after addition of the radiolabeled tracer and demonstrates the cytotoxic effects of conventional doses of 3H-thymidine (typically greater than or equal to 1 microCi/ml). These results thus show that stable isotope methods are superior to radioisotopes for determining rates of DNA synthesis and cell replication. Because 3H-thymidine perturbs the very process it was employed to study, experiments using 3H-thymidine to monitor DNA synthesis and cell proliferation should be interpreted with caution."

Increased phosphorylation and relocalization to insoluble fractions were found within a few days of hind-limb suspension. High phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at Ser-59 (and to a certain extent, at Ser-45) and of Hsp27 at Ser-15 and Ser-85, along with phosphorylated, active states of p38 and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases were maintained during hind-limb suspension but promptly returned to control levels within a 5-day recovery period. These results are similar to those observed with U373 MG glioma cells exposed to proteasome inhibitors (16). However, the responses of alphaB-crystallin and Hsp27 in suspended soleus muscles did not appear with ipsilateral transection of the sciatic nerve trunk, indicating mediation by nerve activity. The fact that ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in the insoluble fractions of suspended soleus muscle further suggests participation of alphaB-crystallin and Hsp27 in quality control of proteins in disused soleus muscle, with involvement of nerve activity-dependent processes."

Because fission of clathrin-coated pits requires dynamin, we examined the mechanisms by which dopamine receptor signals promote dynamin-2 recruitment and assembly at the site of Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis. Western blotting revealed that dopamine increased the association of dynamin-2 with the plasma membrane and with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Dynamin-2 is phosphorylated at Ser848, and expression of the S848A mutant significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of dopamine.

Although the traffic in both directions appears to be different in nature, it shares several mechanistic features as follows: (a) cargo recognition, (b) mechanisms for membrane budding, (c) formation of clathrin-coated pits, and (d) fission and release of the clathrin vesicles (for review, see Refs. 1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar and 2Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The complexity of these processes could be anticipated from the fact that only a small number of molecules traffic in response to a given receptor signal and that this signal selects a specific protein to be internalized among many within the plasma membrane. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in response to dopamine (DA) in renal epithelial cells has proven to be an interesting model for studying the organization of signaling networks during endocytosis of integral membrane proteins in response to a given GPCR. The Na+,K+-ATPase is exclusively located at the basolateral domain of renal epithelial cells (3Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J.

Activation of PI 3-kinase is necessary for binding of adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) to the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and recruitment of clathrin (14Yudowski G.A. Efendiev R. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I.

Although we begin to better understand the organization of signals initiating the traffic of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules (i.e.selection of the cargo and AP-2/clathrin recruitment), the mechanisms by which DA receptor signals promote the fission of clathrin vesicles remain unclear. Release of clathrin-coated vesicles during plasma membrane endocytosis as well as the fission of vesicles derived from intracellular organelles requires the coordinated action of many proteins, among them dynamin (16Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, dynamin is a necessary factor regulating compensatory endocytosis following neurotransmitter release within the nerve terminal (18Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E. Slepnev V.I., De Camilli P. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25963-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Multiple protein-protein interactions via specific domains are likely to be responsible for the assembly of dynamin at the neck of invaginated membrane pits. For example, the PRD within its carboxyl terminus interacts with amphiphysin and enables dynamin to anchor with adaptor proteins and clathrin (19Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Moreover, its PRD binds with high affinity to SH3 domains present in phospholipase Cγ, growth factor receptor-bound protein (Grb2), and the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (20Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the PRD has been suggested to act as a positive regulator of intramolecule assembly and GTPase activity (21Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The role of GTP hydrolysis, relevant for dynamin assembly, is still a matter of debate (22Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 482-486Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Because dynamin present in the cytosol is phosphorylated, a role for post-translational modifications (such as Ser/Thr as well as Tyr phosphorylation) in regulating its assembly and location has also been proposed (23Robinson P.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrated that dynamin-1 (dyn1) is phosphorylated in a PKC-dependent manner and that dephosphorylation by calcineurin, associated with calcium-induced depolarization in the nerve terminal (26Liu J.-P. Sim A.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), represents a calcium sensor for vesicle endocytosis (18Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E. Slepnev V.I., De Camilli P. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25963-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Dynamin exists in three isoforms and several splice variants (27Sontag J.M. Fyske E.M. Uskaryov Y. Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4547-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 3: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The dyn1 isoform is localized in neuronal cells, whereas dynamin-2 (dyn2) is ubiquitously distributed, and dynamin-3 is mainly present in the testes and to a lesser extent in lung and neurons (29Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recent studies (30Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) performed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and transiently expressing different dynamin isoforms have indicated that dyn1 is mainly involved in endocytic processes originated at the apical domain of the cell, whereas dyn2 is responsible for endocytosis occurring at the basolateral domain of the cell. These observations suggest a role for the dyn2 isoform during Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis, not only for being an isoform present in the kidney epithelial cells but also for being responsible for basolateral membrane endocytosis (site where the Na+,K+-ATPase is located in renal proximal tubule cells). The purpose of this study has been to examine the relevance of dyn2 during receptor-mediated endocytosis of Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in renal epithelial cells, and to identify the possible cellular signals originated from GPCRs responsible for providing spatial and temporal organization during recruitment of dyn2 molecules to the site of Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis in these cells. The experimental protocols were carried out in isolated PCT from rat kidney (9Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in a cell line derived from opossum proximal tubules (OK cells) which expresses the DA receptor and utilizes the same signaling pathways as PCT during regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and endocytosis (31Ogimoto G. Yudowski G.A. Barker C.J. Köhler M. Katz A.I. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For consistency with previous observations, all the experiments were performed at 23 °C. Although reactions occur faster at 37 °C than at 23 °C and low temperatures may halt intracellular protein recycling and trafficking, no mechanistic differences were observed between the two conditions. Immunoprecipitation of dyn2 was performed with a polyclonal antibody (Hudy-1) that recognizes both dyn1 and dyn2 isoforms (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); monoclonal antibody against PI 3-kinase and the PP2A antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); polyclonal antibody against GFP and fluorescent-labeled antibodies (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit) with either Oregon Green, Texas Red, Alexa Fluor 546 and Alexa Fluor 633 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DA was purchased from Sigma, and Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen. The antibody against dyn2 isoform as well as the dyn2 cDNA were generously provided by Dr. M. A. Minivan (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Antibodies against phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues were purchased from Sigma. The PP2A mutants were kindly provided by Dr. B. A. Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institut, Basel, Switzerland). All other reagents were of highest grade available. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCR3.Dyn2 or pCR3.GFP-dyn2 by employing the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutants were generated by exchanging nucleotides as follows: K44A (AAG versus GCC), S848A (AGC versusGCC), S848D (AGC versus GAC), and S848E (AGCversus GAG). The GFP-tagged dyn2 construct, pCR3.GFP-dyn2, was generated by first introducing an NruI site upstream from the translation start site and subsequent in-frame insertion of GFP0 cDNA. The GFP0 cDNA, which lacks the stop codon, was obtained from pB.CMV.GFP0 (32Moede T. Leibiger B. Pour H.G. Berggren P.-O. Leibiger L.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To obtain the plasmid pCMV.GFP-Na+,K+-ATPase, we first introduced anNruI site into the 5′-untranslated region of the α-subunit of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase in pCMV ouabain (Pharmingen). The GFP0 cDNA was inserted in-frame in pCMV ouabain-NruI following digestion with NruI andClaI. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. OK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml respectively), and 2 mm glutamine in a 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. Transfection of OK cells was performed by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Expression constructs (15 μg) were transferred into 1 × 105 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection (16–24 h), cells were transferred to 24-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above at 37 °C for 6–18 h. All experiments were performed 1–2 days after transfection. Transfection efficiency was monitored by staining the cells with a GFP antibody (varies between 50 and 70%). The efficiency was comparable to the one previously reported (33Hu M.C. Fan L. Crowder L.A. Karim-Jimenez Z. Murer H. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26906-26915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) by using various dynamin DNAs reported in OK cells. Transfection with the active and dominant-negative mutants of PP2A was performed as described above. Selection of stable clones expressing the GFP-tagged rat Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was performed as described previously (34Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined in intact OK cells incubated in the presence or absence of DA. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was expressed as the rate of 86Rb+ transport per mg of protein for 1 min (34Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). OK cells or isolated PCT cells were incubated in the presence or absence of DA for different times. Thereafter, the medium was replaced by immunoprecipitation buffer (in mm, 100 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl, 2 EGTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain), 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5)), and the samples were transferred to ice. The cells were disrupted by homogenization with a motor pestle homogenizer (Kimble-Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Equal aliquots (500 μg of protein/1 ml) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of a polyclonal antibody raised against a shared epitope of dyn2 and dyn2, Hudy-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and the simultaneous addition of excess protein A-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206276) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blots were developed with an ECL Plus detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214148) Google Scholar). OK cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were transferred to acetone (−20 °C) for 5 min and then quenched with bovine serum albumin (1% in PBS) for 30 min (31Ogimoto G. Yudowski G.A. Barker C.J. Köhler M. Katz A.I. Féraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Staining with Hudy-1 or PI 3-kinase antibodies was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Thereafter, coverslips were mounted (SlowFade Light, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The confocal microscope was equipped with an Ar/Kr laser and a double dichroic mirror and a 63× lens (Leica HCX PL APO 63×/1.20–0.17, UV) lens. After incubation with or without DA for different periods, the samples were transferred to ice, centrifuged, and resuspended in homogenization buffer. Protein phosphatase activity was determined in total cell extracts or in extracts subjected to a chromatographic separation after a brief centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min). Proteins remaining in the supernatant were applied onto a MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography column and separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted by a NaCl gradient (0–0.4 m in a 20 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 10% glycerol) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min in 0.8-ml fractions. Protein phosphatase activity was assayed by measuring the release of32Pi from [32P]phosphohistone, as described previously (37Larsson O. Barker C.J. Sjöholm Å. Carlqvist H. Michell R.H. Bertorello A.M. Nilsson T. Honkanen R. Mayr G.W. Zwiller J. Berggren P.-O. Science. 1997; 278: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Calcineurin activity was assayed using the Quantizyme assay system (Biomol) by measuring the dephosphorylation of the phospho-RII regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Measurements were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in a medium (50 μl final) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 μm calmodulin, and 0.15 mm phosphopeptide RII substrate. Detection of inorganic phosphate released from RII phosphopeptide was performed using a chromogenic assay based on the Malachite Green method (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Isolation of basolateral membrane was performed in confluent OK cells and in freshly isolated PCT cells as described previously (10Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Comparison between two experimental groups was made with the nonpaired Student's t test. p< 0.05 was considered significant. We have used an antibody (Hudy-1) that recognizes a shared epitope between dyn1 and dyn2 to examine dyn2 association with basolateral membranes (BLM) prepared from rat proximal tubule (PCT) cells and from OK cells. Dyn2 immunoreactivity was observed in BLM from PCT and OK cells (Fig. 1 A); its abundance in BLM was higher in DA-treated cells (% of control, PCT cells, 167 ± 14, n = 4; OK cells, 206 ± 26,n = 3). In contrast, the abundance of GLUT-2, a glucose transporter that does not change its distribution in response to DA (9Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is located exclusively at the BLM of kidney proximal tubules, did not change significantly after DA treatment (% of control, PCT cells, 117 ± 14, n = 4; OK cells, 119 ± 13,n = 3). The importance of dyn2 for the process of Na+,K+-ATPase endocytosis was further examined in OK cells transiently expressing a dyn2 wild type or a dominant-negative mutant (K44A) of dyn2. Because decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity is a reflection of endocytosis of active molecules (11Chibalin A.V. Ogimoto G. Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1920-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of DA to regulate Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cells expressing the different forms of dyn2. The dyn2 wild type and K44A mutants were comparably expressed (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Although DA decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity in mock-transfected OK cells (only exposed to LipofectAMINE) and in OK cells overexpressing the wild type dyn2, it failed to induce a significant decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity in OK cells expressing the dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 1 B). Noteworthy, the failure of DA to decrease Na+,K+-ATPase activity and to promote endocytosis of active units cannot be attributed to deficient DA receptor signaling, as the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was phosphorylated by DA to the same extent in all groups (not shown). Basal Na+,K+-ATPase activity was not affected by overexpressing the wild type dyn2 nor by expressing any of the mutants. The long half-life of Na+,K+-ATPase (considered to be between 36 and 48 h) and the low turnover rate (activity and endocytosis) of this enzyme in cell lines (housekeeping function) may have contributed to the lack of any effect, and only when the endocytic process was accelerated by treatment with dopamine the presence of the mutants becomes rate-limiting. The state of dynamin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is considered to be of importance for its recruitment to membrane (27Sontag J.M. Fyske E.M. Uskaryov Y. Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4547-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,39Powell K.A. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially established whether DA increases protein phosphatase activity, and whether this effect was associated with inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and endocytosis of molecules. In PCT cells DA treatment was associated with an increase in total protein phosphatase activity (Fig.2 A). Incubation with DA induced a rapid (within 30 s) increase in protein phosphatase activity (maximal ∼20%), and at 2.5 min the phosphatase activity returned to control levels. PP2B activity did not increase in response to DA during this period (not shown). To examine whether PP1 or PP2A was activated by DA and to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of its activation, samples from vehicle- and DA-treated cells were applied to a MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography column and eluted by a NaCl gradient (Fig. 2 B). The highest DA-induced phosphatase activity (% of control, 50 ± 4, n = 3) was observed with the first peak of activity, which was eluted at ∼0.21m NaCl. Interestingly, this is the fraction where purified PP2A elutes under similar chromatographic conditions (40Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that okadaic acid at a concentration as low as 1 nmproduced 50% inhibition of protein phosphatase activity in this peak (Fig. 2 C), supporting the conclusion that PP2A (and not PP1) was the most likely phosphatase present in the DA-stimulated peak. In Western blot analysis we found that PP2A was indeed present in lysates of renal tubule cells and OK cells (Fig. 2 D). We next examined whether activation of PP2A was functionally associated with down-regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The experiments were carried out in OK cells transiently expressing either the wild type- or a dominant-negative mutant Leu199→ Pro (L199P) form of PP2A (41Evan D.R.H. Myles T. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24038-24046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DA significantly inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity in non-transfected cells, LipofectAMINE-treated cells, and in cells transfected with the wild type PP2A, whereas it failed to induce a significant inhibition of enzyme activity in OK cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of PP2A (Fig. 2 E). Moreover, by using the same protocol, we observed that DA dephosphorylates dyn2 in non-transfected cells, and in cells transfected with the wild type PP2A, it failed to do so in OK cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of PP2A (Fig. 2 F). Western blot analysis performed with an antibody raised against phosphorylated serine residues of immunoprecipitated dyn2 revealed that DA reduces the state of phosphorylation (Fig.3 A), whereas a similar procedure using an anti-phosphorylated threonine antibody did not demonstrate any immunoreactivity (not shown). The effect of DA was present in both OK cells and in cells isolated from rat renal proximal tubules, and it occurred as early as within 1 min after incubation with DA (Fig. 3 B). Further support for constitutive serine phosphorylation of the dyn2 molecules was obtained under non-stimulated conditions in immunoprecipitates of OK cells obtained with an antibody against phosphorylated serine residues (Fig. 3 C), where a protein with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa was recognized by a specific dyn2 antibody. Although dyn1 is a good substrate for protein kinases (24Liu J.-P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also identified a highly consensus site (Ser848) for protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation in the dyn2 molecule. To evaluate whether there was a causal relationship between dyn2 dephosphorylation and reduction in Na+,K+-ATPase activity elicited by DA, several mutations were introduced in the dyn2 molecule in which the Ser848 was replaced by either alanine (S848A) or by negatively charged residues (S848E and S848D). Expression of these dynamin cDNAs was comparable in each experiment (Fig.3 D, upper panel, and Fig. 3 F,upper panel). Substitution of Ser848 by Ala significantly reduced dyn2 phosphorylation and consequently the response to DA (Fig. 3 D) in cells transiently transfected with this mutant. Na+,K+-ATPase activity in response to DA was also studied in OK cells transiently expressing these mutants. Expression of the wild t"

The concentration of uncoupling protein (UCP)1 and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) located on the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively, were measured. Administration of leptin prevented the normal decline in colonic temperature over the first few hours and days after birth. It subsequently accelerated the loss of both mRNA and protein for UCP1 but had no effect on VDAC abundance. At seven days of age, colonic temperature was correlated strongly with both mRNA abundance and thermogenic potential of UCP1 in leptin-treated but not control lambs, indicating more effective use of UCP1 for heat production following leptin administration. Leptin had no effect on weight gain or adipose tissue deposition; at one day of age only, leptin mRNA was correlated positively with adipose tissue weight. In conclusion, leptin administration to neonatal lambs improves thermoregulation and promotes the loss of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2154464726,"We previously introduced a method called steroid-mediated gene delivery (SMGD), which uses steroid receptors as shuttles to facilitate the nuclear uptake of transfected DNA. Here, we describe a SMGD strategy with peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that allowed linkage of a steroid molecule to a defined position in a plasmid without disturbing its gene expression. We synthesized and tested several bifunctional steroid derivatives [patent in process of nationalization] and finally selected the compound named DEX-bisPNA, a molecule consisting of a dexamethasone moiety linked to a PNA clamp (bisPNA) through a 30-atom chemical spacer. Dex-bisPNA binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as well as to reporter plasmids containing the corresponding PNA binding sites, translocates the GR from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, and increases the delivery of plasmid to the nucleus, resulting in enhanced GR-dependent expression of the reporter gene. The SMGD effect was more pronounced in growth-arrested cells than in proliferating cells. The specificity for the GR was shown by the reversion of the SMGD effect in the presence of dexamethasone as well as an enhanced expression in GR-positive cells but not in GR-negative cells. Thus, SMGD with PNA is a promising strategy for nonviral gene delivery into target tissues expressing specific steroid receptors."

Here we show the molecular mechanism of RAG2 degradation. The RAG2 protein is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. RAG2 translocation is mediated by the Thr-490 phosphorylation of RAG2. Inhibition of this phosphorylation by p27Kip1 stabilizes the RAG2 protein in the nucleus. These results suggest that RAG2 sequestration in the cytoplasm and its subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system upon entering the S phase is an integral part of G0/G1-specific V(D)J recombination.

V(D)J recombination is initiated by the introduction of site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) between two recombining gene segments and their flanking recombination signal sequences (RSSs).

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar): the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the Ku70/80 dimer, XRCC4, and DNA Ligase IV. More proteins may be involved in V(D)J recombination to ensure the strict regulation of this system. Several lines of evidence suggest that V(D)J recombination is restricted to the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle and that periodic accumulation and destruction of the RAG2 protein regulate cell-cycle-dependent V(D)J recombination (8Desiderio S. Lin W.C. Li Z. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar). According to Lee and Desiderio, Thr-490 of RAG2 is phosphorylated by cyclin A/CDK2 when the cells are at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle, thereby triggering the rapid degradation of RAG2 (9Lee J. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism of the degradation process remains elusive. The ubiquitin/proteasome system plays a major role in target-specific protein degradation and in the regulation of protein expression levels (10Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates proceeds via a three-step cascade. First, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) activates ubiquitin, which is then transferred by a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to a ubiquitin ligase (E3) with which the substrate protein is associated. Finally, E3 catalyzes the conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate protein. Proteins polyubiquitinated by these enzymes are subjected to degradation by the 26S proteasome. Recent reports have suggested that many proteins, such as p53, IκB, β-catenin, and p27Kip1, are degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (10Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat.

Desiderio S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p27Kip1 and RAG2 have similar sequences in the CDK-phosphorylation sites: QT187PKKGPL in p27Kip1 and QT490PKRNPPL in RAG2. This CDK-phosphorylation site has a critical role in p27Kip1 degradation (13Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 14Malek N.P. Sundberg H. McGrew S. Nakayama K. Kyriakidis T.R. Roberts J.M.

At the G1-S transition of the cell cycle, CDK2 phosphorylates Thr-187 of p27Kip1. The phosphorylated p27Kip1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, associated with the SCF (Skp1/cullin-1/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex through this CDK-phosphorylation site, then ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome, which promotes the cell-cycle transition from G1 to S. We speculated that a similar scenario may occur for RAG2 degradation. Thus, we examined the ubiquitination of the RAG2 protein and the correlation between RAG2 subcellular localization and its stability. To generate RAG2 expression vectors (Fig.1 A), mouse RAG2 cDNA fragments were amplified by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method from the mouse thymus RNA using specific primers. To amplify wild-type RAG2 cDNA fragments, primers 5′-CAACTCGAGATGTCCCTGCAGATGGTAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAATCAAACAGTCTTCTAAGG-3′ were used. An amplified fragment was introduced into a pCR-Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After digestion of this plasmid with XhoI and EcoRV, the RAG2 cDNA fragment (XhoI-EcoRV) was inserted into the SalI-SmaI site of the pCAT7-neo vector (16Morimura T. Coitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36523-36531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to generate pT7-RAG2 containing the T7-tag sequence upstream of the RAG2 sequence. To generate pEGFP-RAG2, the same RAG2 cDNA fragment was also introduced into theSalI-SmaI site of the pCAEGFP vector in which the T7-tag sequence of pCAT7-neo vector (16Morimura T. Coitsuka R. Zhang Y. Saito I. Reth M. Kitamura D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36523-36531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) had been replaced with the EGFP sequence of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). To generate pT7–388 and pEGFP-388, primers 5′-CAACTCGAGATGTCCCTGCAGATGGTAAC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGATCCTTAAGCACTGAAACAAAATTCCTC-3′ were used. DNA fragments encoding deletion mutant 388 were amplified with these primers with RT-PCR, and the subsequent procedure was same as that of the wild-type RAG2 vectors. To generate pT7-T490A and pEGFP-T490A vectors, a point mutation at codon 490 (ACT → GCT) of the RAG2 cDNA of the wild-type RAG2 vectors (above) was introduced by the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers 5′-GCAAGAGCATTGCAAGCTCCCAAAAGAAACC-3′and 5′-GGTTTCTTTTGGGAGCTTGCAATGCTCTTGC-3′ were used for this purpose. Human XRCC4 cDNA fragment was prepared from pMycXR (1–334) (Myc-tagged full length human XRCC4 expression vector, Ref. 17Mizuta R. Cheng H.L. Gao Y. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by digestion with XhoI and NotI. The 3′-NotI site was converted to a blunt end by Klenow treatment, and this fragment (XhoI-blunt) was introduced into the SalI-SmaI site of the pCAT7-neo vector to generate pT7-XRCC4. The histidine-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmid (pMT107) and HA-tagged p27Kip1 expression plasmid (pHA-p27Kip1) were generous gift from D. Bohmann (18Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and J. Kato (15Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), respectively. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences or nuclear exporting signal (NES) sequences (19Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) were introduced into pCAT7-based RAG2 expression vectors. pT7-NLS-RAG2 was constructed to express RAG2-NLS which had the NLS of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK, Ref. 19Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of wild-type RAG2. First, pT7-RAG2 plasmid was digested withXhoI and HindIII, and the 3′-HindIII site was converted to a blunt end by Klenow treatment to generate theXhoI-blunt site of pT7-RAG2 vector. Second, an annealed DNA fragment of two synthesized oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCTAAGAGGCCTGCGGCTACCAAAAAAGCAGGCCAGGCAAAGAAGAAGAAAGGATCCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTTTCTTCTTCTTTGCCTGGCCTGCTTTTTTGGTAGCCGCAGG CCTCTTAGC-3′ was introduced into the XhoI-blunt site of pT7-RAG2 to generate pT7-NLS-RAG2. pT7-NES-T490A was constructed to express T490A-NES, which had the NES of PKI (LALKLAGLDI, Ref. 19Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of T490A. An annealed DNA fragment of two synthesized oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCTTTAGCCTTAAAACTAGCAGGCCTTGATATCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGATATCAAGGCCTGCTAGTTTTAAGGCTAAAGC-3′ was introduced into the XhoI-HindIII site of pT7-T490A to generate pT7-NES-T490A, T7-tagged mouse RAG2 or XRCC4 expression vectors (1 μg, Fig.1 A) and the histidine-tagged ubiquitin expression vector (pMT107, 3 μg) were transfected into COS7 cells (2×106 cells) using Trans IT transfection reagent (Pan Vera) and 36 h later, half of the cells were treated with lactacystin (10 μm), a specific inhibitor for the 26S proteasome (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), for 12 h. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and ubiquitinated proteins were purified with Ni2+-charged resin (Fig. 1 B). Briefly, cells were solved in 1 ml of guanidine HCl solution (0.5 m NaCl, 6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and, after sonication, protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Polyubiquitinated proteins were purified from 700 μg of crude cell lysates with 20 μl of slurry of the Ni2+-charged resin of HISTAGcatcher (CytoSignal) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Each 10 μg of the crude lysates was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and used for “Input.” Proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis as indicated below. Unless otherwise noted, transfected cells were lysed in 60 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of crude lysate (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was probed with the anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen), the anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) or the anti-HA tag antibody (12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim). Each pCAT7-based vector was transfected into COS7 cells. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, stained with the anti-mouse RAG2 antibody (Pharmingen), and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). COS7 cells plated on glass-bottomed plates (Mak Tek Corporation) were transiently transfected with EGFP-fused constructs with or without pHA-p27Kip1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, living cells were examined under the confocal microscope (Leica TCS-NT SP). To show that the RAG2 protein is a substrate for ubiquitination, we adopted a highly sensitive in vivo ubiquitination assay system originally developed by Treier et al. (Fig.1 B) (18Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We generated three T7 epitope-tagged RAG2 vectors to express wild-type RAG2 (pT7-RAG2), a point mutant where Thr-490 was replaced by alanine (pT7-T490A) and a deletion mutant that contained the N-terminal 388-amino acid region (pT7–388) (Fig. 1 A). The core functional domain of RAG2 for V(D)J recombination has been defined as an N-terminal 1∼383-amino acid region (21Kirch S.A. Rathbun G.A. Oettinger M.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We confirmed the recombination activity of the three constructs (data not shown). Each construct, together with the histidine-tagged ubiquitin expression vector (pMT107), was transfected into COS7 cells (18Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The T7-tagged XRCC4 expression construct (pT7-XRCC4) was used as a control. Half of the cells were treated with lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitinated proteins were precipitated using Ni2+-charged resin and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-T7 antibody (α-T7). As shown in Fig. 1 C, RAG2 proteins were clearly polyubiquitinated, as evidenced by the blockade of proteasome-mediated degradation with lactacystin (lanes 1 and 2). Ubiquitinated XRCC4 was not detected even after lactacystin treatment (lanes 3 and 4). In crude cell lysates, the expression level of RAG2, but not that of XRCC4, was increased by blocking the proteasome-mediated degradation with lactacystin treatment (Fig. 1 C, INPUT, lanes 1–4). These results clearly indicate that RAG2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Lee and Desiderio reported that Thr-490 phosphorylation targets the RAG2 protein for rapid degradation, relieving the T490A mutant of this destruction (9Lee J. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of mutant RAG2 proteins, T490A and 388 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5–10). As expected, the T490A protein was more abundant compared with the RAG2 protein in the absence of lactacystin (INPUT, lanes 8 and 6). After lactacystin treatment, the expression level of T490A increased and the ubiquitination became visible (lane 7) but was weaker than that of wild-type RAG2 (comparelanes 5 and 7). This result suggests that the phosphorylation of Thr-490 is not essential for but facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of the RAG2 protein. Unexpectedly, a deletion of the C-terminal 140-amino acid region including the Thr-490 rendered the RAG2 protein more sensitive to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (lanes 9 and 10; compare withlanes 5 and 6). These data suggest that the following. 1) Sites for the ubiquitination and interaction with a ubiquitin ligase are located in the N-terminal 1∼388-amino acid region of RAG2. 2) The C-terminal 140-amino acid region inhibits ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. 3) The phosphorylation of Thr-490 abrogates such inhibitory function of the C-terminal 140-amino acid region. As mentioned before, upon phosphorylation, p27Kip1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome system (13Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 15Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RAG2 degradation correlates with its subcellular localization similar to p27Kip1, we examined the localization of three GFP fusion proteins, EGFP-RAG2, EGFP-T490A, and EGFP-388, transiently expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1 D). Although it is believed that RAG2 resides in the nucleus, EGFP-RAG2 is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus at various ratios (Fig.1 D, upper two panels, and see Fig. 3 B,upper left panel). On the other hand, the T490A mutant is located exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D, lower left panel), whereas the 388 mutant is predominantly located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 D, lower right panel). RAG2 is physiologically co-expressed with RAG1 in lymphocyte precursors (1Gellert M. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 39-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hesslein D.G. Schatz D.G. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 78: 169-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, its localization may be affected by the RAG1 protein. However, the co-expression of the RAG1 protein did not alter the localization pattern for the RAG2 protein in our system (data not shown). Thus, it is presumable that RAG2 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm independent of RAG1, that the C-terminal 140-amino acid region is inhibitory to the cytoplasmic localization of RAG2, and that the phosphorylation of the Thr-490 in this region abrogates this inhibition. Together with the result shown in Fig. 1 C, the cytoplasmic localization of RAG2 by Thr-490 phosphorylation or the C-terminal deletion accelerates its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. To confirm the correlation between the subcellular localization and the stability of the RAG2 protein (Fig.2), we first examined the stability of the RAG2 protein that is restricted to the nucleus or the cytoplasm by fusing a NLS or a NES to the RAG2 protein, respectively. The expression constructs encoding the wild-type RAG2, NLS-fused RAG2, T490A mutant, and NES-fused T490A mutant were transfected into COS7 cells, and their subcellular localization was confirmed by immunofluorescent detection using the anti-RAG2 antibody (Fig.2 A). We next examined the amount of RAG2 protein in whole-cell lysates by Western blot analysis. The NLS-fused RAG2 protein was expressed in the cells at a higher level than the wild-type RAG2 protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, the expression level of the T490A protein exclusively localized in the nucleus was markedly diminished by the fusion to NES (lanes 3 and 4). The expression level of these proteins was equivalent to that of the wild-type RAG2 protein in the cells treated with lactacystin (lanes 5–8, top). Lactacystin treatment did not affect the expression level of co-expressed EGFP (lanes 5–8, bottom). Thus, the cytoplasmic RAG2 is less stable than the nuclear RAG2 due to its proteasome-dependent degradation. We next examined the localization of RAG2 when it was stabilized by co-expression with p27Kip1. Co-expression of p27Kip1 resulted in the increase of the EGFP-RAG2 expression level as reported previously (9Lee J. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A) and, strikingly, in the exclusive localization of the EGFP-RAG2 protein in the nucleus (Fig.3 B, upper panels) without affecting the localization of EGFP (lower panels). Thus, p27Kip1 induces the localization of RAG2 in the nucleus, leading to the stabilization of the RAG2 protein. Taken together, we conclude that the nuclear localization of the RAG2 protein increases its stability and that the cytoplasmic sequestration accelerates its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. RAG2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm appears to be mediated by Thr-490 phosphorylation. Thus, the p27Kip1-inhibition of this cyclin A/CDK2-mediated Thr-490 phosphorylation stabilizes the RAG2 protein in the nucleus. V(D)J recombination, the process by which lymphocyte antigen receptor genes are assembled, is initiated by double-stranded DNA cleavage with RAG1/RAG2 proteins and is completed by repairing the cleaved DNA with the general repair machinery. This entire process is restricted to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The onset of V(D)J recombination correlates well with the RAG2 expression level, namely, the RAG2 protein is accumulated at G0/G1 and its expression level decreases rapidly at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. Thus, the disappearance of the RAG2 protein turns off V(D)J recombination. The RAG2 expression level is determined by the post-transcriptional mechanism because the expression level of RAG2 mRNA is constant through the entire cell cycle (8Desiderio S. Lin W.C. Li Z. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar), but the precise molecular mechanism of RAG2 degradation has not been fully clarified. Here we showed that two novel mechanisms are involved in RAG2 degradation: RAG2 protein translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and the ubiquitination of the RAG2 protein. Based on previous studies (8Desiderio S. Lin W.C. Li Z. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 45-59PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lee J. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and our own, we propose a model for the RAG2 degradation system (Fig. 4). After completion of V(D)J recombination, the cell cycle goes into the S phase. At the G1-S transition, p27Kip1 is degraded, and subsequently cyclin A/CDK2 becomes active and phosphorylates the Thr-490 of RAG2. This phosphorylation abates the C-terminal regulatory domain function, which is inhibitory for the cytoplasmic localization of RAG2, and promotes RAG2 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The ubiquitination of RAG2 may occur in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but the active degradation is mainly executed in the cytoplasm by the 26S proteasome. The reason for the difference in RAG2 degradation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is presently unclear. Exactly how Thr-490 phosphorylation promotes the cytoplasmic localization of RAG2 and what ubiquitin ligase could mediate the ubiquitination of RAG2 remain to be determined. RAG2 and p27Kip1 are regulated in a similar manner, that is, by phosphorylation-dependent translocation and degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. In the case of p27Kip1, the Jab1 protein associates with the phosphorylated p27Kip1 and transports p27kip1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (15Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). RAG2 localization, however, was not affected by the co-expression of the Jab1 protein (data not shown). Thus, Rag2 translocation may be induced by other proteins that bind to various sites including the phosphorylated Thr-490. V(D)J recombination, the process in which lymphocytes acquire immune diversity, is potentially deleterious, because the process involves DNA cleavage. This rapid cytoplasmic sequestration/degradation of RAG2 at the G1-S transition before the onset of genomic DNA replication would ensure that the S phase does not initiate with RAG-mediated DSBs being present in the DNA. Moreover, G0/G1-specific V(D)J recombination is also consistent with the fact that the non-homologous end-joining pathway that is responsible for the repair of DSB in V(D)J recombination is most active during G0/G1 (23Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell cycle regulation of V(D)J recombination serves to protect cells against deleterious effects of DNA cleavage. Here we show the molecular mechanism of the rapid sequestration/degradation of the RAG2 protein. A similar mechanism might be employed in other proteins whose nuclear localization may be harmful.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays a pivotal role in response to hypoxia by transcriptionally activating target genes involving oxygen uptake, transport, delivery, and consumption. HIF-1α activity is regulated primarily through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, which targets the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1α. In particular, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds to the ODD upon hydroxylation of HIF-1α Pro-564. Here, we show that in vivo VHL interacts with the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal ODD independently, supporting the notion of functional redundancy within the ODD. Moreover, we demonstrate that Leu-574 of HIF-1α is essential for VHL binding to the C-terminal ODD. Despite the presence of Pro-564, deletion or mutation of Leu-574 resulted in a loss of VHL binding and a gain of protein stability. Furthermore, the identification of Leu-574 redefines the N-terminal activation domain of HIF-1α to be constitutively active.

The degradation is controlled by a unique oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) consisting of ∼200 amino acids within HIF-1α (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Deletion of the entire ODD gave rise to a stable HIF-1α, capable of heterodimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation in cell culture systems. Consistently, the ODD-deleted HIF-1α (but not the full-length), when transgenically expressed in the mouse epidermis, activated HIF-1 target genes, thereby resulting in epidermal hypervascularity (14Elson D.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2520-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), providing compelling evidence that a stable HIF-1α, irrespective of hypoxic signal, is sufficient for transcriptional activation in animal models. In search of the mechanisms underlying HIF-1α degradation, Maxwellet al. (15Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J.

Inactivation of the VHL gene is linked to the development of the VHL disease, a hereditary human cancer syndrome characterized by the predisposition to develop highly angiogenic tumors (16Kaelin Jr., W.G. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). VHL protein is in a multiprotein complex with elongin B, elongin C, and Cul2, which share sequence similarity with the Skp1 and Cdc53 components of the SCF ubiquitin ligase (17Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 18Kibel A. Iliopoulos O.

All these observations have led to the hypothesis that the VHL complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1α polyubiquitination (24Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krzeska M. Conaway R.C.

The proline hydroxylation, catalyzed by a conserved family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases, relies on molecular oxygen and iron (31Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar), indicating these enzymes as oxygen sensors. Moreover, recent studies of HIF1α-VHL complexes provide a structural basis for VHL recognition of hydroxyproline in HIF-1α (33Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 34Min J.H. Yang H. Ivan M. Gertler F. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), suggesting a central role for proline hydroxylation in oxygen signaling. Interestingly, Pro-402 of HIF-1α is also subjected to hydroxylation and, in turn, targeted by the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase for HIF-1α ubiquitination (35Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of a crucial role for Pro-564 in controlling HIF-1α degradation, our earlier study showed that partial deletion of the ODD containing Pro-564 failed to completely stabilize HIF-1α (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), indicating functional redundancy within the ODD. In this study, we show that VHL interacts independently with the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal ODD, that Pro-564 is necessary but not sufficient for VHL binding, and that Leu-574 is required for VHL binding and VHL-mediated degradation. HIF-1α expression plasmids p(HA)HIF1α, p(HA)HIF1α(401Δ603), and p(HA)HIF1α(497Δ601) were described previously (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Gal4-HIF1α fusions were constructed by the standard PCR cloning method using specifically designed PCR primers that contain appropriate codons. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). p(HA)VHL was a gift of William G. Kaelin, Jr. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and pEYFP-Nuc was purchased from Clontech. Hep3B and 293 cells were cultured in 12- and 6-well plates, respectively, and transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (36Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A typical transfection for luciferase assays contains 0.25 μg of pGal4-luc, 0.1 μg of effector plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pEYFP-Nuc for normalizing transfection efficiency. Fluorescence and luciferase activities were sequentially scanned through a microplate fluorescence reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek) in which the Bright-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was used for luciferase reaction. For the determination of protein levels, 1 μg of Gal4-HIF1α fusions were transfected into 293 cells. At 24–40 h after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholine, and 0.1% SDS). Gal4 fusions were precipitated with polyclonal anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were further probed with monoclonal anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Western blot. All of the experiments were repeated three to four times. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described previously (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). A specific antibody (0.5–1 μl) was added to the DNA binding reaction. Anti-VHL antibody was a gift of William G. Kaelin, Jr., and anti-Gal4 and anti-hemagglutinin antibodies were acquired as described previously (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Both VHL and Gal4 fusions were in vitro-translated as described previously (36Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). [35S]methionine-labeled Gal4 fusions were mixed with unlabeled VHL in NETN buffer (36Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) containing anti-VHL antibody. The reaction mixture was washed five times with NETN buffer before SDS-PAGE. Direct involvement of the VHL protein in HIF-1α degradation was first demonstrated by the addition of anti-VHL antibody (15Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar), which caused a supershift of the slower (but not the faster) migrating HIF-1 DNA binding activity (Fig.1 a, lane 4,asterisks), whereas addition of anti-HIF1α antibody resulted in a complete shift of both HIF-1 binding activities (lane 3). Previously, we proposed functional redundancy within the ODD because each part of the ODD independently confers degradation (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). In particular, removal of the C-terminal ODD that harbors Pro-564 led only to a more stable but not completely stable HIF-1α, suggesting additional mechanisms controlling HIF-1α degradation. To test whether VHL interacts with the N-terminal ODD, we transfected 293 cells with a plasmid expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged HIF-1α that was wild-type, ODD entirely deleted from amino acids 401–603 (401Δ603), or ODD C-terminally deleted from amino acids 497–601 (497Δ601), as illustrated in Fig. 1 b. VHL binding activity of the transfected HIF-1α was analyzed in supershift assays. As expected, the addition of anti-VHL antibody shifted the slower migrating wild-type HIF-1 DNA binding activity (Fig.1 c, lane 7). To differentiate the transfected HIF-1α from the endogenous, we also included in the assay an anti-HA antibody, which only supershifted the DNA binding complex resulting from transfected HIF-1α but retained the weak endogenous binding activity (compare lane 6 and lane 8). When ODD-deleted HIF-1α was used, a constitutive HIF-1 binding pattern was observed (lanes 9 and 10), as shown in our previous reports (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 37Huang L.E. Willmore W.G., Gu, J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, no supershift was observed with anti-VHL antibody (lane 11), whereas anti-HA antibody slowed the binding mobility (lane 12). This result is in agreement with the observation that VHL targets the ODD for HIF-1α degradation. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal ODD retained a weaker yet noticeable supershift by anti-VHL (lane 15), indicative of VHL binding to the N-terminal ODD. In keeping with this notion, HIF-1α(497Δ601) gave rise to an inducible rather than a constitutive binding pattern (compare lane 13 and lane 14). This finding is also in good agreement with a recent report that hydroxylation of HIF-1α Pro-402 independently confers VHL binding (35Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Thus, our results provide in vivo evidence that VHL interacts with the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal ODD for HIF-1α degradation. To understand the structure and function of the ODD, we fused a Gal4 DNA-binding domain to various ODD mutants derived from serial N-terminal and C-terminal deletions, as schematized in Fig.2 a. Transfection of these mutants into 293 cells revealed that deletion of the N-terminal ODD resulted in increasing expression of Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603) under normoxia (Fig. 2 b, lanes 3 and 5), consistent with the notion of VHL binding to the N terminus. However, deletion of amino acids 574–603 from the C terminus significantly elevated normoxic expression levels of Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573) and Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) (lanes 7 and 9), thereby abrogating hypoxic induction. In addition, Gal4-HIF1α-(574–603) exhibited strong constitutive expression (data not shown). Interestingly, both Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573) and Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) contain Pro-564, which is critical for VHL binding through hydroxylation (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M.

Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest that in addition to Pro-564, the downstream sequence also contributes to oxygen-dependent proteolysis. Because part of the ODD overlaps an N-terminal activation domain (NAD) of HIF-1α (38Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 39Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the functional role of these Gal4-HIF1α fusions in a Gal4 luciferase reporter system to establish a link between HIF-1α degradation and its transcriptional activity. Consistent with the protein levels mentioned previously, removal of the N-terminal ODD (Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603)) slightly increased normoxic but modestly decreased hypoxic transcriptional activity (Fig.2 c). Further deletion from the N terminus (Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603)) resulted in significant loss of luciferase reporter activity, although the protein was more stable, implying the requirement of amino acids 498–530 for transcriptional activity. Interestingly, Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573), which was missing amino acids 574–603 but stable, exhibited a striking 2.4-fold increase in transcription under normoxia in comparison with Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603), indicative of inherent transcriptional activity. However, both Gal4-HIF1α-(498–530) (data not shown) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573) alone showed much weaker activity. Therefore, we conclude that the core NAD lies within amino acids 498–573 of HIF-1α and is constitutively active. To investigate the molecular basis for the constitutive activity of HIF-1α, we performed supershift assays to analyze in vivoVHL binding activity. As expected, transfection with Gal4-HIF1α-(401–603) exhibited hypoxic induction of Gal4 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2) and VHL binding activity (lane 5). The Gal4 binding activity was confirmed by the addition of excessive unlabeled Gal4 oligonucleotides and anti-Gal4 antibody, respectively, resulting in abrogation or supershift of the binding activity (lanes 3and 4). Likewise, a supershift by anti-VHL antibody was observed with Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603) (lanes 8 and 12). However, we could not detect such a mobility shift with Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573) (lanes 10 and 14) when the C terminus of ODD (amino acids 574–603) was deleted. Thus, these results suggest that stabilization of Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573) was due to the loss of VHL binding, providing further evidence that, in addition to Pro-564, the downstream sequence is required for in vivo VHL binding. To further test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation ofin vitro-translated Gal4-ODD fusions with VHL (26Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Consistently, Gal4-HIF1α-(401–603), Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603), and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603) were co-precipitated by anti-VHL antibody (Fig.4 a, lower panel,lanes 1–3). By contrast, Gal4 fusions lacking amino acids 574–603 (Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–573)) showed no interaction with VHL (lanes 5 and 6). In addition, Gal4-HIF1α-(574–603) alone did not bind to VHL (lane 4), although all the constructs were translated in vitro at similar levels (upper panel). Taken together, these results indicate the requirement of HIF-1α amino acids 530–603 for VHL binding. The interaction between VHL and Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603) was further validated in Fig. 4 b, in which no interaction was observed when in vitro-translated VHL or anti-VHL antibody was omitted (Fig. 4 b, lanes 8 and 9). Furthermore, because the VHL protein used contains an HA tag, the addition of anti-HA antibody also co-precipitated Gal4-HIF1α-(530–603) (lane 10). To ensure the critical role of HIF-1α Pro-564 for VHL binding in our systems, we made an alanine substitution and, as expected, observed no VHL interaction (Fig. 4 c, lane 13). In contrast, alanine substitutions of other proline residues within the ODD (Pro-513, Pro-516, and Pro-567) produced no effect, suggesting the specific requirement of Pro-564 for VHL binding, consistent with previous reports (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 29Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that VHL binding requires not only Pro-564 of HIF-1α but also the downstream sequence. To further examine the molecular determinants of VHL binding, we asked whether Leu-574 could be involved because this residue is highly conserved and included in all the studies of HIF-1α oligopeptide binding to VHL (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 29Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). To that end, Gal4-HIF1α-(498–574) was constructed and analyzed for in vitro VHL binding. Remarkably, addition of a single leucine residue to Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) gained VHL binding (Fig.5 a, lanes 1 and2), whereas mutation of Leu-574 to serine abolished the binding (lane 3), indicating an essential role for Leu-574 in VHL binding. To corroborate the importance of Leu-574, we also mutated Leu-574 in Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) and asked whether substitution with serine would affect VHL binding. Consistently, the mutation resulted in the loss of VHL binding (compare lane 4and lane 5). Thus, these results provide compelling evidence that Leu-574 is critically involved in VHL binding. To address the role of Leu-574 in protein stability, we examined expression levels of these constructs by Western blot analysis. In comparison with Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573), Gal4-HIF1α-(498–574) exhibited an ∼3-fold decrease in protein levels under normoxia (Fig.5 b, compare lane 1 and lane 3), supporting the role of Leu-574 in VHL-mediated degradation. Consistently, mutation of Leu-574 prevented the degradation process, resulting in a stable Gal4-HIF1α-(498–574) (compare lane 3 and lane 5). Furthermore, mutation of Leu-574 gave rise to a 7-fold increase in the expression level of Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) (compare lane 7 and lane 9). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Leu-574 plays a critical role in the VHL degradation pathway, although additional residues between amino acids 575–603 may also contribute oxygen-dependent degradation of the C-terminal ODD. As shown above, the core NAD lies within amino acids 498–573 of HIF-1α. To examine the effect of Leu-574 on transcriptional activity, we employed the aforementioned Gal4 luciferase reporter system. As expected, the addition of Leu-574 significantly lowered the luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 5 c) by 6.5-fold under normoxia. In contrast, Gal4-HIF1α-(498–574)L574S gave rise to a similar reporter activity as that of Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573), supporting the involvement of Leu-574 in ODD instability. Furthermore, under oxygenated conditions, Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603)L574S exhibited a 4.3-fold increase in luciferase activity in comparison with the wild-type. Therefore, these results provide further evidence that Leu-574 plays a critical role in VHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1α, thereby regulating HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Significant progress has been made in the last few years in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIF-1α degradation, which has led to the identification and characterization of the oxygen sensing and signaling pathway (28Ivan M.

Much of the focus has been on the C-terminal ODD of HIF-1α that binds to VHL, although Pro-402 has also been shown to confer independent VHL binding through hydroxylation (37Huang L.E. Willmore W.G., Gu, J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this study, we provided in vivoevidence that VHL interacts with the N-terminal ODD as well, which is consistent with and supported by the notion of functional redundancy within the ODD (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Although VHL binding to the N-terminal ODD appears to be weaker, it is capable of rendering HIF-1α unstable in normoxia, as demonstrated in the ODD partial deletion studies (12Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 c). Moreover, simultaneous mutation of both Pro-402 and Pro-564 in full-length HIF-1α resulted in a far more stable HIF-1α than Pro-564 mutation alone (35Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The notion of multiple mechanisms controlling HIF-1α stability is further supported by the involvement of p53-MDM2 and Hsp90 in a VHL-independent fashion, although the molecular determinants have not yet been identified (41Ravi R.

In addition, we have identified recently another destruction motif within the ODD, which is also distinct from the VHL-mediated degradation pathway. 2L. E Huang, E. A Pete, and J. Gu, manuscript in preparation. Thus, degradation of HIF-1α seems to be mediated by multiple pathways, among which the VHL pathway is arguably responsible for targeting HIF-1α for oxygen-dependent degradation. Pro-564 of HIF-1α plays a pivotal role in VHL binding to the C-terminal ODD (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

In this study, we demonstrate that Leu-574 is indispensable to VHL binding in vitro and in vivo and to VHL-mediated degradation. This finding is based on the evidence that (i) unlike Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603), Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) was unable to bind to VHL, and therefore, constitutively expressed; (ii) the addition of Leu-574 to Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) resulted in a gain of VHL binding and a loss of protein stability; (iii) the mutation of Leu-574 in Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) led to a decrease in VHL binding and an increase in protein stability; and (iv) Leu-574 is highly conserved in HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α. Furthermore, our finding is consistent and corroborated by the fact that Leu-574 was required in all of the VHL-HIF binding studies (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A.

On the other hand, all other Pro-564 neighboring residues were found to be mostly nonessential with the exception of Leu-562 (28Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar), Ala-563 (30Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we conclude that Leu-574 plays a specific and crucial role in the VHL-dependent degradation pathway. It is noteworthy, however, that the biological function of Leu-574 may go beyond VHL binding per se. It is equally possible that this residue participates in the interaction of the C-terminal ODD with HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylases. Consequently, lack or mutation of Leu-574 would prevent Pro-564 hydroxylation, thereby resulting in protein stabilization and loss of VHL binding. In fact, this hypothesis is consistent with recent structural studies of VHL-HIF1α interaction, which concluded that hydroxyproline Pro-564 provides strict specificity for VHL recognition, whereas the neighboring amino acid residues only contribute to the complex stability through a β sheet-like contact (33Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 34Min J.H.

In particular, these studies showed that amino acids 571–574 (Asp-Phe-Gln-Leu) of HIF-1α are not as important for VHL binding because amino acids 560–567 (Glu-Met-Leu-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Pro), when synthetically hydroxylated, exhibited similar VHL affinity as the peptide containing both regions. Therefore, it would be interesting to use synthetic peptides to test whether Leu-574 is required for hydroxylation of Pro-564, thus providing insight into the event(s) upstream of VHL binding. The identification of Leu-574 has enabled us to redefine the core NAD. HIF-1α contains an NAD in addition to its C-terminal activation domain (CAD) (38Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R.

All of these studies, however, showed that NAD transcriptional activity was hypoxia-dependent. In this report, we demonstrated that the core NAD lies between amino acids 498–573 and confers constitutive transcriptional activity irrespective of changes in oxygen tension. Our finding suggests that the NAD possesses an intrinsic (or hypoxia-independent) transcriptional activity. In keeping with this notion, addition of Leu-574 to Gal4-HIF1α-(498–573) regained VHL binding, normoxic degradation, and therefore normoxic repression (or hypoxic induction) of transcription. Conversely, Leu-574 mutation in Gal4-HIF1α-(498–603) produced the opposite effects. Thus, NAD transcriptional activity is constitutive and dependent upon protein stability. In summary, degradation of HIF-1α is a complex process, at least involving VHL binding to the N-terminal and C-terminal ODD independently. Leu-574 of HIF-1α is crucial for in vivoVHL binding and VHL-mediated degradation, possibly through direct contact with VHL or with HIF prolyl hydroxylases. Regardless of the precise mechanism, our finding may provide a molecular basis for the development of therapeutic agents to alter HIF-1α function. We are indebted to H. F. Bunn. for generous support and encouragement of this work. We thank W. G. Kaelin, Jr. for reagents, Xin W. Wang for critical reading of the manuscript, and Dorothea Dudek for editorial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2126736750,"We previously reported that proinflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK) induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in human airway smooth muscle (HASM), but the mechanism is unknown in any biological system. Here, we studied the role of specific protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme(s) in COX-2 expression. Among the eight PKC isozymes present in HASM cells, the Ca2+-independent PKC-delta and -epsilon and the Ca2+-dependent PKC-alpha and -betaI were translocated to the nucleus upon BK stimulation. BK-induced COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) accumulation were mimicked by the direct PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and inhibited by the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. However, the selective Ca2+-dependent PKC isozyme inhibitor Go 6976 had no effect. Furthermore, the membrane-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM had no effect on BK-induced COX-2 expression and COX activity despite its inhibition of PGE2 accumulation, suggesting the involvement of Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes. Rottlerin, a PKC-delta inhibitor, also had no effect, likely implicating PKC-epsilon. BK-stimulated transcriptional activation of a COX-2 promoter reporter construct was enhanced by overexpression of wild-type PKC-epsilon and abolished by a dominant negative PKC-epsilon, but it was not affected by wild-type or dominant negative PKC-alpha or -delta. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PKC-e mediates BK-induced COX-2 expression in HASM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169288795,"Apoptosis is the major independent form of cardiomyocyte cell death in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). TNF-alpha release early in the course of AMI contributes to myocardial injury, and TNF-alpha induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Soluble TNF-alpha receptor 1 (sTNFR1) is an antagonist to TNF-alpha. However, the effect of sTNFR1 on AMI remains unclear. Here we report that direct injection of an sTNFR1 expression plasmid DNA to the myocardium reduces infarct size in experimental rat AMI. Treatment with sTNFR1 expression plasmid DNA reduced the TNF-alpha bioactivity in the myocardium and the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.

The regeneration of the amphibian (newt) limb has been used as a model system to understand the role of FGF-1 in embryonic growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis (26Ornitz D.W. Yahon A.

Acta. 1994; 1220: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, the isolation and characterization of an acidic fibroblast growth factor, nFGF-1, from the newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, has been reported (28Patrie K.M. Botelho M.J. Ray S.K. Mehta V.B. Chiu I.M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Arunkumar A.I. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Srisailam S. Wang H.M. Leena P.S.T. Chi Y.H. Chen H.C. Wu C.H. Wu R.T. Chang G.G. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1050-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison indicates that nFGF-1 exhibits about 80% homology with its mammalian counterparts (Fig.1). nFGF-1 has been shown to elicit a mitogenic response, which is similar to that exhibited by the human FGF-1 (hFGF-1, Ref. 28Patrie K.M. Botelho M.J. Ray S.K. Mehta V.B. Chiu I.M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the high degree of sequence homology and functional similarity, polyclonal antibodies directed against mammalian FGF-1 failed to recognize nFGF-1 (28Patrie K.M. Botelho M.J. Ray S.K. Mehta V.B. Chiu I.M. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this context, we determine the three-dimensional structure(s) of nFGF-1 using a variety of multidimensional NMR techniques. In addition, we also compare the thermodynamic stabilities of hFGF-1 and nFGF-1 and attempt to rationalize the observed difference(s) in the conformational stabilities based on their three-dimensional structures. Plasmid DNA was prepared using a mini-prep kit obtained from Qiagen (Germany). EcoRI and XbaI were purchased from New England Biolabs. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol were procured from AMERSCO. Ingredients for the LB medium were obtained from DIFCO laboratories. Low molecular weight heparin (M r∼3000), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, Triton X-100, β-mercaptoethanol, and α-chymotrypsin were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Sucrose octosulfate (SOS) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Canada). Heparin-Sepharose was procured from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals used were of high quality analytical grade. All solutions were made in Milli Q water. Unless otherwise mentioned, all experiments were performed in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7. 2) containing 100 mmNaCl. Recombinant hFGF-1 and nFGF-1) were prepared from transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The nFGF-1 DNA construct consisting of 486 base pairs was inserted between the NdeI and BamH1 restriction sites. The expressed proteins were purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column over a NaCl gradient (0–1.5 m). Desalting of the purified protein was achieved by ultrafiltration using an Amicon set-up. The purity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. The authenticity of the truncated sample was verified by ES-Mass analysis. The concentration of the protein was estimated based on its extinction coefficient value at 280 nm. Uniform15N and 13C isotope labeling (of human and newt FGF-1) were achieved using M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl and (13C6)-glucose (30Gardner K.H. Kay L.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struc. 1998; 27: 357-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In order to realize maximal expression yields, the composition of the M9 medium was modified by the addition of a mixture mixture of vitamins. The expression host strain E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS is a vitamin B1-deficient host and hence the medium was supplemented with thiamine (vitamin B1). Protein expression yields were in the range of 25–30 mg/liter of the isotope-enriched medium. The extent of 15N labeling was verified by ES-Mass analysis. The thermodynamic stability of the protein was assessed from the urea denaturation experiments. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorimeter at 2.5 or 10 nm resolution, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Unless otherwise mentioned, all fluorescence measurements were made using a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml in 10 mmphosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 100 mm ammonium sulfate. The fraction of unfolded species was estimated from the ratio of the emission intensities at 308 nm and 350 nm. Equilibrium unfolding data obtained were converted to plots of FU, the fraction of the protein in the unfolded state, versus denaturant concentration using Equation 1, FU=(XD−(XF+mF[D])/{(XU+mU[D])−(XF+mF[D])}Equation 1 where, XD is the value of the spectroscopic property measured at denaturant concentration [D]. XF and XU represent the intercepts, and mF and mU are the slopes of the folded and unfolded baselines of the data, respectively, and were obtained from the linear least square fits of the baselines. For a two state (Native ⇆ Denatured) unfolding pathway, the free energy of unfolding by denaturant (ΔG U) at concentration [D] is related toF U by transformation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. It is assumed that the free energy of unfolding ΔG U, has a linear dependence on the concentration of the denaturant [D] according to Equation 2, ΔGU=ΔG(H2O)+m[D]Equation 2 where, ΔG (H2O) andm are the intercept and slope, respectively of the plot of ΔG U versus the concentration of the denaturant. m is the measure of the co-operativity of the unfolding reaction, and ΔG (H2O) is the change in free energy for a transition from folded to unfolded state(s) in the absence of the denaturant. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with An-60 Ti analytical rotor and standard double sector cells. Sedimentation velocity experiments on nFGF-1 (in the presence and absence of SOS) were performed under identical conditions. Sedimentation velocity Experiments were performed at 4 °C at 50,000 rpm for 20 h. The Svedberg constant (S20,w) values were estimated using standard methods. The sedimentation boundary movement was traced by the absorbance of the protein using an inbuilt UV detector. The protein to ligand (SOS) ratio used in these experiments was 1:1. The concentration of the protein (nFGF-1) used was 1.5 mg/ml NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX 600 MHz spectrometer. For the two- and three-dimensional heteronuclear experiments, the concentration of the protein used was about 1 mm. The protein samples were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA in the presence and absence of SOS. All NMR data were acquired at 25 ± 0.5 °C. Homonuclear two-dimensional experiments [TOCSY (mixing time 75 ms), DQF-COSY, NOESY (mixing time 200 ms)] were acquired on unlabeled nFGF-1. All heteronuclear two- and three-dimensional experiments were performed on a uniformly 13C/15N-labeled protein (31Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 130-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 32Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1991; 3: 379-391Google Scholar). The three-dimensional NMR experiments performed on nFGF-1 include, HNHA, HNCA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C HSQC-TOCSY, 15N HSQC-TOCSY, 13C HSQC-NOESY, and 15N HSQC-NOESY. DSS was used as an internal standard for calibration of the proton resonances. For 15N and 13C chemical shift calibration, we followed the IUPAC procedure defined by Markleyet al. (33Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The water resonance was suppressed by applying a WATERGATE sequence or by presaturation. The three-dimensional spectra were processed and analyzed using the standard Bruker software XWINNMR and AURELIA. A 200-ms 13C F1-filtered, F3-edited NOESY experiment was recorded on 13C/15N-labeled nFGF-1 and unlabeled SOS complex at 600 MHz using the pulse sequence described by Lee et al. (34Lee W. Revington M.J. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A data matrix consisting of 36 × 16 × 1024 complex points in each of t1, t2, and t3 was acquired. Spectral width of 6614 × 3924 × 2400 Hz was employed in the F1, F2, and F3 dimensions, with corresponding acquisition times of 154, 4, and 15 ms, respectively. 128 scans were acquired for each FID, and the total acquisition time was about 106 h. The structures were calculated using the hybrid distance geometry-dynamical simulated annealing method of Nilges et al. (35Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) using the program X-PLOR (36Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Software Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) adopted to incorporate pseudo potentials for the 3JNHαcoupling constants (37Kuszewski J. Qin J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mag. Reson. 1995; 106: 92-96Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and secondary13Cα/13Cβ chemical shift restraints (38Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mag. Reson. 1995; 107: 293-297Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The target function that is minimized during restraint minimization and simulated annealing only comprises of quadratic harmonic terms for covalent geometry, 3J coupling constants and13Cα/13Cβ chemical shift restraints. NOE data were extracted from two- and three-dimensional NOESY experiments. To avoid over estimation of NOE intensities due to a contribution of zero quantum coherence, all intraresidual NOEs between vicinal protons were allowed to cover a distance range of 1.8–3.7 Å. Torsional angle constraints were calculated from the HNHA experiment and the TALOS (Torsion Angle Likelihood Obtained from Shift and Sequence Similarity) software (39Cornilescu G. Deluglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). A family of structures were calculated by a simulated annealing (SA) approach followed by a refinement procedure using the X-PLOR version 3.1 program package (36Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Software Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). For calculation, slightly modified slow-cooling standard simulated annealing protocols were used. Refinement was carried out against the standard covalent geometry restraints. Constraints resulting from NOE intensities, coupling constants, and hydrogen bonds were introduced to the simulated annealing approach in a step by step procedure. Sequential, medium range NOEs as well as long-range NOEs defining the β-sheet regions and coupling constants were used for structure calculation. All the remaining NOEs and hydrogen bonds were subsequently introduced in consecutive steps. The quality of the constraints were checked by analyzing the violations of the calculated conformers. The NOE cross-peaks corresponding to constraints that were consistently violated in a significant number of structures were checked for possible overlap, and the corresponding restraints were consequently modified. The quality of the structures was evaluated using the PROCHECK software (40Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The structure of the nFGF-1/SOS complex was generated by Adopted Newton-Raphson restraint minimization with the inclusion of the available intermolecular NOE constraints. The restraint energy minimization process was repeated for few cycles so as to obtain the lowest energy structure(s) and avoid unnecessary bad contacts in the molecule. During this process, the atomic restraints that had been imposed on the nFGF-1 molecule were relaxed. Protein solution was prepared in 100 mm phosphate buffer and 200 mm ammonium sulfate (Millipore) and dried by lyophilization. H/D exchange is initiated by dissolving dry protein in 10 mm phosphate-buffered D2O (pD 6.0, at 25 °C). All NMR data acquisition parameters were preset using a mock sample, and the sample pH was measured after the experiment to minimize the dead-time. The first 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was acquired after 8 min of initiation of exchange. Spectra were recorded with 8 transients of 2048 data points and 64 t1increments. 50 spectra were collected in 48 h with various time points, and another 8 spectra were collected in 1265 h. The peak heights in the two-dimensional spectra were measured using the peak picking subroutine and referenced internally to a nonexchangeable aliphatic proton resonance in the one-dimensional 1H spectra. To determine rate constants for exchange, NH resonance intensities (I) as a function time (t) were fit to a single exponential function, I = Ioexp(-k ex t) + C, where Io is the initial intensity, k ex is the rate constant of exchange, and C is the final amplitude. The protection factor (P) for the various amide protons in the protein were estimated on the basis of the method reported by Bai et al.(41Bai Y. Englander J.J. Mayne L. Milne J.S. Englander S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 259: 344-356Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), using the equation p =k rc/k ex, wherek rc and k ex represent the exchange rates of the protein in the random coil and the native conformation, respectively. As reported by Bai et al. (41Bai Y. Englander J.J. Mayne L. Milne J.S. Englander S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 259: 344-356Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the hydrogen exchange rates of amide protons in the nonstructured peptides (termed k rc) are estimated by referencing an alanine-based (poly-dl-alanine, PDLA) at low ionic strength at 20 °C. The free energy of exchange of the individual amide protons were calculated from the equation, ΔG ex = -RTln(k ex/k rc), were R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature at which the exchange was monitored. Recent studies on acidic and basic FGF showed that the protein has a strong tendency to self-associate preferentially to a biologically active oligomerized state even in the absence of ligands (16Volkin D.B.

J. 1999; 341: 611-629Google Scholar). Polysulfonated ligands such as heparin or SOS have been demonstrated to merely stabilize the oligomerized state of FGF (17Mach H. Volkin D.B. Burke C.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1892-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Low resolution crystal structure of the human acidic fibroblast growth factor complexed to SOS revealed that the growth factor molecule exists in a dimeric state upon binding to the ligand (46Roghani M.

Structure. 1993; 1: 27-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this context, we assessed the molecular state of nFGF-1 in its free and SOS-bound states using the sedimentation velocity experiments (29Arunkumar A.I. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Srisailam S. Wang H.M. Leena P.S.T. Chi Y.H. Chen H.C. Wu C.H. Wu R.T. Chang G.G. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1050-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). nFGF-1 in its free form in 10 mmphosphate buffer containing 100 mm each of sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate is found to move as single boundary with a Svedberg constant (S20,w) value of 1.16 S (Supplementary Fig. S1). Time derivative analysis of the data revealed the presence of single species with molecular mass corresponding to 15.7 kDa. Interestingly, nFGF-1 remains as a monomer (S20,W = 1.24 S) even after binding to SOS (M r ∼1293). The molecular mass of nFGF-1 in the SOS-bound state is estimated to be 17.5 kDa. These results are in marked contrast to the crystal structure data on hFGF-1, wherein the protein in the presence of SOS was shown to exist as a dimer. Although, we are currently unable to provide a concrete explanation for the observed discrepancy, we strongly believe that the observation of dimers in the crystal structure (of hFGF-1) is related to the crystallization packing. In this context, it should be pertinent to mention that the solution structure of hFGF-1 in complex with myo-inositol hexasulfate (a heparin functional analog) in solution exists in a monomeric state (48Pineda-Lucena A. Jimenez M.A. Lozano R.M. Nieto J.S. Santoro J. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 1H,15N, and 13C resonances in nFGF-1 were sequence specifically assigned using the classical method developed by Wuthrich as well as by chain tracing methods based on double and triple resonance NMR experiments (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Refs. 31Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 130-138Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 32Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1991; 3: 379-391Google Scholar, and49Wuthrich K. Wider G. Wagner G. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 155: 311-319Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Sequential resonance assignments of nFGF-1 were achieved based on the combined information obtained from the HNCA, HNCOCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and CBCANH spectra. The residues at the N terminus (residues, 23–25) are largely unstructured, as evidenced by the absence of long range NOEs, and the chemical shifts which are close to the random coil state(s). γ, δ, ε resonances of aliphatic chains were traced using CC(CO)NH-TOCSY and HCCH-TOCSY experiments. The aromatic side-chain proton resonances were obtained based on the two-dimensional COSY and TOCSY spectra in conjunction with 15N-edited NOESY data. The aromatic resonance assignments were verified based on the13C-edited NOESY spectra. The chemical shift assignments in nFGF-1 are discussed in detail elsewhere (50Arunkumar A.I. Srisailam S. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Peng C.L. Chen C.P. Chiu I.M. Yu C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and have been deposited with the BioMagResBank (accession number, BMRB- 4712). Fig. 2 shows the best-fit superposition of the ensemble of 13 lowest energy nFGF-1 conformers selected from a pool of 50 structures. The structures were computed based on 1359 experimental NMR restraints, consisting of NOE-derived approximate interproton distance constraints, 22 hydrogen-bond derived restraints, and 110 dihedral angle constraints derived from scalar coupling constants. The NMR structure represented by the 13 best conformers represents a good fit of the experimental data, with very small residual constraint violations (<0.3 Å for distance constraints and >3° for dihedral angle constraints). A summary of the structural statistics for the final 13 stimulated annealing structures of nFGF-1 is provided in Table 1. The atomic RMS distribution of the 13 structures about the mean coordinate positions is 0.97 Å for the backbone atoms in the whole protein. The high quality of the nFGF-1 NMR structure is also evident from the results of PROCHECK analysis and by a calculated large negative value for the Lennard Jones/van der Waals energy (−802.39 kcal·mol−1). In addition, the fact that most of the backbone torsion angles for non-glycine residues lie within the expected regions of the Ramachandran plot is also an indication of the high-precision structure of nFGF-1.Table IStructural statistics of nFGF-1NMR ConstraintsDistance constraints:Intraresidues318Sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1)378Medium range (‖i − j‖ = 4)166Long range (‖i − j‖⩾5)417Intermolecular NOEs15Hydrogen bond constraints22Total constraints1359Dihedral constraints110Structural statistics (13 structures)Violation statistics (average of 13 structures)NOE violations, number > 0.3 Å0.54Dihedral angel violations, number > 3°0.92X-PLOR energies (kcal mol−1) (average of 13 structures)Etotal287.63Ebond9.19Eangle200.27Eimproper30.61Enoe23.83Ecdih4.29CHARM minimization energiesaEnergy after 200 steps of energy minimization using Adopted-Basis Newton Raphson (ABNR) force field available in Quanta 98's CHARM energy minimization interface.ETot−4991.27 kcal/molEL-J−802.39 kcal/molR.M.S.D. from idealized geometryBond (Å)0.0019Angle (deg.)0.75R.M.S.D. from experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.014Dihedral angles (deg.)0.58R.M.S.D. for structured regionbResidues in the structured region: 25–31, 34–40, 44–50, 57–63, 67–73, 77–83, 85–90, 97–104, 108–114, 121–127, 129–134, 144–151.

Resistance is associated with higher selectivity for unsaturated acyl substrates over saturated ones. In vitro substrate selectivity assays performed under physiologically relevant conditions have been established that discriminate between selective and non-selective forms of the enzyme. A mutation, L261F, in the squash protein converts it from a non-selective enzyme into a selective one. The mutation lies within 10 Å of the predicted acyl binding site and results in a higherK m for 16:0 acyl carrier protein (ACP). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the importance of four residues, Arg235, Arg237, Lys193, and His194, implicated to be involved in binding of the phosphate group of glycerol 3-phosphate to the enzyme. All the proteins were highly homologous in structure to the wild type enzyme. Mutations in Arg235, Arg237, and Lys193 resulted in inactive enzyme, while His194 had reduced catalytic activity. The mutant proteins retained the ability to bind stoichiometric quantities of acyl-ACPs supporting the potential role of these residues in glycerol 3-phosphate binding. Glycerol-3-phosphate 1-acyltransferase is a soluble chloroplast enzyme involved in glycerol-lipid biosynthesis associated with chilling resistance in plants (1Murata N. Ishizaki-Nishizawa O. Higashi S. Hayashi H. Tasaka Y. Nishida I. Nature. 1992; 356: 710-713Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Resistance is associated with higher selectivity for unsaturated acyl substrates over saturated ones. In vitro substrate selectivity assays performed under physiologically relevant conditions have been established that discriminate between selective and non-selective forms of the enzyme. A mutation, L261F, in the squash protein converts it from a non-selective enzyme into a selective one. The mutation lies within 10 Å of the predicted acyl binding site and results in a higherK m for 16:0 acyl carrier protein (ACP). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the importance of four residues, Arg235, Arg237, Lys193, and His194, implicated to be involved in binding of the phosphate group of glycerol 3-phosphate to the enzyme.

Glycerol-3-phosphate 1-acyltransferase (G3PAT, 1The abbreviations used are: G3PAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; G-3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; 18:1, oleic acid; 16:0, palmitic acid (plsb), EC 2.3.1.15) catalyzes the first acylation step in glycerol lipid biosynthesis acylating the sn1 position of glycerol 3-phosphate (G-3-P). Both soluble and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme exist (2Slabas A.R. Hanley Z. Schierer T. Rice D. Turnbull A. Rafferty J. Simon J.W. Brown A. J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 158: 505-513Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli the enzyme is membrane-bound and uses both acyl-ACP and acyl-CoA as substrates (3Green P.R. Merrill A.H.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11151-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plants contain soluble and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme, the former being located in the chloroplast and the latter being extraplastidial (2Slabas A.R. Hanley Z. Schierer T. Rice D. Turnbull A.

Soluble G3PAT has strong substrate selectivity for acyl-ACP over acyl-CoAs, consistent with the location of both the enzyme and ACP within the chloroplast (4Frentzen M. Heinz E. McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both selective (4Frentzen M. Heinz E. McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. Eur. J.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1195-1201Google Scholar and oil palm in this report). Non-selective enzymes utilize 16:0 and 18:1 substrates at the same rate, while selective enzymes preferentially incorporate 18:1. Chilling sensitive plants preferentially incorporate C16 saturated fatty acids at position 1, while chilling-resistant plants have a much higher content of unsaturated fatty acids at that position (8Murata N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1983; 24: 81-86Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As a consequence the glycerolipids of chilling-resistant plants are more fluid at lower temperatures and hence less sensitive to chilling damage. Transgenic studies with tobacco using constructs containing selective (Arabidopsis) and non-selective (squash AT2) G3PATs targeted to the chloroplast supported this view (1Murata N. Ishizaki-Nishizawa O. Higashi S. Hayashi H. Tasaka Y. Nishida I. Nature. 1992; 356: 710-713Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). G3PAT is nuclear-encoded, and import into the chloroplast requires a transit peptide, which is removed to give the mature protein. The exact nature of the processing site has not been determined experimentally (9Ishizaki O. Nishida I. Agata K. Eguchi G. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Murata N. Tasaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transformation experiments performed in tobacco utilizing the truncated form of the squash enzyme linked to the Rubisco (ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) transit peptide have demonstrated that this form of the enzyme is both biologically active and non-selective in vivo (1Murata N. Ishizaki-Nishizawa O. Higashi S. Hayashi H. Tasaka Y. Nishida I. Nature. 1992; 356: 710-713Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The primary structure of mature soluble plant G3PAT is highly conserved. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the putative mature protein from spinach, pea, and Arabidopsis, all of which show substrate preference for 18:1 over 16:0, reveals that in the mature sequence 199 residues are absolutely conserved between all three of these species. Of these 19 are different in squash; thus it is difficult to identify discrete amino acid residues that could play a major role in determining substrate selectivity. It is also highly likely, as with the oleate desaturase/hydroxylase (11Broun P. Shanklin J. Whittle E. Somerville C. Science. 1998; 282: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), that several residues contribute to substrate selectivity, and no one residue has a dominating effect. Determining the nature of the acyl-ACP and G-3-P binding sites will be of importance as a step in elucidating the mechanism of substrate selectivity of this enzyme. The reaction proceeds via a compulsory ordered ternary complex with acyl-ACP binding before G-3-P (12Hayman M.W. Fawcett T Slabas A.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of squash G3PAT has been determined at 1.9-Å resolution (13Turnbull A.P. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Slabas A.R. Schierer T.P. Kroon J.T.M. Simon J.W. Fawcett T. Nishida I. Murata N. Rice D. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 347-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Crystals containing bound substrates could not be obtained; however modeling of the G-3-P and acyl-ACP binding site was performed on the basis of proximity to the conserved H(X)4D motif, which has been shown to be important in catalysis among glycerolipid acyltransferases (14Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the crystal structure it has been predicted that the phosphate group of G-3-P lies in a positively charged pocket formed by the side chains of two arginine residues Arg235 and Arg237, a lysine, Lys193, and a histidine residue, His194. The presumptive acyl-ACP site was modeled by maximization of the substrate contacts with fully conserved residues across the G3PAT family and the positioning of the reactive sulfur of the fatty acid moiety close to the sn1 position of the modeled G-3-P site. This placed the palmitoyl/pantothene substrate within a deep hydrophobic cleft lined with 14 residues which make van der Waals contacts with the substrate. We are now in a position to test the predicted models for residues implicated to be important in G-3-P and acyl-ACP binding via site-directed mutagenesis. Appropriate assays need to be in place to determine whether any change in in vitro substrate selectivity occurred, since assaying with a single substrate may mistake change in selectivity with total loss of activity. Assays with G3PAT, in the literature, have been performed under a variety of different conditions; hence we have decided to develop assays pertinent to known physiological conditions. The pH of the stroma in the light is pH 8.0 and pH 7.4 in the dark (15Leegood R.C. Lea P.J. Leegood R.C. Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1993: 30-45Google Scholar). Estimates of the concentration of G-3-P vary between 65–90 μm in spinach (16Sauer A. Heise K.P. Z. Naturforsch. C. 1984; 39: 593-599Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and 450–620 μm in Amaranthus (17Cronan Jr., J.E. Roughan P.G. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 676-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplast acyl-ACP concentration values vary in the literature between 0.6–1.9 μm and 0.4–2.0 μm for C16:0 and C18:1 acyl-ACP, respectively (18Roughan G. Nishida I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Sol J. Roughan G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 146: 189-192Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this paper we report on 1) in vitro assays that can distinguish between selective and non-selective G3PATs performed under physiological relevant conditions, 2) the effect of mutation of Lys193, Arg235, Arg237, and His194, proposed to be involved with binding of the phosphate group of G-3-P, on biological activity and acyl-ACP binding, 3) the conversion of non-selective squash enzyme into a selective one by site-directed mutagenesis resulting in an alteration of theK m for 16:0 ACP. X-ray crystallography has been performed with the protein variants and has shown that the structures are highly homologous to the wild type protein. A 111 day post anthesis oil palm (Elaeis guineesis) mesocarp cDNA library was constructed in the λZAPII cloning vector (Stratagene) using the TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) to prepare EcoRI flanked double-stranded cDNA. A 2043-bp cDNA sequence encoding oil palm G3PAT was isolated from this library by heterologous screening of 2 × 105 plaque-forming unit with a32P-labeled 1445-bp EcoRI cDNA fragment ofArabidopsis G3PAT. Overexpression of squash (NA4, Q24a, Q17b, and JKSQ+), Arabidopsis (AR1) and oil palm constructs for G3PAT (Fig. 1) was carried out using the pETTM plasmid overexpression system. Typical levels of overexpression of plant G3PAT were 10–15% of the totalE. coli proteins. For substrate selectivity and kinetic analyses recombinant G3PAT was selectively released from the E. coli cells by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing in dry ice/ethanol and ice/water (20Johnson B.H. Hecht M.H. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 1357-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and the concentration adjusted to give standard amounts in each assay. Site-directed mutations of squash and oil palm G3PAT were generated using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (21Simon, J. W., Molecular and Structural Studies on Proteins Involved in Lipid Biosynthesis in Plants and Bacteria.Ph.D. thesis, 2002, University of Durham, Durham, UK.Google Scholar). [14C]Palmitic and [3H]oleic acyl-ACPs were synthesized using 25 μm[14C]palmitic or [3H]oleic acid at a specific activity of 55 Ci/mol and 33 μm recombinantE. coli holo-ACP in a reaction catalyzed by 5 μm E. coli acyl-ACP synthetase. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 5.0 ml containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm LiCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 1% Triton X-100 and proceeded at 30 °C for 10 h. Following synthesis the radioactive acyl-ACP reaction product was purified away from the other reaction components using anion exchange (Q Sepharose) and hydrophobic interaction (octyl-Sepharose) chromatography. Dual substrate specificity assays using radioactive acyl-ACP substrates were carried out using modified reaction conditions of Frentzen et al.(7Frentzen M. Nishida I. Murata N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1195-1201Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 250 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, 300 μm G-3-P, 5.0 mg/ml BSA with 14C 16:0 ACP and 3H 18:1 ACP at 1.1 μm each, in a total volume of 320 μl. Assays were started with the addition of 200 ng of G3PAT purified protein. 80-μl aliquots were removed at 0 (before addition of enzyme), 1, 2, and 3 min and mixed with 710 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). 280 μl of 0.2 mH2PO4 in 1 m KCl was added to the samples, which were vigorously mixed and the phases separated by centrifugation. 250 μl of the lower (LPA containing) layer were removed, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, re-suspended in 280 μl of methanol, and mixed with 4 ml of Ecoscint A. Samples were counted in a Packard liquid scintillation counter on a 14C/3H dual counting protocol to determine the rate of incorporation of 14C 16:0 ACP and 3H 18:1 ACP into LPA. The initial velocities were linear. Binding assays with mutant G3PAT enzymes and acyl-ACP substrates were carried out using a UltrafreeTM microconcentrator (Millipore). 100 pmol of radiolabeled acyl-ACP (18:1 ACP) was incubated with 50 pmol of G3PAT enzyme in the absence of the other substrate for 5 min in 200 μl of 250 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0. Following incubation the samples were transferred to the concentrator and centrifuged through aM r 30,000 cut-off membrane. The radiolabeled substrate bound to G3PAT was retained by the membrane in the upper compartment of the concentrator. Sample volume in both compartments was readjusted to 200 μl and the sample removed and added to 4 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid prior to counting in a Packard liquid scintillation counter. This membrane did not retain acyl-ACPs in the absence of G3PAT. X-ray crystallography and modeling of substrates within the structure of squash G3PAT was carried out as described previously (13Turnbull A.P. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Slabas A.R. Schierer T.P. Kroon J.T.M. Simon J.W. Fawcett T. Nishida I. Murata N. Rice D. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 347-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of all G3PAT constructs was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 377 automated sequencer using forward and reverse primers flanking the position of the G3PAT insert. Primers specific to regions close to mutation sites were also used to confirm the presence of the correct mutation. General molecular biology reagents and restriction enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Stratagene. pET expression vectors came from Novagen, and competentE. coli cells were from Stratagene. Oligonucleotide primers for cloning and mutagenesis reactions were from MWG Biotech. [14C]Palmitic and [3H]oleic acids were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Merck. Assays were performed under competitive conditions with two substrates in the reaction mixture, 18:1 and 16:0 acyl-ACP at a concentration of 1.1 μm each, which is close to their physiological concentration. Since BSA has routinely been used in assays for G3PAT, we chose to include it in these studies. Two different BSA concentrations were used, 0.5 and 5 mg/ml, referred to, respectively, as low and high. Two different pH values were used, pH 7.4 and pH 8.0, reflecting the pH of the chloroplast in the dark and the light respectively. The G-3-P concentration was 300 μm, which is in the physiological range of this substrate. With the squash enzyme (Fig. 2) both reaction velocities are lower at pH 7.4 than at pH 8.0. At high BSA there is little preference for either 16:0 or 18:1, while at low BSA there is a preference for 18:1 over 16:0, which is more marked at the lower pH. At low BSA, in comparison with high BSA, the reaction velocity is lowered for 16:0 and increased for 18:1 resulting in an alteration of the substrate selectivity of the enzyme. Assays conducted with the full-length sequence of the squash enzyme (JSKQ+) in the presence of high BSA and pH 8.0 gave a substrate selectivity of 0.93, which is close to that observed for the truncated enzyme. With theArabidopsis enzyme (Fig. 2) similar effects are seen; however under all assay conditions the Arabidopsis enzyme shows a strong preference for 18:1. As the physiological concentrations of G-3-P and acyl-ACP could be as high as 2 μm for acyl-ACPs and 620 μm for G-3-P, we conducted further selectivity assays increasing the acyl-ACP and G-3-P concentration at high BSA and pH 8.0. The G-3-P concentration was increased up to 620 μm and the acyl-ACP up to a concentration of 2.2 μm each. Assays were conducted with both the squash and Arabidopsis enzymes (TableI). Doubling the acyl-ACP or G-3-P concentration had little effect on the substrate selectivity. We therefore decided to use a 1.1 μm concentration of each acyl-ACP, 300 μm G-3-P, high BSA and pH 8.0 in all future experimentation.Table ISubstrate selectivity assays of squash and Arabidopsis G3PAT using varying levels of acyl-ACP and G3P substratesConcentration of each acyl-ACPaEquimolar mixtures of 18:1 and 16:0 ACP were used in the reaction mixture, each at the concentration given.[G3P]Rates for 18:1/16:0 LPA productionSelectivity (18:1/16:0)bSelectivity is given as the rate of production of 18:1 LPA divided by the rate of production of 16:0 LPA.μmμmpmol/minSquash G3PAT (Q24a)1.130012.4/13.00.951.162015.6/17.30.92.230018.2/15.21.2Arabidopsis G3PAT (AR1)1.130020.1/6.53.11.162025.9/9.652.72.230030.1/8.63.5a Equimolar mixtures of 18:1 and 16:0 ACP were used in the reaction mixture, each at the concentration given.b Selectivity is given as the rate of production of 18:1 LPA divided by the rate of production of 16:0 LPA. Open table in a new tab To prepare large quantities of squash G3PAT, using fermentation, for more extensive crystallization trials, we decided to replace the ampicillin selection marker with a kanamycin one. This was to overcome problems with loss of the plasmid due to the expense of maintaining the organism under ampicillin selection in the fermenter. In our cloning strategy we amplified the squash G3PAT cDNA from the plasmid pNA4 via a PCR-based protocol using a proof reading Taq polymerase (VENTTM DNA Polymerase) and inserted it into the pET24a plasmid, which contains a kanamycin selection marker. Assays using the dual substrate 16:0/18:1 acyl-ACP selectivity assay were performed on selected transformants. It was noticed that G3PAT from one of the transformants showed a preference for 18:1 (Fig.3 d), while the “wild type” plasmid from which it was derived exhibited no acyl preference (Fig.3 a). Sequencing of the entire coding region for G3PAT in the “mutant” plasmid revealed that two point mutations had occurred during the PCR reactions. These converted Leu261 and Ser331 to Phe and Pro, respectively (Fig. 3 d). To identify which residue was responsible for this change in substrate selectivity, both mutated residues were individually mutated back to the wild type. The L261F enzyme was selective (Fig. 3 b), while the S331P was non-selective (Fig. 3 c), indicating that a point mutation at 261 converts a non-selective enzyme into a selective one. To see if mutation at this residue could result in altered substrate selectivity in other G3PAT enzymes, we looked for the corresponding residue in the oil palm G3PAT, which we had recently cloned, and which shows no substrate selectivity. The corresponding residue in oil palm is Leu352. We mutated this to a Phe and assayed for substrate selectivity. Mutation of this residue in oil palm caused a similar alteration in substrate selectivity (Fig. 3, e and f). Position 261 in the squash G3PAT structure lies at the end of the deep cleft remote from the H(X)4D motif and represents one of 12 residues implicated in binding the fatty acyl substrate (13Turnbull A.P. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Slabas A.R. Schierer T.P. Kroon J.T.M. Simon J.W. Fawcett T. Nishida I. Murata N. Rice D. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 347-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fact that the structures of the wild type and L261F variant are otherwise identical suggests that differential substrate specificity could arise in part from the large side chain of the phenylalanine residue. To determine the basis of the alteration in substrate selectivity we performed kinetic analysis on the wild type and mutant enzymes from squash. Assays were performed using acyl-ACP at 10 μmeach and G-3-P at 20 mm at pH 8.0 in the presence of 5 mg/ml BSA, while varying the second substrate concentration. The K m andV max for both G-3-P and acyl-ACP (Fig.4) are almost identical for the wild type and mutant using 18:1 ACP as substrate; however, theK m for 16:0 in the mutant was almost three times as high (Table II). The reaction velocity of both Q24a N-terminally truncated recombinant protein and the Q24a-L261F mutant were determined at 20 mm G-3-P and 10 μm of both 16:0 and 18:1 ACP (total acyl-ACP concentration 20 μm). The values for 18:1 were similar but were almost half for 16:0 with the mutant, consistent with the mutation being caused by a K m effect on 16:0 ACP.Table IIKinetic analysis of squash G3PAT (Q24a) and mutant displaying altered substrate selectivity (Q24a L261F) using acyl-ACP substratesIsomeric formAcyl-ACPKmacyl-ACPKm G-3-PVelocityaVelocity under conditions close toV max.

Open table in a new tab The H(X)4D motif is present in G3PAT and is hypothesized to be involved in metal binding, and the D331E mutant ofplsb in E. coli is still capable of binding G-3-P, albeit with an increased K m of 200 μm in comparison with 100 μm for the wild type. By analogy with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (22Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biocemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) it has been argued that the His residue could act as a general base to abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the acyl acceptor to facilitate nucleophilic attack on the thioester of the acyl donor. It is notable that in all 18:1-selective G3PATs the sequence is HQSEAD, while in the squash enzyme, which is non-selective, the Ser is a Thr (141). The corresponding residue in oil palm is also a Thr (169). Mutation of Thr141 to an Ser in the squash enzyme does not result in any major alteration in substrate selectivity of the protein (Table III). It is still fully catalytically active and shows the same substrate preference, indicating that this single residue does not play a major role in determining substrate selectivity.Table IIISummary of squash G3PAT Q24a mutants created and analyzedMutant (based on Q24a numbering)Activity as % of wild type (standardizedng of GPAT protein added)aPercentage activity is calculated by assigning the wild type enzyme an activity of 100% and comparing the LPA formed per min (of 18:1 and 16:0 ACP together) against that of the wild type.Selectivity (if determined)Q24a100 (arbitrary)1.0T141S1061.0E142AbThese assays were performed for up to 100 times the normal incubation time to confrim lack of activity.0K193SbThese assays were performed for up to 100 times the normal incubation time to confrim lack of activity.0H194S790.8R235SbThese assays were performed for up to 100 times the normal incubation time to confrim lack of activity.0R237SbThese assays were performed for up to 100 times the normal incubation time to confrim lack of activity.0L261F903.8S331P941.2Oil palm wild type1001.1Oil palm L352F1173.3a Percentage activity is calculated by assigning the wild type enzyme an activity of 100% and comparing the LPA formed per min (of 18:1 and 16:0 ACP together) against that of the wild type.b These assays were performed for up to 100 times the normal incubation time to confrim lack of activity. Open table in a new tab From the crystal structure it has been predicted that the G-3-P binding site lies in domain 2 of the protein and that the phosphate group lies in a positively charged pocket formed by the side chains of two arginine residues Arg235 and Arg237, a lysine, Lys193, and a histidine residue, His194 (Fig. 5). We mutated each of the four positively charged residues and converted them individually to serine residues. The proteins were expressed inE. coli at the same level as the wild type protein and were fully soluble. The soluble protein was assayed for biological activity using the standard assay with acyl-ACPs (Table III). R235S, R237S, and K193S were all inactive, even following incubation times 100 times longer than those normally used. In acyl-ACP binding studies using a spin column, all three inactive enzymes retained their ability to bind stoichiometric quantities of acyl-ACP. The values for nanomoles of acyl ACP substrate bound per mole of enzyme were 0.95 + 0.01, 0.81 + 0.03, 0.91 + 0.02, 0.91 + 0.05, and 0.90 + 0.03 for Q24a, E142A, K193S, R235S, and R237S, respectively. Since the reaction proceeds via an ordered ternary complex with acyl-ACP binding first, the results are consistent with the three residues being involved in G-3-P binding. The H194S mutant had ∼80% of the biological activity of the wild type enzyme, indicating that this residue is not so critical for binding and catalysis. We also mutated Glu142, which lies in the H(X)4D box to Ala. This residue is conserved in all plant G3PAT enzymes. The resultant E142A protein is biologically inactive, indicating that it plays an important role in the enzyme. Replacing the Glu with an Ala changes the local hydrogen bonding environment close to the presumptive G-3-P binding site and presumably perturbs the structure in such a way that the enzyme is catalytically inactive. High resolution x-ray diffraction data were collected for crystals of the K193S, R235S, and R237S mutant enzymes, and the three-dimensional structures were solved using molecular replacement methods employing programs from the CCP4 suite (data not shown). Pairwise superposition using the program LSQKAB (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) of the structures of the mutant enzymes with that of the wild type G3PAT structure gave root mean square displacements of Cα positions ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 Å, which indicate that the structures of these enzymes are highly homologous. Therefore, the replacement of any of these residues with a serine residue inactivates the enzyme without major perturbation of the three-dimensional structure. Additionally, the structure of the L261F mutant is also highly homologous to the wild type structure with a root mean square displacement of Cα distances of 0.1 Å.

Nature. 1992; 356: 710-713Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar), which code for the non-selective enzyme into tobacco, has confirmed the importance of the acyl group composition on chilling resistance in plants. Studies using chimeric protein constructs between the pea and the squash enzymes have indicated that the central portion of the enzyme is probably important in substrate selectivity (25Ferri S.R. Toguri T. Arch. Biochim. Biophys. 1997; 337: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However these studies have been compromised by the use of non-physiological conditions and substrate analogues. In this study we have developed in vitro assays that discriminate between selective and non-selective plant G3PATs. It is interesting to note that BSA, which is known to bind fatty acids, has a significant effect on this assay, prompting us to suggest that chloroplasts may contain an acyl-binding protein equivalent to the acyl-CoA-binding protein present in the cytoplasm (26Brown A.P. Johnson P. Rawsthorne S. Hills M.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 629-635Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutation of a single residue L261F causes major changes in substrate selectivity, and from modeling studies this is likely to be due to masking of the hydrophobic cleft. The exact nature of the interactions between the enzyme and fatty acyl substrate awaits further three-dimensional structural data on a binary complex of the enzyme with substrate. However, the modeling studies combined with the site-directed mutagenesis studies presented here have indicated that changing Leu261 to a phenylalanine residue alters specificity from a non-selective enzyme to one that preferentially incorporates C18:1 ACP. Given that our crystallographic studies reveal no other changes in enzyme structure, the bulky hydrophobic nature of the phenylalanine side chain must alter the shape of the binding pocket so that a lower binding affinity and rate of catalysis are observed with the C16:0 substrate (K m three times higher andK cat 50%), while the affinity and catalytic rate with the C18:1 substrate remain unchanged compared with the wild type protein. Since knowledge of the active site of the enzyme is important to understand how it functions, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis on amino acid residues proposed from modeling studies to be involved in G-3-P and acyl-ACP binding. Our results are consistent with Lys193, Arg235, and Arg237 as residues important in binding the negatively charged phosphate group of G-3-P. Clear evidence cannot be obtained on the site of acyl-ACP binding, and this will require further studies either using a catalytically inactive enzyme to obtain a suitable enzyme complex or appropriate binding studies using photo-affinity probes. Such studies will be the basis of future work."

Superoxide radicals seem to participate in AMPH-induced damage because its toxicity is attenuated in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase transgenic (SOD-tg) mice. To provide a detailed analysis of molecular changes associated with AMPH toxicity, we used cDNA arrays consisting of 1176 genes to detect differential changes in gene expression in the striata of wild-type and SOD-tg mice treated with neurotoxic doses of the drug. We found 42 genes that showed >1.8-fold changes in at least two consecutive time points during the course of the study and were differentially affected by AMPH in the two genotypes. Specifically, more transcription factors and genes involved in responses to injury/inflammation were affected in wild-type mice after AMPH administration. Some of these stimulant-induced superoxide-dependent alterations in gene expression might affect neuronal functions and promote neuronal damage. Other changes might help to provide some degree of protection against AMPH toxicity. These results support the view that the use of global array analysis of gene expression will help to identify novel molecular mediators of AMPH-induced neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2092154530,"Leukocytic inflammation can be limited by inhibiting selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling. In spite of intensive efforts to develop small molecule selectin inhibitors with defined structure-activity profiles, inhibition of P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling in vivo by such a compound has yet to be described. We recently reported that glycosulfopeptides (GSP), modeled on the high affinity selectin ligand PSGL-1, inhibit leukocyte binding to P-selectin in vitro. Here, we have used intravital microscopy to investigate whether GSP can inhibit P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling in vivo. Surgical preparation of the mouse cremaster muscle for intravital microscopy induced P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling. Baseline rolling was recorded for 1 min followed by i.v. injection of GSP. 2-GSP-6 and 4-GSP-6 substantially reversed P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling, whereas control GSP, which are not fully glycosylated, did not. Inhibition of leukocyte rolling by 2- and 4-GSP-6 lasted 2-4 min. Clearance studies with 125I-labeled 4-GSP-6 demonstrated rapid reduction in its circulating levels concurrent with accumulation in urine. These data represent the first demonstration that a precisely defined structure based on a natural P-selectin ligand can inhibit P-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling in vivo."
