https://openalex.org/W2007593295,"Tubular nanostructures are suggested to have a wide range of applications in nanotechnology. We report our observation of the self-assembly of a very short peptide, the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid diphenylalanine structural motif, into discrete and stiff nanotubes. Reduction of ionic silver within the nanotubes, followed by enzymatic degradation of the peptide backbone, resulted in the production of discrete nanowires with a long persistence length. The same dipeptide building block, made of D-phenylalanine, resulted in the production of enzymatically stable nanotubes."
https://openalex.org/W1964551999,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by features reminiscent of marked premature ageing. Here, we present evidence of mutations in lamin A (LMNA) as the cause of this disorder. The HGPS gene was initially localized to chromosome 1q by observing two cases of uniparental isodisomy of 1q-the inheritance of both copies of this material from one parent-and one case with a 6-megabase paternal interstitial deletion. Sequencing of LMNA, located in this interval and previously implicated in several other heritable disorders, revealed that 18 out of 20 classical cases of HGPS harboured an identical de novo (that is, newly arisen and not inherited) single-base substitution, G608G(GGC > GGT), within exon 11. One additional case was identified with a different substitution within the same codon. Both of these mutations result in activation of a cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in production of a protein product that deletes 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminus. Immunofluorescence of HGPS fibroblasts with antibodies directed against lamin A revealed that many cells show visible abnormalities of the nuclear membrane. The discovery of the molecular basis of this disease may shed light on the general phenomenon of human ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2021050536,"A central issue in stem cell biology is to understand the mechanisms that regulate the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are required for haematopoiesis to persist for the lifetime of the animal. We found that adult and fetal mouse and adult human HSCs express the proto-oncogene Bmi-1. The number of HSCs in the fetal liver of Bmi-1-/- mice was normal. In postnatal Bmi-1-/- mice, the number of HSCs was markedly reduced. Transplanted fetal liver and bone marrow cells obtained from Bmi-1-/- mice were able to contribute only transiently to haematopoiesis. There was no detectable self-renewal of adult HSCs, indicating a cell autonomous defect in Bmi-1-/- mice. A gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of stem cell associated genes, cell survival genes, transcription factors, and genes modulating proliferation including p16Ink4a and p19Arf was altered in bone marrow cells of the Bmi-1-/- mice. Expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in normal HSCs resulted in proliferative arrest and p53-dependent cell death, respectively. Our results indicate that Bmi-1 is essential for the generation of self-renewing adult HSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2088411222,"Eukaryotic 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prxs) not only act as antioxidants, but also appear to regulate hydrogen peroxide-mediated signal transduction. We show that bacterial 2-Cys Prxs are much less sensitive to oxidative inactivation than are eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs. By identifying two sequence motifs unique to the sensitive 2-Cys Prxs and comparing the crystal structure of a bacterial 2-Cys Prx at 2.2 angstrom resolution with other Prx structures, we define the structural origins of sensitivity. We suggest this adaptation allows 2-Cys Prxs to act as floodgates, keeping resting levels of hydrogen peroxide low, while permitting higher levels during signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1662084969,"Block copolymer micelles are water-soluble biocompatible nanocontainers with great potential for delivering hydrophobic drugs. An understanding of their cellular distribution is essential to achieving selective delivery of drugs at the subcellular level. Triple-labeling confocal microscopy in live cells revealed the localization of micelles in several cytoplasmic organelles, including mitochondria, but not in the nucleus. Moreover, micelles change the cellular distribution of and increase the amount of the agent delivered to the cells. These micelles may thus be worth exploring for their potential to selectively deliver drugs to specified subcellular targets."
https://openalex.org/W2073893553,"Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and tau polymerize into amyloid fibrils and form intraneuronal filamentous inclusions characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that alpha-syn induces fibrillization of tau and that coincubation of tau and alpha-syn synergistically promotes fibrillization of both proteins. The in vivo relevance of these findings is grounded in the co-occurrence of alpha-syn and tau filamentous amyloid inclusions in humans, in single transgenic mice that express A53T human alpha-syn in neurons, and in oligodendrocytes of bigenic mice that express wild-type human alpha-syn plus P301L mutant tau. This suggests that interactions between alpha-syn and tau can promote their fibrillization and drive the formation of pathological inclusions in human neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2017642315,"The active-site cysteine of peroxiredoxins is selectively oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid during catalysis, which leads to inactivation of peroxidase activity. This oxidation was thought to be irreversible. However, by metabolic labeling of mammalian cells with 35 S, we show that the sulfinic form of peroxiredoxin I, produced during the exposure of cells to H 2 O 2 , is rapidly reduced to the catalytically active thiol form. The mammalian cells' ability to reduce protein sulfinic acid might serve as a mechanism to repair oxidatively damaged proteins or represent a new type of cyclic modification by which the function of various proteins is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2146053166,"We report the direct observation by x-ray diffraction of a photoinduced paraelectric-to-ferroelectric structural phase transition using monochromatic 100-picosecond synchrotron pulses. It occurs in tetrathiafulvalene-p-chloranil, a charge-transfer molecular material in which electronic and structural changes are strongly coupled. An optical 300-femtosecond laser pulse switches the material from a neutral to an ionic state on a 500-picosecond time scale and, by virtue of intrinsic cooperativity, generates self-organized long-range structural order. The x-ray data indicate a macroscopic ferroelectric reorganization after the laser irradiation. Refinement of the structures before and after laser irradiation indicates structural changes at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2142965179,"Upon fertilization, remodeling of condensed maternal and paternal gamete DNA occurs to form the diploid genome. In Xenopus laevis, nucleoplasmin 2 (NPM2) decondenses sperm DNA in vitro. To study chromatin remodeling in vivo, we isolated mammalian NPM2 orthologs. Mouse NPM2 accumulates in oocyte nuclei and persists in preimplantation embryos. Npm2 knockout females have fertility defects owing to failed preimplantation embryo development. Although sperm DNA decondensation proceeds without NPM2, abnormalities are evident in oocyte and early embryonic nuclei. These defects include an absence of coalesced nucleolar structures and loss of heterochromatin and deacetylated histone H3 that normally circumscribe nucleoli in oocytes and early embryos, respectively. Thus, Npm2 is a maternal effect gene critical for nuclear and nucleolar organization and embryonic development."

https://openalex.org/W2029428999,"Interactions with ankyrinG are crucial to the localization of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at the axon initial segment and for neurons to initiate action potentials. However, the molecular nature of these interactions remains unclear. Here we report that VGSC-α, but not -β, subunits bind to ankyrinG using pull-down assays. Further dissection of this activity identifies a conserved 9-amino acid motif ((V/A)P(I/L)AXXE(S/D)D) required for ankyrinG binding. This motif is also required for the localization of chimeric neurofascin/sodium channel molecules to the initial segment of cultured hippocampal neurons. The conserved nature of this motif suggests that it functions to localize sodium channels to a variety of “excitable” membrane domains both inside and outside of the nervous system.

The concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VGSC, voltage-gated sodium channel; IS, initial segment; CAM, cell adhesion molecule; MB, membrane binding; GST, glutathione S-tranferase; aa, amino acid; BHK, baby hamster kidney; α-MEM, minimum essential medium α; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NF, neurofascin; aa, amino acid(s). into excitable membrane domains is crucial to information processing and transmission in the nervous system and to excitation/contraction coupling in muscle. Localized concentrations of VGSCs at the initial segment (IS) and the nodes of Ranvier are necessary for the initiation and propagation of action potentials through myelinated axons. However, mechanisms underlying the localization of VGSCs to these excitable membrane domains remain relatively unknown. In neurons, VGSCs exist as heterotrimers composed of a large pore-forming α subunit associated with two smaller accessory β subunits (reviewed in Ref. 1Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar).

Schachner M. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15753-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and other CAMs such as neurofascin (6Ratcliffe C.F. Westenbroek R.E. Curtis R. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Polarized localization of VGSCs in the axonal membrane requires interactions with members of the ankyrin family of peripheral membrane proteins (reviewed in Ref. 7Bennett V. Lambert S. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 303-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ankyrins function as membrane-cytoskeleton adaptors that immobilize integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. Ankyrins co-purify with and directly bind to purified VGSCs (8Srinivasan Y. Elmer L. Davis J. Bennett V. Angelides K. Nature. 1988; 333: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and specific isoforms of the ankyrinG gene are concentrated with VGSCs at the IS (9Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), the nodes of Ranvier (9Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the interaction between ankyrinG and VGSCs is demonstrated in knockouts of ankyrinG in the mouse cerebellum. Purkinje cells from knockout animals are deficient in localized VGSC concentrations at the IS (11Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and are unable to initiate action potentials (12Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In addition to VGSCs, ankyrins also interact with a variety of other integral membrane proteins present at the node including the CAMs neurofascin and NrCAM (13Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 109-117Crossref Google Scholar, 14Lambert S. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7025-7036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions of ankyrins with VGSCs (15Srinivasan Y. Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other integral membrane proteins are mediated through the N-terminal 90-kDa repeat or membrane-binding (MB) domain. The interaction between the ankyrin MB domain and neurofascin/NrCAM is dependent upon a conserved FIGQY motif in the cytoplasmic domain of these molecules (16Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike neurofascin and NrCAM, the nature of the interaction between VGSCs and ankyrins remains unclear. Initial studies using uncharacterized rat brain preparations of VGSCs and purified erythrocyte ankyrin (15Srinivasan Y. Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not distinguish which VGSC subunits or their isoforms were involved in ankyrin binding. Subsequent studies using a variety of techniques have suggested sites for ankyrin interaction on both the VGSC β (17Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and α subunits (18Bouzidi M. Tricaud N. Giraud P. Kordeli E. Caillol G. Deleuze C. Couraud F.

In this study, we identified a domain of the VGSC-α subunit that interacts with ankyrinG and demonstrated its role in the localization of VGSCs to the IS in vivo. Initially we observed that rNav1.2 (rat Nav1.2) co-localizes with ankyrinG at the IS of hippocampal neurons and identified an ankyrinG-binding site in the cytoplasmic linker between domains II and III (loop 2), using a pull-down assay. We did not detect binding sites for ankyrinG elsewhere within the α subunit nor did we detect binding with the β subunits using this assay. We further identified a 9-aa motif within the loop 2 sequence that is conserved among all vertebrate α subunits and demonstrated its requirement in ankyrinG binding. Finally, we demonstrated that deletion of this 9-aa motif abolishes the ability of neurofascin/loop 2 chimeric molecules to be localized to the IS of cultured hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate that ankyrin binding is conserved among vertebrate sodium channels and is crucial to the localization of VGSCs to excitable membrane domains. Cell Culture and Transfection—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α (α-MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent in serum-free α-MEM following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Typically, 4 μg of total DNA was used on ≈106 cells in 60 mm-dishes. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of 18-day-old fetal Wistar rats and transfected using a modified calcium/phosphate protocol as described (19Banker G. Goslin K. Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis of Primary Hippocampal Neurons— For immunostaining of primary hippocampal neurons, coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and processed as described (19Banker G. Goslin K. Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Nav1.2 (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or mouse anti-Myc (1:1000; Covance, Berkeley, CA), and chicken anti-ankyrinG 480/270 kDa (1:2000; (14Lambert S. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7025-7036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). For neurons transfected with neurofascin/loop 2 chimeras, cells were incubated with a mouse anti-HA antibody (1:2000; Covance) before permeabilization and staining with the chicken anti-ankyrinG 270/480-kDa antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with Alexa 594-nm conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488 nm goat anti-chicken (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescent images were captured on a Leica DM IRE2 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) using an ORCA ER extended-range cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Inc.) and Openlab software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Construction of Plasmids for Protein Expression—Rat cDNAs for the β1 and β2 subunits of the voltage-gated sodium channels (a gift from Dr. L. L. Isom, University of Michigan) were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) (not in frame with the downstream GFP), and a sequence coding for the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted by PCR at a position corresponding to aa 26 for β1 and 34 for β2 (see Fig. 1b). Constructs were verified by sequencing. cDNA constructs encoding combinations of different domains of the rNav1.2a molecule (full-length cDNA for rNav1.2a was a gift from Dr. A. L. Goldin, University of California, Irvine, CA) fused to the C terminus of GFP (see Figs. 1 and 2) were obtained using PCR and standard molecular biology techniques. Similarly, PCR was used to generate a series of chimeric channels (see Fig. 3) encompassing areas of loop 1 from rNav1.2a (aa 599–694, construct II-1-III) and loop 2 from rNav1.1 (aa 1033–1131, construct II-III (1.1)), rNav1.6 (aa 1014–1108, construct II-III (1.6)), rNav1.4 (aa 837–933, construct II-III (1.4)), and rNav1.5 (aa 983–1102, construct II-III (1.5)). These substitutions were based on a sequence alignment of the whole loop 2 region of these isoforms with rNav1.2a (see Fig. 2c). Rat cDNAs for Nav1.1, Nav1.6, and Nav1.4 were gifts from Dr. A. L. Goldin, Dr. J. H. Caldwell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) and Dr. J. S. Trimmer (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY), respectively. A partial cDNA for rNav1.5 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the Prostar kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on rat heart mRNA isolated with the Oligotex kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) following the manufacturers' specifications. Deletion of consensus sequence VPIAXX-ESD in constructs II-III and II-III (1.5) was obtained by “loop-out” mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions (constructs II-IIIΔ and II-IIIΔ (1.5), respectively; see Fig. 3).Fig. 3Loop 2 is sufficient and the 9-aa motif necessary to promote ankyrinG association. a, chimeric neurofascin/loop 2 molecules. Diagrammatic representation (top panel) of chimeric neurofascin molecules using loop 2 sequences from Nav1.2 and Nav1.2Δ (a deletion of the VPIAXXESD motif). NF Y81A was used as a negative control for ankyrinG association. These constructs (bottom panel) were expressed in BHK cells and the lysates incubated with MB-GST (+ lanes)- or GST (– lanes)-conjugated beads. Bound proteins (left) or 6% of the total cell lysate used (right) was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to HA. b, Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain was co-transformed with pBTM116-Nav1.5 or pBTM116-Nav1.5Δ (lacking the 9-aa motif) and pGAD424 alone or pGAD424-MB. The cytoplasmic domain of wild type neurofascin or the Y81A mutation was used as a positive or negative control, respectively, for the interaction with MB. Co-transformants were selected on solid media lacking tryptophan and leucine and then tested for activation of the HIS3 reporter gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Neurofascin/Na v Chimeric Molecules—Full-length cDNAs encoding HA-tagged neurofascin 186-kDa isoforms were a gift from Dr. Vann Bennett (Duke University, Durham, NC), and their preparation has already been described (20Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The 500-bp ApaI–NotI fragment representing the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin was subcloned into pBlue-script (Stratagene), and the Y81A mutation was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) before the altered cytoplasmic domain fragments were re-introduced into full-length neurofascin molecules. PCR products representing the loop 2 sequence from Nav1.2a and -1.2Δ (Nav1.2a missing the VPIAXXESD motif) were modified to include a 5′ in-frame ApaI site and a 3′ stop codon upstream of a NotI site. These products were then substituted for the neurofascin-cytoplasmic domain in full-length HA-tagged neurofascin (NF) 186-kDa molecules to generate neurofascin/Nav chimeric molecules (see Figs. 3 and 4). Sindbis Pseudovirions—PCR was used to generate a 3′ fusion of the 24-ankyrin repeats from rat ankyrinG (MB, aa 1–853) with sequence-encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). The cDNA for MB-GST, or GST alone, was cloned into the pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) and used as a template to synthesize capped RNA transcripts in vitro with the Invitroscript CAP kit (Invitrogen). The transcripts were electroporated into BHK cells along with similarly prepared transcripts encoding the structural genes for the DH(26S) helper phage. BHK cells were then cultured in α-MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h, and the media containing Sindbis pseudovirions for MB-GST or GST were collected, aliquoted, and kept at–80 °C. In Vitro Ankyrin G Binding Assay—Media enriched with Sindbis pseudovirions for MB-GST or GST were diluted in serum-free α-MEM, and optimal viral dilutions were determined to obtain high and reproducible levels of protein expression. 450 μl of these dilutions were applied to ≈106 BHK cells in 60-mm dishes and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with intermittent rocking. Then 4 ml/dish α-MEM with 1% FBS (v/v) was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min on ice with 600 μl/dish lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant containing MB-GST or GST was incubated with one-fifth volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in a 50% slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocker. The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer and kept on ice before use. For pull-down experiments with MB-GST or GST alone as a control, BHK cells were transfected with GFP-Nav or neurofascin/Nav chimeric constructs as described above and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed as above in 600 μl/60-mm dish of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. 300 μl of cell lysate was then added to either 20 μl of MB-GST beads or 20 μl of GST beads and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The concentration of MB-GST or GST used in each pull-down was typically 2 μm. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted twice with 1 bed volume of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Cell lysates and proteins associated with MB-GST and GST were probed by immunoblotting using antibodies to GFP (Covance) or the HA tag (Covance). Similarly, cell lysates were analyzed to ensure expression of the tagged protein, and batches of beads used in the assays were analyzed using antibodies to GST to ensure the presence of the MB-GST and GST proteins (not shown). Yeast Two-hybrid System—The MB domain from ankyrinG was subcloned in frame with the Gal4 activation domain into LEU2-marked prey vector pGAD424 (a gift from Dr. Peter Pryciak, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). The loop 2 EcoRI cassettes described above were subcloned in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain into TRP1-marked bait vector pBTM116. The cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin in its wild type form or carrying the Y81A mutation was also subcloned into pBTM116 to be used respectively as the positive or negative control for interaction with MB. Yeast strain L40, harboring the HIS3 reporter gene under the control of LexA-binding sites, was co-transformed with 50 ng each of the bait and prey vector using the lithium/acetate method and then streaked out onto agar plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. For each transformation, six independent clones were selected and replica-plated onto media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine to assess expression of the HIS3 reporter gene. Na v 1.2 Co-localizes with Ankyrin G in Vivo and Binds to Its Repeat Domain in Vitro—Rat hippocampal neurons in culture (11 days in vitro) were double-labeled with an antibody against the conserved tail region of ankyrinG 480/270 kDa (Fig. 1a, ank G 480/270 kDa) and with a specific antibody against the C-terminal end of rNav1.2 (Fig. 1a, rNa v 1.2). Neurons exhibited localized concentrations of rNav1.2 at their IS coincident with similar concentrations of ankyrinG 480/270 kDa. We developed a pull-down assay to determine ankyrinG-binding sites within defined subunits and domains of rNav1.2a using a GST fusion of the repeat domain (MB) of ankyrinG (MB-GST). This construct was expressed at high levels in BHK cells using the Sindbis viral expression system and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Similar beads coupled to GST alone were used as controls for each assay. To test for interactions with β subunits, beads were added to cell lysates from BHK cells expressing HA-tagged β1 and β2 subunits (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1b, these subunits did not exhibit interactions with MB-GST. To test for interactions with the rNav1.2a α subunit, we incubated MB-GST and GST beads with BHK cell lysates expressing full-length rNav1.2a. However, we were unable to obtain efficient solubilization of the full-length rNav1.2a protein under the non-denaturing conditions used in our binding assay (data not shown). We therefore generated a series of GFP-tagged constructs that spanned rNav1.2a (Fig. 1c) in which we tried to maintain the structure of the cytoplasmic loops while preserving the integrity of the transmembrane domains (Fig. 1c). Constructs spanning the rNav1.2a α subunits III-IV, II-III, and the III domain all precipitated with MB-GST beads and not with GST beads alone (Fig. 1c). This interaction did not appear to involve the C terminus of rNav1.2a as deletion of this region of the molecule from construct III-IV (construct III-IVΔC) did not interfere with its ability to interact with MB-GST. In contrast, domain I-II of rNav1.2a and a GFP fusion of the cytoplasmic C terminus alone (not shown) did not exhibit interactions with MB-GST. These results suggested the presence of a site of ankyrinG interaction between aa 1044 and 1474 of rNav1.2a. Further studies in which individual cytoplasmic loops of the III-IV construct were replaced sequentially with the nonbinding N terminus of rNav1.2a confirmed that the binding site was restricted to loop II-III (not shown). These results are in contrast to the findings of Bouzidi et al. (18Bouzidi M. Tricaud N. Giraud P. Kordeli E. Caillol G. Deleuze C. Couraud F. Alcaraz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28996-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) who recently reported interactions between ankyrinG and fusion proteins representing the isolated intracellular loops between domains I-II and III-IV but not between the II-III loop and ankyrinG. Ankyrin G Associates with a Conserved 9-aa Motif in Loop 2 of VGSC-α Subunits—To further define the ankyrinG-binding site within loop 2, we used deletion analyses. An internal deletion of aa 1024–1121 in loop 2 or its substitution with a portion of loop 1 (aa 599–694) (Fig. 2a, constructs II-Δ-III and II-1-III, respectively) abolishes the interaction with MB-GST restricting the binding site to aa 1044–1121 of rNav1.2a. Fig. 2c shows an alignment of the sequence of loop 2 between rat VGSCs. A high degree of homology is observed between aa 1024–1121 of rNav1.2a and the analogous region of other neuronal isoforms (87, 76, 71, and 65% identity with rNav1.1, -1.3, -1.6, and -1.7, respectively) with the exception of rNav1.8 and rNav1.9 (only 15 and 26% identity, respectively). This region is less well conserved between rNav1.2a and the skeletal muscle and cardiac isoforms rNav1.4 (41% identity) and rNav1.5 (16% identity), respectively. We decided to exploit the range of conservation within various loop 2 sequences to further map the site of ankyrinG interaction. We substituted aa 1024–1121 in construct II-III with the analogous region (Fig. 2c) of rNav1.1, rNav1.6, rNav1.4, and rNav1.5 to generate four chimeras (II-III (1.1), II-III (1.6), II-III (1.4), and II-III (1.5)). These constructs were expressed in BHK cells and used in pull-down assays with MB-GST as before. Chimeras II-III (1.1), II-III (1.6), and II-III (1.4) were specifically precipitated by MB (Fig. 2b). Despite its low level of homology, chimera II-III (1.5) also retained the ability to bind to MB (Fig. 2b). Careful analysis of the sequence of these five isoforms revealed only one stretch of nine amino acids conserved in this region, VPIAXXESD (indicated in bold in Fig. 2c), corresponding to aa 1105–1113 in rNav1.2a and located within the binding region defined previously. We selectively deleted this sequence of 9 aa in constructs II-III and II-III (1.5) using loop-out mutagenesis to obtain the deletion mutants II-IIIΔ and II-IIIΔ (1.5), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2d, deletion of this 9-aa motif resulted in a loss of binding to MB-GST. The sequence VPIAXXESD is thus necessary for association of both II-III and II-III (1.5) with MB and defines a binding sequence for ankyrinG within the α subunit rNav1.2a. Fig. 2e shows that this motif is conserved among rat VGSCs regardless of the overall degree of homology in loop 2. We have found that its presence is associated with binding to MB-GST in at least six isoforms (indicated with a “+” in Fig. 2e) including the lesser conserved motif observed in rNav1.9 (APLAEVEDD, not shown). The sequence (V/A)P(I/L)AXXE(S/D)D thus defines a conserved motif in the α subunits of VGSCs involved in the binding of ankyrinG. To test whether loop 2 and the conserved 9-aa motif were sufficient and necessary for ankyrinG association, we constructed chimeric molecules consisting of HA-tagged neurofascin extracellular domain fused to the loop 2 sequence (Fig. 3a). Loop 2 sequences from rNav1.2a and a variant of rNav1.2a lacking the 9-aa motif (rNav1.2Δ) were utilized (Fig. 3a). These chimeric constructs along with wild type neurofascin 186 kDa were used in pull-down assays with MB-GST. As a negative control, we mutated the tyrosine residue within the FIGQY motif of wild type neurofascin to an alanine (NF Y81A). Phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue has been previously shown to abolish ankyrin binding (20Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fig. 3a shows that chimeric molecules containing loop 2 sequences from rNav1.2a (NF 1.2) exhibited interactions with MB-GST suggesting that loop 2 alone was sufficient to promote association with ankyrinG. However, deletion of the conserved 9-aa motif (NF 1.2Δ) led to a loss of MB-GST interaction. As expected, wild type neurofascin associated strongly with MB-GST, whereas mutation of the tyrosine residue to alanine (NF Y81A) abolished this interaction despite comparable expression levels (Fig. 3a). The observation that a single aa change can abolish ankyrin binding illustrated the sensitivity and specificity of our pull-down assay using MB-GST. Our data demonstrate that loop 2 and the conserved 9-aa motif are necessary for ankyrinG binding. To determine whether the loop 2/ankyrinG interaction involved proteins specific to BHK cell lysates, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid reaction. As shown in Fig. 3b, the loop 2 sequence from rNav1.5 fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (pBTM Nav1.5) was able to activate expression of the L40 HIS3 reporter gene when co-transfected with the MB sequence fused to the Gal4 activation domain (pGAD MB). His3 was not expressed when pBTM Nav1.5 was co-transfected with the Gal4 activation domain alone nor when a mutated version of rNav1.5 lacking the 9-aa motif (pBTM Nav1.5Δ) was used. The wild type neurofascin cytoplasmic domain and the Y81A variant of this domain were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 3b). Similar studies involving loop 2 sequences from Nav1.2 and -1.6 could not be carried out as these constructs were observed to transactivate reporter genes in the absence of pGAD MB. The Conserved 9-aa Motif Affects Localization to the IS of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—To determine whether loop 2 and the 9-aa motif affected localization of membrane proteins at the IS, we utilized the neurofascin/loop 2 chimeric constructs. These molecules were transfected into 3 days in vitro hippocampal cells, and these cells were fixed and stained with HA antibodies at various time points after transfection to determine when and where these proteins could be first detected on the cell surface. Cells were then permeabilized and stained with antibodies to ankyrinG 480/270 kDa to delineate the IS. As shown in Fig. 4, ∼75% of neurons 6 h after transfection with neurofascin/loop 2 chimeric molecules (NF 1.2) exhibited concentrated HA staining at their IS (Fig. 4A) as delineated by ankyrinG staining (Fig. 4A, inset). Staining was also observed on the cell body of transfected neurons. 24 h after transfection, ∼90% of the neurons now exhibited HA concentrations at the IS, and neuronal cell body staining was diminished compared with the signal at the IS (Fig. 4E). In contrast to wild type loop 2 molecules, chimeric molecules lacking the 9-aa motif (NF 1.2Δ) were observed over the surface of the entire neuron and did not exhibit concentration at the IS even at later time points (Fig. 4, B and F). Indeed, at earlier time points NF 1.2Δ showed increased concentrations at the distal end of the axon (Fig. 4B). We also introduced wild type and Y81A neurofascin constructs into hippocampal neurons. Unlike NF 1.2, wild type neurofascin did not immediately exhibit concentrations at the IS except in a small population of neurons (<10%). Instead, HA staining was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 4G) in a similar fashion to that observed for the Y81A mutant (Fig. 4D). However, NF was observed to accumulate over time at the IS, such that between 45 and 65% of transfected neurons showed IS accumulations of neurofascin at 24 h after transfection (Fig. 4G). Similar concentrations were not observed for the Y81A mutation (Fig. 4H) supporting the idea that concentration of chimeric constructs at the IS is independent of the neurofascin extracellular domain. These results indicate that the 9-aa motif is necessary for the specific localization of neurofascin/loop 2 chimeric constructs at the IS. In this study, we describe for the first time the identification of a conserved motif in the family of VGSC-α subunits necessary for their binding to ankyrinG. Initially, we observe that ankyrinG co-localizes with rNav1.2 at the IS of cultured hippocampal neurons and interacts with the domain II-III cytoplasmic linker (loop 2) of rNav1.2a. This represents the first specific function that has been ascribed to this area of VGSC-α subunits. We provide evidence to show that ankyrinG binding may be a common feature of the VGSC-α subunit family and further identifies a conserved 9-aa motif within loop 2 sequences that is necessary for ankyrinG binding. Finally, we demonstrate that the 9-aa motif is required for the localization of neurofascin/loop 2 chimeric molecules to the IS of cultured neurons. Based on these observations, we propose that the 9-aa motif functions in the concentration of VGSCs within excitable membrane domains through interacti"

The most stable structure of Li3Al4(-) found theoretically contained a rectangular Al4(4-) tetraanion stabilized by the three Li+ ions in a capped octahedral arrangement. Molecular orbital analyses reveal that the rectangular Al4(4-) tetraanion has four pi electrons, consistent with the 4n Hückel rule for antiaromaticity."

This hummingbird is the sole pollinator of H. caribaea and H. bihai, with flowers of the former corresponding to the short, straight bills of males, the larger sex, and flowers of the latter corresponding to the long, curved bills of females. On St. Lucia, H. bihai compensates for the rarity of H. caribaea by evolving a second color morph with flowers that match the bills of males, whereas on Dominica, H. caribaea evolves a second color morph with flowers that match the bills of females. The nectar rewards of all Heliconia morphs are consistent with each sex's choice of the morph that corresponds to its bill morphology and energy requirements, supporting the hypothesis that feeding preferences have driven their coadaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2160993282,"Glycomics, the study of microbial polysaccharides and genes responsible for their formation, requires the continuous development of rapid and sensitive methods for the identification of glycan structures. In this study, methods for the direct analysis of sugars from 108 to 1010 cells are outlined using the human gastrointestinal pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni. Using capillary-electrophoresis coupled with sensitive electrospray mass spectrometry, we demonstrate variability in the lipid A component of C. jejuni lipooligosaccharides (LOSs). In addition, these sensitive methods have permitted the detection of phase-variable LOS core structures that were not observed previously. High resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR was used to examine capsular polysaccharides directly from campylobacter cells and showed profiles similar to those observed for purified polysaccharides analyzed by solution NMR. This method also exhibited the feasibility of campylobacter serotyping, mutant verification, and preliminary sugar analysis. HR-MAS NMR examination of growth from individual colonies of C. jejuni NCTC11168 indicated that the capsular glycan modifications are also phase-variable. These variants show different staining patterns on deoxycholate-PAGE and reactivity with immune sera. One of the identified modifications was a novel -OP=O(NH2)OMe phosphoramide, not observed previously in nature. In addition, HR-MAS NMR detected the N-linked glycan, GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,4-[Glc-beta1,3-]GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,4-GalNAc-alpha1,3-Bac, where Bac is 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucopyranose, in C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli. The presence of this common heptasaccharide in multiple campylobacter isolates demonstrates the conservation of the N-linked protein glycosylation pathway in this organism and describes the first report of HR-MAS NMR detection of N-linked glycans on glycoproteins from intact bacterial cells."

Additives such as lysozyme, NaCl, and K2SO4 increased the half-life of the enzyme by 3.5-, 33.4-, and 23.7-fold respectively, from its initial value at 60 °C. The activation energy increased from 60.3 kcal mol–1 to 72.9, 76.1, and 88.3 kcal mol–1, whereas the entropy of activation increased from 104 to 141, 147, and 184 cal·mol–1·deg–1 in the presence of 7.1 × 10–5m lysozyme, 1 m NaCl, and 0.2 m K2SO4, respectively. The thermal unfolding of GOD in the temperature range of 25–90 °C was studied using circular dichroism measurements at 222, 274, and 375 nm. Size exclusion chromatography was employed to follow the state of association of enzyme and dissociation of FAD from GOD. The midpoint for thermal inactivation of residual activity and the dissociation of FAD was 59 °C, whereas the corresponding midpoint for loss of secondary and tertiary structure was 62 °C. Dissociation of FAD from the holoenzyme was responsible for the thermal inactivation of GOD. The irreversible nature of inactivation was caused by a change in the state of association of apoenzyme. The dissociation of FAD resulted in the loss of secondary and tertiary structure, leading to the unfolding and nonspecific aggregation of the enzyme molecule because of hydrophobic interactions of side chains. This confirmed the critical role of FAD in structure and activity. Cysteine oxidation did not contribute to the nonspecific aggregation.

Glucose oxidase (β-d-glucose:oxygen-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.4) from Aspergillus niger is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the oxidation of β-d-glucose to d-glucono-δ-lactone and hydrogen peroxide, using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor.

Kubicek C.P. Kominek J. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology. 3. Verlag Chemie Weinheim, Muenchen1983: 455-456Google Scholar, 2Turner A.P.F. Karube I. Wilson G.S.

This protein is a dimer of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 160,000 (4Tsuge H. Natsuakai O. Ohashi K. J. Biochem. 1975; 78: 835-843Google Scholar). The dimer contains two disulfide bonds, two free sulfhydryl groups (4Tsuge H. Natsuakai O. Ohashi K. J. Biochem. 1975; 78: 835-843Google Scholar), and two FAD molecules (tightly bound) not covalently linked to the enzyme (5Swoboda B.E.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 175: 365-369Google Scholar). The dimer has a high degree of localization of negative charges on the enzyme surface and dimer interface (6Ahmed A. Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1945-1955Google Scholar). The flavin cofactors are responsible for the oxidation-reduction properties of the enzyme (7Jones M.N. Manley P. Wilkinson A. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 285-291Google Scholar). Under denaturing conditions, the subunits of GOD dissociate accompanied by the loss of cofactor FAD (7Jones M.N. Manley P. Wilkinson A. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 285-291Google Scholar, 8O'Malley J.J. Weaver J.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3527-3532Google Scholar). Various additives such as salts, mono- and polyhydric alcohols, and polyelectrolytes were used to increase the thermal stability of GOD (9Ye W.N. Combes D. Manson P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 498-502Google Scholar, 10Appleton B. Gibson T.D. Woodward J.R. Sens. Actutor B. 1997; 43: 65-69Google Scholar). The effectiveness of additives depended on the nature of enzyme, its hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, and the degree of its interaction with the additives (9Ye W.N. Combes D. Manson P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 498-502Google Scholar). Aggregation, the main causative factor for the inactivation of glucose oxidase, could be prevented by modifying the microenvironment of the enzyme (11Ye W.N. Combes D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 999: 86-93Google Scholar). The thermal stability of GOD at 60 °C could be increased by incorporating lysozyme as an additive during immobilization. The role played by the complementarity of surface charges of the enzyme and lysozyme appeared to be crucial in the stabilization of GOD (12Gouda M.D. Thakur M.S. Karanth N.G. Electroanalysis. 2001; 13: 849-855Google Scholar). The presence of salt ions (primarily sulfate) is known to increase the stability of the folded conformations of proteins (13Baldwin R.L. Biophys. J. 7. 1996; 1: 2056-2063Google Scholar). Details of the mechanism are not yet completely understood, partly because of the presence of several intra- and intermolecular interactions in proteins that may or may not be stabilized by sulfate. Light is yet to be shed on the mechanism of thermal inactivation of GOD, despite several attempts at improving its stability (9Ye W.N. Combes D. Manson P. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 498-502Google Scholar, 10Appleton B. Gibson T.D. Woodward J.R. Sens. Actutor B. 1997; 43: 65-69Google Scholar, 11Ye W.N. Combes D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 999: 86-93Google Scholar). An understanding of the thermal inactivation mechanism of GOD could lead to thermostabilization of the enzyme using appropriate additives. With this objective, experiments were carried out on the effect of some selected additives on the thermal stability of GOD. In addition to lysozyme, found earlier by us to increase the stability of GOD, two more salts, NaCl and K2SO4, which are commonly known to stabilize enzymes through ionic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, were selected for the thermal stability studies reported here. The mechanism of inactivation and the effect of additives on the thermal stability of the enzyme were followed by kinetics of inactivation, spectroscopic measurements, and size exclusion chromatography. GOD (EC 1.1.3.4) from A. niger (type VII-S, 180,000 units/g solid), FAD, acrylamide, and N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, SDS, and lysozyme from hen's egg and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) from Sigma Chemical Co., β-mercaptoethanol, glycine, TEMED, and horseradish peroxidase (320 PPG units/mg) from ICN Biomedical Inc., Ohio, USA, and Shodex® PROTEIN KW-803 size exclusion column (300 × 8 mm) with an exclusion limit of 1.5 × 105 from Showa Denko, Japan were used. All other chemicals and buffer salts used were of analytical grade. Purification of GOD—The traces of catalase, associated with commercial preparations of GOD, were removed by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (45 × 2.1 cm) preequilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). GOD was loaded on the column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. Protein concentration and activity of the fractions were measured. The protein concentration (of GOD) was determined using a value of A280 nm1%=13.8(14Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2209-2215Google Scholar). The fractions containing GOD were pooled and used. Enzyme Activity Assay—GOD was assayed at 30 °C by peroxidasecoupled assay (15Bergmeyer H.U. Methods Enzymat. Anal. 1974; 3: 457-458Google Scholar). Glucose and peroxidase were added to an o-dianisidine containing buffer (pH 6.0). GOD solution, appropriately diluted, was added after proper mixing. The increase in absorption at 460 nm was monitored for 4 min at 30 °C with a spectrophotometer. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE experiments were performed on 17.5% vertical minislab gel (Broviga, Balaji Scientific Instruments, Chennai, India) according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were fixed using water:methanol:trichloroacetic acid (5:4:1 by volume) and stained with 0.1% w/v Coomassie Brilliant Blue in water:methanol:acetic acid in the same ratio. Gels were destained in water:methanol:acetic acid in the above mentioned ratio until the background was clear. Molecular weight protein markers (Bangalore Genei, India) used were phosphorylase b (97,400), bovine serum albumin (66,000), ovalbumin (43,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,000), and lysozyme (14,300). Thermal Unfolding Transitions by Activity Measurements—The loss of enzyme activity as a function of temperature was followed, in the presence and absence of additives, in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The enzyme samples were incubated for 15 min at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 °C. After cooling to 4 °C, the residual activity was measured at 30 °C by transferring an aliquot to the assay mixture. The midpoint of thermal inactivation, Tm, at which the activity was diminished by 50%, was calculated from the plot of percent residual activity versus temperature. Kinetics of Thermal Inactivation—Kinetics of thermal inactivation of GOD was studied at different temperatures (56 – 67 °C), both in the absence and presence of selected additives. 100 μl (1 mg/ml) of enzyme solution was added to 0.9 ml of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and kept in a constant temperature bath at the desired temperatures. 10-μl samples of enzyme solution were withdrawn at periodic intervals and cooled in an ice bath prior to the assay; the residual activity was measured and expressed as a percentage of initial activity. From a semilogarithmic plot of residual activity versus time, the inactivation rate constants (kr) were calculated (from the slopes), and apparent half-lives were estimated. Activation Energy Calculations—The thermal stability of GOD in the presence and absence of selected additives was determined by the inactivation rate constant (kr) as a function of temperature, in the range 56 – 67 °C. The temperature dependence of kr was analyzed from Arrhenius plot (natural logarithm of krversus reciprocal of the absolute temperature); the activation energy (Ea) was obtained from the slope of the plot. Activation enthalpy (ΔH*) was calculated according to the equation ΔH*=Ea−RT (Eq. 1) where R = universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The values for free energy of inactivation (ΔG*) at different temperatures were obtained from the equation ΔG*=−RTln(krh/kT)(Eq. 2) where h is the Planck constant and k is the Boltzmann constant. Activation entropy (ΔS*) was calculated from Equation 3. Δs*=(ΔH*−ΔG*)/T(Eq. 3) Effect of Lysozyme on Kmand Vmaxof GOD—Two kinetic parameters namely, the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and velocity maximum (Vmax) were calculated from the double reciprocal plot to study the effect of lysozyme on functional properties of GOD. The kinetics of GOD in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was studied by varying the initial substrate concentration. Circular Dichroism Spectra Measurements—Circular dichroism measurements were made with a Jasco J-810 automatic recording spectropolarimeter fitted with a xenon lamp and calibrated with + d-10-camphor sulfonic acid. Dry nitrogen was purged continuously into the instrument before and during the experiment. The measurements were made at 30 °C (unless otherwise mentioned). The light path length of the cell used was 1 mm in the far-UV region, 5 mm in near-UV, and 10 mm in the visible regions. The protein concentrations were 0.2– 0.25, 0.7– 0.8, and 2.5–3.5 mg/ml in the far-UV, near-UV, and visible regions, respectively. The samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). For the thermal unfolding measurements, data were collected at 222, 274, and 375 nm every second at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The secondary structure of GOD was analyzed using the computer program of Yang et al. (17Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Google Scholar), which calculates the structural component ratio of secondary structures for the protein, by the least squares method. The mean residue ellipticity [θ]MRW was calculated using a value of 115 for mean residue weight of GOD. Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were made with a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorophotometer using a 10-mm path length quartz cell. GOD (1.5 μm concentration) in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was used for measuring the intrinsic fluorescence. The temperature of the cell was maintained at 30 °C by circulating water through the thermostated cuvette holder. The emission spectra of intrinsic protein fluorescence were recorded after excitation at 285 nm. For ANS binding studies, an enzyme solution of 1.5 μm concentration was incubated with 20 μm ANS at 30 °C for 1 h, and spectra were recorded in the region 400 – 600 nm. The enzyme, in the presence of either 0.6 m NaCl or 0.2 m K2SO4, was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C before recording the spectra. Appropriate blank spectra of ANS in the corresponding salt concentrations were subtracted to obtain the fluorescence emission caused by ANS binding to protein. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration measurements were carried out using a Shodex® PROTEIN KW-803 column (300 × 8 mm), with the manufacturer's exclusion limit of 1.5 × 105 for proteins, on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a 1525 binary pump and Waters 2996 photodiode array detector. For following the elution profile after thermal denaturation, both in the absence and presence of 0.2 m K2SO4, 20 μl of 4 –5 μm GOD solution was injected into the column at 30 °C before and after heating at 60 °C for 15 min. Elution of the sample was carried out isocratically using 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 30 °C and detection at 280 and 375 nm by photodiode array detector. For Stokes radius measurements, the column was equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), containing the desired salt concentrations, at 30 °C. 20 μl of 4 –5 μm GOD solution, equilibrated in the desired salt concentration (0 – 0.4 m K2SO4 in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) was injected into the column and eluted in the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The absorbance was detected at 280 and 375 nm. Standard proteins from a molecular weight marker kit for gel filtration (Sigma) including alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), cytochrome c (12,400) with known Stokes radius were used for calibrating the column. Blue dextran at a 1 mg·ml–1 concentration was used for determining the void volume. Experiments with Sulfhydryl Groups—The thiol groups exposed during the course of thermal unfolding of GOD were quantified by measuring their reactivity with DTNB as a function of temperature in a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer with an integrated temperature programmer. The transition was followed by increase in absorbance at 412 nm. The heating rate was 1 °C/min. The commercial preparation of GOD was purified by gel filtration on a column of Sephacryl S-200 HR. Homogeneity of the preparations was ascertained by HPLC and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The purified enzyme had an absorbance ratio of 11.1 (280/450 nm), which is in good agreement with the reported value (4Tsuge H. Natsuakai O. Ohashi K. J. Biochem. 1975; 78: 835-843Google Scholar). Thermal Unfolding Transitions by Activity Measurements— GOD gets irreversibly inactivated over the temperature range 25– 80 °C. The residual activity of GOD as a function of temperature in the presence and absence of additives such as lysozyme, K2SO4, and NaCl is given in Fig. 2. These additives shifted the Tm of GOD from 59 °C to 61, 67, and 69 °C, respectively (Fig. 2). Thermal Inactivation Kinetics and Effect of Additives on the Thermal Stability of GOD—The thermal inactivation kinetics of native GOD was studied in the temperature range 56 – 67 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The effect of various additives, lysozyme, NaCl, and K2SO4, on the thermal stability of GOD, was followed by measuring the residual activity with time. At all temperatures studied, inactivation followed an exponential decay. The semilogarithmic plots (Fig. 3, A–D) indicated that thermal inactivation kinetics followed first order in all cases. The Arrhenius plots (Fig. 3Dinset) were linear in the temperature range studied. From this plot and making use of Equations 1, 2, 3, the activation parameters, free energy (ΔG*), enthalpy (ΔH*), and entropy (ΔS*) of activation, were calculated (Table I). The half-life of GOD was found to increase in the presence of each of the additives at all temperatures studied. Taking a typical case, at 60 °C, the half-life increased by 3.5-, 33.4-, and 23.7-fold, activation energy of GOD increased from 60.3 to 72.9, 76.1, and 88.3 kcal mol–1 whereas activation entropy increased from 104 to 142, 147, and 184 cal deg–1 mol–1 with 7.1 × 10–5m lysozyme, 1 m NaCl, and 0.2 m K2SO4, respectively. The corresponding net free energy change, ΔG*, at 60 °C, was 0.9, 2.4, and 2.1 kcal mol–1, respectively. The magnitude of free energy of activation reflected the effectiveness of relative stabilization by various additives. The relatively small value of ΔG* (24.2 kcal·mol–1), for native GOD at 60 °C, pointed to the labile nature of enzyme. The difference in the slopes (activation energy) of Arrhenius plot (Fig. 3D, inset), in the presence of the lysozyme, NaCl, and the K2SO4 indicated the differences in mechanism of enzyme stabilization. A significant increase in the activation energy, Ea, in the presence of only 0.2 m K2SO4 (88.3 kcal·mol–1) compared with 1 m NaCl (76.1 kcal·mol–1) and 7.1 × 10–5m lysozyme (72.9 kcal·mol–1), indicated that stabilization of GOD by K2SO4 was of conformational origin. This was further confirmed by CD and size exclusion chromatography measurements. Stabilization of GOD (in terms of increased half-life and activation parameters) by NaCl and lysozyme in acidic pH values indicated the role of ionic interaction between GOD and lysozyme or NaCl. However, activation energy, i.e. the energy required to denature the enzyme, was higher in the presence of 0.2 m K2SO4 compared with either 1 m NaCl or 7.1 × 10–5m lysozyme. This indicated that hydrophobic interactions play a more dominant role in the stabilization of GOD than ionic interactions. The change in the activation entropy, ΔS*, in the presence of additives can be explained in terms of an enhancement of the order and compactness of the structure, thus favoring intramolecular stabilizing forces and consequently increasing the stability of the enzyme. Significant change in the activation entropy and the difference in the slopes of the Arrhenius plots in the presence of K2SO4 indicated that the stabilization of GOD was of conformational origin. CD measurements and size exclusion chromatography measurements confirmed this.Table IActivation parameters of GOD in the presence of additivesIncubation temperatureHalf-lifeInactivation rate constantΔG*ΔH*ΔS*°Cminkr × 10-4 s-1kcal·mol-1kcal·mol-1cal·deg—1·mol-1Native GOD (without additive) (Ea = 60.3 kcal·mol-1)56861.3425.259.5104.460139.624.259.5106.1637.51624.159.5105.5674.524.924.059.5104.3GOD in presence of 7.1 × 10-5 M lysozyme (Ea = 72.9 kcal·mol-1)563220.3626.072.3140.660462.525.172.3141.963245.024.873.3141.367129.524.972.3140GOD in presence of 1 M NaCl (Ea = 76.1 kcal·mol-1)5618060.06427.175.5146.8604340.2626.675.5146.8631460.7926.175.5147.067582.025.875.5146.2GOD in presence of 0.2 M K2SO4 (Ea = 88.3 kcal·mol-1)5614460.0827.087.6184.3603080.3926.387.6184.263621.925.587.61856727.54.325.287.6183.6 Open table in a new tab Effect of Lysozyme Concentration on the Stability of GOD— Detailed studies on the thermal inactivation of GOD were carried out in the presence of various concentrations of lysozyme at 60 °Cin20mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). As the mol ratio of lysozyme to GOD increased from 0 to 110, the half-life of GOD increased from 13 to 46 min (Fig. 4A), thereafter showing a decrease in the thermal stability of GOD. A significant observation (Fig. 4A) was that in the presence of higher concentrations of lysozyme (>150 mol ratio) the half-life of GOD decreased (seen as the dotted line). This was because of aggregation of lysozyme observed at higher concentrations. To avoid interference (of the aggregated lysozyme) during residual activity measurements, after exposing to 60 °C for the specified time, aggregated lysozyme was separated by centrifugation for 15 min at 4,000 rpm, and the supernatant was passed through a G-75 column (4 × 0.75 cm). The eluted sample was used to measure the residual activity of GOD. This procedure ensured that the half-life did not decrease after reaching the maximum. Increasing the lysozyme to GOD mol ratio above 110 gave no further improvement in the thermal stability of GOD, the lysozyme concentration corresponding to this mol ratio was employed for thermal inactivation studies. The requirement of a relatively high mol ratio (110) of lysozyme to stabilize GOD suggested that the interaction between lysozyme and GOD was nonspecific. Increased stability of GOD, in the presence of lysozyme in acidic pH (pH 6.0), confirmed the ionic interactions between lysozyme and GOD. At pH 7.7, the net charge on GOD was reported as –77 (18Voet J.G. Coe J. Epstein J. Matossian V. Shipley T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7182-7185Google Scholar). The net charge (Lys and Arg) of lysozyme at pH 6.0 is positive (19Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 382Google Scholar). Effect of Lysozyme Incorporation on the Kinetic Parameters of GOD—To obtain a better understanding of the stabilization of GOD by lysozyme, kinetic parameters, Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum reaction velocity (Vmax), were determined in the presence as well as the absence of lysozyme (Fig. 4B). The Km and Vmax of GOD increased from 7.5 to 36.4 mm and 0.33 to 0.73 μm min–1, respectively, when the lysozyme concentration was varied from 0 to 1.1 mm. There was a decrease in affinity of GOD for β-d-glucose in the presence of lysozyme. Interaction of GOD with lysozyme resulted in an alteration of its functional properties. Thermal Inactivation of GOD: CD Measurements—The effect of thermal inactivation on the FAD environment, tertiary and secondary structures of GOD were studied by measuring CD spectra in the visible, near-, and far-UV regions, respectively. GOD exhibited characteristic FAD band at 375 nm in the visible region, a strong CD band at 274 nm in the near-UV region, and minima around 208 and 222 nm in the far-UV region. The analysis of secondary structure by the method of Yang et al. (17Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Google Scholar) indicated 14% α-helix and 64% β-structure in the molecule. Because of the thermal inactivation of the enzyme, there were changes in all three regions of the spectra (Fig. 5, A–C). The intensity at 208 and 222 nm decreased, suggesting a loss in α-helix structure. The secondary structure analysis also supported this. The thermally inactivated enzyme had 9% α-helix content and 65% β-structure. In the near-UV region, the 274 nm band caused by the asymmetric environment of aromatic amino acids completely disappeared, indicating disruption of the native tertiary structure. The intensity of the CD band at 375 nm decreased, and the maxima was shifted to 335 nm. Addition of either 0.2 m K2SO4 or 0.6 m NaCl to the native enzyme did not affect the CD bands at 274 nm. In the far-UV region too, there was no change in the intensity of 222 nm band. Addition of either NaCl or K2SO4 did not alter the backbone or side chain conformation. Spectra of thermally inactivated enzyme at 60 °C in the presence of either 0.6 m NaCl (results not shown) or 0.2 m K2SO4 suggested (a) a small decrease in the intensity of both 274 nm band and 375 nm band, indicating the partial prevention of loss in tertiary structure and protection of the environment around FAD; (b) no significant change in the far-UV region, pointing to the prevention of loss of α-helix, attributable to these salts. The comparison of CD spectra of thermally inactivated GOD in the region 300 – 450 nm with that of free FAD suggested possible dissociation of FAD from GOD (Fig. 5C). Effect of Lysozyme, K2SO4, and NaCl on FAD Environment of GOD—To follow the conformational changes in GOD caused by interaction with lysozyme, the changes in CD spectra in the region 300 – 450 nm, where lysozyme does not contribute (even at high protein concentrations) were measured. The addition of lysozyme and NaCl resulted in small changes in the spectra, indicating a change in the environment of FAD in GOD (Fig. 6). K2SO4 did not affect the FAD band, indicating no significant changes in the environment of FAD. Thermal Unfolding Monitored by CD Measurements—The CD measurements of native and thermally inactivated GOD pointed to structural changes in the molecule. Secondary structural changes could be followed by changes in ellipticity values at 222 nm. Changes in tertiary structure were reflected at 274 nm, whereas the dissociation of FAD could be followed by changes in the ellipticity values at 375 nm. Thermal unfolding transitions of GOD in the temperature range 25–90 °C as followed at 222, 274, and 375 nm are shown (Fig. 7, A–C). The loss of tertiary and secondary structure in the native GOD, evident from [θ]274 nm and [θ]222 nm, occurred over a temperature range of 55 to 65 °C with a Tm of 62 °C. It was found that the loss of FAD (starting at 50 °C) was complete by 63 °C with a Tm of 59 °C. Effect of NaCl, K2SO4, and Lysozyme on Thermal Unfolding—To understand the mechanism of stabilization by NaCl and K2SO4, thermal unfolding transitions of GOD in the presence of 0.6 m NaCl and 0.2 m K2SO4 were followed by CD measurements at 222, 274, and 375 nm (Fig. 7, A–C). Tm, followed at 274 nm, shifted from 62 to 68 and 72 °C for native, 0.2 m K2SO4, and 0.6 m NaCl stabilized GOD, respectively (Fig. 7A). The Tm, followed at 375 nm, shifted from 59 °C to 68 and 72 °C for native, 0.2 m K2SO4, and 0.6 m NaCl, respectively. NaCl was seen to stabilize the tertiary structure, and the environment around FAD better compared with K2SO4. The only contrasting difference observed was the transition at 222 nm. K2SO4 was a marginally better stabilizer of the secondary structure compared with NaCl (Fig. 7B). Thus, it is evident that NaCl affected the side chain interactions (reflected by Tm measurements at 274 and 375 nm) more favorably, whereas K2SO4 primarily affected the backbone interactions. Tm followed at 375 nm, shifted by 7 °C in the presence of lysozyme (results not shown). Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—For the native GOD, a fluorescence emission maximum was observed at 338 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the holoenzyme in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), when excited at 285 nm, was significantly quenched compared with the heat-inactivated enzyme (Fig. 8A). For the heat-inactivated enzyme, a significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity along with a small shift in the emission maximum was observed. The dissociation of FAD from the enzyme because of heat inactivation resulted in an increase in the quantum yield. Studies on the reduced and oxidized holoenzyme as well as the apoenzyme revealed that in the native conformation of the enzyme, seven tryptophan residues and FAD are in proximity. The quenching of fluorescence was the result of a Förster energy transfer from the tryptophan residues to the flavin group (20Haouz A. Twist C. Zentz C. Kersabiec A.M. Pin S."
https://openalex.org/W2083326890,"We recently cloned human chondroitin synthase (ChSy) exhibiting the glucuronyltransferase-II (GlcATII) and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-II (GalNAcTII) activities responsible for the biosynthesis of repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate, but chondroitin polymerization was not demonstrated in vitro using the recombinant ChSy. We report here that the chondroitin polymerizing activity requires concomitant expression of a novel protein designated chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF) with ChSy. The human ChPF consists of 775 amino acids with a type II transmembrane protein topology. The amino acid sequence displayed 23% identity to that of human ChSy. The expression of a soluble recombinant form of the protein in COS-1 cells produced a protein with little GlcAT-II or GalNAcT-II activity. In contrast, coexpression of the ChPF and ChSy yielded markedly augmented glycosyltransferase activities, whereas simple mixing of the two separately expressed proteins did not. Moreover, using both UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as sugar donors, chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated on the so-called glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence of α-thrombomodulin. These results suggested that the ChPF acts as a specific activating factor for ChSy in chondroitin polymerization. The coding region of the ChPF was divided into four discrete exons and localized to chromosome 2q35-q36. Northern blot analysis revealed that the ChPF gene exhibited a markedly different expression pattern among various human tissues, which was similar to that of ChSy.

Recent studies of CS chains have shown that they play important roles in neural network formation in the developing mammalian brain (for reviews see Refs. 1Ohhira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Google Scholar and 2Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Google Scholar) and are major inhibitory molecules affecting axon growth after spinal cord injury in the central nervous system of adult mammals (3Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D.F. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Google Scholar). CS biosynthesis is initiated by the addition of xylose to serine residues in the core protein, followed by the sequential addition of two Gal residues and a GlcUA residue to form the tetrasaccharide linkage structure GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser. Chondroitin polymerization with alternating GalNAc and GlcUA then takes place, forming the repeating disaccharide region. In a previous study, in vitro chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated when α-thrombomodulin (α-TM) with a truncated glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar), GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl, was tested as an acceptor together with both UDP-GlcUA and UDPGalNAc as sugar donors using a cell-free enzyme system, which was prepared from the serum-free culture medium of a human melanoma cell line (5Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar). We recently cloned chondroitin synthase (ChSy) consisting of a single large polypeptide with dual glycosyltransferase activities of GlcUA transferase II (GlcAT-II) and GalNAc transferase II (GalNAcT-II), which are responsible for synthesizing the repeating disaccharide units of CS (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar). However, despite the individual transferase activities observed for ChSy, chondroitin polymerization was not demonstrated using the recombinant ChSy in vitro. We hypothesized, therefore, that an unidentified regulatory protein might be required for the full polymerization activity of ChSy and might be homologous to ChSy. To date, four homologous glycosyltransferases including ChSy, all of which are responsible for CS biosynthesis, have been cloned (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar, 7Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar, 8Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A.

To search for such a regulatory protein involved in chondroitin polymerization, the ChSy sequence was used to screen a data base. Here, we describe the cloning of a human cDNA encoding a novel protein required for chondroitin polymerization, designated chondroitin polymerizing factor (ChPF). Materials—UDP-[U-14C]GlcUA (285.2 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[3H]GalNAc (10 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GalNAc were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitin (a chemically desulfated derivative of whale cartilage CS-A) and Arthrobacter aurescens chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Purified α-TM (11Nawa K. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Sato Y. Sugiyama N. Teruuchi T. Iwamoto M. Marumoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 729-737Google Scholar) was provided by the research institute of Dai-ichi Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and contained the linkage tetrasaccharide GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar). Chondro-glycuronidase from Flavobacterium heparinum (12Hovingh P. Linker A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 287-293Google Scholar) was from Dr. K. Yoshida (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo). The chemically synthesized linkage tetrasaccharide serines GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser and GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu) (13Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T.

ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl was isolated by HPLC after the chondroitinase ABC digestion of whale cartilage CS-A followed by mild alkaline treatment using 0.5 m LiOH, and was structurally identified by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. It was then derivatized with a fluorophore, 2-aminobenzamide, and purified by HPLC as described previously (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar, 14Sakaguchi H. Watanabe M. Ueoka C. Sugiyama E. Taketomi T. Yamada S. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 107-118Google Scholar).

The Superdex™ peptide HR10/30 column was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In Silico Cloning of the ChPF cDNA—A tBLASTn analysis of the GenBank™ data base, using the sequence of human ChSy (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar), showed highly homologous clones. Analysis of one clone (GenBank™ accession number BC021223) revealed a single open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to human ChSy. In addition, a data base search of the Human Genome Project identified a genome sequence (GenBank™ accession number NT_005403.13) identical to the cDNA sequence. Comparison of the cDNA and genome sequences demonstrated the genomic organization of the ChPF gene. Construction of a Soluble Form of the ChPF—A cDNA fragment of a truncated form of the ChPF, lacking the first 62 amino-terminal amino acid sequence containing the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with total RNA derived from G361 human melanoma cells (ATCC number CRL-1424) as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCAACTCGGTGCAGCCCGGAGC-3′) containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCGCTCTGGTTTTGGGGGAGAAG-3′) containing a Bam HI site located 46 bp downstream from the stop codon. PCR was carried out with KOD polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) for 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 180 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragments were subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (15Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the ChPF with the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. An NheI fragment containing this fusion protein sequence was inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pEF-BOS (16Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression of a Soluble Form of the ChPF and Enzyme Assays—The expression plasmid (6.0 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cotransfection experiments, the ChPF and ChSy expression plasmids (3.0 μg each) (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE 6 as above. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for glycosyltransferase activities as described below. Assays for GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II were carried out using chondroitin as an acceptor and UDPGalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a sugar donor, respectively, as described previously (17Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Google Scholar, 18Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Google Scholar). Polymerization reactions using linkage tetrasaccharide-serine or -peptide and α-TM as acceptors were conducted in incubation mixtures containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl, i.e. 1 nmol of a linkage tetrasaccharide-serine or α-TM, 0.25 mm UDP-[3H]GalNAc (5.28 × 105 dpm), 0.25 mm UDP-GlcUA, 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μl of the resuspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the 3H-labeled products were then separated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex peptide column equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.4 ml each) were collected at a rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the measurement of radioactivity was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. Characterization of the Reaction Products—Products of the polymerization reactions on α-TM were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex peptide column with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. The [3H]GalNAclabeled oligosaccharide chains released from α-TM by mild alkaline treatment using 0.5 m LiOH were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar, 14Sakaguchi H. Watanabe M. Ueoka C. Sugiyama E. Taketomi T. Yamada S. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 107-118Google Scholar) and then exhaustively digested with chondroitinase ABC using 50 mIU of the enzyme for 1 h as described previously (19Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Google Scholar). The enzyme digest was subjected to gel filtration on Superdex peptide as described above. The radioactive peak of the 2-aminobenzamide-derivatized putative linkage hexasaccharide and its digest with chondro-glycuronidase were analyzed using an anion-exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described previously (20Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Google Scholar). The identification of the reaction products was accomplished by co-chromatography with authentic linkage hexa and pentasaccharides labeled with 2-aminobenzamide. Northern Blot Analysis—A commercial human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) membrane was used for the analysis. The membrane was probed with a gel-purified, radiolabeled (>1 × 109 cpm/μg), 0.84-kb ChPF-specific fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1720–2558 of the ChPF cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AB095813). In Silico Cloning of a ChPF cDNA—We recently identified and characterized human ChSy (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar). Screening of the nonredundant data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), using the deduced amino acid sequence of human ChSy, identified a few clones. One of them, designated ChPF here (GenBank™ accession number BC021223), contained a 5′-untranslated region of 236 bp, a single open reading frame of 2325 bp coding for a protein of 775 amino acids with three potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1), and a 3′-untranslated region of about 0.5 kb with a presumptive polyadenylation signal. Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA was about 3.4 kb in length in various human tissues (see below), suggesting that the cDNA was approximately full-length. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to a 85,494-Da polypeptide. The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment of 23 amino acid residues in the NH2-terminal region, predicting that the protein has a type II transmembrane topology (Fig. 1). Data base searches suggested that the amino acid sequence displayed 57 and 23% identity to human chondroitin GlcAT (9Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Google Scholar) and ChSy (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar), respectively (Fig. 1). Notably, however, the identified protein did not have the conserved DXD motif found in most glycosyltransferases (23Wiggins S. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Google Scholar). Thus, the features of the identified protein sequence suggest that the identified gene product might be involved in CS biosynthesis but would not possess a glycosyltransferase activity. Intriguingly, a homologue of the identified human gene was found in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genome, sharing 27 and 25% identity with that of C. elegans and Drosophila, respectively (data not shown). Genomic Organization and Chromosomal Localization— Comparison of the identified cDNA sequence with the genome sequence deposited in the Human Genome Project data base revealed the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the gene. The gene spans over 5 kb, and the coding region of the gene was divided into four discrete exons as shown in Fig. 2. Its genomic organization is very similar to that of the chondroitin GlcAT gene, which consists of four discrete exons in the coding region (9Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Google Scholar). The intron/exon junctions followed the GT/AG rule (24Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar) and were flanked by conserved sequences (data not shown). This gene is located on human chromosome 2q35-q36, whereas other homologous genes have been localized to different chromosomes as follows: ChSy, 15q26.3; chondroitin GalNAcT-1, 8q21.3; chondroitin GalNAcT-2, 10q11.22; and chondroitin GlcAT, 7q35 (10Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3072-3078Google Scholar). Expression and Characterization of ChPF—To facilitate the functional analysis of the ChPF, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 62 amino acids of the protein with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then the soluble protein was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant protein fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. When the expression plasmid was expressed in COS-1 cells, a ∼95-kDa protein was secreted as shown by Western blotting using IgG (data not shown). The fused protein expressed in the medium was adsorbed onto IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous glycosyltransferases, and then the protein-bound beads were used as an enzyme source. Although the bound fusion protein was assayed for glycosyltransferase activity using a variety of acceptors and either UDPGalNAc or UDP-GlcUA as a donor substrate, little glycosyltransferase activity was detected. However, coexpression of the soluble ChPF with the soluble ChSy augmented both the GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities of ChSy over 20-fold, which is involved in the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin (Table I). Notably, these effects of coexpression were not due to differences in the expression levels of these proteins, as assessed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Moreover, simple mixing of the soluble proteins, which were expressed in COS-1 cells separately transfected with ChPF or ChSy, did not result in any increase in the catalytic activities (Table I).Table IGalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities of the fusion proteins secreted into the culture medium by transfected COS-1 cellsProteinGalNAcT-II activityaPolymer chondroitin was used as an acceptor substrate, and the values represent the averages of three independent experiments.GlcAT-II activityaPolymer chondroitin was used as an acceptor substrate, and the values represent the averages of three independent experiments.pmol/ml medium/hpmol/ml medium/hChSy1.32.3ChPF0.2NDbND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).ChSy/ChPF31188.4ChSy + ChPFcThe values obtained by mixing soluble proteins derived from COS-1 cells separately transfected by ChPF and ChSy.0.51.1a Polymer chondroitin was used as an acceptor substrate, and the values represent the averages of three independent experiments.b ND, not detected (<0.1 pmol/ml medium/h).c The values obtained by mixing soluble proteins derived from COS-1 cells separately transfected by ChPF and ChSy. Open table in a new tab In a previous study (5Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar), in vitro chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated when α-TM with a truncated glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage tetrasaccharide (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar), GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl, was used as an acceptor together with a cell-free enzyme system, which was prepared from the serum-free culture medium of a human melanoma cell line. However, despite the individual GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities observed for ChSy, chondroitin polymerization was not demonstrated using α-TM with the recombinant soluble ChSy in vitro (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar). Hence, it was next investigated in this study whether the coexpression of ChPF and ChSy is required for chondroitin polymerization. Incubations of the coexpressed proteins with various acceptors in the presence of UDP-[3H]GalNAc and UDP-GlcUA yielded radiolabeled polymer chondroitin chains as shown in Fig. 3; the acceptors used were α-TM and the chemically synthesized linkage tetrasaccharide derivatives GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser and GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu). The reaction products obtained with α-TM as an acceptor were subjected to reductive β-elimination using NaBH4/NaOH (25Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Google Scholar), and the released radiolabeled oligosaccharide chains were analyzed by gel chromatography using a column of Superdex peptide or 75 (Fig. 3). The saccharide chains synthesized on α-TM were much longer than those synthesized on the tetrasaccharide-serine or -peptide and were comparable with commercial polymer chondroitin chains (Fig. 3B). In contrast, simple mixing of the soluble proteins, which were expressed in COS-1 cells separately transfected with ChPF or ChSy, did not produce such chondroitin polymerizing activity. These results suggest that the ChPF and ChSy proteins need to be synthesized simultaneously in the same cell to polymerize chondroitin chains and that the core protein is required for the synthesis of the longer chondroitin chains. Analysis of the Chondroitin Chains Newly Polymerized on the Tetrasaccharide Linkage Region of α-TM—The [3H]GalNAclabeled chondroitin chains obtained from the polymerization reactions on α-TM were liberated by mild alkaline treatment using 0.5 m LiOH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting radiolabeled chondroitin chains were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and then isolated by gel filtration (4Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Google Scholar). The isolated chains were digested with chondroitinase ABC and subjected to gel chromatography, resulting in Fraction 1 containing the linkage hexasaccharides and Fraction 2 containing both di and monosaccharides in a molar ratio of 1:47 (Fig. 4A). These results suggested that the average size of the synthesized chondroitin chains was ∼100-mer. Fraction 1 was then subjected to anion-exchange HPLC, resulting in only one 3H-labeled peak at the elution position of the authentic linkage hexasaccharide ΔHexUAα1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-2-aminobenzamide, which was shifted to a position of GalNAcβ1-4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-2-aminobenzamide upon digestion with chondro-glycuronidase (12Hovingh P. Linker A. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 287-293Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). These results clearly indicated that the polymerization did take place on the truncated linkage tetrasaccharide sequence of α-TM. Expression Pattern of ChPF—Northern blot analysis of mRNA demonstrated a single band of ∼3.4 kb for all human tissues except peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 5). The gene exhibited a differential expression in the human tissues examined, with strong expression in the placenta and heart in addition to moderate expression in the brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. Notably, the expression pattern was similar to that of ChSy. The findings of the present study demonstrated that the chondroitin polymerizing activity requires the coexpression of a unique protein, ChPF, with ChSy. Although ChPF itself harbors little GalNAcT-II or GlcAT-II activity, the protein sequence of ChPF is homologous to the four previously cloned glycosyltransferases involved in CS biosynthesis. Thus, ChPF is the fifth member of this novel gene family, which is responsible for initiation and elongation of CS chains. In a previous study (5Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar), in vitro chondroitin polymerization was demonstrated when α-TM was used as an acceptor together with a cell-free enzyme system, which was prepared from the serum-free culture medium of a human melanoma cell line. In addition, based on the substrate competition experiments described in a previous study (5Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar), it was proposed that a chondroitin polymerase with three enzyme activities, i.e. GalNAcT-I for chondroitin chain initiation and GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II for chain elongation, might exist. In view of the present finding that the coexpression of ChPF and ChSy was required for chondroitin polymerization on the linkage region tetrasaccharide of α-TM, the proposed chondroitin polymerase does not appear to be a single polypeptide but appears to be a protein complex consisting of ChPF and ChSy. In this context, the recently cloned chondroitin GalNAcT-1 and -2 (7Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8841-8846Google Scholar, 8Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar, 10Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Tanaka J. Tamura J. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3072-3078Google Scholar), both of which harbored both GalNAcT-I and -II activities, were not required for the chondroitin polymerization on the linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence of α-TM. In addition, coexpression of chondroitin GalNAcT-1 or -2 and ChSy yielded no chondroitin polymerizing activity, even when α-TM was used as an acceptor substrate. Moreover, coexpression of chondroitin GalNAcT-1, ChSy, and ChPF or chondroitin GalNAcT-2, ChSy, and ChPF did not augment chondroitin polymerization activity (data not shown). Therefore, chondroitin GalNAcT-1 and -2 may be dispensable for the chondroitin polymerization itself, although their involvement in CS biosynthesis cannot be excluded. In fact, homologues of the human ChSy and ChPF are present in C. elegans, but those of GalNAcT-1 and -2 are absent despite the existence of chondroitin in the worm (26Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Google Scholar), supporting the present hypothesis. Thus, more efforts to determine the specific roles of chondroitin GalNAcT-1 and -2 in CS biosynthesis will be required. As described previously (6Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar), the GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities observed for ChSy were low with polymer chondroitin and chondro-oligosaccharides as acceptor substrates (also see Table I). Considering that coexpression of the soluble ChPF with the soluble ChSy augmented both the GalNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities of ChSy over 20-fold (Table I), it has become evident that coexpression of ChPF was also required for full GlcAT-II and GalNAcT-II activities of ChSy. In addition, the present study confirmed the previous findings (5Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Goto F. Tamura J. Newmann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 353-357Google Scholar) that the chondroitin chain polymerization reactions were also influenced by the core protein portion. The oligosaccharide chains synthesized on α-TM were much longer than those synthesized on the linkage tetrasaccharide-derivatives GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser and GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu) (see Fig. 3). In this regard, Oldberg et al. (27Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Moses J. Fransson L.-Å. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Google Scholar) reported that cells transformed with vectors encoding deletion variants of decorin synthesized proteoglycan with shorter glycosaminoglycan chains and suggested that such effects on the glycosaminoglycan chain length might be due to a lower affinity between the core protein and the glycosyltransferases. Thus, in view of the present findings that the chondroitin chain polymerization reactions were markedly stimulated by the core protein of the acceptor, it is possible that the protein complex consisting of ChPF and ChSy interacts with the core protein and regulates the glycosaminoglycan chain length. It should also be noted that animal cells utilize β-d-xylosides as primers for glycosaminoglycan synthesis, and, thus, the core protein can be substituted by the mildly hydrophobic xylosides such as 4-methylumbelliferyl- or p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside (28Okayama M. Kimata K. Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 1069-1073Google Scholar). In addition, Fernández and Warren (29Fernández C.J. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19030-19039Google Scholar) demonstrated CS synthesis using reconstituted Golgi in the presence of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xyloside. In fact, in vitro chondroitin polymerization was also observed in this study when GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl was used as an acceptor substrate with the recombinant soluble proteins secreted from COS-1 cells cotransfected with ChPF and ChSy. However, the oligosaccharide chains synthesized on GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-O-C2H4NH-benzyloxycarbonyl were slightly shorter than those synthesized on α-TM (data not shown). It appears that hydrophobic aglycones mimic a recognition sequence on core proteins and interact with the protein complex consisting of ChPF and ChSy. Further work should be aimed at better defining the acceptor recognition requirements by the protein complex consisting of ChPF and ChSy. Earlier studies have indicated that the sulfation of glycosaminoglycan moieties ordinarily proceeds together with polymerization at a single Golgi site and that there appears to be a close interrelation between sulfation and polymer elongation/termination (30Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Google Scholar). In fact, although it has been reported that prior sulfation of the growing CS chain profoundly affects chain polymerization (17Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Google Scholar, 18Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Google Scholar, 30Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Google Scholar), the present study clearly indicated that sulfation is not an absolute requirement for polymer elongation. The protein-coding sequences of the human chondroitin GlcAT and ChPF genes are distributed among four exons that span ∼7 kb (9Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38179-38188Google Scholar) and 5 kb (this study), respectively. Comparison of the genomic organizations of these two genes shows a quite similar genetic exon-intron organization within the coding sequences (Fig. 2). Moreover, the amino acid sequence of ChPF was the most homologous to that of chondroitin GlcAT among the five identified proteins involved in CS biosynthesis (Fig. 1). However, coexpression of chondroitin GlcAT and ChSy yielded little chondroitin polymerization activity when α-TM was used as an acceptor substrate (data not shown). These findings suggest that ChPF acts as a specific activating factor for ChSy in chondroitin polymerization. The identification of ChPF, a unique protein factor required for chondroitin polymerization activity, may shed light on the molecular basis of CS biosynthesis and the evaluation of the biological functions of CS and dermatan sulfate because the gene knockout of either ChPF or ChSy or both would result in specific elimination of CS and dermatan sulfate.

Furthermore, we found an end point of this transition line beyond which the two glasses become identical in their local structure and their long-time dynamics.

With a two-hybrid approach and co-immunoprecipitations, we show here that Sti1 specifically interacts with the Ssa group of the cytosolic yeast Hsp70 proteins. Using purified components, we reconstituted the dimeric Ssa1-Sti1 complex and the ternary Ssa1-Sti1-yHsp90 complex in vitro. The dissociation constant between Sti1 and Ssa1 was determined to be 2 orders of magnitude weaker than the affinity of Sti1 for yHsp90. Surprisingly, binding of Sti1 activates the ATPase of Ssa1 by a factor of about 200, which is in contrast to the behavior of Hop in the mammalian Hsp70 system. Analysis of the underlying activation mechanism revealed that ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting in the Ssa1 ATPase cycle and that this step is accelerated by Sti1.

An important feature in this context are dynamic interactions of various components of the chaperone machinery. Two of the most abundant chaperones found in the eukaryotic cell are Hsp70 and Hsp90.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A complex consisting of Hsp70, Hop, and Hsp90 is of central importance for the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, because it is able to activate steroid hormone receptors for steroid hormone binding in vitro (23Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hop/Sti1 is a unique co-chaperone consisting mainly of three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 1The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; yHsp90, yeast Hsp90; hHsp90, human Hsp90. domains. TPRs are helical modules that mediate interactions between proteins (24Honore B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8485-8491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Hop, its TPR domains can bind to the C-terminal ends of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 (25Scheufler C. Brinker A.

Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), thus providing a physical link between the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone machinery (26Dittmar K.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Despite its importance for the Hsp90 cycle, the composition and function of this complex are still ill-defined. Using purified components, it had been shown previously that yHsp90 and Sti1 form a binary complex in which Sti1 inhibits the ATPase of yHsp90 (28Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, neither the question of whether in addition to the Ssa class (29Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) any of the nine cytosolic Hsp70 proteins in yeast is incorporated into the Sti1-yHsp90 complex nor the functional consequences of this interaction had been addressed. These nine Hsp70s can be divided into the four subfamilies: Ssa, Ssb, Sse, and Ssz (Ss denotes stress seventy-related; a, b, e, and z indicate the subfamily) (8Craig E.A. Boorstein W.R. Park H.O. Stone D.N.C.M. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 96: 51-61Google Scholar). The Ssa subfamily, which is the only essential Hsp70 family in the cytosol, comprises four members (Ssa1–Ssa4). The expression of at least one of the four Ssa proteins is essential for viability (30Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The Ssa1 gene is expressed at high levels at physiological temperature; in addition, its expression is stimulated ∼10-fold after a temperature shift to 37 °C, whereas Ssa2 is expressed at the same level at all temperatures (30Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Ssa3 and Ssa4 are expressed at extremely low levels at physiological temperature, but after a temperature upshift, the amounts of Ssa3 and Ssa4 mRNAs increase severalfold (8Craig E.A. Boorstein W.R. Park H.O. Stone D.N.C.M. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 96: 51-61Google Scholar). In contrast to the Ssa proteins, which are soluble in the cytosol, Ssb1 and Ssb2 are associated with nascent polypeptides of translating ribosomes (31Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 32Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A.

Biol. 1985; 5: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ssz1 forms a ribosome-associated complex with the Hsp40 protein Zuo1. This Ssz1-Zuo1 complex stimulates the mitochondrial translocation of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (34Gautschi M. Lilie H. Funfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rucknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 35Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 4203-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, Sse1 and Sse2 are up-regulated severalfold under heat shock conditions. Under normal growth conditions, Sse1 is present at moderate levels, and Sse2 is present at very low levels (37Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of the Hsp70·Sti1·Hsp90 complex from yeast, we first set out to identify the Hsp70 components. We show that the Ssa proteins are the only Hsp70 component of the complex and that Sti1, unlike Hop in the mammalian Hsp90 multichaperone complex, is a novel regulator for their ATPase activity. Yeast Strains, Culture Media, and General Methods—All strains except for GS 115, which is a Pichia pastoris strain, are Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Strains used in this study have the following geno-types: Y190, MATa ura3–52 his3–200 ade2–101 lys2–801 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 gal4Δ gal80Δ cyhr2 LYS2::GAL1 UAS -HIS3 TATA -HIS3 MEL1 URA3:: GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -lacZ; W303, MATa ade2–1, leu2–3, 112 his3–11, and 15 trp1–1 ura3–1 can1–100; CN11a, MAT a Δtrp1 lys1 lys2 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 sti1–1::HIS3; and GS 115, his4 (Invitrogen). All S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto peptone, 2% glucose). The P. pastoris strain GS 115 containing the pPICZB-Ssa1 plasmid was grown in dextrose histidine medium (1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.4% (w/v) l-histidine, 2% (w/v) glucose, 4 × 10–5% biotin), and the expression of Ssa1 was induced in methanol histidine medium (1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.4% (w/v) l-histidine, 4 × 10–5% biotin, and 0.5% (v/v) methanol). The lysates for immunoprecipitations were prepared as follows. The strains W303 and CN11a were grown in 100 ml of YPD medium to a A 600 of ∼1.0, harvested, and resuspended in 5 ml of 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The cells were lysed using a cell disruption system (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK), shock frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored in 100 μl portions at –80 °C. Construction of pAS and pACT Clones—Ssa1–4, Ssb1–2, Sse1–2, Ssz1, and Sti1 were amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA (strain W303) and ligated in the vectors pAS1-CYH2 and/or pACTII (38Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) as fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pAS1-CYH2) and the GAL4 activation domain (pACTII) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The identity of the clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast strain Y190 was transformed with either Sti1 in pAS1-CYH2 or pACTII or the nine different yeast Hsp70s in pAS1-CYH2 or pACTII as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Single transformants were confirmed as His– and LacZ– to ensure that the fusion proteins alone do not exhibit transcriptional activity in Y190. Double transformants were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C before positive clones were picked, restreaked onto His– Leu– Trp– plates and assayed for the lacZ phenotype (39Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Construction of the Mutants his-Ssa1 (K69Q) and his-yHsp90 (E33A)—The design of the Ssa1 (K69Q) mutant is described elsewhere (40McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yHsp90 (E33A) point mutation was generated in vitro using overlap PCR technique according to Mikaelian and Sergeant (41Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The identity of this construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—S. cerevisiae Ssa1 was expressed using the P. pastoris expression system (42Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. J. of Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mutant his-Ssa1 (K69Q) was expressed and purified as described previously (40McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sti1 was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) and purified as described elsewhere (28Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 43Mayr C. Richter K. Lilie H. Buchner J. J.

Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Human Hsp70 was expressed in a DnaK– variant of the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) and purified as described elsewhere (46Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human Hop and human Hsp90 were purified as described (44Buchner J. Bose S. Mayr C. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 47Buchner J. Weikl T. Bugl H. Pirkl F. Bose S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 418-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Shock frozen proteins were stored in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (standard buffer) at –80 °C. Immunoprecipitations—The immunoprecipitations were performed with lysates from the S. cerevisiae wild type strain W303 or the Sti1 knock-out strain CN11a and with the purified proteins Ssa1, Sti1, and yHsp90 in a volume of 100 μl. The immunoprecipitations were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h in standard buffer with or without 2 mm ATP, using the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered by binding to protein A/G-Sepharose (Sigma). After three washes with 5 volumes of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (4 mm KH2PO4, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 0.12 m NaCl, pH 7.4), the immunocomplexes were eluted with 1× Laemmli SDS loading buffer. For immunodetection, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-nitrocellulose (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes and incubated with polyclonal anti-sera specific for either Ssa (C-terminal 80 amino acids), Ssb (C-terminal 80 amino acids) (48Lopez-Buesa P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15253-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Sti1 (this study), or yHsp90 (this study). As a secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase for ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) was used. ATPase Activity (Radioactive Assay)—ATPase assays were performed according to Kornberg et al. (49Kornberg A. Scott J.F. Bertsch L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3298-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of Ssa1 ± Sti1 ± yHsp90 ± Ydj1 ± Hop, Hsp70 ± Hop ± Sti1, and Hsp90 ± Hop ± Sti1 (±, with or without) were incubated in standard buffer at 37 °C. The ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of the respective ATP concentrations containing [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). A sample contained 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. As a control for unspecific protein effects, Sti1 was added after incubation at 70 °C for 30 min. For steady state hydrolysis measurements, a final ATP concentration of 15 mm was used. In the case of single turnover experiments, the ATP to protein ratio was kept constant at 0.8:1. The ATP to ADP ratio was quantified with a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The hydrolysis rates were corrected for uncatalyzed, spontaneous ATP hydrolysis. ATPase Activity of Ssa1 (HPLC)—The formation of ADP in steady state and single turnover experiments was measured at 37 °C by incubating Ssa1 (Ssa1 K69Q) ± Sti1 and/or yHsp90 (yHsp90 E33A) with ATP for various times and subsequent nucleotide analysis by HPLC as described (50Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Biacore Measurements—Surface plasmon resonance (51Schuck P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 52Nice E.C. Catimel B. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) data were collected on a Biacore X Instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). For experiments in the yeast system, either Ssa1 or yHsp90 were covalently linked to the CM5 chip via amine residues according to the supplier's instructions; for determination of binding constants in the human system, Hop was linked the same way to the CM5 chip. The measurements were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. To determine the binding constant, we directly measured the change in response units, when different amounts of Sti1 were injected onto a Ssa1- or yHsp90-coated chip in standard buffer with or without 2 mm ATP or different amounts of Hsp70 and Hsp90 were injected onto the Hop-coated chip in standard buffer with or without 2 mm ATP. Data analysis for direct binding curves used the linear relationship between the resonance signal (RU) and the amount of protein (c) bound to the chip. RU max (Equation 1) is the maximum signal at which all of the Ssa1 molecules on the chip are saturated with Sti1. RU=RUmax×cc+KD(Eq. 1) The Hsp70 Component of the Sti1 Complex Is the Ssa Proteins—An important step in characterizing the Hsp90 multichaperone complex in S. cerevisiae is to elucidate which of the 14 Hsp70 proteins present in yeast interacts with cytosolic Sti1. Nine of the 14 different yeast Hsp70 proteins are cytosolic and therefore potential partners of the co-chaperone Sti1. It had been shown previously that at least one member of the Ssa class interacts with Sti1 in yeast (29Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not clear whether other yeast Hsp70s also interact with Sti1 in the Hsp90 system. To determine which of these Hsp70 proteins interacts with Sti1, we tested Ssa1–4, Ssb1–2, Sse1–2, and Ssz1 in a yeast two-hybrid reporter system for interaction with Sti1 (Fig. 1 A). Only for the Ssa class (Ssa1–4) positive results were obtained suggesting that the Ssa proteins are the only Hsp70 component in the yHsp90 complex. As an independent proof for this interaction, we immunoprecipitated Sti1 from a wild type yeast lysate (strain W303) and tested the precipitate by Western blotting for the presence of Ssa proteins. Fig. 1B (lane 1) shows that the Ssa proteins were precipitated together with Sti1. When the cell lysates were supplemented with purified Sti1, the amount of Ssa1 co-precipitated increased with increasing amounts of purified Sti1 added (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). As a control for the specificity of the Sti1 antibody, we repeated the experiment using lysate from the Sti1 knock-out strain CN11a (Fig. 1B, lane 4). No Ssa1 could be detected in this case. To test whether the Sti1 complex contained only Ssa proteins and not Ssb proteins, we probed the blots with an antibody specific for Ssb proteins. This experiment showed that Ssb proteins could not be detected in the Sti1 complex (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Ssb proteins were, however, present in the lysate as shown in Fig. 1B (lane 6). This result is in agreement with previous studies in the mammalian system (25Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), because only the Ssa class of Hsp70s share the C-terminal sequence motif (I/L/M)EEVD-COOH. Because Ssa3 and Ssa4 are only expressed under heat shock, these proteins are not relevant for the function of the yHsp90 multichaperone complex under normal growth conditions. Therefore, we focused in the following on the Ssa1 protein, because Ssa1 and Ssa2 are 97% identical and expressed in equal amounts under these conditions (8Craig E.A. Boorstein W.R. Park H.O. Stone D.N.C.M. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 96: 51-61Google Scholar). Sti1 Binds to Ssa1 with Low Affinity—To further characterize the interaction between Ssa1 and Sti1, we purified both proteins and studied complex formation under physiological conditions concerning salt concentration and temperature. First, we incubated the proteins and performed immunoprecipitations with anti-Sti1 or anti-Ssa antibodies and separated the precipitate by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2A indicates that the Sti1-Ssa1 complex was formed efficiently under these conditions. We found that the amount of Ssa1 in the complex was not significantly affected by ATP (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). To gain quantitative data on the interaction between Ssa1 and Sti1, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was employed. Binding of different Sti1 concentrations with or without ATP to immobilized Ssa1 was analyzed. The data from the resulting sensorgrams were used to determine the dissociation constant of the Ssa1-Sti1 interaction (Fig. 2B). We found that in the absence of ATP, Sti1 binds to Ssa1 with an affinity of 7.5 ± 2 μm, whereas in the presence of ATP, the affinity is 3 ± 1 μm (Fig. 2B and Table I). Compared with the affinity of Sti1 for yHsp90 (28Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

We were interested in determining whether Sti1 influences the ATPase activity of Ssa1 as well. Sti1 itself does not exhibit ATPase activity (data not shown). The ATPase activity of Ssa1 is similar to that of other Hsp70s studied, with a K m for ATP of 0.2 μm and a k cat for ATP of 0.04 min–1 at physiological potassium concentrations (48Lopez-Buesa P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15253-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When Sti1 was added to Ssa1, we found that, unexpectedly, the ATPase activity of Ssa1 increased with increasing amounts of Sti1 (Fig. 3A). A stimulation by a factor of 200 was reached at a Sti1:Ssa1 ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3B). Half-maximal activation was reached at a ratio of Ssa1:Sti1 = 1:0.5. When thermally unfolded Sti1 was added in a control experiment, no significant increase in the ATPase activity of Ssa1 was detected (Table II).Table IISummary of kcat valuesProteinkcatmin-1Ssa10.04 ± 0.02Ssa1-Sti1 (1:1)7.1 ± 0.2Ssa1-Sti1 nonnative (1:1)0.04 ± 0.02Ssa1-Ydj1 (1:4)0.4 ± 0.05Ssa1-Ydj1-Sti1 (1:4:1)7.1 ± 0.2Ssa1-Hop (1:5)0.04 ± 0.02yHsp900.4 ± 0.05yHsp90-Sti1 (1:5)0.05 ± 0.02yHsp90-Hop (1:5)0.4 ± 0.05Hsp700.4 ± 0.05Hsp70-Hop (1:5)0.4 ± 0.05Hsp70-Sti1 (1:5)0.4 ± 0.05hHsp900.04 ± 0.01hHsp90-Hop (1:5)0.04 ± 0.01hHsp90-Sti1 (1:5)0.04 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab To determine which step in the Ssa1 ATPase cycle is accelerated by Sti1, we compared steady state measurements with single turnover experiments in the presence and absence of Sti1 (Fig. 3). It was not known whether ATP hydrolysis or nucleotide exchange represents the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of Ssa1. To discriminate between the two possibilities, we analyzed the steady state k cat and the single turnover k cat. In steady state measurements, excess of ATP is used, and therefore Ssa1 hydrolyzes ATP with maximum velocity, whereas in single turnover assays, about 80% of Ssa1 is saturated with ATP. Thus, a single hydrolysis step could be monitored, which allows, in comparison with the steady state measurement, determination of the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle. We found that the k cat values (0.04 min–1) were identical in the absence of Sti1. Thus, we conclude that ATP hydrolysis, or a conformational change preceding it, is rate-limiting for the Ssa1 ATPase cycle. Increasing amounts of Sti1 resulted in an acceleration of the single turnover ATPase activity of Ssa1 (Fig. 3C). A stimulation factor of 200 could also be seen in the single turnover experiments at a Sti1 to Ssa1 ratio of 1:1. In the presence of Sti1, both the steady state k cat and the single turnover k cat were accelerated (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that Sti1 stimulates ATP hydrolysis and confirms that this step is rate-limiting in the Ssa1 ATPase cycle. As previously described (53Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ydj1 is able to accelerate the ATPase of Ssa1 by a factor of 10. When Ydj1 was added to a preformed Ssa1-Sti1 complex at a 1:1 ratio or at high excess, the activation resulting from Sti1 was not influenced (data not shown). Further, if Sti1 was added to an Ssa1-Ydj1 complex, a 200-fold activation was observed. Influence of Sti1 on Ssa1 and yHsp90 in the Ternary Multichaperone Complex—To study the ternary multichaperone complex consisting of Ssa1, Sti1, and yHsp90, we incubated the purified Ssa1, Sti1, and yHsp90, precipitated with anti-Ssa1, anti-Sti1 or anti-yHsp90 antibodies and separated the precipitate by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). The three proteins could be detected in equal amounts no matter which antibody was used. This complex is also present in the absence of ATP (Fig. 4A, lane 4). To study the influence of Sti1 on the ATPase activities of yHsp90 and Ssa1 in the ternary complex, it was necessary to incorporate either a Ssa1 mutant (K69Q) (40McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2139592877,"Nucleotide sulfate, namely 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), is a universal sulfuryl donor for sulfation. Although a specific PAPS transporter is present in Golgi membrane, no study has reported the corresponding gene. We have identified a novel human gene encoding a PAPS transporter, which we have named PAPST1, and the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, slalom (sll). The amino acid sequence of PAPST1 (432 amino acids) exhibited 48.1% identity with SLL (465 amino acids), and hydropathy analysis predicted the two to be type III transmembrane proteins. The transient expression of PAPST1 in SW480 cells showed a subcellular localization in Golgi membrane. The expression of PAPST1 and SLL in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae significantly increased the transport of PAPS into the Golgi membrane fraction. In human tissues, PAPST1 is highly expressed in the placenta and pancreas and present at lower levels in the colon and heart. An RNA interference fly of sll produced with a GAL4-UAS system revealed that the PAPS transporter is essential for viability. It is well known that mutations of some genes related to PAPS synthesis are responsible for human inherited disorders. Our findings provide insights into the significance of PAPS transport and post-translational sulfation.

Glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation are essential post-translational alterations of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids for normal growth and development. For sulfation, an activated form of sulfate, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope; NST, nucleotide-sugar transporter; NFκBIE, nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor epsilon; RNAi, RNA interference; UGTrel1, UDP-galactose transporter-related isozyme 1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ORF, open reading frame.1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope; NST, nucleotide-sugar transporter; NFκBIE, nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor epsilon; RNAi, RNA interference; UGTrel1, UDP-galactose transporter-related isozyme 1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ORF, open reading frame. is used as a common sulfate donor (1Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 837-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate is transferred from PAPS to a defined position on the sugar residue by sulfotransferases. In higher organisms, PAPS is synthesized in the cytosol (2Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 681-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 686-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a bifunctional PAPS synthetase having both ATP-sulfurylase and adenosine-phosphosulfate kinase activities (4Li H. Deyrup A.

Since sulfation occurs in the lumens of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (5Lane N. Caro L. Othero-Vilardebó L.R. Godman G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 21: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), PAPS must be translocated from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen through a specific transporter localized in the microsomal membrane. Earlier studies had shown a saturable transport activity of PAPS using isolated Golgi vesicles (6Schwarz J.K. Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or reconstituted proteoliposome (7Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify this transporter protein, the proteins responsible for PAPS translocating activity have been purified (8Mandon E.C.

The characterization of these purified proteins revealed the kinetic behavior of a PAPS-specific transport through an antiport mechanism (8Mandon E.C. Milla M.E. Kempner E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10707-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Ozeran J.D. Westley J. Schwartz N.B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, cloning of the transporter has not been reported. Recently, several nucleotide-sugar transporters (NSTs) have been cloned and characterized in mammals, yeast, protozoa, and plants (11Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Gerardy-Schahn R. Oelmann S. Bakker H. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-sugars are the donor substrates for glycosylation, which is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases. These NST proteins are highly hydrophobic Type III multitransmembrane proteins localized in the Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum membrane and provide a specific substrate for the glycosylation. The structural conservation among NSTs has contributed to the identification of novel NST-related sequences from existing databases, whereas the levels of the amino acids identified are not indicators of their substrate specificities (14Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A large number of putative NST sequences of mammals, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, and yeast are under investigation for substrate specificity and function. By a BLAST search of the data base, we identified a putative NST gene homologous to human UGTrel1 (UDP-galactose transporter-related isozyme 1) (15Ishida N. Miura N. Yoshioka S. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the heterologous expression of PAPST1 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not result in any nucleotide-sugar transport activity but revealed PAPS transport activity. Furthermore, the Drosophila melanogaster orthologous gene, slalom (sll), had the same substrate specificity. When double-stranded RNA of sll was expressed ubiquitously under the control of a cytoplasmic actin promoter to induce the silencing of the sll gene, the RNAi fly showed marked lethality. Here we reported the functional properties of these novel PAPS transporters. Materials—GDP-[2-3H]mannose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-[1-3H]glucose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-N-acetyl-[6-3H]d-galactosamine (15 Ci/mmol), and UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [35S]PAPS (2.275 Ci/mmol), GDP-[1-3H]fucose (6.95 Ci/mmol), UDP-[4,5-3H]galactose (48.3 Ci/mmol), CMP-[9-3H]sialic acid (33.6 Ci/mmol), and UDP-N-acetyl-[6-3H]d-glucosamine (39.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Isolation of Human and Drosophila PAPS Transporter cDNAs and Construction of Expression Plasmids—A TBLASTN search was performed for the amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) of UGTrel1 (15Ishida N. Miura N. Yoshioka S. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We succeeded in identifying a candidate cDNA sequence encoding a full-length ORF. To obtain this cDNA and create recombination sites for the GATEWAY™ cloning system (Invitrogen), we used two steps of attB adaptor PCR for the preparation of attB-flanked PCR products. For the first gene-specific amplification, a forward template-specific primer with attB1 (5′-aaaaagcaggcttcgcctggaccatggacgc-3′) and a reverse template-specific primer with attB2 (5′-agaaagctgggtcaaccttctgcacaggaga-3′) were used. PCR was performed using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and a cDNA library derived from human colon tissue. The insertion of a complete attB adaptor and cloning into the pDONR™201 vector to create an entry clone for the subsequent subcloning were performed according to the instruction manual. A Drosophila cDNA encoding the ORF of slalom (sll) was obtained from expressed sequence tag clone SD04658 (Invitrogen) by PCR using a forward template-specific primer (5′-aaaaagcaggcttccgccacatgtacgcctat-3′) and a reverse template-specific primer (5′-agaaagctgggtcgacagccattttcggttt-3′). The rest of the cloning procedure was the same as described above. Expression vectors were inserted with three copies of HA epitope tags (YPYDVPDYA) at the position corresponding to the C terminus of the expressing protein and converted to a GATEWAY destination vector with a conversion site. Each entry clone was subcloned into appropriate expression vectors using the GATEWAY cloning system according to the instruction manual. Transient Transfection and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The mammalian expression vector, pCXN2, was kindly provided by Dr. K. Miyazaki (Tokyo University). SW480 cells (CCL-228; ATCC) were subcultured onto a four-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 0.25 μg/well of pCXN2 or pCXN2 inserted with PAPST1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and permeabilized in permeabilizing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then cells were stained with anti-β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 mAb (16Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) for 16 h at 4 °C, washed four times with permeabilizing buffer, and incubated with rhodamine-labeled anti-IgG mAb for 90 min at room temperature. After incubation, the cells were washed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA mAb for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and mounted with PermaFluor (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Stable Transfection—Burkitt's lymphoma Namalwa cells (CRL-1432; ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. First, 4 μg of pAMo vector (17Sasaki K. Watanabe E. Kawashima K. Sekine S. Dohi T. Oshima M. Hanai N. Nishi T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or pAMo inserted with PAPST1 was transfected into 1 × 107 cells by electroporation using a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). The transfectants were selected by the addition of 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) to the medium. Subcellular Fractionation of Yeast and Transport Assay—Yeast S. cerevisiae strain W303–1a (MATa, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11,15, trp1-1, leu2-3,112, and can1-100) was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a yeast expression vector, YEp352GAP-II, kindly provided by Dr. K. Nakayama (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan). Transformed yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in synthetic defined medium in which uracil was omitted for the selection of transformants. Subcellular fractionation and nucleotide-sugar transport assays were performed as described by Roy et al. (19Roy S.K. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13580-13587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were converted into spheroplasts, homogenized, and fractionated to yield a 10,000 × g membrane fraction (P10), a 100,000 × g membrane fraction (P100), and the supernatant of the cytosolic fraction (S100). Then 200 μg of protein of each fraction was incubated in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 m 2 phenotype. m MnCl, and 10 m m 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 μm radiolabeled substrate at 30 °C for 5 min. After incubation, the radioactivity incorporated in the microsomes was trapped with a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter and measured by liquid scintillation. The amount of incorporated substrate was calculated as the difference with the background value obtained from the time 0 assay for each sample. Western Blot Analysis—The indicated amounts of protein of samples were added to 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were fractionated on a 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the XV PANTELA electrophoresis system (DRC Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Anti-HA mouse mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb were detected by ECL+plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantitative Analysis of the PAPST1 Transcript in Human Tissues by Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from human tissues by the methods of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a SuperscriptII first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of PAPST1 expression in the different tissues was performed by real time PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-ggcaggccctgaagct-3′; reverse, 5′-tgcgggtcatcactctttc-3′. The probe, which consisted of 5′-ccacagggctccaggtgtcttatctg-3′, was labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dye, 3FAM, and at the 3′-end with the quencher dye TAMRA (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real time PCR was performed using a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The relative amount of PAPST1 transcript was normalized to an endogenous control, human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript in the same cDNA. Construction of sll RNAi Fly and Quantitative Analysis of the Transcript—A 500-bp cDNA fragment of sll was amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5′-acacttcttctcggatctgct-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gacgattggaaaacaccagga-3′) and inserted as an inverted repeat with a head-to-head orientation into a modified Bluescript vector, pSC1. The cloning of sll into the transformation vector pUAST was done as previously reported (21Takemae H. Ueda R. Ohkubo R. Nakato H. Izumi S. Saigo K. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transformation of Drosophila embryos was carried out according to Spradling (22Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 175-197Google Scholar) with w1118 stock as a host to make four UAS-sll inverted repeat fly lines. Each line was mated with the Act5CGAL4 fly line, and the F1 progeny was raised at 28 °C to determine the phenotype. The quantitation of the sll transcript in third instar larvae was performed using real time PCR as described above. Sequences of used primers and probe are as follows: forward, 5′-ggcccagttgtgtttacgataat-3′; reverse, 5′-ggtagatgaagcaggagagcataat-3′; probe, 5′-ccaccgcctgacgcagtgtcat-3′. The relative amount of sll transcript was normalized to an endogenous control, ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32) transcript in the same cDNA. Cloning of Human PAPST1 and sll cDNA—We identified a cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number BC024288) homologous to UGTrel1 and cloned the full-length ORF as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We named it PAPST1. We also found a gene producing marked alignment with UGTrel1 in Drosophila, sll (GenBank™ accession number NM_079665). sll is known in Flybase as CG7623 (Flybase accession number FBgn0038524) and predicted to be an UDP-galactose transporter. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of PAPST1, SLL, and UGTrel1 is shown in Fig. 1A. PAPST1 consisted of 432 amino acids with a calculated mass of 47.5-kDa, whereas SLL has 465 amino acids with a calculated mass of 52.3-kDa. Hydrophobicity analyses of the amino acid sequences revealed that PAPST1 and SLL are type III transmembrane proteins with eight and nine transmembrane domains, respectively. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of these genes suggested that sll is orthologous to PAPST1 rather than UGTrel1. PAPST1 showed 31.6 and 48.1% identity to UGTrel1 and SLL, respectively. There are two potential N-glycosylation sites in the SLL sequence (double underlined), but no possible N-glycosylation site was found in PAPST1 and UGTrel1. The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) of human and Drosophila transporter genes suggests that sll is more orthologous to PAPST1 than all of the others. The PAPST1 gene is mapped on human chromosome 6, and the mRNA is composed of four exons. The sll gene is mapped on Drosophila chromosome 3, and the mRNA is composed of five exons. Subcellular Localization of PAPST1 in Mammalian Cells— The subcellular localization of transiently expressed PAPST1 protein in SW480 cells was investigated by immunofluorescence staining. A mammalian expression vector, pCXN2, was inserted with the ORF of PAPST1 with an HA epitope tag at the C terminus and transfected transiently into SW480 cells. The cells were double immunostained with anti-HA mAb and anti-β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 mAb. The immunofluorescence microscopy of cells expressing HA-tagged PAPST1 is shown in Fig. 2A. PAPST1-HA showed partial co-localization with β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, which is a typical protein of trans-Golgi localization (16Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that PAPST1 is localized in the Golgi apparatus but not endoplasmic reticulum. Further support for this observation was derived from Western blotting of stable transfectants. Namalwa cells stably expressing HA-tagged PAPST1 or mock vector (vector alone) were fractionated into a 10,000 × g fraction (P10), a 100,000 × g microsomal fraction (P100), and the supernatant of the cytosolic fraction (S100). PAPST1 transfectant showed 16.3 times the PAPST1 transcript level of the mock transfectant (4.41 and 71.71 × 10–3/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2B, PAPST1 protein was detected mainly in the P100 microsomal membrane fraction with a small amount in the P10 fraction by Western blotting. HA-tagged PAPST1 proteins migrated as a 48-kDa protein. These proteins were not detected in cells transfected with mock vector. These results indicate that HA-tagged PAPST1 protein is predominantly localized on Golgi membrane. Substrate Specificities of PAPST1 and SLL Proteins Expressed in Yeast Cells—To investigate the functional properties of PAPST1 and SLL, we used a heterologous yeast expression system. Yeast strain S. cerevisiae is widely used, because the isolated microsomal vesicles have little nucleotide-sugar transport activity except for GDP-mannose. A yeast expression vector, YEp352GAP-II, was inserted with the ORF of PAPST1 or sll and introduced into W303–1a yeast. PAPST1 and SLL proteins were expressed in the yeast P100 membrane fraction (Fig. 3A). The substrate specificities of PAPST1 and SLL were examined using radiolabeled substrates. As shown in Fig. 3B, the transport activity of PAPS into the P100 fraction prepared from yeast cells expressing PAPST1 and SLL is significantly higher than that shown for the mock (2.5 and 4.9 times, respectively). No difference was observed among PAPST1, SLL, and mock in the transport of other nucleotide-sugars. This was confirmed in Namalwa cells stably transfected with PAPST1. The P100 fraction of the PAPST1 transfectant showed 4.3 times the PAPS transport activity of the mock transfectant (1.34 ± 0.13 and 5.72 ± 0.06 pmol/5 min/mg of protein, respectively). The substrate concentration dependences of PAPS transport by PAPST1 and SLL are shown in Fig. 3C. The apparent K m values of PAPST1 and SLL were estimated to be 0.8 and 1.2 μm, respectively. Tissue Distribution of PAPST1 Transcripts in Human Tissues—The gene expression of PAPST1 in human tissues was analyzed using real time PCR. The distribution of PAPST1 transcripts in human tissues is shown in Fig. 4. The placenta had the most PAPST1 among the tissues tested. Relatively high levels of PAPST1 expression in the pancreas, mammary gland, and skeletal muscle were also observed. PAPST1 transcripts were hardly detectable at all in colon, heart, and prostate. All transcript levels are shown relative to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Lethality of Inducible sll RNAi Flies—Proteoglycans, including heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, are sulfated at various positions along their glycosaminoglycan chains. Since PAPS is the sole substrate for sulfation, the down-regulation of PAPS transport into Golgi lumen may display an abnormal biological phenotype. To elucidate the importance of the PAPS transporter to the viability of D. melanogaster, we made an inducible sll RNAi fly using the GAL4-UAS system (21Takemae H. Ueda R. Ohkubo R. Nakato H. Izumi S. Saigo K. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Ueda R. J. Neurogenet. 2001; 15: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). First we made four UAS-sll inverted repeat fly lines, and then we used Act5C-GAL4 as a GAL4 driver to induce sll gene knock-down in all cells of the fly. In the F1 generations of the Act5C-GAL4 fly and the UAS-sll inverted repeat fly, double-stranded RNA of sll was expressed ubiquitously under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promoter to induce sll gene silencing. The amount of sll transcript in the third instar larvae of each F1 is shown in Table I. All transcripts were analyzed by real time PCR and are shown as relative amounts to that of RpL32. The relative amount of sll transcript in the F1 of the UAS-sll inverted repeat fly crossed with the Act5C-GAL4 fly is reduced to approximately one-fifth of that in the F of w1118 1 crossed with Act5C-GAL4, Act5C-GAL4/+, which corresponds to the wild type. All four lines of the F1 of the UAS-sll inverted repeat fly crossed with Act5C-GAL4 exhibited pupal lethality, and no fly developed into an adult (Table I). These results clearly demonstrated that sll is essential for the viability of flies.Table ILethality of inducible sll RNAi flyStock No.Insertion chromosomesll transcriptaThe relative amount of each sll mRNA to RpL32 mRNA in F1 progeny of w1118 crossed with Act5C-GAL4, Act5C-GAL4/+, which corresponds to the wild type, was presented as 100.

ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We have identified and characterized a human PAPS transporter, PAPST1, and the Drosophila ortholog sll. PAPS is considered to be translocated from cytosol into Golgi lumen via a specific transporter. The present study is the first to achieve the cloning and molecular characterization of PAPS transporters. To isolate these novel transporters, we used the cloning strategy of searching databases for cDNAs homologous to human UGTrel1. UGTrel1 is a gene of unknown function that has similarity with human UDP-galactose transporter genes (15Ishida N. Miura N. Yoshioka S. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In humans, Muraoka et al. (24Muraoka M. Kawakita M. Ishida N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) identified a gene related to UGTrel1 and reported that the product transports both UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. The phylogenetic tree of these transporters indicated that PAPST1 is more closely related to UGTrel1 (Fig. 1B). PAPST1 was defined in GenBank™ as a nuclear factor of a κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor epsilon (NFκBIE), although no evidence of this has been provided. Two distinct NFκBIE proteins were reported in 1997 independently by two laboratories (25Li Z. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israël A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In some data bases, there has been confusion over PAPST1 and two other NFκBIEs about the sequence and gene locus. Although we did not assess the effect of PAPST1 on nuclear factor κB DNA binding activity, we failed to find any ankyrin repeat motif in PAPST1, which is essential for interactions with nuclear factor κB. Furthermore, PAPST1 is multitransmembrane protein, whereas other NFκBIEs are toplasmic proteins. These findings strongly indicate that PAPST1 is not an NFκBIE. Mandon et al. (8Mandon E.C. Milla M.E.

The PAPS transport activity was characterized using phosphatidylcholine liposome and sessed to have an apparent K m of 1.7 μm. Independently, Ozeran et al. (9Ozeran J.D. Westley J. Schwartz N.B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) purified and characterized a 230-kDa liver Golgi membrane translocase protein. From its kinetic properties, they characterized it as a specific transporter PAPS, which acts through an antiport mechanism with adenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate as the returning ligand. The kinetic behavior of PAPST1 resembles that of a rat protein (a saturable transport of PAPS with an apparent K m of 0.8 μm (Fig. 4B)); however, PAPST1 is different from these proteins in regard its apparent molecular mass. The HA-tagged PAPST1 protein expressed in Namalwa cells showed a band of 48-kDa on Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). It is not clear whether these proteins are homo- or heteropolymeric forms of PAPST1 or distinct PAPS transporters. Whether PAPST1 is the sole PAPS transporter or not should be evaluated in further investigations. As shown in Table I, the RNAi fly of sll induced with GAL4-UAS system confirmed that sll is essential for viability. Recent studies on Drosophila demonstrated that the mutation of some genes required for proteoglycan biosynthesis, dally (27Tsuda M. Kamimura K. Nakato H. Archer M. Staatz W. Fox B. Humphrey M.

A number of reports have suggested that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are involved in variety of signaling pathways, in particular those of fibroblast growth factor (34Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are thought to be required for stabilizing the complex between a ligand and its receptors or restricting the extracellular diffusion of ligands (35Reichsman F. Smith L.

It is known that the developmental signaling functions cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are dependent their sulfation states (35Reichsman F. Smith L. Cumberledge S. J.

In Drosophila, the mutation of gene encoding N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (sulfateless) caused defects in Wingless (27Tsuda M. Kamimura K. Nakato H. Archer M. Staatz W. Fox B. Humphrey M.

Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, sll in the flybase is involved in signal transduction by growth factors of Wingless and Hedgehog during patterning and morphogenesis (39Lüeders, F., Selva, E., Perrimon, N., and Häcker, U.

We reported the quirement of Drosophila β1,4-galactosyltransferase I, which contributes to the synthesis of the linkage structure of proteoglycans, for viability (21Takemae H. Ueda R. Ohkubo R.

However, we did not investigate whether the lethality of the sll RNAi fly is caused by a reduction in the sulfation of proteoglycans or other sulfated glycoconjugates, such as sulfatides (40Honke K. Hirahara Y. Dupree J. Suzuki K. Popko B. Fukushima K. Fukushima J. Nagasawa T. Yoshida N. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it might involved in not only proteoglycan synthesis but also sulfatide synthesis, which occurs in the early Golgi compartment. Further clarification is necessary regarding the role of the PAPS transporter in proteoglycan synthesis and the signaling pathway. Mutations of some genes related to PAPS synthesis are known to be responsible for human inherited disorders. The diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene was identified as being responsible for diastrophic dysplasia by Hästbacka et al. (42Hästbacka J. de la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve-Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I. Lander E.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter plays an important role in providing sulfate ion from the extracellular milieu to the cytosol. Mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene impair sulfate uptake across the plasma membrane and the sulfation of proteoglycans in cartilage matrix. Achondrogenesis type IB, atelosteogenesis type II, dysplasia epiphysealis multiplex, and other diastrophic dysplasia variant disorders are caused by allelic mutations in the same gene, although the molecular basis of the majority of osteochondrodysplasias is still unknown. In addition, Kurima et al. found that the PAPS synthase 2 gene is responsible for mouse brachymorphism characterized by a dome-shaped skull, short thick tail, and shortened limbs (43Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger Jr., R.C. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Missense and nonsense mutations of PAPS synthase 2 were demonstrated in the human inherited disorder, spondylo-epimetaphyseal dysplasia (44ul Haque M.F. King L.M. Krakow D. Cantor R.M. Rusiniak M.E.

On the other hand, no genetic disorder has been associated with the subsequent PAPS transport pathway. We also identified the Drosophila ortholog, sll. D. melanogaster is a well established model for genetic analysis. The analysis of the RNAi fly of sll may help to elucidate the biological function of PAPS transport and its role in post-translational sulfation. We are grateful to Dr. Y. Nagai (Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Science) for helpful advice and critical reading of the manuscript."

It is anchored to the plasma membrane via a single transmembrane domain that, together with a six-amino acid cytoplasmic tail, is part of the putative uncleaved signal sequence (1Hong W. Doyle D.

DPPIV is expressed in various epithelial tissues (e.g. liver bile canaliculi, kidney proximal tubules, prostate gland, and intestine), endothelia (e.g. lung capillaries, kidney vasa recta, and spleen sinusoids), and T-cells (4De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. Scharpe S. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 367-375Google Scholar, 5Piazza G.A. Callanan H.M. Mowery J. Hixson D.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 327-334Google Scholar, 6Johnson R.C. Zhu D.

The DPPIV functions are diverse and include three major activities. The best known and most widely researched function is that of its serine exopeptidase activity. DPPIV cleaves dipeptides from the N terminus of polypeptides that have either proline or alanine in their penultimate positions (3Fleischer B. Immunol.

The DPPIV exopeptidase activity accounts for a variety of regulatory processes, including chemokine regulation (8Lambeir A.M. Proost P. Durinx C. Bal G. Senten K. Augustyns K. Scharpe S. Van Damme J.

Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 187-195Google Scholar). The catalytic sequence is GWSYG and is located at amino acids 627–631 of rat DPPIV. The second major function of DPPIV is its ability to bind to the extracellular matrix, presumably involving the predicted seven-bladed β-propeller domain (13Gorrell M.D. Gysbers V. McCaughan G.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 2001; 54: 249-264Google Scholar). Binding affinities for both collagen type 1 and fibronectin (FN) have been reported (5Piazza G.A. Callanan H.M. Mowery J. Hixson D.C. Biochem.

The third major function is that of a T-cell co-stimulatory protein (reviewed in Refs. 3Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Google Scholar, 4De Meester I. Korom S. Van Damme J. Scharpe S.

Although the exact molecular mechanisms by which DPPIV mediates T-cell activation are still unresolved, the ability of DPPIV to interact with CD45, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (20Torimoto Y.

Rather than relying on tissue culture-isolated endothelial cells, screening was performed with outside-out membrane vesicles freshly harvested from the luminal membrane of endothelial cells by in situ vascular perfusion of rat lungs with a formaldehyde/dithiothreitol solution to induce endothelial cell-surface vesiculation (6Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Google Scholar, 15Johnson R.C. Augustin-Voss H.G. Zhu D.Z. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 394-399Google Scholar). Consistently, lung endothelial vesicles adhered in large numbers to lung-metastatic cancer cells only, but not to liver-metastatic or non-metastatic cancer cells, whereas control vesicles prepared from a rarely metastasized organ (e.g. leg musculature) adhered at background levels to lung- and liver-metastatic and non-metastatic tumor cells. Using a passive/active immunization schedule involving emulsified leg endothelial vesicles for passive immunization and lung endothelial vesicles for active immunization, we identified a monoclonal antibody that totally blocked the adhesion of lung endothelial vesicles to lung-metastatic cancer cells. The molecule blocked by the antibody was identified as DPPIV (6Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Google Scholar). Subsequently, we showed that vascular arrest of lung-metastatic cancer cells was mediated by DPPIV adhesion to cancer cell surface-associated FN (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar, 17Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Levine R.A. Pauli B.U. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 35-43Google Scholar, 18Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Zhang S. Pauli B.U. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Google Scholar). In contrast to the poor ability of DPPIV to bind to soluble plasma FN, the binding to cell surface-associated FN was of high avidity, suggesting that cell surface-associated FN presents itself in a different configuration than soluble plasma FN (25Ugarova T.P.

Indeed, detailed biochemical analyses of cancer cell surface-associated FN revealed that FN is assembled into large fibrillar polymers (poly-FN) that are dispersed over the cancer cell surface in multiple globular aggregates, apparently exposing multiple DPPIV-binding sites (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar, 17Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Levine R.A. Pauli B.U. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 35-43Google Scholar). Participation of the DPPIV/poly-FN adhesion in lung metastasis was substantiated by the findings that (a) a soluble DPPIV polypeptide representing the entire extracellular domain totally abolishes adhesion of lung-metastatic breast cancer cells to DPPIV and, accordingly, prevents lung colonization (17Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Levine R.A. Pauli B.U. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 35-43Google Scholar); (b) the Fischer 344/CRJ rat substrain, which harbors a G633R substitution in DPPIV that leads to retention and degradation of much of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (18Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Zhang S. Pauli B.U. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Google Scholar, 28Tsuji E. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Takami N. Ogata S. Ikehara Y.

Pauli, unpublished data. respectively; (c) lung-metastatic tumor cell lines derived from various human, mouse, and rat cancers invariably carry a strong message for endogenous FN and are able to assemble poly-FN on their surfaces; (d) FN surface expression in clones derived from a rhabdomyosarcoma correlates with lung metastasis (29Korach S. Poupon M.F. Du Villard J.A. Becker M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3624-3629Google Scholar); and (e) human and mouse melanoma cell lines selected for enhanced lung colonization overexpress FN (30Clark E.A.

Together, these data suggest that the DPPIV/poly-FN adhesion might be a quite common mechanism in the colonization of the lungs by blood-borne cancer cells, where it may operate alone or collaborate with other adhesion molecules, including FN ligands other than DPPIV (e.g. integrins, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and CD44), to mediate vascular arrest (32Kurschat P.

The binding sites were found by generating and screening a series of successively shorter FN sequences for DPPIV binding. The sites are located in type III repeats 13, 14, and 15 (FNIII13, -14, and -15, respectively) and represent a common consensus motif. Their DPPIV-binding specificity is confirmed in biochemical, mutational, adhesion, and lung colony assays.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Lung-metastatic MTF7 rat mammary carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. D. R. Welch (Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, PA); B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells were from Dr. I. J. Fidler (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX); and MDA-MB-231 cells were from Dr. J. Price (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). MTF7 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum; MDA-MB-231 and B16-F10 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6A3 and polyclonal antibody (pAb) CU31 were generated against rat DPPIV (6Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Google Scholar). pAb against maltose-binding protein (MBP) was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA); pAb against FN was from Invitrogen; and pAbs against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). FN proteolytic fragments (29, 45, and 70 kDa), anti-HA mAb-conjugated agarose beads, and all other reagents were from Sigma. PET14 (amino acids 2045–2062 of FNIII14, VTEATITGLEPGTEYTIY, with the DPPIV-binding motif underlined) and the control peptide PEPcon (amino acids 1774–1791 of FNIII extra domain A (FNIIIEDA), EDTAELQGLRPGSEYTVS) were synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA).Plasmid Constructs and PROTOMAT Search—Rat FNIII1–6, FNIII8–15, and FNIII12–15 were obtained as MBP fusion proteins from Dr. J. E. Schwarzbauer (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) (36Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Google Scholar). To generate MBP-FN fusion proteins, FNIII8–11 (amino acids 1414–1720), FNIII12–14 (amino acids 1811–2081), FNIII12–13 (amino acids 1811–1991), FNIII13–14 (amino acids 1903–2081), FNIII14–15 (amino acids 1992–2081 and 2202–2286), FNIII12 (amino acids 1811–1902), FNIII13 (amino acids 1903–1991), FNIII14 (amino acids 1992–2081), and FNIII15 (amino acids 2202–2286) were PCR-amplified from FNIII8–15 and inserted into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.). All plasmids were verified by double-stranded sequencing. Overlap extension PCR was used to swap the consensus motif of FNIII13 (amino acids 1959–1968), FNIII14 (amino acids 2049–2058), or FNIII15 (amino acids 2247–2257) with the corresponding region of FNIII12 (amino acids 1868–1877) (37Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Google Scholar). The same methods were used to replace amino acids 1868–1877 in FNIII12 with amino acids 2049–2058 in FNIII14. GST-PEP14-HA and GST-PEPcon-HA fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of FNIII14-(2045–2062) and FNIIIEDA-(1774–1791). The amplified sequence included the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and was inserted into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of the pGEX-KG vector (38Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar).PROTOMAT was used to search for conserved motifs in FNIII13, -14, and -15. The MOTIF program (H. O. Smith, Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) was first run to provide candidate blocks in the FNIII repeats. It was followed by an automated implementation of the GIBBS sampler program (C. E. Lawrence, Department of Statistics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) for reality checking (39Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Alford W.J. Pietrokovski S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: GC17-GC26Google Scholar). A data base of blocks was constructed by successive application of the automated PROTOMAT system to individual entries in the PROSITE catalog (40Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2013-2018Google Scholar) of FNIII repeats keyed to the Swiss Protein Sequence Database (41Bairoch A. Boeckmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2019-2022Google Scholar). 3Available at www.blocks.fhcrc.org. If sequences truly have motifs in common, then both runs typically yield similar or, more significantly, identical sets of blocks (39Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Alford W.J. Pietrokovski S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: GC17-GC26Google Scholar).Purification of Fusion Proteins and Rat DPPIV—MBP-FN fusion proteins (New England Biolabs Inc.) were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 liters of Escherichia coli culture were spun after a 2-h isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.3 mm) induction. Cell pellets were sonicated in 100 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and then spun at 19,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 1:3 with column buffer and passed through an amylose resin column. Columns were washed with 10 volumes of column buffer and eluted with 10 mm maltose in column buffer. The purity of the elutes were evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting with anti-MBP pAb. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). DPPIV was immunopurified from rat lungs using mAb 6A3 (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar, 17Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Levine R.A. Pauli B.U. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 35-43Google Scholar, 18Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Zhang S. Pauli B.U. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Google Scholar). HA-tagged GST fusion proteins were purified with anti-HA mAb-conjugated agarose beads.Gel Overlay Assay (Far-Western)—Equal amounts of N-terminal FN proteolytic fragments (29, 45, and 70 kDa) and MBP-FNIII fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (36Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Google Scholar, 42Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Google Scholar). Gel-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and denatured with 4 m guanidine HCl in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 2 h. Proteins were then slowly renatured in TTBS. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TTBS for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated overnight with 2 μg/ml DPPIV in 5% skim milk at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with TTBS and incubation with anti-DPPIV pAb CU31. Bound anti-DPPIV antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and visualized by ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences).Other Biochemical Methods—A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the binding of DPPIV to FN fusion proteins. FN fusion proteins were coated at the indicated concentrations onto 96-well microtitration plates overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated overnight with 5 μg/ml immunopurified DPPIV at 4 °C. DPPIV binding was detected with anti-DPPIV pAb CU31, horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, and ECL. DPPIV affinity precipitation (pull-down assays) was carried out with DPPIV-conjugated Affi-Gel 10 beads (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar). FN fusion proteins (5 μg/ml in 300 μl of PBS containing 0.1% β-octyl glucoside) were incubated overnight with DPPIV beads at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 0.1% β-octyl glucoside-containing PBS and then boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer. Bound SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were Western-probed with anti-MBP pAb. For the co-immunoprecipitation of DPPIV and MBP-FNIII repeats, DPPIV (5 μg/ml in 300 μl of 0.5% β-octyl glucoside-containing PBS) was incubated with the same concentrations of wild-type or mutant MBP-FNIII single repeats for 6 h at 4 °C. Complexes were then incubated overnight with anti-MBP pAb-conjugated protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C. After washing with 0.5% β-octyl glucoside-containing PBS, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-DPPIV pAb CU31 or anti-MBP pAb. To examine the heparin-binding abilities of wild-type and mutant MBP-FNIII fragments, fusion proteins were incubated overnight with heparin-agarose beads at 4 °C. After washing with 0.5% β-octyl glucoside-containing PBS, the beads were boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were immunoblotted with anti-MBP pAb.Peptide Binding to Purified DPPIV and DPPIV-expressing Cells— Immunopurified DPPIV (10 μg/ml) was coated onto 96-well microtitration plates overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the coated plates were incubated with biotinylated PEP14 or PEPcon (or GST-PEP14 or GST-PEPcon) for 2 h at room temperature. Bound peptide was detected by ELISA using horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin or anti-GST pAb. HEK293 cells were transfected with either rat DPPIV cDNA or vector (pRc-CMV) alone (18Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Zhang S. Pauli B.U. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Google Scholar). Surface expression of DPPIV was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using anti-DPPIV mAb 6A3. To determine the ability of biotinylated PEP14 and PEPcon to bind to cell surface-expressed DPPIV, transfected cells were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml biotinylated peptide for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS, and bound peptide was detected by staining with Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min at 4 °C. Staining patterns were observed by fluorescence microscopy.Cell Adhesion and Lung Colony Inhibition Assays—Cell adhesion and lung colony assays were described previously (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar, 42Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Google Scholar). For adhesion inhibition experiments, DPPIV-binding MBP-FNIII fusion proteins (160 nm) were coated onto the wells of microtitration plates overnight at 4 °C (control, 30 μg/ml poly-l-lysine) and then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and conjugated with DPPIV at a concentration selected to equate the amount of DPPIV bound to plastic as determined by ELISA with anti-DPPIV pAb CU31. The wells were then seeded with tumor cells (3–5 × 104 cells/well) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The percent tumor cell adhesion was determined as described (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar). Alternatively, DPPIV (10 μg/ml) was coated onto the microtitration plate directly overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with GST-PEP14 (control, GSP-PEPcon) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, tumor cells were added, and adhesion was determined as described above. For lung colony inhibition assays, GST-PEP14 or GST-PEPcon (1 mg/mouse) was injected intravenously 15 min prior to tumor cells (1 × 105 cells/0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/mouse). To exclude adverse reactions of GST-PEP14 with DPPIV-expressing T-cells, lung colony assays were performed in T-cell-deficient female 4-week-old Scid/beige mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA).RESULTSFNIII12–15 Harbors the DPPIV-binding Site and Mediates Adhesion of Cancer Cells to DPPIV—Coarse FN fragments that together span the entire length of the FN molecule were screened for DPPIV-binding sites using gel overlay (Far-Western) assays (36Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Google Scholar, 42Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.-C. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25438-25446Google Scholar). Fragments included 29-, 45-, and 70-kDa N-terminal proteolytic cleavage products as well as MBP fusion proteins of FNIII1–6 and FNIII8–15 (Fig. 1). DPPIV binding was mediated by full-length FN and MBP-FNIII8–15, but not by the three proteolytic fragments, MBP-FNIII1–6, and MBP (Fig. 2A). Further dissection of FNIII8–15 into FNIII8–11 and FNIII12–15 confined the DPPIV-binding site to FNIII12–15 (Fig. 2A). To confirm our Far-Western results, pull-down assays and ELISAs were performed. DPPIV-conjugated Affi-Gel 10 beads previously employed to “pull down” cancer cell surface-associated FN aggregates from tumor cell extracts (16Cheng H.-C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Google Scholar) readily pulled down amylose affinity-purified MBP-FNIII8–15 and MBP-FNIII12–15, but not MBP, MBP-FNIII1–6, and MBP-FNIII8–11 (Fig. 2B). The same result was achieved when binding of DPPIV to immobilized FN fragments was analyzed by ELISA using anti-DPPIV pAb CU31 to detect bound DPPIV (Fig. 2C). Binding of DPPIV to full-length FN and FNIII12–15 was dose-dependent, reaching a plateau at 160 nm (Fig. 2D), whereas DPPIV failed to bind FNIII8–11 at any of the test concentrations.Fig. 2DPPIV binding to FN fragments.A, Far-Western assay. Affinity-purified FN fragments resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions were examined for DPPIV binding by Far-Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that DPPIV bound only to full-length (F.L.) FN, MBP-FNIII8–15, and MBP-FNIII12–15. B, pull-down assay. DPPIV-conjugated beads were incubated with soluble MBP, MBP-FNIII1–6, MBP-FNIII8–15, MBP-FNIII8–11, and MBP-FNIII12–15, and the pulled down material was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MBP pAb.

Means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements in three separate experiments are shown. *, p < 0.01, relative to DPPIV binding to FNIII8–11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The functional significance of the DPPIV/FNIII12–15 adhesion was substantiated in adhesion inhibition assays with four cancer cell lines. Three of these cell lines, MTF7, B16-F10, and MDA-MB-231, consistently colonized the lungs of rats and mice upon tail vein injection, expressed strong endogenous messages for FN, and accumulated significant amounts of aggregated FN on their surfaces (Fig. 3A). In contrast, MCF7 tumor cells did not colonize the lungs and were negative for endogenous message and surface accumulation of FN. Accordingly, MTF7, B16-F10, and MDA-M"
https://openalex.org/W2062171241,"β-Glucans are major structural components of fungi. We have recently reported that the pathogenic fungus Pneumocystis carinii assembles a β-glucan-rich cell wall that potently activates alveolar macrophages to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Purified P. carinii β-glucans predictably induce both cytokine generation and associated neutrophilic lung inflammation. Herein, we demonstrate that P. carinii β-glucan-induced macrophage stimulation results from activation of NF-κB. Although analogous to macrophage activation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), P. carinii β-glucan-induced macrophage NF-κB activation exhibits distinctly different kinetics, with slower induction and longer duration compared with LPS stimulation. Macrophage activation in response to P. carinii β-glucan was also substantially inhibited with the NF-κB antagonist pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. In addition to different kinetics of NF-κB activation, P. carinii β-glucan and LPS also utilize different receptor systems to induce macrophage activation. Macrophages from Toll-like receptor 4-deficient and wild type mice produced equivalent amounts of tumor necrosis factor α when stimulated with P. carinii β-glucan. However, Toll-like receptor 4-deficient macrophages were refractory to stimulation with LPS. In contrast, MyD88-deficient macrophages exhibited a significant (though partial) blunted response to P. carinii β-glucan. These data demonstrate that P. carinii β-glucan acts as potent inducer of macrophage activation through NF-κB utilizing cellular receptors and signaling pathways distinct from LPS. β-Glucans are major structural components of fungi.

Pneumocystis carinii remains a common cause of pneumonia among individuals with compromised immune function, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS or malignancies and following organ transplantation (1Phair J. Munoz A. Detels R. Kaslow R. Rinaldo C. Saah A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 161-165Google Scholar, 2Yale S.H. Limper A.H. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1996; 71: 5-13Google Scholar). Similar to other related fungi, P. carinii assembles a β-glucan-rich cell wall comprised of glucose residues arranged in β-(1,3)-d-glucopyranosyl polymers with β-(1,6)-d-glucopyranosyl side chains of varying length and frequency distributions (3Kottom T.J. Limper A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40628-40634Google Scholar, 4Shematek E.M. Braatz J.A. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 888-894Google Scholar, 5Duffus J.H. Levi C. Manners D.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1982; 23: 151-181Google Scholar). We recently reported the isolation and characterization of a particulate carbohydrate cell wall fraction derived from P. carinii, which is composed largely of β-glucans (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 7Hahn P.Y. Evans S.E. Kottom T.J. Standing J.E. Pagano R.E. Limper A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2043-2050Google Scholar). In addition to providing structural support to the organism, P. carinii cell wall β-glucans potently induce inflammatory activation of lung cells, with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during this infection (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 7Hahn P.Y. Evans S.E. Kottom T.J. Standing J.E. Pagano R.E. Limper A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2043-2050Google Scholar). Although essential for host responses and clearance of P. carinii, alveolar macrophage-induced lung inflammation contributes substantially to respiratory failure and death during P. carinii pneumonia (8Limper A.H. Hoyte J.S. Standing J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2110-2117Google Scholar). Indeed, exuberant host inflammatory responses to this organism stimulate alveolar edema and neutrophilic infiltration, resulting in acute lung injury and respiratory failure. Pulmonary inflammation exerts a greater effect on clinical outcome than direct actions of the organism (9Limper A.H. Offord K.P. Smith T.F. Martin II, W.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1204-1209Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the clinical observation that severe P. carinii pneumonia remains the only form of acute lung injury that has clearly been demonstrated to improve with agents that nonspecifically down-regulate host inflammatory responses, namely corticosteroid therapy (10Huang Z.B. Eden E. Chest. 1993; 104: 751-755Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of host inflammatory cell activation by P. carinii is of critical importance and may provide essential insights into means by which the inflammatory response may be selectively modulated to advantage the host. Particulate β-glucans from fungal organisms interact with cognate receptors on macrophages stimulating the release of reactive oxidants, eicosanoid metabolites, cytokines, and chemokines (11Abel G. Czop J.K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 1363-1373Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, whole P. carinii organisms and β-glucan isolates purified from P. carinii both strongly promote inflammatory activation of alveolar macrophages with subsequent release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TLR-4, Toll-like receptor 4; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EMSA, electromobility shift assay(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TLR-4, Toll-like receptor 4; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EMSA, electromobility shift assay(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (6Vassallo R.

P. carinii-initiated macrophage stimulation is mediated through ligation of glucan receptors and is abolished by digestion with β-glucanase, indicating that glucan components of the organism are chiefly responsible for macrophage inflammatory responses during this infection (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 12Hoffman O.A. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3932-3940Google Scholar). Although these investigations provide important insight into the initiation of P. carinii-induced lung inflammation, signal transduction mechanisms mediating macrophage activation during P. carinii challenge have not yet been defined. NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates inflammatory gene expression in many immune effector cells. NF-κB activation is induced by a variety of extracellular signals such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and viral products (13Muller J.M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 233-256Google Scholar, 14Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Google Scholar, 15Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 3-9Google Scholar, 16Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Demers L.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 7-17Google Scholar). In quiescent unstimulated cells, NF-κB is composed of homodimers or heterodimers containing various Rel proteins, including NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel, complexed to an inhibitory anchor protein termed IκBα (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Google Scholar). Following stimulation with an appropriate agent, IκBα is phosphorylated and rapidly degraded through proteosomal mechanisms (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Google Scholar). Removal of IκBα permits translocation of active NF-κB components to the nucleus where they initiate cytokine gene transcription (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Google Scholar, 18Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar). In addition, receptor mechanisms participating in innate macrophage immune responses to β-glucans are not yet characterized. The Toll family of immune receptors represents a conserved family of pattern recognition receptors that respond to microbial products and other agonists to trigger host inflammatory responses (19Modlin R.L. Brightbill H.D. Godowski P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1834-1835Google Scholar). For instance, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a well defined mechanism conferring host cell response to bacterial LPS (20Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D.

Furthermore, many, although not all, Toll family responses also require activity of the MyD88 adaptor protein to initiate cell signaling (21Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Google Scholar, 22Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 155-167Google Scholar). Cellular activation through such innate immune receptors has not been extensively studied during challenge of cells with fungal cell wall β-glucans. The branching structures and biological activities of fungal β-glucans vary considerably with the sources from which they are derived. Zymosan, a commonly studied β-glucan source prepared from the nonpathogenic fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other soluble nonpathogenic glucans activate nuclear factor NF-κB in cell lines (23Young S.H. Ye J. Frazer D.G. Shi X. Castranova V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20781-20787Google Scholar, 24Adams D.S. Pero S.C. Petro J.B. Nathans R. Mackin W.M. Wakshull E. J.

Whether NF-κB participates in signaling macrophage inflammatory activation to release TNFα following stimulation with cell wall β-glucans derived from P. carinii and whether such signaling can be modified pharmacologically are currently unknown. The present investigation was therefore performed to determine the role of NF-κB in inflammatory activation of macrophages challenged P. carinii β-glucans. We further tested the roles of TLR-4 and MyD88 in signaling macrophage responses to P. carinii β-glucans and whether macrophage activation could be modified with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent inhibitor of NF-κB. Reagents—Endotoxin-free buffers and reagents were scrupulously used in all experiments. LPS from Escherichia coli 026:B6, PDTC, and other general reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. P. carinii was derived originally from the American Type Culture Collection stock (Manassas, VA) and has been passaged in our immunosuppressed rat colony (8Limper A.H. Hoyte J.S. Standing J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2110-2117Google Scholar). Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were also purchased from American Type Culture Collection and routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin 10,000 units/liter, and streptomycin 1 mg/liter. Generation of a P. carinii β-Glucan-rich Cell Wall Isolate—All animal experimentation was reviewed and approved by the Mayo Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. A glucan-rich cell wall fraction from P. carinii was prepared as recently described (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 7Hahn P.Y. Evans S.E. Kottom T.J. Standing J.E. Pagano R.E. Limper A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2043-2050Google Scholar). P. carinii pneumonia was induced in dexamethasone-treated immunosuppressed Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) (8Limper A.H. Hoyte J.S. Standing J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2110-2117Google Scholar). P. carinii organisms were isolated from lungs of heavily infected animals by homogenization and filtration through 10-μm filters. The organisms were autoclaved (120 °C, 20 min) and disrupted by ultrasonication (200 W for 3 min, six times), and the glucans were isolated by NaOH digestion and lipid extraction as previously detailed (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 7Hahn P.Y. Evans S.E. Kottom T.J. Standing J.E. Pagano R.E. Limper A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2043-2050Google Scholar). The final product contained predominantly carbohydrate (95.7%) and released 82% of its content as d-glucose following hydrolysis (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar). Extensive measures were employed to ensure that the fraction was free of endotoxin. Prior to use in culture, the P. carinii cell wall fractions were washed with 0.1% SDS and then vigorously washed with distilled physiological saline to remove the detergent. The final preparation was assayed for endotoxin with the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay method and found to consistently contain <0.125 units of endotoxin (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Lysate Fractions—To evaluate IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared from macrophages (RAW 264.7; 2 × 106 cells/well) incubated in the presence or absence of particulate P. carinii β-glucans (2.5 × 106 particles/ml) or LPS (0.1 μg/ml) in parallel cultures. At specified times, the cells were scraped and suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.9) freshly supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cytosolic preparations were made by the addition of lysis buffer (buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min, followed by centrifugation (6,500 rpm, 3 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fractions. The remaining pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors as above. Nuclear suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with intermittent agitation and then centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclear debris. The supernatants were collected and diluted with 30 μl of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 m KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) containing the inhibitors described above and designated as the nuclear fractions. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were stored at –70 °C until assay. Protein concentrations in respective extracts were determined by Coomassie protein assay (Pierce) referenced against a bovine serum albumin standard. Determination of Cytosolic IκBα—To first determine the effect of P. carinii cell wall β-glucan stimulation on macrophage levels of IκBα, immunoblot analysis was performed on cytosolic lysates prepared from RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with particulate P. carinii cell wall β-glucan. Cytosolic lysates from P. carinii β-glucan-stimulated cells were compared with lysates prepared from LPS-treated (0.1 μg/ml) macrophages. The lysates were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with polyclonal antibody recognizing the carboxyl terminus of IκBα (200 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detected by a chemiluminescence detection system ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Evaluation of NF-κB Activation—To determine activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, electromobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed on nuclear lysates prepared from RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with either P. carinii β-glucan or LPS. A double-stranded DNA probe that binds NF-κB (5′ AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGC 3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and EMSA performed on 5 μg of nuclear extract as described previously (27Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 837-842Google Scholar). To confirm specificity of DNA binding, in some experiments a 50-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB probe was added to the reaction for 15 min prior to addition of the radiolabeled NF-κB probe. In further studies, supershift analyses were performed using antibodies to each of the specified NF-κB subunits (p50, 200 μg/0.1 ml; p65, 200 μg/0.1 ml; or c-Rel, 200 μg/0.1 ml; Santa Cruz). These antibodies were incubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled DNA probe recognizing NF-κB. All of the EMSA reactions were subsequently incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Fluorescence Visualization of NF-κB Nuclear Translocation—To further define the time course of NF-κB activation following macrophage stimulation with P. carinii β-glucans, immunofluorescence was employed to detect translocation of the p65 component of NF-κB to the nucleus. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto sterile 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates and cultured with P. carinii β-glucans or LPS for the indicated times prior to fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. In parallel experiments, the cells were treated for 30 min with the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC (10 μm) prior to the addition of P. carinii β-glucan. After macrophage stimulation and fixation, the cells were subsequently permeabilized with methanol for 2 min at 22 °C and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse p65 (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz) was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed extensively and incubated for 60 min with a 1:50 dilution of Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-goat polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, New Grove, PA) or 1:1000 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-goat polyclonal antibody (ICN-Cappel, Costa Mesa, CA). Nuclear staining was performed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml, Sigma). Following extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using an IX70 Olympus microscope equipped with filter packs. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red labeling was observed under the fluorescence microscope using optics appropriate for these fluorophores (excitation = 470/40 nm, emission = 540/40 nm for fluorescein isothiocyanate; excitation = 540/25 nm, emission = 620/60 nm for Texas Red). Nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was observed at excitation = 360/40 nm and emission = 460/50 nm. In any given experiment, all of the photomicrographs were exposed and printed identically. Quantitative image analysis was performed using the “Metamorph” image processing program (Universal Imaging Corp.) as previously described (28Pagano R.E. Watanabe R. Wheatley C. Dominguez M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 523-534Google Scholar, 29Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Google Scholar). Role of TLR-4 and MyD88 in Macrophage TNFα Release following P. carinii β-Glucan Stimulation—We have previously shown that isolated P. carinii cell wall β-glucans directly activate alveolar macrophages to release TNFα, a centrally important cytokine promoting lung inflammation during P. carinii pneumonia (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar, 12Hoffman O.A. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3932-3940Google Scholar). To begin to evaluate the potential roles of Toll-like receptors and the MyD88 toll adaptor protein in mediating macrophage activation, alveolar macrophages were collected from TLR-4 –/– mice (30Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Google Scholar), MyD88 –/– mice (31Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Google Scholar, 32Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Google Scholar), and strain-matched wild type controls (C57Bl/6). Macrophages were recovered by BAL as previously described (6Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Google Scholar). Two × 105 alveolar macrophages were plated per well in 96-well tissue culture plates, allowed to adhere for 60 min, and gently washed to remove any unattached cells. Subsequently, varying P. carinii β-glucan concentrations (2.5 to 5 × 106 particles/ml) were incubated with the alveolar macrophages for 12 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). Following incubation, the medium was removed, centrifuged (10,000 × g for 5 min) to remove any particulate material, and assayed for the presence of TNFα by ELISA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). P. carinii β-Glucans Induce Degradation of Cytosolic IκBα in Macrophages—Phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα represent key events in the activation and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (14Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Google Scholar). We therefore sought to evaluate whether P. carinii β-glucans stimulate degradation of IκBα during the course of macrophage activation with P. carinii β-glucans. RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with P. carinii β-glucans and IκBα levels evaluated by immunoblot analysis of cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1). Stimulation of macrophages with P. carinii β-glucans induced degradation of IκBα, which was evident following 2 h of stimulation and appeared to be virtually absent in cytosolic extracts following 4 h of incubation. To contrast these effects of P. carinii β-glucan to another potent stimulus of IκBα degradation, we further compared the kinetics to those resulting from LPS stimulation. In comparison, LPS induced more rapid degradation of IκBα, evident after as little as 15 min of macrophage stimulation. This rapid degradation of cytosolic IκBα following LPS stimulation is consistent with prior published observations (33O'Connell M.A. Bennett B.L. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Google Scholar) and illustrates that although P. carinii β-glucans and LPS both induce IκBα degradation, they exhibit markedly different time courses, strongly suggesting the use of different receptor-ligand interactions. P. carinii β-Glucans Stimulate Nuclear Translocation of p65 NF-κB in Macrophages—Degradation of cytosolic IκBα enables NF-κB subunits to migrate to the nuclear compartment, where they promote gene transcription. We next investigated whether P. carinii β-glucans induce translocation of NF-κB components to nuclear compartments of stimulated macrophages. Because the p65 subunit of NF-κB has been demonstrated to exert critical activity in the transcription of many inflammatory genes (14Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Google Scholar), we performed immunostaining to detect the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 2). Although p65 NF-κB was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of unstimulated RAW macrophages, stimulation with P. carinii β-glucans causes p65 NF-κB translocation to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner. This response was detectable as early as 1 h after stimulation and peaked between 2 and 4 h of stimulation (Fig. 2A). Nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB began to decline after 6 h of continuous stimulation with P. carinii β-glucan. In contrast, parallel experiments conducted with LPS revealed significant p65 NF-κB translocation to the nucleus as rapidly as 15–30 min of stimulation. Subsequent time points showed decreasing levels of p65 NF-κB inside the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2B). This redistribution of p65 NF-κB over time was evaluated by quantifying the nuclear/cytoplasmic ration of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2C). P. carinii cell wall β-glucans transiently induced p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation peaking between 2 and 4 h (nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios of 0.848 ± 0.050 and 0.826 ± 0.026, respectively), whereas LPS-induced p65 NF-κB translocation had an abrupt increase between 15 and 30 min (0.903 ± 0.023 and 0.884 ± 0.020, respectively) and rapidly declined by 1 h (0.640 ± 0.030). Thus, consistent with our earlier observations on IκBα degradation, P. carinii cell wall β-glucan stimulates NF-κB translocation in macrophages in a delayed fashion, but NF-κB activation is sustained for a much longer period of time, compared with that following LPS challenge. Kinetics of NF-κB Activation in RAW 264.7 Macrophages Stimulated with P. carinii β-Glucan—To further understand P. carinii β-glucan activation of macrophages, DNA binding activity of NF-κB was examined in nuclear extracts of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with P. carinii cell wall β-glucan by EMSA. An increases in nuclear NF-κB content occurred in nuclear extracts of macrophages stimulated with P. carinii cell wall β-glucans (Fig. 3A). P. carinii β-glucan-induced NF-κB binding was evident 1 h after stimulation and appeared to decline by 6 h, once again in marked contrast with LPS-induced nuclear NF-κB binding activity. LPS-induced NF-κB binding was evident following 10 min of stimulation, peaked between 15 and 30 min, and was largely reduced at later time points (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, P. carinii β-glucan-induced NF-κB binding was slower in onset and was not detected at these earlier time points (Fig. 3C). To next determine which components of NF-κB were present in the DNA-protein complexes, supershift and competition assays were performed (Fig. 4). Supershift analysis demonstrated an upper band formed by a heterodimer of p65 and p50 subunits and a lower band representing a homodimer of p50. Furthermore, oligonucleotide competition assays demonstrate that the DNA-protein complexes were formed specifically by interactions between the NF-κB probe and cognate nuclear proteins, because DNA binding of the radiolabeled NF-κB probe was fully inhibited by the addition of cold NF-κB probe but not by equimolar concentrations of unlabeled AP-2 probe. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that P. carinii β-glucans induce macrophage degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB. Furthermore, the kinetics of P. carinii β-glucan-induced NF-κB activation are distinctly different from those following LPS stimulation. P. carinii β-Glucan-stimulated Nuclear Translocation of p65 NF-κB Is Inhibited by Pyrrolidine Dithiocarbamate—To begin to investigate whether pharmacological inhibitors could be potentially used to alter macrophage activation during challenge with P. carinii β-glucan, we studied whether PDTC, a specific and potent inhibitor of NF-κB (34Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Sternsdorf T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Bauerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993Google Scholar, 35Vassallo R. Huntoon C. McKean D.J. Limper A.H. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2001; 48: 1605Google Scholar), would suppress activation of this transcription factor under these conditions. RAW 264.7 macrophages were preincubated with PDTC for 30 min, followed by 4 h of stimulation with the P. carinii cell wall β-glucan isolate. Treatment with PDTC dramatically reduced p65 translocation to the nucleus upon stimulation with the P. carinii cell wall isolate (Fig. 5A). RAW cell viability was not impaired by these concentrations of PDTC using the XTT viability assay. To further determine whether PDTC suppression of NF-κB nuclear translocation was also associated with inhibition of inflammatory activation of macrophages, RAW cells were stimulated with"

Cofactors that can directly bind and regulate Stat4 activity have not been described. We report here that PIASx, a member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family, is a negative regulator of Stat4. PIASx becomes associated with Stat4 following IL-12 stimulation in vivo. PIASx inhibits IL-12-stimulated and Stat4-dependent gene activation in human T cells. PIASx does not inhibit the DNA binding activity of Stat4. Instead PIASx is present in the Stat4-DNA binding complex. Finally the inhibitory activity of PIASx on Stat4-mediated gene activation is abolished by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.

(signal transducers and activators of transcription) are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors. Upon cytokine stimulation, STATs become tyrosine phosphorylated and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to DNA to activate transcription (1Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar, 2O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). The STAT signaling pathways can be negatively regulated at multiple steps. In the nucleus, two major mechanisms have been described that modulate the activity of STATs. First, STATs can be inactivated in the nucleus by protein tyrosine phosphatases. It has recently been documented that TC45, the nuclear isoform of T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (4Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), is responsible for the dephosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 in the nucleus (5ten Hoeve J. de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez M. Fu Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Second, the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family of proteins has been suggested to regulate the transcriptional activity of STATs in the nucleus. Four members of the PIAS family have been described including PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASy, and PIASx (6Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PIAS1 and PIAS3 interact with Stat1 and Stat3, respectively, in response to cytokine stimulation. PIAS1 and PIAS3 inhibit Stat1- and Stat3-mediated transcription by blocking their DNA binding activity (7Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). PIASy can also associate with Stat1, but it inhibits Stat1 transcription without affecting the DNA binding activity of Stat1 (9Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The role of PIASx in STAT signaling has not been characterized. IL-12, produced by activated macrophages or dendritic cells, plays an essential role in the development of Th1 cells. Stat4 is activated by IL-12 stimulation (10Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 11Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Consistent with the biochemical studies, gene targeting analysis has demonstrated an essential role of Stat4 in Th1 development (12Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 13Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Sangster M.Y. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 382: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In addition to IL-12, IFN-α/β has also been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 (14Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rogge L. D'Ambrosio D. Biffi M. Penna G. Minetti L.J. Presky D.H. Adorini L. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6567-6574PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, the activation of Stat4 by IFN-α/β has been shown to be critical for IFN-γ production during viral infection (16Nguyen K.B. Watford W.T. Salomon R. Hofmann S.R. Pien G.C. Morinobu A. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Biron C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2063-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Despite a clear role of Stat4 in IL-12 and IFN-α/β signaling, cofactors that can directly interact and modulate Stat4 activity have not been described. We report here that PIASx interacts with Stat4 in vivo following IL-12 stimulation of T cells. PIASx forms a complex with activated Stat4 binding to DNA. The IL-12-stimulated Stat4-dependent transcription can be inhibited by PIASx. The inhibitory activity of PIASx on Stat4 is diminished by an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Our results suggest that PIASx is a transcriptional co-repressor of Stat4. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Cell Lines—GST-PIASx was constructed as described previously (8Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). FLAG-PIASx was constructed by insertion of the human PIASx into the BamHI and SalI sites of pCMV-FLAG vector. Anti-PIASx antibody was raised against a recombinant fusion protein of GST with COOH-terminal residues 476–572 of human PIASxα. Anti-PY20 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Stat4 was a gift from J. Darnell. Kit225/K6 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 at 5% CO2. Human Th1 clone 3F6 cells were maintained as described previously (17Farrar J.D. Smith J.D. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2693-2697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—The cellular localization of PIASxα and PIASxβ was analyzed by immunofluorescence as described previously (9Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—Kit225/K6 T cells (8 × 106) were transfected by electroporation at 270 V, 975 microfarads using a Bio-Rad electroporator. Cells were electroporated with endotoxin-free preparations of 2 μg of pCMV, 5 μg of 4xIRF1 (18Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar), 10 μg of pCMV-Stat4 (10Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and various amounts of FLAG-PIASxα or FLAG-PIAS3 plasmids (7Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with or without IL-12 (60 ng/ml, R&D Systems) for 16 h and analyzed for luciferase activity as described previously (14Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar). The relative luciferase units were corrected for the expression of β-galactosidase. Oligonucleotide Pull-down Assay—The oligonucleotide pull-down assay was essentially performed as described previously (19Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear extracts were incubated with the biotin-tagged STAT-binding oligonucleotide from the IRF1 promoter (IRF1 oligo) for 2 h at 4 °C. The complex bound to the IRF1 oligo was pulled down using streptavidinagarose beads. The beads were then washed four times, and bound proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer and subsequently examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was essentially performed as described previously (9Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as described previously (7Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In brief, whole cell extracts were prepared under mild lysis conditions (1% Brij, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate). The lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-PIASx at a 1:50 dilution. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. PIASx Associates with Stat4 in Vivo following IL-12 or IFN-α Stimulation—Two isoforms of PIASx have been described: PIASxα and PIASxβ (8Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These two isoforms are identical, except for their COOH-terminal regions, and are probably the products of differentially spliced messages from the same gene. To characterize the role of PIASx in STAT signaling, an antiserum (anti-PIASx) raised against amino acids 476–572 of PIASxα was obtained. Western blot analysis of protein extracts prepared from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-PIASxα or FLAG-PIASxβ indicates that this antibody can recognize both isoforms of PIASx (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). In 293T and human NK cells, PIASxα is the predominant isoform (Fig. 1A, lane 1 and 4). To examine the cellular localization of PIASx, human 2fTGH fibroblasts were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-PIASxα and FLAG-PIASxβ followed by immunofluorescence analysis. Both isoforms of PIASx are localized in the nucleus as distinct nuclear bodies (Fig. 1B). Interestingly the pattern of nuclear body formation of these two isoforms appears to be different. While PIASxα exists as small distinct nuclear dots, PIASxβ is expressed as larger but fewer nuclear bodies. To examine whether PIASx interacts with a STAT protein in vivo, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Protein extracts from human NK cells unstimulated or stimulated with IFN-α were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies that can specifically recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 proteins. It has been shown previously that IFN-α can also induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4, and the activation of Stat4 by IFN-α plays an important role in the induction of IFN-γ during viral infection (14Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nguyen K.B. Watford W.T. Salomon R. Hofmann S.R. Pien G.C. Morinobu A. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Biron C.A. Science. 2002; 297: 2063-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4, the same protein extracts were immunoprecipitated by anti-Stat4 antibody followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20. As shown, IFN-α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat4 in NK cells (Fig. 1C, left panels). These protein extracts were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation with anti-PIASx antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Stat4 antibody. Stat4 was found to be present in PIASx immunoprecipitates of IFN-α-stimulated NK cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Neither Stat1 nor Stat3 was present in the immunoprecipitates as shown by reblotting the same filter with anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat3 antibodies (Fig. 1C, right panel). These results suggest that PIASx is associated with Stat4 but not Stat1 or Stat3. Similar to previously described PIAS-STAT interactions (6Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the PIASx-Stat4 association occurs only in cells stimulated with cytokines. Stat4 plays a critical role in IL-12 signaling pathway. To evaluate whether Stat4 associates with PIASx following IL-12 stimulation, human Kit225 T cells, which express functional IL-12 receptors, were used for analysis. Protein extracts of untreated or IL-12-treated Kit225 T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PIASx antibody followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of about 84 kDa was detected in PIASx immunoprecipitates from IL-12-treated cell extracts. IL-12 is known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat4 in Kit225 cells. Reblot of the filter with anti-Stat4 confirmed the presence of Stat4 in PIASx immunoprecipitates from cells treated with IL-12 (Fig. 1D). Similar amounts of PIASx were immunoprecipitated from both unstimulated and IL-12-stimulated cells (Fig. 1D, lower panel). The association of PIASx with Stat4 was also observed in human T cell clones (data not shown). We conclude that PIASx associates with Stat4 following IL-12 stimulation. PIASx Inhibits Stat4-mediated Gene Activation in Response to IL-12—We next examined the effect of PIASx on Stat4-mediated gene activation by luciferase reporter assays. Kit225 T cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing four copies of the STAT binding sequence from the IRF1 gene (4xIRF1) together with Stat4 and increasing amounts of PIASxα. In the absence of PIASxα, IL-12 stimulation induced luciferase activity about 20-fold. Co-transfection of PIASxα at various concentrations efficiently blocked IL-12-stimulated gene activation (Fig. 2A). To examine the specificity of PIASx on IL-12 signaling, similar luciferase assays were performed in the presence of PIASxα or PIAS3 in Kit225 T cells. Consistently PIASx blocked IL-12-induced luciferase activity. In contrast, co-transfection of PIAS3 at various concentrations had no effect on IL-12-induced gene activation (Fig. 2B). To further test the specificity of PIASx in STAT signaling, the effect of PIASx on Stat1-mediated gene activation was examined. 293T cells were transiently transfected with a Stat1 luciferase reporter (3xLy6E) and Stat1 in the presence of various amounts of FLAG-PIAS1, FLAG-PIASy, or FLAG-PIASxα. Consistent with the previous studies, PIAS1 and PIASy, two known inhibitors of Stat1 (8Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 9Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), effectively repressed Stat1-dependent gene activation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, PIASxα had no significant effect on Stat1-mediated gene activation. These results suggest that PIASx is a specific negative regulator of Stat4. PIASx Does Not Inhibit the DNA Binding Activity of Stat4 —To understand the molecular mechanism by which PIASx inhibits Stat4-mediated gene activation, we analyzed the effect of PIASx on the DNA binding activity of Stat4 by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Kit225 cells untreated or treated with IL-12 and analyzed by EMSA using the STAT-binding site from IRF1 gene as the probe. IL-12 treatment induced the formation of a specific shifted band on EMSA (Fig. 3A). This complex is due to the binding of Stat4 as it was blocked in the presence of anti-Stat4 but not anti-Stat1 or anti-Stat3 antibody. To examine the effect of PIASx on the DNA binding activity of Stat4, IL-12-treated Kit225 nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of various amounts of GST, GST-PIASxα, or GST-PIASxβ followed by EMSA. The ability of Stat4 to bind to DNA was not affected in the presence of these fusion proteins. Thus, PIASx does not inhibit the DNA binding activity of Stat4. PIASx Forms a DNA Binding Complex with Stat4 —Certain protein complexes are unstable under EMSA conditions. Therefore, we investigated whether PIASx can still interact with Stat4 in the presence of DNA using oligonucleotide pull-down assays. The untreated and IL-12-treated extracts of human 3F6 Th1 clones were mixed with a biotin-tagged STAT-binding oligonucleotide. Proteins bound to DNA were pulled down with streptavidin-agarose beads followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Stat4 or anti-PIASx antibody. As expected, Stat4 was found to bind to DNA in IL-12-stimulated extracts. Interestingly PIASx was also detected in the IL-12-treated sample. In contrast, neither Stat4 nor PIASx was pulled down in untreated extracts. As a control, no binding was detected in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using Kit225 T cell extracts (data not shown). These results indicate that the formation of the PIASx-Stat4 complex does not interfere with the DNA binding activity of Stat4. The Involvement of HDAC Activity in PIASx-mediated Inhibitory Effect on Stat4 —Our data presented above indicate that PIASx can inhibit the transcriptional activity of Stat4 without affecting the DNA binding activity of Stat4, suggesting that PIASx may function as a co-repressor of Stat4. Modification of chromatin structure by histone acetylases and deacetylases is an important mechanism in modulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. To examine whether HDAC activity is involved in PIASx-mediated transcriptional repression, trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was used in the reporter assays. Kit225 T cells were transfected with 4xIRF1-luciferase reporter and Stat4 expression construct together with or without PIASx. Following transfection, cells were either left untreated or pretreated with TSA (0.3 nm) prior to the addition of IL-12. As expected, co-expression of PIASx resulted in an inhibition of IL-12-stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 4). Interestingly the inhibitory activity of PIASx on Stat4-mediated gene activation was abolished in the presence of 0.3 nm TSA (Fig. 4). These results suggest the possible involvement of HDAC activity in PIASx-mediated inhibition on Stat4 transcription. In this report, we provide evidence that PIASx is a transcriptional co-repressor of Stat4. By in vivo co-immunoprecipitation analysis, PIASx was found to be associated with Stat4 upon IL-12 stimulation. Oligonucleotide pull-down analysis indicated that PIASx is present in the Stat4-DNA binding complex. Consistently PIASx does not interfere with the DNA binding activity of Stat4. Using reporter assays, we showed that PIASx inhibited Stat4-mediated gene activation and that such an inhibitory activity of PIASx can be overcome by suppressing HDAC activity. Both PIASxα and PIASxβ can inhibit Stat4-mediated gene activation. The mode of action of PIASx is similar to that of PIASy in which both proteins repress the transcriptional activity of STAT without affecting its DNA binding activity (9Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). With the completion of this work, each member of the PIAS family has now been found to regulate STAT transcription. In Drosophila, a PIAS homologue named dPIAS/Zimp has been identified. Genetic studies suggest that dPIAS negatively regulates the activity of dStat (20Betz A. Lampen N. Martinek S. Young M.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9563-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to modulating dSTAT activity, dPIAS has also been shown to regulate chromosome stability (21Hari K.L. Cook K.R. Karpen G.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In yeast, two PIAS-related proteins named SIZ1 and SIZ2 have also been described (22Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly SIZ1 and SIZ2 have been shown to possess SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) E3 ligase activity. Subsequently members of the PIAS family have been demonstrated to participate in the SUMO modification of a number of transcription factors including p53, androgen receptor, and Lef-1 (23Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 24Megidish T. Xu J.H. Xu C.W. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These findings raise an interesting possibility that the SUMO ligase activity of a PIAS protein may be involved in its ability to regulate transcription. However, we have been unable to find any evidence to support that PIASx can promote the SUMO modification of Stat4. Instead our data presented in this report suggest the possible involvement of HDAC activity in the transcriptional repression of Stat4 by PIASx. Interestingly it has been suggested recently that PIASxβ is associated with HDAC3 (30Tussie-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Seto E. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12807-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that PIASx is a component of a large transcriptional co-repressor complex, the identity of which remains to be uncovered. PIASx has been suggested to participate in the regulation of several other transcription factors. ARIP3 (androgen receptor interaction protein 3), a rat homologue of PIASxα, has been shown to regulate the activity of androgen receptor (26Nishida T. Yasuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Yan W. Toppari J. Jeanne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37556-37563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Miz1 (Msx-interacting zinc finger), which corresponds to the COOH-terminal portion of PIASxβ (amino acids 134–621), was suggested to modulate the transcriptional activity of a homeobox DNA-binding protein, Msx2 (33Wu L. Wu H. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, like many known transcriptional co-regulators, PIASx may participate in the regulation of various transcriptional responses. We thank X. Rao for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2088322370,"We generated mice lacking Cks2, one of two mammalian homologs of the yeast Cdk1-binding proteins, Suc1 and Cks1, and found them to be viable but sterile in both sexes. Sterility is due to failure of both male and female germ cells to progress past the first meiotic metaphase. The chromosomal events up through the end of prophase I are normal in both CKS2-/- males and females, suggesting that the phenotype is due directly to failure to enter anaphase and not a consequence of a checkpoint-mediated metaphase I arrest."

The Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis causes life-threatening meningitis and septicaemia in humans. Based on the immunological characteristics of the capsular polysaccharides, N. meningitidis strains are divided in 12 serogroups. Strains of serogroups A, B, and C are the predominant cause of meningococcal disease (1Frasch C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: S134-S138Google Scholar). Effective vaccines, which consist of capsular polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid protein to generate sufficient immunological memory, are now available against serogroups A and C (2Anderson E.L. Bowers T. Mink C.M. Kennedy D.J. Belshe R.B. Harakeh H. Pais L. Holder P. Carlone G.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3391-3395Google Scholar, 3Costantino P. Viti S. Podda A. Velmonte M.A. Nencioni L. Rappuoli R. Vaccine. 1992; 10: 691-698Google Scholar). Unfortunately however, the capsular polysaccharide of serogroup B is poorly immunogenic, making this type of vaccine ineffective (4Zollinger W.D. Mandrell R.E. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 257-264Google Scholar, 5Mandrell R.E. Zollinger W.D. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2172-2178Google Scholar). Therefore, attention has shifted toward the possibility of using outer membrane proteins (OMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: OMP, outer membrane protein; OMV, outer membrane vesicle; NspA, neisserial surface protein A; DodMe2NprSO3, 3-dimethyldodecylammoniopropane-sulfonate; O-POE, n-octyl-poly-oxyethylene. 1The abbreviations used are: OMP, outer membrane protein; OMV, outer membrane vesicle; NspA, neisserial surface protein A; DodMe2NprSO3, 3-dimethyldodecylammoniopropane-sulfonate; O-POE, n-octyl-poly-oxyethylene. as targets for vaccine development (6Poolman J. Berthet F.X. Vaccine. 2001; 20: S24-S26Google Scholar). OMPs perform a variety of functions including the following: (a) they may form channels in the outer membrane for uptake of nutrients or the secretion of proteins; (b) they may be enzymes involved in, for example, the modification of lipopolysaccharides or in proteolysis; or (c) they may function as adhesins mediating the interaction of the bacterium to host cells. Despite these different functions, they appear to share a common fold, i.e. they form trans-membrane β-barrels consisting of antiparallel amphipathic β-strands. The number of β-strands in the OMPs, of which the structure has been solved, varies and ranges from 8 to 22 (7Schulz G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 308-317Google Scholar). The best-studied OMPs for vaccine development against N. meningitidis are the porins PorA and PorB and the adhesin OpcA, which elicit bactericidal and protective antibody responses (8Saukkonen K. Abdillahi H. Poolman J.T. Leinonen M. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 3: 261-267Google Scholar). However, due to the antigenic heterogeneity of these proteins (9Rosenqvist E. Hoiby E.A. Wedege E. Caugant D.A. Froholm L.O. McGuinness B.T. Brooks J. Lambden P.R. Heckels J.E. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 197-205Google Scholar) or phase-variable expression of their genes (10Rosenqvist E. Hoiby E.A. Wedege E. Kusecek B. Achtman M. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 1065-1073Google Scholar), they are unable to provide protection against all or most of the serogroup B strains. Recently, the 18-kDa OMP NspA (Neisserial surface protein A) has been identified (11Martin D. Cadieux N. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1173-1183Google Scholar), which is remarkably conserved among N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates (11Martin D. Cadieux N. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1173-1183Google Scholar, 12Plante M. Cadieux N. Rioux C.R. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. Martin D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2855-2861Google Scholar, 13Cadieux N. Plante M. Rioux C.R. Hamel J.

Lucas A.H. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3762-3771Google Scholar). The function of NspA is unknown, but it shows considerable sequence similarity with members of the Opa family of OMPs (11Martin D. Cadieux N. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1173-1183Google Scholar), which are important adhesins involved in the entry of neisseriae into epithelial cells by interacting, for example, with the human carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors (16Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Google Scholar, 17Chen T. Gotschlich E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14851-14856Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that NspA can elicit antibodies that are protective and bactericidal against a wide range of N. meningitidis serogroup B strains, making NspA an attractive vaccine candidate (11Martin D. Cadieux N. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1173-1183Google Scholar, 12Plante M. Cadieux N. Rioux C.R. Hamel J. Brodeur B.R. Martin D. Infect.

Zuno-Mitchell P. Hammond S.N. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6021-6031Google Scholar) showed that sequential immunization using vesicles derived from different meningococcal strains, thus containing different PorA, PorB, and lipopolysaccharide types, resulted in a protective antibody response against NspA, underscoring the importance of NspA as a possible vaccine candidate. To date, the crystal structure of only one OMP of N. meningitidis has been solved, i.e. that of OpcA (19Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Google Scholar), which forms a closed 10-stranded β-barrel. Structural studies can not only provide insight into the function of OMPs, but they can also reveal the conformation of epitopes that are recognized by bactericidal antibodies, thus being helpful for the design of vaccines. Here, we describe the crystal structure of NspA, at 2.55-Å resolution, which shows an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure with a hydrophobic groove at the extracellular side harboring a detergent molecule. Cloning of the nspA Gene and Expression of the Recombinant Protein—Genomic DNA of N. meningitidis strain H44/76 was prepared using the Qiagen genomic preparation kit. The part of the nspA gene encoding the mature domain of the protein, i.e. without the 19-amino acid signal peptide, was PCR-amplified with the primer pair 5′-gctacatatggaaggcgcatccggcttttacg-3′ and 5′-gctaggatcctcagaatttgacgcgcacaccgg-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into pET11a (Novagen), yielding pET11a-NspA. Five-liter cultures of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), containing pET11a-NspA, were grown at 37 °C in L-broth (20Tommassen J. van Tol H. Lugtenberg B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1275-1279Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, 0.1 mm of isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce expression of the recombinant gene. After another 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and washed with 600 ml of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. NspA was present in inclusion bodies, which were isolated according to Dekker et al. (21Dekker N. Merck K. Tommassen J. Verheij H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 214-219Google Scholar) and solubilized in 8 m urea containing 10 mm glycine, pH 8.0. Residual insoluble material and membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g × for 1 h). Refolding and Purification of NspA—Urea-solubilized NspA protein was folded in vitro by 5-fold dilution into 20 mm ethanolamine, pH 11, containing 1% (w/v) 3-dimethyldodecylammoniopropane-sulfonate (DodMe2NprSO3, Fluka) and left overnight at room temperature while stirring. Refolding was evaluated by SDS-PAGE on gels containing 14% acrylamide under “seminative” conditions, i.e. with no SDS in the gel and only 0.03% instead of 3% SDS in the 3-fold sample buffer (additionally containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15.4% (v/v) glycerol, 7.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.008% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and without heating before electrophoresis. For denaturation, the sample was boiled for 5 min with 1% (w/v) SDS. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for visualization of the protein bands. To purify the folded NspA, the mixture was loaded onto a 1-ml mono S column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with 10 mm DodMe2NprSO3, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (buffer A). Prior to loading, the pH of the protein sample was adjusted to pH 8.5 using 1 m HCl. The column was washed with buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A, total volume 50 ml. Fractions containing folded NspA were pooled, diluted 10-fold in buffer A, and again loaded on a mono S column. The column was washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.06% (v/v) n-decylpentaoxyethylene (C10E5; Bachem P-1005)). The protein was eluted with 500 mm NaCl in buffer B and concentrated to 6 mg/ml using Centricon concentrators with molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa (Amicon). The protein was dialyzed three times against 10 ml of 0.06% C10E5 prior to crystallization. Chemical Cross-linking—A 200-μl sample of NspA was incubated at 0.2 mg/ml in 20 mm buffer (either sodium acetate, pH 4.5, or Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing 1% (v/v) n-octyl-poly-oxyethylene (O-POE, Alexis), and 5 μl of a 1% stock solution of glutaraldehyde in 1% (v/v) O-POE was added. The cross-linking reaction was allowed to proceed for4hat room temperature. Subsequently, 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and 20 μl of this solution was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Protein molecular weights were determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments, using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge with absorbance monitoring. Cells contained double-sector charcoal-filled epon centerpieces and had column lengths of ∼8 mm and depths of 3 mm. A protein sample of 50 μl was used. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were run at 18,000 rpm at 20 °C using a loading concentration of ∼1.0 mg/ml corresponding to a measured absorption at 280 nm (A280) of ∼0.3 in the cell. Optima XL-A data analysis software running under the program Microcal Origin version 3.78 (MicroCal Software, Inc.) was used to calculate the molecular weight. Data were fitted to single component and monomer/dimer models. A density of 1 g/cm3 was assumed for the solvent plus detergent, which was 1% (v/v) O-POE and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystallization of NspA and Data Collection—NspA at a concentration of 6 mg/ml in 0.06% (w/v) C10E5 was crystallized at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against a reservoir solution of 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 mN-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid (Fluka), pH 6.6, and 2% (v/v) isopropanol. The crystallization drops contained equal volumes (0.5 μl) of reservoir solution and purified NspA. Crystals were hexagonal and grew to a size of up to 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm3 in a few days. Crystals were soaked in a cryo solution containing the reservoir solution, 0.06% (w/v) C10E5, and 20% (v/v) glycerol and directly cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 100 K on a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector at the ID14 EH1 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Native data were collected to 2.55-Å resolution using a wavelength of 0.933 Å and an oscillation range of 1°. The space group of the crystal was R32 (for the native data set, a = b = 97.37 Å, c = 171.94 Å in the trigonal setting). Due to the position of the crystal in the loop, which caused the long 3-fold axis to be perpendicular to the plane of the loop, we measured over 125° to obtain a complete data set. This resulted in a high redundancy of ∼9. Derivative data were collected at 100 K on the EMBL beamline X11 at DESY (Hamburg). The wavelength was 0.811 Å. Crystals contained one monomer in the asymmetric unit and had a Vm of 4.74 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent plus detergent content of 74% (v/v). All diffraction data were processed using DENZO (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar), SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar), and TRUNCATE (23Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Heavy Atom Derivatives and Phasing—The structure was finally solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method. Initially, molecular replacement was tried because NspA shares sequence similarity with OmpA and, to a lesser extent, with OmpX. The core β-barrel of OmpA (Protein Data Bank code 1qjp) was used for molecular replacement. Most residues were replaced by alanines. The structure could not be refined properly, and therefore, a heavy atom derivative was prepared. A crystal was soaked for 1 h in 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.06% C10E5 and 10 mm of the heavy atom compound. Anomalous signals were calculated using SCALEPACK. The KAu(CN)2 data set showed the highest anomalous signal with a total χ2 of 4.5 (10 in the lowest resolution shell and 1.5 in the highest resolution shell). For convenience and due to the presence of ice rings, the data were processed to only 3.95-Å resolution. Shake and Bake (DREAR/SnB package) (24Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Google Scholar) was used to find the gold atom positions. Two sites were found; one Au(CN)2– was close (∼3 Å) to Phe-27, which is located close to the trimer axis. The distances between three gold peaks was ∼6.8 Å. The second peak was found close to the backbone of Ser-144. Phases were subsequently calculated using MLPHARE (23Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) to 4.0-Å resolution. This yielded an R-cullis of 0.79. With density modification in CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), phases were extended to 2.55-Å resolution using the native data set. Model building was performed using the program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement using REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Google Scholar). Refolding and Quaternary Structure of NspA—NspA was overproduced without its signal sequence in E. coli, which resulted in the formation of NspA protein aggregates (inclusion bodies). After solubilization of these inclusion bodies, NspA was refolded in a buffer containing the detergent DodMe2NprSO3. Folding was monitored by seminative SDS-PAGE. OMPs are generally heat-modifiable, i.e. folded monomers run faster in SDS-PAGE gels than heat-denatured proteins. In contrast, we observed that NspA migrated slower in the gel after refolding. The denatured protein migrated at a mass of ∼18 kDa, whereas the folded protein migrated at 22 kDa, which agrees well with the electrophoretic mobility of native NspA isolated from neisserial membranes (14Moe G.R. Tan S. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5664-5675Google Scholar). To investigate whether the reduced electrophoretic mobility of folded NspA is due to dimerization, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments as well as chemical cross-linking. Both methods (data not shown) as well as the crystal structure (see below) strongly indicated that NspA is a monomer in a detergent-containing solution. Structure Solution—The NspA structure was solved with the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method using KAu(CN)2. The refined model contained one monomer (155 amino acids), five partial C10E5 molecules, one sulfate ion, one ethanolamine, and nine water molecules in the asymmetric unit and had a crystallographic R-factor of 22.2% and an Rfree of 25.8% for data in the 30–2.55-Å resolution range. For the side chains Glu-1, Lys-53, and Lys-79, no electron density was observed, and therefore these were omitted from the Protein Data Bank file. The Ramachandran plot shows 92.4% of the φ/ψ combinations in the most favored regions, 6.1% in the additionally allowed regions, and 0.8% (residue Asn-38 and Thr-138, which are present in T1 and L4, respectively) in the disallowed regions. The overall temperature factor is 40 Å2. Table I summarizes the statistics of the crystallographic data and refinement. The crystal packing consisted of crystallographic trimers, which were packed in alternating directions in such a way that the upper part of the molecule that faced up made contacts with the upper part of a symmetry-related molecule that faced down.Table ISummary of data and refinement statisticsNativeKAu(CN)2Data set statisticsResolution limits (outer shell) (Å)40-2.55 (2.64-2.55)40-3.95 (4.09-3.95)Space groupR32R32Unit cell parameters (Å,o)a = 97.37, b = 97.37, c = 171.94,a = 97.83, b = 97.83, c = 171.87,α = 90, β = 90, γ = 120α = 90, β = 90, γ = 120Mosaicity (o)0.3190.492Oscillation range (o)/total oscillation (o)1/1251/370Total no. of reflections (outer shell)125,566 (8944)98,783 (3304)No. of unique reflections (outer shell)aFor the KAu(CN)2 data set, the Friedel mates have been counted separately.10,350 (1029)5388 (549)Rmerge (%) (outer shell)bRmerge = Σ (I — <I>)/Σ (I).7.0 (37.5)5.0 (12.2)Completeness (%) (outer shell)98.6 (99.7)99.9 (100)I/σ (I) (outer shell)19.0 (5.2)23.5 (16.7)Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)30-2.55Total no. of non-hydrogen atoms1278Rwork (%)22.2Rfree (%)25.8r.m.s.d.cr.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation. bond lengths (Å)0.016r.m.s.d. bond angles (o)1.77a For the KAu(CN)2 data set, the Friedel mates have been counted separately.b Rmerge = Σ (I — <I>)/Σ (I).c r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation. Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—NspA (Fig. 1A) consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with a height of ∼50 Å and a main chain diameter of ∼20 Å. It has a shear number of 10 with β-strands having an angle of ∼40° with respect to the barrel axis. In general, OMPs contain short turns at the periplasmic side of the protein and longer loops at the extracellular side with the N and C termini located at the periplasmic side (see, for example, Refs. 19Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Google Scholar, 30Koronakis V. Andersen C. Hughes C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 403-407Google Scholar, and 31Vandeputte-Rutten L. Kramer R.A. Kroon J. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Gros P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5033-5039Google Scholar). The four long loops of NspA are therefore likely to be located at the extracellular side of the membrane. Like other OMPs, NspA contains two rings of aromatic residues (Fig. 1A) that flank both sides of the membrane and may stabilize the position of the barrel in the membrane (32Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 443-447Google Scholar). The lower ring contains 7 aromatic residues, whereas the upper ring is less well defined. Located on top of the upper aromatic ring is a rim of mainly basic residues that contains 7 lysines and 3 arginines (Fig. 1B), a feature also found in other OMPs (33Zeth K. Diederichs K. Welte W. Engelhardt H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 981-992Google Scholar). Four detergent (C10E5) molecules are present at the sides of the barrel (Fig. 1A). Two of them are present at the interfaces of the crystallographic trimer, which indicates that NspA is probably not a trimer in solution. The inside of the β-barrel harbors an extensive hydrogen-bonding network as well as cavities, but there is no pore through which ions or other molecules could be transported. The periplasmic side of NspA is mainly basic in the center with 5 positively charged residues residing in the middle and some aspartates further away from the β-barrel axis (Fig. 2A). The four extracellular loops of NspA form a long groove at the top of the molecule, which is highly hydrophobic (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we observed additional electron density at the location of this hydrophobic groove, in the 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc omit-electron density maps of NspA, which probably corresponds to part of a C10E5 detergent molecule (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2NspA viewed from the periplasmic side and the extracellular side.A, bottom view (periplasmic side), and B, top view (extracellular side), showing the electrostatic surface potentials. The surface is colored blue for potentials >10 kT/e and red for potentials <–10 kT/e. Loops are indicated with L1 to L4. Some residue positions are indicated by the one-letter code. C, stereo representation of the NspA β-barrel as Cα trace, in light gray, viewed from the top. Residues that are within a distance of 4.5 Å to the detergent molecule in the crystal structure are shown in a ball-and-stick model and are labeled by the one-letter code. Carbon atoms are colored yellow, and oxygen atoms are colored red. A complete C10E5 detergent molecule is shown in dark gray, and the electron density observed in the 2Fo – Fc map is shown in blue around the detergent molecule, in which no distinction is made between oxygen and carbon atoms. Fig. 2, A and B, was prepared using GRASP (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Loop Structures—NspA contains four long extracellular loops, which are well conserved among the different neisserial strains. The loops have relatively low temperature factors, allowing for accurate determination of their conformations. Loops 2 and 4 show some uncommon features when compared with the more standard β-hairpin loops seen in β-sheet structures. In the case of loop 2, this could be the result of crystal contacts with the same loop from five other symmetry-related NspA molecules (Fig. 3A). However, the presence of a conformation-restraining proline in the middle of the extremity of the loop might indicate that loop 2 indeed has an uncommon conformation in the native NspA structure. In loop 4, adjacent residues, Gly-134 and Lys-135 in strand 7 and Lys-140 and Asn-141 in strand 8, are directed outwards from the barrel. Loops 1 and 3 both adopt a 2:4 tight β-hairpin conformation. Loop 3 (Fig. 3A) contains 2 glycine residues, which have a large degree of freedom for backbone angles, at its extremity. The conformation of the loop seems to be stabilized by a hydrogen bond between a side chain oxygen of Asp-94 and the backbone nitrogen of Gly-97. Due to the presence of two well exposed aspartates, Asp-94 and Asp-99, the loop is negatively charged. This is in contrast with the overall positive charge of NspA, which has a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.64. Homology of NspA to Other Outer Membrane Proteins— Three other OMP structures that contain eight β-strands have been solved before, i.e. the crystal structures of OmpA (35Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Google Scholar) and OmpX (36Vogt J. Schulz G.E. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1301-1309Google Scholar) and the solution structure of PagP (37Hwang P.M. Choy W.Y. Lo E.I. Chen L. Forman-Kay J.D. Raetz C.R. Prive G.G. Bishop R.E. Kay L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13560-13565Google Scholar), all from E. coli. We searched for more structural homologs of NspA in the Protein Data Bank using the program DALI (38Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar). This search revealed OmpA and OmpX with the highest z scores of 17.8 and 12.9, respectively, and 144 and 139 Cα atoms of NspA overlay with the Cα atoms of OmpA and OmpX with root-mean-square deviations of 2.5 and 3.4 Å, respectively. The structure of NspA resembles that of OmpA most, probably because the OmpA β-barrel also has a shear number of 10, whereas the shear number of OmpX is 8. The third protein found by the DALI search was a soluble bacterial protein, quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans (39Datta S. Mori Y. Takagi K. Kawaguchi K. Chen Z.W. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Ikeda T. Kano K. Tanizawa K. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Google Scholar), a part of which forms of an eight-stranded β-barrel. Using the DALI program, we also found that 126 Cα atoms of NspA can be superpositioned on OpcA (19Prince S.M. Achtman M. Derrick J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3417-3421Google Scholar), a 10-stranded β-barrel from N. meningitidis, with an root-mean-square deviation of only 3.0 Å and a z score of 9.3. Similarly, another 10-stranded β-barrel, OmpT from E. coli (31Vandeputte-Rutten L. Kramer R.A. Kroon J. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Gros P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5033-5039Google Scholar), superpositions on NspA with 122 residues with an root-mean-square deviation of 3.8 Å and a z score of 9.4. Although these scores reflect the overall similaritie between these 8- and 10-stranded β-barrels, no further remarkable similarities between NspA on the one hand and OpcA or OmpT on the other hand could be detected. NspA shares the highest sequence homology (∼38.7% identity) to the members of the neisserial Opa protein family of adhesins (Fig. 4). No three-dimensional structure has been solved for these important molecules, but Marlorny et al. (40Malorny B. Morelli G. Kusecek B. Kolberg J. Achtman M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1323-1330Google Scholar) predicted the topology of Opa. Residues that are present in the membrane-spanning β-strands of NspA are highly conserved between NspA and Opa, particularly the residues that are located on the inside of the β-barrel. It is therefore likely that the structures of Opa and NspA are highly similar in the membrane-spanning region. A major difference between NspA and Opa is the length of the extracellular loops, which are much longer in Opa proteins. Using the sequence similarity between Opa and NspA, we refined the previously predicted Opa topology model (Fig. 4). In the previous topology model, turn 2 was exceptionally long. In the crystal structure of NspA, this turn is almost as short as the other two turns. Based on the sequence homology between Opa and NspA, it is likely that the fourth strand in the previously predicted topology model has to be shifted toward the extracellular side by 8 residues. NspA has, in addition, high sequence similarity (∼35% identity) with two non-characterized Opa proteins from Haemophilus influenzae and Pasteurella multocida (Fig. 4). The loops from the H. influenzae and P. multocida proteins are more comparable in length with the loops in NspA than with those of the neisserial Opa proteins. Since the hydrophobic groove harboring a detergent molecule is a remarkable feature of the NspA structure, we examined specifically whether the hydrophobic residues contacting the detergent molecule are conserved in the H. influenzae and P. multocida proteins. Although none of them was fully conserved, most of the substitutions involved replacements by other hydrophobic residues, especially in the cases of the residues that are located most centrally. There is an obvious need for a vaccine that offers protection against diverse group B meningococcal strains. As described in the Introduction, this vaccine should consist of non-capsular components, such as the OMPs present in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The major hurdle in development of such a vaccine has been the fact that the meningococcus possesses a huge capacity to change its outer surface by phase and antigenic variation of many of its OMPs. For this reason, the OMV vaccines tested so far were very effective against their homologous strains but offered far less protection against heterologous strains. Therefore, novel vaccine candidates that are conserved among strains and will likely confer broad protection need to be identified. One very promising vaccine candidate is NspA, which is remarkably conserved among neisserial strains. The relatively low amount of NspA generally present in OMVs may prevent a sufficiently high immune response against this protein in vaccines. However, Moe et al. (18Moe G.R. Zuno-Mitchell P. Hammond S.N. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6021-6031Google Scholar) have recently shown that sequential immunization with OMVs that were heterologous for the major immunodominant OMPs, but all contained NspA, resulted in protective immunity that was at least partly mediated by bactericidal anti-NspA antibodies. Thus, given in the correct formulation, NspA could be a very important novel vaccine component. Our present study aids in the further development of NspA-based vaccines. For example, we developed efficient procedures to produce NspA and to refold it in vitro into its native conformation. This refolded NspA can be used in vaccine formulations. As an alternative strategy, the use of peptide vaccines can be considered. In general, bactericidal antibodies are directed to conformational epitopes, which are, in OMPs, typically located in the extracellular loops. In a previous study, we described that bactericidal antibodies could not be elicited in mice with a linear peptide derived from an epitope from PorA. However, based on the crystal structure of a peptide containing a sequence derived from a PorA epitope in complex with a Fab fragment of a bactericidal antibody, a conformationally restrained peptide was designed. With this peptide, a specific bactericidal immune response could be elicited, demonstrating the value of structural information (41Oomen C.J. Hoogerhout P. Bonvin A.M.J.J. Kuipers B. Brugghe H. Timmermans H. Haseley S.R. van Alphen L. Gros P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1083-1089Google Scholar). In NspA, loop 3 is the longest of the four loops and is probably, as in the crystal structure, most exposed in vivo. Hou et al. (43Hou V.C. Raad Z. Moe G.R. Davé A. Granoff D.M. 13th International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference, September 1–6, 2002. Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway2002: 127Google Scholar) have shown that loop 3 is an important target for bactericidal antibodies directed against recombinant NspA. The structure of the extracellular loops, particularly loop 3, may greatly aid in the design of peptide vaccines. The function of NspA is not known yet, although experiments performed by Moe et al. (15Moe G.R. Zuno-Mitchell P. Lee S.S. Lucas A.H. Granoff D.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3762-3771Google Scholar) suggest that NspA is at least not necessary for causing bacteremia in infant rats. Nevertheless, the observation that NspA is highly conserved and is expressed in all neisserial strains tested so far suggests that its function is important. Based on the sequence similarity of NspA to Opa proteins, which are adhesins facilitating colonization of the human naso-pharynx, it could be possible that NspA is an adhesin as well. However, preliminary experiments, in which we measured the adherence of an E. coli strain overexpressing NspA to primary human corneal cells, do not support this idea. Either NspA is not adhesin or its adhesive function is blocked on the surface of E. coli, possibly due to the long lipopolysaccharides. It is interesting that the structure of NspA contains a remarkable hydrophobic groove at the top of the molecule, which harbors a detergent molecule. Among the crystal structures of the closed OMPs, i.e. OmpA, OmpX, PagP, OmpT, OpcA, and OMPLA (42Snijder H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 91-101Google Scholar), only OmpX also contains a central hydrophobic patch at the extracellular side of the molecule, but it does not form such an extended groove as in NspA. Possibly, NspA could bind a lipid-like molecule, such as a membrane lipid, in vivo, thereby possibly playing a role in the invasion of N. meningitidis into host cells by interacting with the lipid bilayer of these cells. Future studies, which can now be guided by the elucidated structure of NspA, will bring more insight into the function of NspA. We are grateful for measurement time at beamline ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, where the native data set has been measured. We also thank Andrea Schmith for helping at X11 at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Outstation at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg."

https://openalex.org/W2026247913,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be caused by toxic aggregates formed from amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. By using Thioflavin T, a dye that specifically binds to beta-sheet structures, we found that highly toxic forms of Abeta-aggregates were formed at the initial stage of fibrillogenesis, which is consistent with recent reports on Abeta oligomers. Formation of such aggregates depends on factors that affect both nucleation and elongation. As reported previously, addition of Abeta42 systematically accelerated the nucleation of Abeta40, most likely because of the extra hydrophobic residues at the C terminus of Abeta42. At Abeta42-increased specific ratio (Abeta40: Abeta42 = 10: 1), on the other hand, not only accelerated nucleation but also induced elongation were observed, suggesting pathogenesis of early-onset AD. Because a larger proportion of Abeta40 than Abeta42 was still required for this phenomenon, we assumed that elongation does not depend only on hydrophobic interactions. Without any change in the C-terminal hydrophobic nature, elongation was effectively induced by mixing wild type Abeta40 with Italian variant Abeta40 (E22K) or Dutch variant (E22Q). We suggest that Abeta peptides in specific compositions that balance hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions promote the formation of toxic beta-aggregates. These results may introduce a new therapeutic approach through the disruption of this balance."
https://openalex.org/W2018837494,"α-Actinin is an abundant actin-bundling and adhesion protein that directly links actin filaments to integrin receptors. Previously, in platelet-derived growth factor-treated fibroblasts, we demonstrated that phosphoinositides bind to α-actinin, regulating its localization (Greenwood, J. A., Theibert, A. B., Prestwich, G. D., and Murphy-Ullrich, J. E. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 150, 627– 642). In this study, phosphoinositide binding and regulation of α-actinin function is further characterized. Phosphoinositide binding specificity, determined using a protein-lipid overlay procedure, suggests that α-actinin interacts with phosphates on the 4th and 5th position of the inositol head group. Binding assays and mutational analyses demonstrate that phosphoinositides bind to the calponin homology domain 2 of α-actinin. Phosphoinositide binding inhibited the bundling activity of α-actinin by blocking the interaction of the actin-binding domain with actin filaments. Consistent with these results, excessive bundling of actin filaments was observed in fibroblasts expressing an α-actinin mutant with decreased phosphoinositide affinity. We conclude that the interaction of α-actinin with phosphoinositides regulates actin stress fibers in the cell by controlling the extent to which microfilaments are bundled. α-Actinin is an abundant actin-bundling and adhesion protein that directly links actin filaments to integrin receptors. Previously, in platelet-derived growth factor-treated fibroblasts, we demonstrated that phosphoinositides bind to α-actinin, regulating its localization (Greenwood, J. A., Theibert, A.

We conclude that the interaction of α-actinin with phosphoinositides regulates actin stress fibers in the cell by controlling the extent to which microfilaments are bundled. The interaction of cells with their extracellular matrix is important for regulation of their growth, differentiation, and migration (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Google Scholar). In cultured cells, the primary adhesive complex between the cell and the extracellular matrix substrate is called a focal adhesion (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Google Scholar). These plaque-like structures are composed of an elaborate network of interconnecting proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via integrin adhesion receptors (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Google Scholar). α-Actinin is an abundant actin-bundling and focal adhesion protein that provides a direct link between actin microfilaments and integrin receptors (3Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Google Scholar, 4Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Google Scholar, 5Pavalko F.M. Otey C.A. Simon K.O. Burridge K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 1065-1069Google Scholar). Although it is clear that α-actinin function is important for modulating cell adhesion and motility (6Gluck U. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 383-387Google Scholar, 7Gluck U. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1773-1782Google Scholar), it is not understood how α-actinin is regulated in the cell.α-Actinin exists as an anti-parallel homodimer (Fig. 1), with each monomer composed of the following three regions: the actin-binding domain, the spectrin repeats, and the C-terminal EF hands domain (3Blanchard A. Ohanian V. Critchley D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 280-289Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of full-length α-actinin has not been solved, cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of the spectrin repeats suggest that the α-actinin dimer aligns as shown in Fig. 1 (8Ylanne J. Scheffzek K. Young P. Saraste M. Structure. 2001; 9: 597-604Google Scholar, 9Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Google Scholar, 10Tang J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 845-858Google Scholar). α-Actinin belongs to a family of proteins, including dystrophin, utrophin, spectrin, ABP-120, and fibrin, in which the actin-binding domain consists of two tandem calponin homology (CH) 1The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; F-actin, filamentous actin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; his-CH2, His-tagged CH2 domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; REFs, rat embryonic fibroblasts; Ins, inositol. 1The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; F-actin, filamentous actin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; his-CH2, His-tagged CH2 domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; REFs, rat embryonic fibroblasts; Ins, inositol. domains (11Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure. 1998; 6: 1419-1431Google Scholar). The CH1 domain from this family of proteins is critical for binding to actin filaments and can bind independently, whereas the CH2 domain enhances binding affinity but cannot bind alone (11Banuelos S. Saraste M. Carugo K.D. Structure. 1998; 6: 1419-1431Google Scholar, 12Keep N.H. Winder S.J. Moores C.A. Walke S. Norwood F.L. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1539-1546Google Scholar, 13Norwood F.L. Sutherland-Smith A.J. Keep N.H. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 2000; 8: 481-491Google Scholar). Based on various experimental approaches, it appears that the actin-binding domains of this family of proteins contain three sites that come in direct contact with actin filaments: sites 1 and 2 are within the CH1 domain, and site 3 is within the CH2 domain (12Keep N.H. Winder S.J. Moores C.A. Walke S. Norwood F.L. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1539-1546Google Scholar, 13Norwood F.L. Sutherland-Smith A.J. Keep N.H. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 2000; 8: 481-491Google Scholar).The importance of α-actinin in integrin-mediated adhesion is illustrated by its localization within adherent cells. Intense immunostaining for α-actinin is observed in focal adhesions, reflecting its role in linking actin filaments to the cytoplasmic domain of integrins (14Lazarides E. Burridge K. Cell. 1975; 6: 289-298Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rajfur et al. (15Rajfur Z. Roy P. Otey C. Romer L. Jacobson K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 286-293Google Scholar) have used chromophore-assisted laser inactivation of GFP-α-actinin in a focal adhesion to demonstrate that loss of the α-actinin link between actin filaments and integrins results in the retraction of the stress fiber. As a key actin filament-bundling protein, α-actinin is also observed in a periodic distribution along stress fibers. Electron microscopy has shown that α-actinin is organized into dense bodies along the stress fiber that alternate with myosin filaments (14Lazarides E. Burridge K. Cell. 1975; 6: 289-298Google Scholar, 16Langanger G. Moeremans M. Daneels G. Sobieszek A. De Brabander M. De Mey J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 200-209Google Scholar). Although it is known that these contractile myosin filaments are necessary for the formation of stress fibers (17Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar), it is not clear what role α-actinin plays or what mechanisms regulate the alternating distribution of these proteins along stress fibers.PtdIns(4,5)-P2 appears to be essential for the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers (18Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar, 19Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Google Scholar), and the type Iγ PtdIns-P kinase has recently been localized in focal adhesions (20Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Google Scholar, 21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Google Scholar). Moreover, PtdIns(4,5)-P2 has been shown to affect the activity of a number of focal adhesion proteins in vitro including talin (22Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Google Scholar), vinculin (18Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Google Scholar, 23Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Google Scholar), syndecan-4 (24Couchman J.R. Vogt S. Lim S.T. Lim Y. Oh E.S. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A. Lee W. Woods A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49296-49303Google Scholar), and α-actinin (25Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar). However, the role PtdIns(4,5)-P2 plays in regulating the function of these proteins in cells remains to be determined. By using anti-PtdIns(4,5)-P2, Fukami et al. (25Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar, 26Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Google Scholar) demonstrated that PtdIns(4,5)-P2 bound α-actinin from chicken striated and smooth muscle as well as Balb/c 3T3 cells. This group mapped the PtdIns(4,5)-P2-binding site in chicken skeletal α-actinin to residues 168 –184 (27Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Google Scholar), adjacent to actin-binding site 3. The binding of PtdIns(4,5)-P2 to α-actinin was found to increase the F-actin gelating activity of α-actinin indicating an increase in cross-linking (25Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar). We have found that PtdIns(4,5)-P2 binds to α-actinin in unstimulated fibroblasts, correlating with the localization of α-actinin to focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (28Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Google Scholar).Activation of PI 3-kinase and production of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides also regulates cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activation of PI 3-kinase induced the restructuring of focal adhesion plaques and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (28Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Google Scholar). The restructuring of focal adhesions was characterized by the loss of α-actinin and vinculin, whereas integrin receptors, talin and paxillin, remained localized to plaque structures. PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 was found to bind to α-actinin in PDGF-treated cells, correlating with redistribution from focal adhesions and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 disrupted the interaction of α-actinin with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β subunit. Based on the data described above, we proposed that PtdIns(4,5)-P2 binding to α-actinin was involved in the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers, whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 binding resulted in the disassembly of these structures. In order to understand the contrasting roles of these two phosphoinositides, we investigated the regulation of α-actinin by PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3in vitro and in cultured cells. To our surprise, the results demonstrate that both PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 inhibit the bundling activity of α-actinin regulating stress fibers in the cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Phosphoinositides were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT) and Matreya (State College, PA).Proteins and DNA Constructs—α-Actinin was purified from chicken gizzard as described previously (30Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Google Scholar). GST-α-actinin fragments were expressed and purified as described previously (31McGregor A. Blanchard A.D. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 225-233Google Scholar). The expression plasmid encoding His-tagged CH2 domain (His-CH2) was constructed by amplifying the DNA encoding amino acids 138 –253 of human α-actinin by PCR using the following primers, forward, 5′-TAA TCT AGA GAC ATC TCC GTG GAA GAG ACT TCA; backward, 5′-GTC AAA CTC GAG CTG GGC TCC AGA GAA GGC GT; pEGFP-α-actinin (15Rajfur Z. Roy P. Otey C. Romer L. Jacobson K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 286-293Google Scholar) was the template for amplification. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the XbaI and XhoI restriction sites of the His-tagged expression vector pPROEX HTb (Invitrogen). Point mutants were produced in pEGFP-α-actinin using QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) as described previously (27Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2646-2650Google Scholar). The α-actinin gene was then subcloned into the HindIII restriction site of pPROEX HTb (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. His-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) following procedures described by the manufacturer.Solid-phase Binding Assay—Phosphoinositide binding to α-actinin was assayed as described previously (33Chen R. Kang V.H. Chen J. Shope J.C. Torabinejad J. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 697-708Google Scholar). Briefly, polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2 nmol of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 or PtdIns(4,5)-P2 in 85% ethanol and the solutions dried overnight. Plates were then blocked with 5% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were incubated with 1 μm α-actinin or GST-α-actinin fragment in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed and incubated with monoclonal anti-α-actinin (Sigma) or anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The wells were then washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, washed, and developed with TMB substrate solution (Pierce). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a BIOTEK Microplate Autoreader.Protein-Lipid Overlay Assay—Nitrocellulose membranes containing immobilized phospholipids were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories. Assays were carried out following manufacturer's protocols incubating the membranes with 1 μg/ml α-actinin for 1 h at room temperature. Binding was detected by standard Western blotting procedures using polyclonal anti-α-actinin (Sigma) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Membranes containing PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 were also used for the overlay assays. In these experiments, PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 were immobilized by spotting 125 pmol of the phosphoinositides in 50% ethanol onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were allowed to dry for1hat room temperature prior to incubation with α-actinin.Fluorescence Emissions Spectrometry—Fluorescence spectra were recorded using an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer with protein concentrations of 2.5 μm in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, at 30 °C. Excitation was carried out at 295 nm with a bandwidth of 8 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded with a bandwidth of 8 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of His-CH2 was first measured alone in a volume of 250 μl. Then 15 μl of phosphoinositide in water was added to achieve a final concentration of 50 μm, and measurement of the fluorescence spectrum was repeated. Phosphoinositides alone did not have any appreciable fluorescence.F-actin Bundling Assay—The bundling of F-actin was determined by sedimentation assays (34Petrucci T.C. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1355-1363Google Scholar). Following a 15-min incubation with PtdIns(4,5)-P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, α-actinin (0 –5 μm) was added to the F-actin (10.4 μm), incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. The supernatant and pellet were separated, and the proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis. Actin was detected by Gelcode Blue (Pierce) staining and quantified by densitometry.F-actin Binding Assay—The binding of GST-α-actinin-(1–269) to F-actin was examined using the co-sedimentation assay described previously (35Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Google Scholar). Following a 15-min incubation with PtdIns(4,5)-P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, GST-α-actinin-(1–269) (1 μm) was added to the F-actin (10.4 μm), incubated for 30 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. The supernatant and pellet were separated, and the proteins were subjected to electrophoresis. GST-α-actinin-(1–269) and actin were detected by Gelcode Blue staining and quantified by densitometry.Cell Culture and Fluorescence Microscopy—Rat embryonic fibroblasts and U-87MG glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were cultured as described previously (28Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pEGFP-α-actinin wild-type and mutants using Tfx20 (Promega) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocols. One day after transfection, cells were prepared for fluorescence microscopy or scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) as described previously (28Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Google Scholar). Digital images were captured using a Zeiss axiovert 100S microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera controlled by MetaMorph software. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein from the supernatant and pellet were separated by electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-actinin (Chemicon), or anti-actin (Sigma).RESULTSSelect Phosphoinositides Bind the CH2 Domain of α-Actinin—In order to characterize the phosphoinositide-binding site on α-actinin, PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 binding was examined using GST fusion proteins containing various fragments of α-actinin (Fig. 1). By using a solid-phase binding assay, we found that only GST-α-actinin (1–269) bound specifically to PtdIns(4,5)-P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 (Fig. 2A). In order to examine the affinity of α-actinin for PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, the solid-phase binding assay was repeated in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble phosphoinositides (Fig. 2B). Both PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 inhibited the binding of GST-α-actinin (1–269) to immobilized PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 in a concentration-dependent manner with an approximate IC50 of 5 μm. The affinity determined for PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 binding to α-actinin is similar to that of the Src homology 2 domain of PI 3-kinase (Kd = 23 μm for PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3) which has a similar phosphoinositide binding sequence (36Ching T.T. Lin H.P. Yang C.C. Oliveira M. Lu P.J. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43932-43938Google Scholar).Fig. 2PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 bind to the actin-binding domain of α-actinin with equal affinity.A, polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2 nmol of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 or PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and incubated with 1 μm α-actinin or GST-α-actinin fragment, and binding was quantified using anti-α-actinin or anti-GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of four separate experiments.

Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Google Scholar), phospholipid binding specificity was examined to further understanding of the chemistry of the interaction between the molecules. A protein-lipid overlay assay was used to probe an array of phospholipids immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane. α-Actinin interacted with the phospholipids in the following order of specificity: PtdIns (5)-P > PtdIns (3, 5)-P2 > PtdIns (4)-P > PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 ≈ PtdIns(4,5)-P2 > phosphatidylserine > PtdIns (3, 4)-P2 (Fig. 3A). Little or no binding was observed for lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphocholine, PtdIns, PtdIns (3)-P, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and phosphatidic acid.Fig. 3Phosphoinositides bind to the CH2 domain of α-actinin.A, nitrocellulose membranes spotted with 100 pmol of the indicated phospholipids were incubated with 1 μg/ml of full-length His-α-actinin wild type (WT) or mutant as labeled.

C, fluorescence spectra of His-CH2 (2.5 μm) in the absence and presence of PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 (50 μm). Phosphoinositides alone did not have any appreciable fluorescence.

The putative PtdIns(4,5)-P2 binding sequence in human α-actinin-1 is highly conserved corresponding to residues 158 –174 (TAPYKNVNIQNFHISWK) within the CH2 domain. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced Lys162 (K162I) and Lys174 (K174I) with isoleucine. We also produced a protein mutated at all three basic amino acid residues within the phosphoinositide-binding site of human α-actinin, replacing Lys162 and Lys174 with isoleucine and His170 with leucine (K162I/H170L/K174I). Mutation of the basic residues within the proposed phosphoinositide-binding site resulted in inhibition of α-actinin binding to all of the phosphoinositides (Fig. 3A). Various concentrations (125 pmol to 1 nmol) of PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with α-actinin. Concentration-dependent binding of α-actinin to immobilized PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 was observed (data not shown). The overlay assays were repeated quantifying the relative binding of wild-type and mutant α-actinin to PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 (Fig. 3B). Binding to PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 was inhibited by mutation of Lys162 ∼40%, Lys174 ∼30%, and Lys162/His170/Lys174 ∼70%. For all the proteins, the mutations were more effective at inhibiting the binding to PtdIns(4,5)-P2 compared with PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3.Because Trp173 lies within the proposed binding motif, we hypothesized that phosphoinositide binding would influence the environment of this residue resulting in a change in fluorescence. Following excitation at 295 nm, His-CH2 exhibited emission spectra typical for tryptophan with a maximum fluorescence at 330 nm (Fig. 3C). His-CH2 fluorescence was quenched ∼20% upon addition of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, whereas PtdIns(4,5)-P2 was only quenched 10%. Increased fluorescence from 360 to 430 nm of the spectra was also observed in the presence of both phosphoinositides. These results confirm that PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 bind to the CH2 domain of α-actinin. The difference in the ability of the phosphoinositides to quench fluorescence suggests that PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 differentially influence the structure of the CH2 domain.Phosphoinositides Inhibit Bundling by Blocking the Binding of α-Actinin to F-actin—To assess the effects of phosphoinositides on α-actinin bundling activity, we used a low speed sedimentation assay (34Petrucci T.C. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1355-1363Google Scholar). A preliminary study in the absence of phosphoinositides showed that the amount of actin bundled increased with the concentration of α-actinin, saturating at 5 μm (data not shown). Approximately 50% of the actin filaments bundled at 1 μm α-actinin, so this concentration was chosen for the assays to maximize sensitivity to both stimulation and inhibition of bundling activity by the phosphoinositides. Using this assay, both PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 inhibited α-actinin bundling activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 being more effective (Fig. 4). In experiments comparing the influence of different phosphoinositides, α-actinin bundling activity was inhibited by 50 μm PtdIns (4)-P 34.7%, PtdIns(4,5)-P2 54.1%, and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 91.9% (n = 2). To test whether inhibition of bundling was due to a direct effect on actin binding, we carried out co-sedimentation assays (35Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Google Scholar) using GST-α-actinin-(1–269). As seen in Fig. 5, both PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 inhibited the binding of the GST fusion protein to actin filaments. The concentration dependence was similar to that seen for the inhibition of bundling, with PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 again being more effective. Finally, we found that the acyl chains are important for inhibition, as diC8 derivatives of PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 did not inhibit the binding of GST-α-actinin-(1–269) to F-actin until concentrations exceeded 50 μm (data not shown). Furthermore, the inositol head groups of the phosphoinositides, Ins(1,4,5)-P2, and Ins(1,3,4,5)-P3, did not have any effect on GST-α-actinin-(1–269) binding to F-actin at concentrations as high as 500 μm (data not shown).Fig. 4PtdIns(4,5)-P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 inhibit α-actinin bundling activity.A, chicken gizzard α-actinin (1 μm) was preincubated with the specified concentration of PtdIns(4,5)-P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3 for 15 min at room temperature. α-Actinin was then added to a solution of actin filaments (10.4 μm), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g.

Expression of the GFP-α-actinins was observed in ∼20% of the cells. As expected (37Edlund M. Lotano M.A. Otey C.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 48: 190-200Google Scholar), wild-type GFP-α-actinin behaved as endogenous α-actinin, localizing to focal adhesions and, with a beaded staining pattern, along actin stress fibers (Fig. 6A). The K162I and K174I mutants were indistinguishable from wild type (data not shown). K162I/H170L/K174I GFP-α-actinin was also observed in focal adhesions, but staining along actin filament bundles was increased altering the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 6, B and B′). Furthermore, abnormal tangles of bundled actin filaments were observed in the cytoplasm of some cells (Fig."

Here, we characterize Bβ2, a novel splice variant of the neuronal Bβ regulatory subunit with a unique N-terminal tail. Bβ2 is expressed predominantly in forebrain areas, and PP2A holoenzymes containing Bβ2 are about 10-fold less abundant than those containing the Bβ1 (previously Bβ) isoform.

Bβ2, but not Bβ1 or an N-terminal truncation mutant, colocalizes with mitochondria in neuronal PC12 cells. Moreover, the Bβ2 N-terminal tail is sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to this organelle. Inducible or transient expression of Bβ2, but neither Bβ1, Bγ, nor a Bβ2 mutant defective in holoenzyme formation, accelerates apoptosis in response to growth factor deprivation.

Reversible phosphorylation is a key post-translational regulatory mechanism in all eukaryotic cells. The phosphorylation state of any given protein is determined by the balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities acting on it. Although it has long been appreciated that kinases assemble into complex signaling networks, our understanding of protein phosphatase regulation is comparatively limited. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 1The abbreviations used are: PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region. is one of four major classes of serine/threonine phosphatases (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Google Scholar). PP2A accounts for up to 1% of total protein in certain cell types, and together with PP1 it contributes greater than 90% of cellular Ser/Thr phosphatase activity (2Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Google Scholar, 3Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar, 4Ruediger R. Van Wart Hood J.E. Mumby M. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4282-4285Google Scholar). PP2A enzymatic activity is conferred by a ∼36-kDa catalytic, or C subunit, which is highly conserved in evolution. Free C subunit is not known to exist in cells; rather it forms complexes with a variety of other proteins. The PP2A core dimer is composed of the C subunit and the scaffolding A (or PR65) subunit, and several other complexes containing one, but not the other subunit have also been described (5Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Google Scholar, 6Lubert E.J. Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38582-38587Google Scholar, 7Bennin D.A. Arachchige Don A.S. Brake T. McKenzie J.L. Rosenbaum H. Ortiz L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Horne M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27449-27467Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A, however, is the trimeric holoenzyme consisting of the core dimer complexed to a third variable regulatory subunit. In mammals, regulatory subunits are encoded by four gene families denoted B (or PR55), B′ (PR61, B56), B″ (PR48, PR59, PR72/130), and B‴ (striatin, SG2NA). Proposed functions of these subunits include regulation of catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization of PP2A. The PP2A B subunit family has four members (Bα–δ). The five B′ subunit genes (B′α–ϵ) encode phosphoproteins with diverse functions including regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling (8Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Google Scholar, 9Yamamoto H. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Fukui A. Usui H. Janssens V. Van Hoof C. Goris J. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26875-26882Google Scholar). The B″ family consists of four polypeptides that arise from three genes (PR72/130, PR48, PR59). B″ subunits are nuclear proteins that bind calcium and have been implicated in the regulation of the G1/S cell cycle transition (10Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Google Scholar, 11Yan Z. Fedorov S.A. Mumby M.C. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1021-1029Google Scholar, 12Janssens V. Jordens J. Stevens I. Van Hoof C. Martens E. De Smedt H. Engelborghs Y. Waelkens E. Goris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10697-10706Google Scholar). Recent RNA interference studies in Drosophila cells have demonstrated that B family subunits regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, whereas B′ family subunits protect cells from apoptosis (13Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Google Scholar, 14Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Google Scholar). Even though they were the first PP2A regulatory subunits to be identified, few functions of the mammalian B family have been uncovered to date. Structurally, B family subunits resemble β subunits of heteromeric G proteins in that they contain seven WD repeat motifs predicted to fold into a β-propeller (15Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Google Scholar). Bα, the most abundant B family member, is expressed in a variety of cell types and mediates dephosphorylation of the cytoskeletal proteins tau and vimentin by PP2A (16Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Google Scholar, 17Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1201-1207Google Scholar, 18Turowski P. Myles T. Hemmings B.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1997-2015Google Scholar). The recently identified Bδ subunit is most similar to Bα and is also expressed in multiple tissues (19Strack S. Chang D. Zaucha J.A. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 462-466Google Scholar). Bβ and Bγ genes, on the other hand, give rise to neuron-specific members of the B family of PP2A subunits with distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns in brain (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar). Forced expression of Bγ, but not other PP2A regulatory subunits, promotes neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, an effect that appears to be mediated by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade at the level or upstream of the Ser/Thr kinase B-Raf (21Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Google Scholar). An important role of Bβ in neuronal survival was suggested by the discovery that the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the promoter region of the human Bβ gene (PPP2R2B) (22Holmes S.E. O'Hearn E.E. McInnis M.G. Gorelick-Feldman D.A. Kleiderlein J.J. Callahan C. Kwak N.G. Ingersoll-Ashworth R.G. Sherr M. Sumner A.J. Sharp A.H. Ananth U. Seltzer W.K. Boss M.A. Vieria-Saecker A.M. Epplen J.T. Riess O. Ross C.A. Margolis R.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 391-392Google Scholar). Thus, dysregulated Bβ gene expression may be detrimental to neurons, ultimately leading to the massive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy seen in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 patients. In this report, we characterize a novel splice product of the Bβ gene which is induced upon neuronal differentiation. The unique N-terminal extension of Bβ2 is shown to target the protein to mitochondria, where Bβ2 accelerates neuronal cell death after survival factor deprivation. Isolation of the Bβ2 cDNA—Duplicate filters containing 1 × 106 plaque-forming units from a rat brain cDNA library in the λZap II vector (Stratagene) were screened with a random primed, [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe corresponding to the full-length mouse Bβ1 cDNA (a gift from Dr. Nat Heintz, Rockefeller University). After four rounds of screening, a partial cDNA containing the 5′-UTR and the N-terminal third of the Bβ2 coding sequence was isolated. The full-length coding sequence for Bβ2 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from total rat brain RNA with primers complementary to the unique 5′-coding sequence and common 3′-UTR (5′-coding sequence/forward primer: 5′-AAA TGC TTC TCT CGT TAC CT-3′; 3′-UTR/reverse primer: 5′-GGT TTG ACT AGT ATT CAG TAT GTG-3′). The Bβ2 cDNA sequence was submitted to GenBank and is available under accession number AY251277. Generation of FLAG- and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged Bβ Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Primers complementary to the N terminus of Bβ1 and Bβ2 and to the beginning of the common region (TEAD) fitted with a HindIII cloning site in conjunction with two nested reverse primers including sequence complementary to the Bβ C-terminal end, the FLAG epitope tag, and a SalI cloning site were used to PCR amplify Bβ1, Bβ2, and BβΔN, respectively. PCR fragments were ligated into pcDNA5/TO or pEGFP-N1 to generate fusion proteins with C-terminal FLAG and FLAG-GFP sequences, respectively. Bβ11–32-GFP and Bβ21–35-GFP were constructed by excising C-terminal sequences from the full-length Bβ1/2-pEGFP-N1 plasmids by EcoRI/XmaI digestion, filling in the overhangs with Klenow polymerase, and religating the plasmids. The Bβ2 RR168EE mutant was constructed by full plasmid synthesis using Pfu Ultra polymerase according to instructions for the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were fully sequenced at the University of Iowa DNA Facility. Antibodies—A peptide derived from the N terminus of Bβ2 (CFSRYLPYIFRPPNT) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the sulfhydryl group of the N-terminal cysteine, and polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits and affinity purified by standard techniques (23Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-138Google Scholar). Bβ1 and pan-B subunit antibodies have been described previously (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to the PP2A A subunit were a kind gift from Gernot Walter (University of California San Diego), and PP2A C subunit antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The adenine nucleotide translocase antibody was provided by Harmut Wohlrab (Boston Biomedical Research Institute). Ribonuclease Protection Analyses—The Bβ2 cDNA library clone was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ and in vitro transcribed using T7 polymerase. Total RNA was isolated from selected rat organs and brain regions using TriZol reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Molecular Research Center). Ribonuclease protection was carried out as described previously (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar, 24Zaucha J. Westphal R. Wadzinski B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 279-291Google Scholar). Competitive RT-PCR—Total RNA (0.5–1.0 μg) was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified in the same 25-μl reaction with reagents from the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and the following primers (0.5 μm each): common reverse, 5′-GAC ATC AAG CCA GCC AAC ATG GAG G-3′; Bβ1 forward, 5′-TGC CCC CCT CTC CTG TGA GAC-3′; Bβ2 forward, 5′-ACC ATC CTC TCT TCC AGC TGC C-3′. Aliquots of PCRs were separated on 1% agarose gels and ethidium bromide-stained bands were quantified by image analysis using NIH Image software. The ratio of the 749-bp Bβ1 and 619-bp Bβ2 PCR products was found to be independent of the number of PCR cycles; 35 cycles were routinely used. Cell Culture—COS-M6 and PC6-3 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (15Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Google Scholar, 21Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Google Scholar). The adult hippocampal progenitor cell line HC2S2 was generously provided by Fred Gage (Salk Institute) and cultured in the presence of 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 on laminin- and polyornithine-coated plates according to published protocols (25Hoshimaru M. Ray J. Sah D.W. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1518-1523Google Scholar, 26Berger F. Gage F.H. Vijayaraghavan S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6871-6881Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Phosphatase Activity Assays—COS-M6 cells were transfected in six-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 (BD Biosciences), and C-terminally FLAG-tagged Bβ subunits were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody-agarose conjugates (Sigma) as described (15Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Google Scholar), except that the immunoprecipitation buffer lacked protein phosphatase inhibitors. Aliquots of immunoprecipitates were solubilized in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analyses. For PP2A activity assays, immunoprecipitates were stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol, 10% ethylene glycol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. 33P-Labeled substrates (see below) were diluted to 0.2–0.5 mg/ml (2,000–10,000 cpm/μl) in 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin. Phosphatase reactions were started by the addition of 5 μl of PP2A immunoprecipitates to 20 μl of diluted substrate, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with intermittent agitation on an Eppendorf shaking incubator, and terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20%. After centrifugation at 22,000 × g, acid-soluble 33P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Less than 20% substrate dephosphorylation occurred under our assay conditions, and activities were inhibited completely by 2.5 nm okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of PP2A at this concentration. Preparation of Phosphatase Substrates—Partially dephosphorylated casein or bovine brain myelin basic protein (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was phosphorylated by protein kinase A catalytic subunit (0.25 units/μl, Sigma) for 2–16 h at 30 °C in buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Phosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g and successive washing of the pellet in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 70% ethanol, and 100% acetone. After the last wash, 33P-labeled substrates were dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and stored aliquoted at –80 °C. Confocal Imaging of GFP Fusion Proteins—PC6-3 cells were seeded on collagen-coated, chambered no. 1 cover glasses (20-mm2 chamber, Nalge Nunc) and transfected with 1 μg of GFP fusion protein plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were imaged live on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope at the Central Microscopy Facility of the University of Iowa. In some experiments, MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) was added to 100 nm to stain mitochondria. Subcellular Fractionation—PC6-3 cells were plated at 2 * 106 cells/dish in 60-mm dishes and transfected 1 day later with 5 μg/dish GFP fusion protein plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000. Three days later, cells were dislodged by scraping in 0.5 ml of mitochondria isolation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After addition of 2 mm MgCl2, cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (20 min, 1,000 p.s.i). Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by two successive centrifugations at 800 × g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was supplemented with 5mm EDTA and further fractionated by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was designated the soluble protein fraction; the pellet was washed once in mitochondria isolation buffer and designated the crude membrane fraction containing mitochondria. Generation of Tetracycline-inducible PC6-3 Cell Lines—Tetracycline-inducible (T-Rex system, BD Biosciences) PC6-3 cell lines stably expressing FLAG epitope-tagged B family PP2A regulatory subunits were generated as described previously (21Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Google Scholar). Between 40 and 60 blasticidine- and hygromycin-resistant clones were expanded and tested for inducible expression by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope tag. In positive clones, maximum protein expression was achieved after 24 h treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Cell Death Assays—Tetracycline-inducible PC6-3 cell lines were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in collagen-coated 96-well plates and grown for 72 h in regular growth medium (10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640) in the presence of vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or 1 μg/ml doxycycline. After two washes, serum-free RPMI 1640 ± doxycycline was added, and cell density was assayed by MTS tetrazolium reduction to formazan according to the manufacturer's instructions (CellTiter 96® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega). Formazan production was quantified after 3 h by absorbance measurement at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. The MTS assay was repeated after 24 h in serum-free medium, and cell survival was expressed as the ratio of the two measurements. Previous apoptosis studies with PC6-3 cells have documented excellent correlation between cell counts and metabolic activity as assayed by tetrazolium salt reduction (27Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Google Scholar). For nuclear morphology assays, native PC6-3 cells or tetracycline-inducible cells were seeded at 200,000 cells/well in 20-mm2 chambered cover glasses. Native PC6-3 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg/chamber GFP fusion protein plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 and cultured for 48 h, whereas inducible cells were treated with vehicle or doxycycline for 72 h prior to serum deprivation. After 24 h under serum-free conditions, cultures were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with the blue fluorescent nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 at 1 μg/ml for 5 min and mounted on slides. Random microscopic fields (6–12 fields/culture, 50–200 cells/field) were captured on an epifluorescence microscope, and images were coded and analyzed blind to the experimental condition. Cells with condensed, irregular, or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. Identification of a Novel PP2A Regulatory Subunit—A rat brain cDNA library was screened with a PP2A/Bβ cDNA probe to identify novel isoforms of this brain-specific PP2A regulatory subunit. A clone was isolated with an insert of 431 bp, of which the first 223 bases are novel, and the last 208 bp are identical to the coding sequence for amino acid residues 23–91 of rat Bβ (28Hatano Y. Shima H. Haneji T. Miura A.B. Sugimura T. Nagao M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 71-75Google Scholar). Conceptual translation of this partial cDNA predicts an isoform of Bβ with a novel 5′-UTR and N-terminal extension of 24 amino acids. The full-length cDNA for Bβ2 was isolated by RT-PCR from rat brain RNA using primers flanking the coding sequence (GenBank accession number AY251277). Data base searches with the unique rat Bβ2 sequence identified several human and mouse ESTs with high degrees of sequence conservation at the nucleotide level and 100% amino acid identity in the coding region. The murine Bβ2 ortholog was recently described and named Bβ.2 (29Schmidt K. Kins S. Schild A. Nitsch R. Hemmings B. Gotz J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2039-2048Google Scholar). EST data base searches also identified a Bβ2 ortholog from rainbow trout (accession number CA376753) which has three conservative substitutions in the N-terminal tail. No Bβ2-related sequences were found in other EST or genome data bases, suggesting that Bβ2 has evolved in the vertebrate subphylum. The chromosomal organization of exons encoding human Bβ1 and Bβ2 was determined by computer-aided alignment of the Bβ cDNAs with human and murine genome data bases and is shown in Fig. 1A. The gene structure of the human and murine Bβ genes is highly conserved as has been noted previously (29Schmidt K. Kins S. Schild A. Nitsch R. Hemmings B. Gotz J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2039-2048Google Scholar). The alternate N termini of Bβ1 and Bβ2 are encoded by exons separated by ∼150 kb. Because the transcription start site for the human Bβ1 mRNA is less than 600 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon (30Mayer R.E. Hendrix P. Cron P. Matthies R. Stone S.R. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3589-3597Google Scholar), the Bβ2 transcript appears to be generated by use of an alternate promoter upstream of exon 1.2 and splicing of exon 1.2 to the first common exon (Fig. 1A). Of note, human EST BC031790 predicts an alternate Bβ mRNA in which exon 1.2 is fused out of frame to exon 1.1 and the rest of the coding sequence. The existence of this apparently incompletely spliced EST supports the notion that Bβ2 is generated by cis splicing of a huge pre-mRNA (∼500 kb) spanning the Bβ locus. Based on prior structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of the related Bγ subunit (15Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Google Scholar), the variant Bβ2 N terminus is predicted to extend from a β-propeller core structure encoded by common exons 2–9 (Fig. 1B). Characterization of Bβ2 Expression—To demonstrate that Bβ2 is expressed at the protein level, we generated polyclonal antibodies by immunizing rabbits with a peptide from the unique N-terminal tail of Bβ2. The resulting antibody reacted specifically with heterologously expressed Bβ2 and displayed no cross-reactivity with Bβ1 or other PP2A regulatory subunits (Fig. 2, and not shown). Although Bβ1 could be detected in total brain lysates (Ref. 20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar and Fig. 2), antibody detection of a protein with the size predicted for Bβ2 (52,000) necessitated enrichment of PP2A holoenzymes by microcystin-Sepharose affinity purification (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar). COS cell lysates expressing FLAG epitope-tagged Bβ splice variants were used as standards and immunoblotted with Bβ isoform-specific and FLAG-directed antibodies to compare detection strengths of Bβ1 and Bβ2 antibodies. Thus normalizing for antibody affinities and titers, the relative abundance of Bβ1- and Bβ2-containing PP2A holoenzymes in rat brain was estimated to be ∼10:1. The low abundance of Bβ2 precluded an analysis of its spatial and temporal expression pattern at the protein level. Therefore, we performed ribonuclease protection assays with probes corresponding to the divergent domains to map the expression of Bβ isoforms in rat brain regions. Bβ1 and Bβ2 transcripts were detected at comparable levels in all forebrain structures, except in olfactory bulb, where relatively more Bβ1 was expressed (Fig. 3 and Ref. 20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar). The cerebellum contained low levels of both Bβ splice forms. We reported previously that B family regulatory subunits exhibit distinct developmental expression profiles in brain (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar). The neuronal Bγ isoform is induced during postnatal brain development, whereas Bα and Bβ1 show constant expression and a slight postnatal decline in expression, respectively. Ribonuclease protection assays with a Bβ2-specific probe revealed that this isoform has an expression pattern similar to Bγ, with near undetectable expression at birth rising to adult levels by postnatal day 14 (Fig. 4A). Thus, alternative promoter use and splicing of the Bβ gene appear to be regulated developmentally. We developed a competitive RT-PCR protocol to assay changes in relative abundance of Bβ1 and Bβ2 transcripts rapidly. In this assay, reverse transcription of mRNA is carried out using a reverse primer that anneals to the common region of Bβ1 and Bβ2 followed by PCR amplification with the common primer and two competing forward primers complementary to Bβ1- and Bβ2-specific sequences (Fig. 4B). This technique was tested by analyzing changes in Bβ gene expression during rat brain maturation (Fig. 4C). Although this assay clearly showed postnatal up-regulation of the Bβ2 transcript, the 70% drop in Bβ1 message levels detected by ribonuclease protection could not be demonstrated by RT-PCR for reasons that are unclear at present. Because Bβ1 protein levels show an ∼2-fold decline during postnatal development (20Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Google Scholar), the ribonuclease protection data are likely a better indicator of the absolute abundance of the Bβ1 mRNA. Our data indicate that Bβ2 mRNA is found specifically in mature brain, but do not rule out a non-neuronal (e.g. glial) origin of expression. To address this issue, multiple cell lines of neuronal (PC6-3, PC12, B104, SHSY5Y, Neuro2A), glial (C6, Ng108), and other (COS, HEK293, NIH3T3, MCF7) origin were analyzed for Bβ isoform expression by competitive RT-PCR. Although all neuronal cell lines tested expressed Bβ1, none had detectable levels of Bβ2 (data not shown). To examine alternative splicing of the Bβ locus in a cell line that more closely resembles primary forebrain neurons, we turned to HC2S2 cells, a neuronal progenitor cell line derived from rat hippocampus (25Hoshimaru M. Ray J. Sah D.W. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1518-1523Google Scholar). HC2S2 cells are conditionally immortalized by a tetracycline-repressible v-myc oncogene and differentiate into phenotypic neurons upon addition of tetracycline or doxycycline to the medium (Fig. 4D). Competitive RT-PCR with Bβ1 and Bβ2 primers was performed on HC2S2 cultures treated for up to 4 days with doxycycline. Bβ2 mRNA was already detectable in dividing HC2S2 cells, and levels increased further relative to Bβ1 as cells differentiated into neurons (Fig. 4E). These data strongly indicate a neuronal locus of Bβ2 expression. The time course of Bβ isoform expression in differentiating HC2S2 cells closely parallels that seen in postnatal maturation of the brain (compare Fig. 4, C and E). With the caveats inherent to a comparison between neuronal differentiation in vitro and brain development in the intact organism, these data suggest that the HC2S2 cell line may be an appropriate model system for Bβ gene regulation studies. The Bβ2 N Terminus Does Not Affect Holoenzyme Formation or Catalytic Activity—Previous structure-function studies indicated that the variable N terminus of Bγ is dispensable for binding to the A and C subunits (15Strack S. Ruediger R. Walter G. Dagda R.K. Barwacz C.A. Cribbs J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20750-20755Google Scholar). A role of the Bγ N terminus in directing the PP2A holoenzyme to specific substrates in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was suggested by analyses of chimeras between this neuronal specific regulatory protein and the widely expressed Bα subunit (21Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41525-41532Google Scholar). To investigate whether the differentially spliced N termini of Bβ1 and Bβ2 play a role in formation or catalytic activity of the PP2A holoenzyme, the two isoforms were FLAG epitope tagged at the C terminus and transiently expressed in COS-M6 cells. A deletion mutant lacking the divergent N terminus, BβΔN, was also constructed and analyzed in parallel. The ectopically expressed proteins were immuno-isolated with anti-FLAG resin and analyzed for association with endogenous A and C subunits by immunoblotting. Bβ1, Bβ2, and BβΔN could be expressed to similar levels and associated with equivalent amounts of A and C subunits (Fig. 5A). Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were then assayed for dephosphorylation of two model substrates, myelin basic protein and casein phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A (Fig. 5B). Myelin basic protein was a better substrate than the more acidic casei"

This study reports the cloning of a novel protein called CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) which interacts with Gadd45α, MyD118/Gadd45β, and CR6/OIG37/Gadd45γ. CRIF1 binds specifically to the Gadd45 family proteins, as determined by an in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and an in vivo mammalian cell two-hybrid assay along with coimmunoprecipitation assays. CRIF1 mRNA is highly expressed in the thyroid gland, heart, lymph nodes, trachea, and adrenal tissues. CRIF1 localizes exclusively to the nucleus and colocalizes with Gadd45γ. Recombinant CRIF1 inhibits the histone H1 kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Cdc2-cyclin B1 and Cdk2-cyclin E, and the inhibitory effects were additive with Gadd45 proteins. Overexpression of CRIF1 increases the percentage of cells in G1, decreases the percentage of cells in S phase, and suppresses growth in NIH3T3 cells. The down-regulation of endogenous CRIF1 by the transfection of the small interfering RNA duplexes resulted in the inactivation of Rb by phosphorylation and decreased the G1 phase cell populations. Expression of CRIF1 is barely detectable in adrenal adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer and much lower than in adjacent normal tissue.

These findings led to the hypothesis that Gadd45 members play a critical role in negative growth control and apoptosis, but the detailed molecular mechanisms by which Gadd45 carries out this role remain to be elucidated. This study used a yeast-two hybrid screen to identify novel proteins that bind to CR6/Gadd45γ. CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) 1The abbreviations used are: CRIF1, CR6-interacting factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. is a nuclear protein identified in this screen. CRIF1 interacts with Gadd45α, Gadd45β, and Gadd45γ, and it is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. CRIF1 is exclusively localized to the nucleus and colocalizes with Gadd45γ. Gadd45 proteins and CRIF1 inhibit Cdc2-cyclin B1 kinase in an additive manner, and CRIF1 inhibits histone H1 kinase activity associated with immunoprecipitated Cdk2-cyclin E in the absence of Gadd45 proteins. Overexpression of CRIF1 inhibits cell cycle progression at G1/S and suppresses growth in serum-stimulated NIH3T3 cells. In addition, adrenal adenoma and thyroid papillary cancer cells express CRIF1 at a very low level, which is lower than in adjacent normal tissue. These findings suggest that CRIF1 is a nuclear protein that modulates cell cycle progression and growth. Altered expression of CRIF1 may also contribute to tumorigenesis in some cell types.

Glutathione-Sepharose was washed extensively with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) followed by autoradiography. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Plasmids pCB-Gadd45γ (for GAL4 DBD-fusion) and pCA-CRIF1 (for NF-κB AD fusion) or pCB-CRIF1 and pCA-Gadd45γ (100 ng each) were co-transfected with 100 ng of pFR-Luc reporter (Stratagene) into NIH-3T3 cells and grown in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 400 ng/well with vector DNA (pCMV-BD or pCMV-AD). 100 ng of pCMV-β-gal DNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was used as internal control. Cells were lysed 24 h after infection, and luciferase activity was measured by Berthold LB9507 luminometer (Berthold). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Northern Blot Analysis—The human multiple tissue mRNA blots (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane were hybridized using QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) under stringent conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. CRIF1 cDNA or DECAprobe glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase template (Ambion) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP with Strip-EZ™ DNA labeling kit (Ambion). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The following immunoprecipitation procedures were carried out at 4 °C using COS-7 cells coexpressing tagged Gadd45 α, β, and γ with/without pFLAG-CRIF1 transfection. Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and incubated for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with rocking for 2 h with 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and centrifuged for 15 min at 8,000 × g. The supernatant was removed and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h with rocking. Protein A/G beads were added, incubated for 12 h, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min 10 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet p-40, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), and 10 μg of each aprotinin and leupeptin per milliliter. Total protein lysates were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween and incubated for 2 h with appropriate antibodies. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-linked antirabbit secondary antibody and developed with a chemiluminescent detection system (Phototope-HRP Western blot detection kit; New England Biolabs). Kinase Assay—Exponentially growing RKO cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). One mg of cellular protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc2 or Cdk2 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated Cdc2-cyclin B1 and Cdk2-cyclin E complexes were incubated with recombinant Gadd45α and Gadd45γ or CRIF1 proteins for 5 min. Histone H1 kinase assays were performed using 10 μg of histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 15 mm MgCl2, 7 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 25 μl. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were transferred to numbered P81 paper and washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone. The activity in assay squares was measured by scintillation counting (Hewlett-Packard). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Samples were prepared for flow cytometry essentially as described previously (24Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Samples were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide 60 μg/ml (Sigma) containing RNase 100 μg/ml (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell analyzer and Cell Quest version 1.2 software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mansfield, MA). At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample. Cell cycle distribution was quantified using the ModFit LT version 1.01 software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Experiments—The 21-nucleotide siRNA were synthesized and purified using a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion Ltd.). The siRNA sequence targeting the human CRIF1 (GenBank™ accession number AF479749) corresponded to the coding region, as showed in Fig. 6A. The desalted DNA of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides targeting four different regions on the human CRIF1 (Fig. 6A) were synthesized, and the eight nucleotides at the 3′-end of both oligonucleotides had the following sequence: 5′-CCTGTCTC-3′, which is complementary to the T7 promoter. In order to produce an efficient transcription template, the sense and antisense oligonucleotides for each siRNA need to be converted to double-stranded DNA with a T7 promoter in 37 °C. The sense and antisense siRNA transcripts were transcribed for 2 h in separate reactions with T7 RNA polymerase. The reactions were then mixed, and the combined reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C for double-stranded RNA. A single-strand specific ribonuclease and DNase digestion were used to eliminate the 5′-overhanging leader sequence and the DNA template, respectively. The resulting siRNA was recovered from the mixture of nucleotides, enzymes, short oligomers, and salts in the reaction by column purification. The cells were transiently transfected with the CRIF1-siRNA duplex and the expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the plasmids were mixed with the Plus reagent and then incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus DNA complex was added to the cells and further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The control cells received the LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected using a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were given fresh medium and maintained for an additional 24 h. The transfection efficiency was evaluated with pCMV-SPORT-β-gal (500 ng) and pEGFP-CRIF1 (500 ng) in a six-well culture plate. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-Gadd45γ and pMyc-CRIF1 and grown on uncoated glass coverslips (Bellco Glass, Inc.). Cells were washed three times in PBS+ (PBS with 1 mm calcium and 1 mm magnesium). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed briefly in PBS+, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS+ and incubated in blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS+. For permeabilization, blocking and all subsequent incubation steps included 0.1% Triton X-100. Anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene) and anti-c-Myc antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) were incubated with the cells overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed five times with PBS+ and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were washed five times in PBS+, and fluorescence was visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics and a digital camera; images were captured as Adobe Photoshop files. Anti-CRIF1 antiserum was obtained from New Zealand White rabbits immunized with conjugated synthetic peptide AEEQKRREREQHIAEC corresponding to the midregion of CRIF1. The sera were titered against the GST-CRIF1 fusion protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the serum exhibiting the highest titer (1:25,600) was used in subsequent experiments. Thyroid gland and adrenal gland tissues were obtained from surgery patients. Tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate histologic type. Samples used in this study were confirmed histologically as benign or malignant. CRIF1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in two adrenal gland and seven thyroid cancer tissues. Samples were micro-waved for 10 min, and slides were incubated with anti-CRIF1 anti-serum (1:800) at room temperature for 1 h. Preimmune sera did not stain tissues at a 1:800 dilution. Slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a linking solution containing biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako LSAB kit; Dako Laboratories) at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were sequentially incubated with streptavidin peroxidase at room temperature for 30 min and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen substrate solution (Dako Laboratories), counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin and mounted. Three independent readers evaluated the slides. Two independent readers graded the slides in a blinded fashion. The slides were graded with respect to staining intensity using the following scale: 0 (no staining), +1 (weak), +2 (moderate), and +3 (high). Other Assays—Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with recrystallized bovine serum albumin as a standard. Statistical Significance—All experiments were repeated at least three times with different batches of cells. Values shown are the mean ± S.E. of three or more experiments. Significance between experimental values was determined by two-way analysis of variance. Isolation, Expression, and Subcellular Localization of CRIF1—A yeast two-hybrid screen (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was carried out to identify human proteins that interact with Gadd45γ. The screen used a Matchmaker two-hybrid cDNA library from K-562 cells (pACT2; Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and a construct expressing a fusion between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and Gadd45γ. A partial cDNA was identified as a positive in this screen and called CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1). Full-length human CRIF1 cDNA was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library (Stratagene) by hybridization (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 18.6-18.38Google Scholar). The CRIF1 cDNA had little 5′-untranslated sequence and a 669-bp open reading frame encoding a predicted polypeptide of 222 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa (Fig. 1A). A polyadenylation signal (AATAA) is located 27 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. A BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar) search revealed that this cDNA encodes a novel protein with no homology to any proteins in the data base. The CRIF1 gene is located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.2. The CRIF1 gene has one exon of 351 bp and a second exon of 315 bp. Homology searches using BLAST identified the human and mouse genomic clones as BC004944 (similar to RIKEN cDNA 2310040G17) and NM026320 (mouse RIKEN cDNA 2310040G17), respectively. The amino acid sequence deduced from the CRIF1 cDNA isolated by two-hybrid screen is identical to BC004944 and has 90% homology with the mouse CRIF1 homologue NM026320 (Fig. 1B). CRIF1 cDNA was in vitro translated, and the protein product had an apparent size of 28 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). CRIF1 was also expressed transiently in COS-7 cells transfected with human CRIF1 cDNA cloned into pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene), and an immunoreactive band was detected of the expected size (Fig. 2B). CRIF1 mRNA was examined by Northern blot using mRNA from cultured cells and human tissues (Clontech Laboratories). A CRIF1 mRNA of ∼0.7 kb was detected in human cultured cells (data not shown). CRIF1 was highly expressed in heart, thyroid, lymph node, trachea, and adrenal tissue and was expressed at a low level in liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, testis, ovary, and stomach (Fig. 2C). CRIF1 mRNA expression was similar to Gadd45γ (data not shown). Gadd45γ is induced by DNA-damaging agents including methylmethane sulfonate and UV (5Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, CRIF1 mRNA was not induced by ionizing radiation, methylmethane sulfonate, or UV in SW620 or MCF7 cells (data not shown). Native CRIF1 was detected in human cells by Western blot analysis using anti-CRIF1 antiserum (Fig. 2D). The anti-CRIF1 antiserum specifically detects 28-kDa CRIF1 in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines NPA, FRO, and ARO and primary cultured smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells from umbilical vein (Fig. 2D). Immunoreactive CRIF1 protein was not detected in either the rat or mouse cells, such as the rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells and mouse NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2D). Gadd45 proteins are localized predominantly in the nucleus (5Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 10Smith M.L. Chen I.T.

Fornace Jr., A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2579-2594PubMed Google Scholar). CRIF1 has a putative nuclear localization signal (28Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) in its C-terminal region (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it might colocalize with Gadd45. The subcellular location of CRIF1 and Gadd45γ was studied using COS-7 cells transfected with pMyc-CRIF1 and pFLAG-CR6. Myc and FLAG epitope tags were visualized by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2E). The results show that FLAG-CR6 protein and Myc-CRIF1 colocalize in the nucleus (Fig. 2E). Interaction between CRIF1 and Gadd45 Proteins in Vitro and in Vivo—The interactions between CRIF1 and Gadd45 proteins were examined in vitro using recombinant GST-Gadd45α, Gadd45β, and"
https://openalex.org/W2076917025,"The robust induction of metallothionein-I and II (MT-I and MT-II) genes by several heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium requires the specific transcription factor metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF1). Chromium (VI), a major environmental carcinogen, not only failed to activate these genes but also inhibited their induction by Zn2+ or Cd2+. The heavy metal-induced expression of another MTF1 target gene, zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1), was also down-regulated by Cr6+. By contrast, the expression of two MTF1-independent Cd2+-inducible genes, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and HSP-70, was not sensitive to Cr6+. Cr6+ did not also affect the expression of housekeeping genes such as GAPDH or β-actin. Stable cell lines overexpressing variable levels of MTF1, the key transactivator of the MT genes, demonstrated differential resistance toward the inhibitory effect of Cr6+, indicating MTF1 as a target of chromium toxicity. The basal and inducible binding of MTF1 to metal response elements was not affected by treatment of cells with Cr6+. Transient transfection studies showed that the ability of MTF1 to transactivate the MT-I promoter was significantly compromised by Cr6+. The fusion protein consisting of a Gal-4 DNA binding domain and one or more of the three transactivation domains of MTF1, namely the acidic domain, proline-rich domain, and serine-threonine rich domain, activated the GAL-4-driven luciferase gene to different degrees, but all were sensitive to Cr6+. MTF1 null cells were prone to apoptosis after exposure to Zn2+ or Cd2+ that was augmented in presence Cr6+, whereas the onset of apoptosis was significantly delayed in cells overexpressing MTF1."

The interface (∼1200-Å2 buried surface) is formed by the interaction of a concave depression on IIAGlc with a convex protrusion on IIBGlc. The phosphoryl donor and acceptor residues, His-90 of IIAGlc and Cys-35 of IIBGlc (residues of IIBGlc are denoted in italics) are in close proximity and buried at the center of the interface. Cys-35 is primed for nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by stabilization of the thiolate anion (pKa ∼6.5) through intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with several adjacent backbone amide groups. Hydrophobic intermolecular contacts are supplemented by peripheral electrostatic interactions involving an alternating distribution of positively and negatively charged residues on the interaction surfaces of both proteins. Salt bridges between the Asp-38/Asp-94 pair of IIAGlc and the Arg-38/Arg-40 pair of IIBGlc neutralize the accumulation of negative charge in the vicinity of both the Sγ atom of Cys-35 and the phosphoryl group in the complex. A pentacoordinate phosphoryl transition state is readily accommodated without any change in backbone conformation, and the structure of the complex accounts for the preferred directionality of phosphoryl transfer between IIAGlc and IIBGlc.

In bacteria, carbohydrate transport across the membrane, mediated by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; EI, enzyme I; EIN, N-terminal domain of enzyme I; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein; IIAGlc, glucose-specific enzyme IIA; IICBGlc, the glucose-specific transporter; IIBGlc, cytoplasmic B domain of IICBGlc; IIBSuc, the cytoplasmic B domain of the sucrose-specific transporter; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s., root mean square; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; EI, enzyme I; EIN, N-terminal domain of enzyme I; HPr, histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein; IIAGlc, glucose-specific enzyme IIA; IICBGlc, the glucose-specific transporter; IIBGlc, cytoplasmic B domain of IICBGlc; IIBSuc, the cytoplasmic B domain of the sucrose-specific transporter; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; r.m.s., root mean square; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase. involves the tight coupling of translocation and phosphorylation. The PTS is a classical example of a signal transduction pathway involving phosphoryl transfer (1Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Google Scholar), whereby a phosphoryl group originating on phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to the translocated carbohydrate via a series of three bimolecular protein-protein complexes. The first two steps of the PTS are common to all sugars: enzyme I (EI) is autophosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate and subsequently donates the phosphoryl group to the histidine phosphocarrier protein HPr. The proteins downstream from HPr are sugar-specific, comprising four distinct families of IIA permeases (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C.

In the case of the glucose branch of the PTS, the phosphoryl group is transferred from HPr to IIAGlc and thence from IIAGlc to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (IIBGlc) of the glucose transporter IICBGlc. In addition to their function within the PTS cascade, the PTS proteins also serve to regulate other pathways (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar). Thus, dephosphorylated enzyme I inhibits bacterial chemotaxis (5Lux R. Jahreis K. Bettenbrock K. Parkinson J.S. Lengeler J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11583-11587Google Scholar); dephosphorylated HPr functions as a positive regulatory subunit of glycogen phosphorylase (6Seok Y.-J. Sondej M. Badawi P. Lewis M.S. Briggs M.C. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26511-26522Google Scholar); dephosphorylated IIAGlc is a negative regulator of glycerol kinase (7Novotny M.J. Frederickson W.L. Waygood E.B. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 810-816Google Scholar), as well as a variety of non-PTS permeases (2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C.

Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Google Scholar); finally, the dephosphorylated form of IICBGlc sequesters the global repressor Mlc, thereby initiating PTS gene transcription in response to the uptake of glucose from the extracellular environment (9Tanaka Y.

This multiplicity of interactions in which individual proteins specifically recognize a wide variety of structurally diverse targets serves as a paradigm for understanding protein-protein interactions and the factors determining their specificity. The glucose-specific transporter, IICBGlc, comprises an N-terminal transmembrane domain thought to consist of eight membrane-spanning helices (residues 17–323) connected to a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (IIBGlc, residues 401–476) via a long flexible linker (13Buhr A.

Recently, we have solved the solution NMR structures of the initial protein-protein complex of the Escherichia coli PTS between the N-terminal domain of enzyme I (EIN) and HPr (16Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Google Scholar) and the subsequent complexes of HPr with both IIAGlc (17Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J.

In this paper, we present the structure of the final cytoplasmic protein-protein complex of the glucose arm of the E. coli PTS, that between IIAGlc and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (IIBGlc) of the IICBGlc transporter. Expression and Purification of Proteins—The following constructs of E. coli IIAGlc and IIBGlc were employed in the present study: IIAGlc (residues 1–168 (19Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Google Scholar) and 11–168 with an additional N-terminal glycine) and IIBGlc (residues 1–90 and 12–90 with an additional N-terminal glycine and a P17A mutation). IIBGlc-(1–90) is identical to the construct described by Buhr et al. (14Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Google Scholar), with the exception of the absence of a C-terminal His tag, and comprises residues 1–4 and 391–476 of full-length IICBGlc. The numbering scheme for IIBGlc is that employed in previous structural studies (15Eberstadt M. Grdadolnik S.G. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. Buhr A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11286-11292Google Scholar, 20Gemmecker G. Eberstadt M. Buhr A. Lanz R. Grdadolnik S.G. Kessler H. Erni B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7408-7417Google Scholar), with the active site cysteine at position 35 corresponding to residue 421 of full-length IICBGlc. IIAGlc-(1–168) and IIBGlc-(1–90) were expressed, purified and uniformly labeled with 15N (>95%) and/or 13C (>95%) as described previously (19Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A.

IIAGlc-(11–168) and IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) were subcloned into the PET32a expression vector as fusions with thioredoxin and a 6-His tag. The protein-coding sequences were amplified with PCR primers that included an N-terminal thrombin cleavage site designed to add only a single N-terminal glycine to the native sequence after thrombin digestion. The original thrombin cleavage site encoded by the PET32a vector was removed by site-directed mutagenesis (Arg → Gln). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli strain BL21-DE3 (Novagen) was transformed with the appropriate expression vector, grown in Luria Bertani or minimal media (with 15NH4Cl and/or 13C6-glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively), and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 ∼1 (22Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Google Scholar). The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation after 2–4 h of induction. The cell paste was resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl (100 ml/liter of cell culture), and the bacteria were lysed by several passages through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA). The lysate from a 2-liter culture was clarified by centrifugation and passed over a nickel-Sepharose column (∼10 ml; Amersham Biosciences), and the fusion protein was subsequently eluted with a 100-ml gradient of imidazole (0.25 mm to 0.5 m). Both fusion proteins were then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 200 mm NaCl and subsequently digested with thrombin (10 NIH units/mg of protein) for at least 18 h at room temperature. Thrombin was removed by passage over a benzamidine-Sepharose column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) followed by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cleaved 6-His-thioredoxin was removed by passing the digested proteins back over a nickel-Sepharose column. IIAGlc-(11–168) was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using MonoQ resin (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Pooled protein was then passed over a Sephadex-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). Similarly, IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) was passed over a Sephadex-75 gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The pH of the pooled protein fractions was lowered rapidly (pH <3) with trifluoroacetic acid, and the protein was incubated at room temperature for several hours to allow for spontaneous dephosphorylation of the active site cysteine. IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) was further purified by reverse phase chromatography using a C8 column and eluted with a 25–75% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The protein was then dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. All purified proteins were >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and 1H-15N correlation spectra. The composition of all purified proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry. NMR studies were carried out on free IIBGlc-(1–90) and IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) and on 1:1 complexes of IIAGlc-(1–168)·IIBGlc-(1–90) and IIAGlc-(11–168)·IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A). NMR samples contained ∼1 mm protein or protein-protein complex in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 20 mm deuterated dithiothreitol. The following complexes were employed (only the presence of 15N and 13C isotopes is indicated; if no C or N isotope is mentioned, then the sample contained 12C or 14N at natural isotopic abundance): IIAGlc(15N)·IIBGlc, IIAGlc·IIBGlc(15N), IIAGlc(15N/13C)·IIBGlc, and IIAGlc·IIBGlc(15N/13C). It should be noted that residues 1–18 of IIAGlc and 1–14 of IIBGlc are disordered in solution in both the free proteins and the complex. The chemical shifts of residues 19–168 of IIAGlc are identical for the shorter and longer constructs. Although all initial experiments were carried out with IIBGlc-(1–90), we noticed that a number of cross-peaks in the 1H-15N correlation spectra of both free and complexed IIBGlc were doubled and that the relative intensity of the two components was temperature-dependent. Examination of the calculated structure of IIBGlc (see below) suggested that this was, in all likelihood, due to a cis-trans isomerization of Pro-17, located at the N terminus of helix 1, coupled with the interaction of Pro-17 with the aromatic ring of Tyr-87, located in helix 3. This was confirmed by examination of the Pro-17 → Ala mutation, which completely removed all cross-peak heterogeneity. The only significant backbone 1HN/15N chemical shift differences (∼0.1 ppm for 1HN or ∼1 ppm for 15N) between IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) and IIBGlc-(1–90) involve residues 16 and 18–20 in the immediate vicinity of the P17A mutation; the cross-peaks for residues 15 and 21–90 in IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) correspond to the major (trans-Pro-17) form of IIBGlc-(1–90). Thus, the P17A mutation results in no structural change other than the removal of a cis-trans isomerization at the N terminus of helix I. The binding characteristics of IIBGlc-(1–90) and IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) to IIAGlc are also identical, as judged by the same chemical shift perturbation and the same pattern of intermolecular NOEs. The quality of the spectra, both free and complexed, obtained with IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A), however, are significantly superior, permitting us to observe many more intermolecular NOEs in the IIAGlc-(11–168)·IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) complex than in the IIAGlc-(1–168)·IIBGlc-(1–90) complex. Thus, the intermolecular NOEs observed in the IIAGlc-(11–168)·IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) complex comprise all of those observed in the IIAGlc-(1–168)·IIBGlc-(1–90) complex plus additional intermolecular NOEs. NMR Spectroscopy—All spectra were recorded at 35 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DRX600, DMX750, and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with either x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes or a z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobe. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe package (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and analyzed using the programs PIPP, CAPP, and STAPP (24Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Google Scholar). 1H, 15N, and 13C sequential assignments were obtained using three-dimensional double and triple resonance through-bond correlation (25Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1991; 252: 1390-1399Google Scholar, 26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Google Scholar, 27Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Google Scholar). 3J N-Cγ,C′-Cγ, and Cα-Cδ couplings were measured using quantitative J correlation spectroscopy (28Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-106Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from multidimensional NOE spectra with mixing times ranging from 75–120 ms. Three-dimensional experiments used for sequential assignments included HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, C(CCO)NH, H(CCO)NH, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments. NOE experiments included three-dimensional 15N-separated NOE, 13C-separated NOE, 13C-separated/13C-separated NOE, and 13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE spectra, and four-dimensional 13C/13C-separated NOE spectra. Long range 1H-15N correlation spectra to correlate the Nδ1 and Nϵ2 15N shifts with the Hδ2 and Hϵ1 1H shifts of the imidazole ring (29Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 543-558Google Scholar) were used to confirm the tautomeric states of the histidine residues in the complex. Residual Dipolar Couplings—Residual dipolar couplings were measured by taking the difference in the corresponding J splittings in oriented and isotropic media. 1DNH dipolar couplings were obtained using either a two-dimensional in-phase/anti-phase 15N-1H HSQC experiment (30Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Google Scholar) or a two-dimensional sensitivity-enhanced E.COSY-type 15N-1H HSQC experiment, which simultaneously provides 1DNC′ and 1DHNC′ couplings (31Ding K. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 158: 173-177Google Scholar). 1DNH, 1DNC′, and 1DHNC′ couplings were measured for free IIBGlc-(12–90/P17A) in a liquid crystalline medium of filamentous phage (32Clore G.M. Starich M.R. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10571-10572Google Scholar, 33Hansen M.R. Rance M. Pardi A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11210-11211Google Scholar), and the magnitude of the alignment tensor was determined from the distribution of normalized dipolar couplings (34Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-222Google Scholar). At low salt, IIBGlc interacts with phage pf1, resulting in significant line broadening. This interaction was abolished by increasing the ionic strength to 0.5 m NaCl, permitting a high quality set of backbone dipolar couplings to be obtained. Unfortunately, we were unable to find a suitable alignment medium that did not interact with one or the other protein in the IIAGlc·IIBGlc complex. Thus, dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine/dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bicelles (35Tjandra N. Bax A. Science. 1997; 278: 1111-1114Google Scholar) interacted with IIAGlc; and phage pf1 (33Hansen M.R. Rance M. Pardi A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11210-11211Google Scholar), polyethylene glycol/hexanol (36Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Google Scholar), and polyacrylamide gel (37Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Google Scholar) interacted with IIBGlc. This is manifested by selective line broadening of only one of the two components, even in the presence of a significant excess (up to 4-fold) of the unlabeled over 15N/13C-labeled component whose dipolar couplings were being measured. Thus, the dipolar couplings measured on the line-broadened component within the complex contain a small contribution from the free state interacting with the alignment medium. As a consequence, the magnitude of the alignment tensors, for all alignment media employed, were found to be sufficiently noncoincident for the two proteins within the complex to preclude their utility in accurately determining relative protein-protein orientation. Further, under high salt conditions, where IIBGlc and pf1 do not interact, complex formation is abolished. Nevertheless, the 1DNH dipolar couplings measured for the IIAGlc·IIBGlc complex can be used as a cross-validation tool to demonstrate the absence of any significant backbone conformational changes upon complex formation. This involves singular value decomposition best fitting of observed and calculated dipolar couplings using an appropriate reference structure, namely the 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure coordinates of free IIAGlc (38Feese M.D. Comolli L. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16087-16096Google Scholar) and the NMR coordinates of IIBGlc determined using dipolar couplings measured in pf1 for free IIBGlc, and interproton distance and torsion angle restraints derived from combined measurements on both free and complexed IIBGlc (see below). The values of the dipolar coupling R-factors, Rdip (39Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9008-9012Google Scholar), obtained in this manner for complexed IIAGlc, are 15.7, 16.1, and 20.1% in polyethylene glycol/hexanol, polyacrylamide gel, and pf1 media, respectively. (The slightly higher value in pf1 is due to the slightly lower quality of the pf1 data). Likewise, the Rdip values obtained for complexed IIBGlc are 17.6 and 18.5% in polyacrylamide gel and pf1, respectively. In addition, the maximum combined 1HN/15N shift perturbation upon complexation, ΔH/N (in Hz) given by [(Δδ1HN)2 + (Δδ15N)2]½, is only 170 Hz for IIAGlc and ∼130 Hz for IIBGlc at 600 MHz, with only 5 residues of IIAGlc having a ΔH/N between 100 and 170 Hz and 4 between 60 and 100 Hz and 2 residues of IIBGlc having a ΔH/N between 100 and 140 Hz and 9 between 60 and 100 Hz. From the combined dipolar coupling and chemical shift data, one can safely conclude that any possible structural differences in the backbone between free and complexed IIBGlc are too small to be determined by NMR. Structure Calculations—NOE-derived interproton distance restraints were classified into four ranges: 1.8–2.8, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å (40Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5891-5898Google Scholar). An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bound for NOEs involving methyl groups, and distances involving nonstereospecifically assigned protons were represented by a (Σr–6)–1/6 sum. χ1 and χ2 torsion angle restraints were derived from analysis of heteronuclear 3J couplings and NOE/ROE experiments (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using the Xplor-NIH NMR molecular structure determination package (41Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Google Scholar). An ensemble of 60 simulated annealing structures for IIBGlc was first calculated using torsion angle dynamics (42Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Google Scholar) based on NMR data recorded on both free and complexed IIBGlc: specifically, 1DNH, 1DNC′, and 1DHNC′ dipolar couplings measured on free IIBGlc; NOE-derived interproton distance restraints obtained from spectra recorded on both free and complexed IIBGlc (note that the pattern of intramolecular NOEs is identical for free and complexed IIBGlc, so that higher quality NOE spectra from the free protein were used to confirm those observed in the complexed protein); backbone φ,ψ torsion angle restraints derived from backbone (N, C′, Cα, Cβ, Hα) chemical shifts using a data base search procedure with the program TALOS (43Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Google Scholar) (identical for free and complexed IIBGlc, since the chemical shift perturbation upon complexation is minimal); and side chain torsion angle restraints (no difference found between free and complexed IIBGlc with the possible exception of Arg-40, which appears to be rotamer-averaged in the free state but has a g– χ1 rotamer in the complex). The target function comprises square well potential terms for the NOE-derived interproton distance restraints and torsion angle restraints (44Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Google Scholar); harmonic potentials for the 13Cα/β chemical shift restraints (45Kuszewski J. Qin J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1997; 105: 92-96Google Scholar), dipolar coupling restraints, (46Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Google Scholar) and covalent geometry; and a quartic van der Waals repulsion potential (44Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Google Scholar), a torsion angle data base potential of mean force (47Clore G.M. Kuszewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2866-2867Google Scholar), and a radius of gyration term (48Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2337-2338Google Scholar) to represent the nonbonded contacts. The radius of gyration term is a weak overall packing potential, and the target value is given by 2.2N0.38, where N is the number of ordered residues (48Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2337-2338Google Scholar). The structure of the IIAGlc·IIBGlc complex was then determined by conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics (18Cornilescu G. Lee B.R. Cornilescu C.C. Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42289-42298Google Scholar, 42Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Google Scholar) on the basis of intermolecular NOE data and NMR data (NOEs, torsion angle restraints, and dipolar couplings) relating to the backbone region of IIBGlc encompassing the IIAGlc binding site and to the interfacial side chains of IIAGlc and IIBGlc. The initial coordinates of IIAGlc comprise the x-ray structure (with protons added) of E. coli IIAGlc (RCSB accession code 2F3G, molecule 2, 2.13-Å resolution) (38Feese M.D. Comolli L. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16087-16096Google Scholar). The initial coordinates for IIBGlc comprise the complete ensemble of 60 simulated annealing structures calculated as described above for IIBGlc in the absence of any intermolecular restraints (i.e. each structure calculation for the complex makes use of a different initial structure for IIBGlc). The coordinates for the backbone and noninterfacial side chains of IIAGlc are held fixed; the overall IIBGlc molecule is allowed rotational and translational degrees of freedom, with the coordinates of the noninterfacial backbone and side chain atoms of IIBGlc treated as a rigid body; the backbone region of IIBGlc encompassing the binding site for IIAGlc (residues 34–40, 59–63, and 72–80) and all interfacial side chains of IIAGlc and IIBGlc are given their full torsional degrees of freedom. This procedure, rather than one in which IIBGlc is given complete torsional degrees of freedom, is employed to enhance convergence and to ensure that structural distortions of IIBGlc are not introduced as a result of any potential underestimation in the upper bounds of some NOE-derived intermolecular distance restraints. Structures were visualized and analyzed with the program VMD XPLOR (49Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 139: 239-244Google Scholar). Figures were generated using VMD-XPLOR (49Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 139: 239-244Google Scholar), RIBBONS (50Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Google Scholar), and GRASP (51Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar). The ensemble distributions of side chains were depicted by isosurfaces of the reweighted atomic density maps (52Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 221-225Google Scholar) drawn at a value of 20% of the maximum with a uniform radius of 1 Å. Optimized Cα alignments and superpositions for different proteins were carried out with the program O (53Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Sequence searches and alignments were carried out with the program BLAST (54Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Structure Determination—The IIAGlc·IIBGlc complex is in fast exchange on the chemical shift time scale, and the lower limit for the dissociation rate constant (as judged by the maximum observed 1HN chemical shift difference between the free and bound states) is ∼800 s–1.

We show here that c-Met accumulates progressively in perinuclear compartments, which in part include the Golgi. The c-Met content in the Golgi is principally the newly synthesized precursor form and, to a lesser extent, the internalized, recycling c-Met. By following the trafficking of c-Met inside the cell using a semi-automatic procedure and using inhibition or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and microtubule depolymerizing agents, we show that PKC positively controls the trans-cytosolic movement of c-Met along microtubules. In parallel to its traffic, internalized c-Met is progressively degraded by a proteasome-sensitive mechanism; the lysosomal pathway does not play a substantial role. Inhibition or promotion of c-Met traffic to the perinuclear compartment does not alter the kinetics of proteasome-dependent c-Met degradation. Thus susceptibility to proteasomal degradation is not a consequence of post-endocytic traffic. The data define a PKC-controlled traffic pathway for c-Met that operates independently of its degradative pathway.

The tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met is the high affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). 1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BIM-I, bisindolylmaleimide I; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ANOVA, analysis of variance. Signaling via this receptor-ligand pair can induce diverse biological events. In vitro, these include scattering, invasion, proliferation, branching morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. In vivo, it is responsible for many processes during embryonic development and a variety of activities in the adult; many of these normal activities have been implicated in its role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (reviewed in Refs. 1Trusolino L.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Met has been observed in a large number of human tumors, correlating closely with metastatic tendency and poor prognosis (3Di Renzo M.F. Olivero M. Katsaros D. Crepaldi T.

Furthermore, germ line missense mutations of c-Met, which lead to increased tyrosine kinase activity, have been reported in childhood hepatocellular carcinoma (7Park W.S. Dong S.M. Kim S.Y. Na E.Y.

A molecular understanding of how this receptor is switched on and off will provide the basis for developing rational interventions in such situations. C-Met, encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene is a disulfide-linked α/β heterodimer, derived by proteolytic processing of the precursor p170met (8Gonzatti-Haces M. Seth A. Park M. Copeland T. Oroszlan S. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The β-chain, p145met, spans the plasma membrane and includes a cytoplasmic domain endowed with tyrosine kinase activity. The mechanisms by which c-Met triggers its regulatory functions involve the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways trough a unique multisubstrate docking site within the C-terminal end of the receptor (reviewed in Ref. 9Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It is well established that many transmembrane receptors become internalized upon ligand stimulation. Although EGFR endocytosis and traffic have been extensively studied and represents probably the best understood receptor trafficking system (10Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), interest in c-Met and its traffic are just emerging. Several receptors such as EGFR or platelet-derived growth factor receptor are ubiquitinated and then degraded by the lysosomal pathway (reviewed in Refs. 11Clague M.J. Biochem.

So far, it has been reported that c-Met is polyubiquitinated (13Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) via the c-Cbl proto-oncogene (14Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) indicate that the primary effect of proteasome inhibition on c-Met could occur indirectly through an effect on acute HGF-induced c-Met endocytic traffic. Similar results have been described for growth hormone receptor (17van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In view of the critical role played by c-Met in cancer, it is important to know how its endocytosis and trafficking are regulated. The endocytosis of several membrane receptors is activated by PKC. For example this is the case for the γ-aminobutyric type A receptor, the parathyroid hormone receptor 1, and the sst2A somatostatin receptor (18Chapell R. Bueno O.F. Alvarez-Hernandez X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5591-5599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prior evidence indicates that PKC plays a negative role in controlling c-Met function (21Sipeki S. Bander E. Farkas G. Gujdar A. Ways D.K. Farago A. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), however it is not known how this relates to the internalization or traffic of c-Met. In this study we show that, upon HGF stimulation, the rapidly internalized c-Met traffics and accumulates in a perinuclear compartment, which in part includes the Golgi, corresponding presumably to a recycling compartment. By following the trafficking of c-Met inside the cell using a semiautomatic assessment of vesicle distribution, we demonstrate that this trans-cytosolic movement of c-Met requires an intact microtubule network and is promoted by PKC. After2hofHGF stimulation, half of the internalized c-Met has been degraded by a proteasomal pathway. C-Met is likely a direct target of the proteasome, because we do not detect any effect of inhibition of proteasome activity on internalization of c-Met; furthermore, the lysosomal pathway does not play a substantial role. Inhibition or promotion of c-Met traffic to the perinuclear compartment does not alter the kinetics of proteasome-dependent c-Met degradation. Thus susceptibility to proteasomal degradation follows receptor internalization but is not a consequence of post-endocytic traffic. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cancer Research UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were seeded in 35-mm plates (for Western blot experiments) or on coverslips in 24-well plates (for immunocytochemistry) and stimulated 24 h later with 100 ng/ml HGF for various time periods. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with appropriate inhibitors 10 or 15 min before HGF stimulation, and the inhibitors were maintained during the stimulations. The preincubation times were routinely longer for proteasome inhibitors: 2 h for lactacystin and 1 h for MG132; shorter preincubations are as indicated in the text or figure legends. Transfections were performed on cells seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates. For each well, 0.8 μg of DNA was mixed with 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of OPTIMEM1 with Glutamax (Invitrogen), incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow the precipitate to form and directly added to the cells in their culture medium. Five hours later the culture medium was changed. Stimulations were performed 24 h post-transfection. Growth Factors, Antibodies, Inhibitors, and Constructs—Purified human recombinant HGF was obtained from R&D Systems. The following antibodies were used: affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human c-Met intracellular domain (12-amino acid CT, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); goat polyclonal anti-early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology for Western blots and Sigma for immunofluorescence); mouse monoclonal anti-c-Met extracellular domain (Upstate Biotechnology Inc); mouse monoclonal antibodies against p115 and GM130 (BD Biosciences); goat polyclonal anti-human EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); goat anti-human HGF (Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti HGF (R&D System). The secondary antibodies used for Western blot were peroxidase-labeled monkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako). The secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), cy3- or cy5-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG and cy5-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). MG132, lactacystin, concanamycin, bafilomycin A1, paclitaxel (or taxol), vinblastine sulfate were obtained from Calbiochem. Nocodazole, colchicine, cycloheximide, propidium iodide, TPA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), and RNase A were purchased from Sigma. Bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM-I) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. LysoTracker was obtained from Molecular Probes. The pCMV-Myc r-AP180 C terminus (residues 530–915) (myc-AP180-C) construct was a generous gift from Dr. Harvey T. McMahon (Cambridge, UK). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Analysis—Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Free aldehydes were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS-2% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. For microtubule staining, the fixation and permeabilization were as follows: cells were incubated for 30 s in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm Pipes, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. They were then immediately incubated in methanol at –20 °C for 2 min. Fixed cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the primary antibodies at the following concentrations: anti-c-Met (1 μg/ml), anti-EEA1 (2 μg/ml), anti α-tubulin (1/200), anti-p-115 (1/200), and anti-GM130 (1/200). Cells were rinsed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. When indicated, nuclei were stained as follows: cells were incubated in RNase A (1 μg/ml) for 15 min and then in propidium iodide (0.2 μg/ml) for 10 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS and once in water and then mounted in Mowiol containing 2.5% DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo-[2,2,2]octane). Images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss Inc.) equipped with a 63×/1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective. Alexa 488 was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser, Cy3 was excited with a 543-nm HeNe laser and Cy5 was excited with a 633-nm HeNe laser. Each image represents a single section. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and boiled for 10 min. Samples were loaded on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Protein loading was checked by staining with Ponceau Red. Membranes were then blotted with the intracellular domain c-Met antibody and anti-α-tubulin. Blots were then incubated with appropriate peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were revealed using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Semiautomatic Assessment of Vesicles in the Cytosol—Fluorescence images of cell nuclei and vesicles were acquired on an Axiovert TM 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 63× numerical aperture 1.3 objective lens and an Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using Acquisition Manager (Kinetic Imaging). Multiple dichroic with excitation and emission filter wheels ensured that there was no lateral shift between the two fluorescent channels. Cell nuclei were automatically detected by thresholding, and their boundaries were interpolated by elliptical curves (see Fig. 1B). c-Met-positive vesicles were detected by Sobel image enhancement followed by thresholding. Cell boundaries were interactively determined. Two distances were calculated for each vesicle located outside the nucleus: the distance from the cell boundary (a) and the distance to the nuclear boundary (b) along a line passing through the center of the nucleus elliptical boundary. The relative distance of a vesicle from the cell boundary was evaluated as a/(a + b). Relative distances can have values between 0 (vesicle at the cell boundary) and 1 (vesicle at the nucleus). The relative distances were weighted according to the total intensity of fluorescence in the vesicles for calculations of mean values, standard deviations, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a hierarchical unbalanced model. The following levels and total numbers of data were used in the hierarchical structure: relative distances (78,637), cells (976), observation fields (357), cell cultures (67), experiments (40Santos O.F. Moura L.A. Rosen E.M. Nigam S.K. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and treatments (12Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). c-Met Is Rapidly Internalized upon HGF Stimulation and Traffics to a Perinuclear Compartment—In the absence of ligand, c-Met is predominantly distributed around the plasma membrane with some asymmetrically distributed, punctate, perinuclear staining (Fig. 1A, top left image). HGF treatment of HeLa cells leads to the rapid endocytosis of c-Met with the receptor transiently accumulating on vesicular structures, followed by a delayed transcytosolic traffic to and accumulation within a perinuclear compartment. We developed a semiautomatic procedure, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to follow the migration of fluorescent c-Met vesicles, from the plasma membrane to this perinuclear location (Fig. 1B). This indicated that following internalization the bulk of the immunoreactive protein accumulated within the perinuclear compartment between 30 and 120 min. The initial endocytic event is typical of a clathrin-mediated process, being inhibited by co-transfected myc-AP180-C (Fig. 1C) and by pretreatment with dansylcadaverine (Fig. 1D). Contrary to previous studies (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) no inhibition of endocytosis was observed on treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin (Fig. 1E; see further below). At 15 min, the internalized c-Met is found to overlap with EEA1 indicative of an early endocytic compartment; this co-localization has decreased by 120 min (Fig. 1F). HGF co-localizes with c-Met in vesicles and is still present after 120 min of treatment (Fig. 1G). This co-localization has been detected with two distinct HGF-specific antibodies, a polyclonal and a monoclonal antibody. PKC Controls the Movement of c-Met from Early Endosome to a Perinuclear Compartment—It has been shown that PKC can negatively influence c-Met signaling (21Sipeki S. Bander E. Farkas G. Gujdar A. Ways D.K. Farago A. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Gandino L. Longati P. Medico E. Prat M. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether this action is effected through the control of HGF-induced traffic of c-Met, an inhibitor of PKC, BIM-I (bisindolylmaleimide I) was employed. BIM-I did not have a substantial effect upon HGF-induced internalization of c-Met. However, it consistently reduced the rate of accumulation of c-Met in the perinuclear compartment (Fig. 2A). c-Met is consequently retained in an early endosomal compartment at 120 min of stimulation (Fig. 2B, compare with Fig. 1F). Using the semi-automatic assessment of fluorescent vesicle distribution, we quantified this effect at 15 and 120 min of stimulation as shown in Table I. For example, at 15 min, BIM-I reduces the relative distance of c-Met from the cell boundary to nuclear boundary by 14% (p < 0.001). The BIM-I effect is specific to c-Met, because transferrin distribution is not modified after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2C).Table IVesicle movementTreatmentTimeRelative distance, mean ± S.D.Number of cellsp value (ANOVA)minHGF150.65 ± 0.0429HGF1200.76 ± 0.1031+a+ indicates a significant difference compared to HGF, 5 min.Bim150.56 ± 0.0751***Bim1200.68 ± 0.0424NSVinb.150.58 ± 0.0613NSVinb.1200.57 ± 0.0474***Taxol150.51 ± 0.0571***Taxol1200.59 ± 0.0658**a + indicates a significant difference compared to HGF, 5 min. Open table in a new tab To confirm the effect of PKC on this trans-cytosolic traffic of c-Met the effect of the direct PKC activator TPA was assessed. In combination with HGF, TPA was found to promote the perinuclear accumulation of internalized c-Met (Fig. 2D). This effect was also blocked by BIM-I. The Trans-cytosolic Movement of c-Met Vesicles Is Microtubule-dependent—The effects of PKC inhibition/activation indicate that trans-cytosolic traffic of c-Met is an active, regulated process. The basis of this active traffic was investigated in relation to the requirement for cytoskeletal integrity. Microtubules have been shown to be required for traffic of endocytosed receptors (see Refs. 24Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Alayof B.E. Himmel H.M. Kim P.Y. Crews A.L. Strauss H.C. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7812-7816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 25Novikoff P.M. Cammer M. Tao L. Oda H. Stockert R.J. Wolkoff A.W. Satir P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 21-32PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the microtubule network with vinblastine or its stabilization with taxol had no substantial effect upon HGF-induced internalization. However, both agents inhibited the movement of c-Met to the perinuclear compartment (Fig. 3A). These effects are quantified in Table I. For example, at 120 min, vinblastine and taxol reduce the relative distance of c-Met from cell boundary to nuclear boundary by 25% (p < 0.001) and 22% (p < 0.01), respectively. A similar inhibitory effect was obtained with the two structurally unrelated microtubule depolymerizing agents colchicine and nocodazole (data not shown). To confirm the action of these agents, the microtubule network was visualized directly (Fig. 3B). The relationship between the microtubule-based transcytosolic traffic of c-Met and the influence of PKC on this process is evidenced by the finding that the promotion of c-Met traffic by TPA, in the presence of HGF, is also blocked by microtubule disruption (Fig. 3C). This indicates that it is the microtubule-based movements of internalized, vesicular c-Met that is positively regulated by PKC. The Accumulating Perinuclear c-Met Compartment in Part Corresponds to the Golgi—Western blot of c-Met demonstrates that, during the time period when c-Met is trafficking, HGF induces a progressive loss of the mature p145 form of c-Met such that at later times the p170 precursor form is roughly at the same concentration as the p145. This has been validated both by the anti-c-Met intracellular domain antibody (Fig. 4A) and the anti-c-Met extracellular domain antibody (data not shown). Densitometric analysis showed that the loss of the p145 form of c-Met reaches 60% by 240–480 min (p < 0.01). The contribution of the immature p170c-Met precursor to the perinuclear pool of immunoreactive receptor was determined by its elimination with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Acute pretreatment with cycloheximide completely inhibited p170c-Met synthesis as evidenced by its steady-state loss (Fig. 4B), however there was no effect upon the rate of HGF-induced p145c-Met degradation. c-Met immunofluorescence of control and cycloheximide treated cells indicated that for controls a substantial overlap with the Golgi compartment was observed at later times following HGF treatment. This was evident at 240 min using the Golgi markers p115 (Fig. 4C) and GM130 (data not shown). In cycloheximide-treated cells, where essentially all the immunoreactivity represents p145c-Met (see above), there was only a weak overlap with the Golgi compartment. This indicates that there is limited recycling of internalized c-Met p145c-Met through the Golgi compartment and that the majority of the internalized receptor is degraded following accumulation in a non-Golgi perinuclear compartment. However, after 240 min of HGF stimulation, only a limited co-localization was detected between c-Met and LBPA (data not shown) or LysoTracker (Fig. 4D) when compared with GM130, indicating that c-Met degradation is not substantially routed through the lysosomal pathway. In addition, co-localized immunofluorescence of LysoTracker is much less evident with c-Met than with EGFR after stimulation with HGF or EGF, respectively (Fig. 4E). It is also notable that perinuclear c-Met displays a distinct distribution compared with γ-tubulin (Fig. 4F). C-Met Degradation Is Proteasome-dependent and Independent of Its Post-endocytic Traffic—To distinguish proteasome and lysosomal directed c-Met degradation, proteasome inhibitors were employed. Both MG132 and lactacystin completely blocked p145c-Met degradation (Fig. 5A). By contrast, MG132 blocks only 24% of EGFR degradation after 120 min of EGF stimulation (Fig. 5B). Previous studies provided evidence that the primary effect of proteasome inhibition on c-Met degradation occurs indirectly through an effect on c-Met endocytosis (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although no effects of these agents on endocytosis had been observed (see above) the post-endocytic action of the inhibitors was confirmed by application 10 min after HGF, at a time when the bulk of c-Met was already internalized (see Fig. 1A). This post-treatment with MG132 also produced a complete block in HGF-induced p145c-Met degradation (Fig. 5C). In contrast to previous result (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we do not detect any block of c-Met degradation in presence of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A used at the same concentration (Fig. 5D). Similar results have been obtained with bafilomycin A1 (data not shown). To determine whether the engagement of proteasome-mediated degradation was particular to the perinuclear compartment, delivery to this compartment was blocked by pretreating the cells with BIM-I, vinblastine, and taxol or, conversely, was promoted by TPA. None of these agents affected HGF-induced p145c-Met degradation (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, we found that proteasomal degradation can still be blocked in the presence of vinblastine (Fig. 5G). This indicates that engagement of the proteasome machinery is not restricted to the perinuclear compartment and that post-endocytic c-Met traffic and degradation are independent. The endocytic and degradative pathway of c-Met has been detailed here for HeLa cells. The studies demonstrate that the bulk of internalized c-Met is delivered in a microtubule-dependent, PKC-controlled manner to a perinuclear compartment, from where it is subsequently degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Contrary to previous studies (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we find no evidence for proteasome-sensitive endocytosis per se. On prolonged exposure to HGF, the c-Met p170 precursor becomes a significant form, and this correlates with the immunofluorescence data that indicates a Golgi localization. This late phase localization is consistent with the observation by Kamei and colleagues (26Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) of a perinuclear localization after 8 h of HGF treatment. Internalized c-Met is progressively degraded by a proteasomal pathway, and the lysosomal pathway does not play a substantial role. Although temporally related to its arrival, the degradation of p145-c-Met is not restricted to this perinuclear compartment, because inhibition of trans-cytosolic traffic (PKC inhibitors and microtubule disruption) or its promotion (PKC activation) does not alter the kinetics of degradation. Thus, susceptibility to proteasome degradation is not a direct consequence of traffic. The mechanism of c-Met internalization appears to involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis, being inhibited by a pretreatment of cells with dansylcadaverine or by overexpression of the COOH part of AP180 (myc-AP180-C). It has been shown previously that EGFR endocytosis was inhibited by the full-length AP180 or AP180-C (27Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) as a consequence of the blocking of clathrin-coated pit formation. The COOH domain of AP180 is able to bind clathrin and to stimulate cage assembly in vitro. These results are consistent with the finding that c-Met endocytosis is impaired by mutant dynamin expression (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). c-Met degradation is dependent on its internalization, because no HGF-dependent degradation is seen in the presence of dansylcadaverine (data not shown). Similarly, it has been shown by others that expression of a dominant interfering mutant of endophilin (28Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) or mutant dynamin (16Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) impairs c-Met internalization and down-regulation. In line with the studies by Jeffers et al. (13Jeffers M. Taylor G.A.

Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Google Scholar). Three isoforms of TGF-βs (TGF-β1, -2, and -3) have been cloned from humans, and they belong to a large superfamily of growth-modulating polypeptides (2Kingsley D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Google Scholar). Members of this family regulate the growth and differentiation of many cell types and have an important role in numerous developmental processes (3Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Google Scholar). TGF-βs regulate also the formation and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (4Laiho M. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2533-2553Google Scholar). Most cells secrete TGF-β in a latent form, noncovalently bound to its propeptide latency-associated peptide (LAP). LAP associates with LTBP, which is needed for secretion, correct folding, and matrix deposition of TGF-β (5Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Google Scholar). Activation of the growth factor requires the dissociation of mature TGF-β from LAP-LTBP complex (1Saharinen J. Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

LTBPs belong to the LTBP/fibrillin family of extracellular matrix proteins, which includes LTBPs 1–4 and fibrillins 1 and 2. LTBP-1 and -2 co-localize with extracellular fibrillin microfibrils as well as with fibronectin in cultured cells at certain points of matrix formation (7Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Google Scholar, 8Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Davis E.C. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Mecham R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6932-6942Google Scholar). LTBP-3 is especially important for bone development (9Dabovic B. Chen Y. Colarossi C. Obata H. Zambuto L. Perle M.-A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 227-232Google Scholar). LTBP-1 and -3 possess the strongest ability to bind small latent TGF-β as assessed by complex formation assays (10Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Google Scholar). LTBP-4 is also important for regulating TGF-β1 function, since the LTBP-4 gene-targeted mouse suffers from defects in TGF-β targeting (11Sterner-Kock A. Thorey I.S. Koli K. Wempe F. Otte J. Bangsow T. Kuhlmeier K. Kirchner T. Jin S. Keski-Oja J. von Melchner H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2264-2273Google Scholar). Unlike the other LTBPs, LTBP-2 is unable to associate with the small latent TGF-β (10Saharinen J. Keski-Oja J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Google Scholar). Human LTBP-2 is expressed mostly in the lung and to a lesser extent in the liver, skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart (12Moren A. Olofsson A. Stenman G. Sahlin P. Kanzaki T. Claesson-Welsh L. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32469-32478Google Scholar). LTBP-2 deficiency in the mouse causes early embryonic lethality, indicating the importance of the molecule in development, possibly during implantation (13Shipley J.M. Mecham R.P. Maus E. Bonadio J. Rosenbloom J. McCarthy R.T. Baumann M.L. Frankfater C. Segade F. Shapiro S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4879-4887Google Scholar). LTBP-2 contains the common integrin recognition sequence RGD in its N terminus, suggesting a possible role in cell adhesion. Interactions between fibrillin-1 and integrin αVβ3 (14Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Google Scholar) and also between LAP-TGF-β1 and integrins αVβ1, αVβ6, and α8β1 have been reported (see Refs. 15Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Giancotti F.G. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2627-2638Google Scholar, 16Munger J. Huang X. Kawakatsu H. Griffiths M. Dalton S. Wu J. Pittet J.-F. Kaminski N. Garat C. Matthay M. Rifkin D. Sheppard D.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4641-4648Google Scholar, respectively). Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors consisting of α and β subunits (reviewed in Refs. 19Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar and 20Hynes R. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Google Scholar). They mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions and play important roles in many biological processes such as wound healing, maintenance of tissue integrity, cell growth, and survival. Integrins participate also in various pathological conditions like inflammation and invasion of cancer cells. Integrins are widely distributed on various cell types, and 24 αβ heterodimers are currently known. Their ligands are usually immobilized extracellular matrix proteins, and their intracellular tail is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton through proteins like talin, paxillin, and vinculin (21Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Google Scholar, 22Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Google Scholar, 23Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3577-3579Google Scholar). Integrin receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, but the cytoplasmic domains are the site of accumulation of many signaling molecules such as Src-type kinases and Src substrates (21Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Google Scholar). In addition, there are proteins that interact with the transmembrane part of an integrin-like adaptor protein, caveolin (24Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Google Scholar, 25Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Google Scholar). Through these multiple interactions, integrins mediate signals from the cell surroundings into the cell and vice versa. The β1 subfamily of integrin receptors includes 12 members, which have partially overlapping ligand specificities (26Ivaska J. Heino J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 16-24Google Scholar, 27Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Google Scholar). Fibronectin, collagens, and laminins are common ligands, but there are also receptors for tenascin and VCAM-1 in this family. Melanoma cells are known to express a wide variety of integrin receptors, of which the function of the αVβ3 is best characterized in the context of malignant melanoma (28Albelda S.M. Mette S.A. Elder D.E. Stewart R. Damjanovich L. Herlyn M. Buck C.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6757-6764Google Scholar, 29Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Google Scholar, 30Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 359-375Google Scholar). In the current work, we have analyzed the ability of LTBP-2 to act as an adhesion protein for different cultured cells. In general, LTBP-2 did not mediate cell adhesion but acted as an adhesion protein for all melanoma cell lines tested. This feature of LTBP-2 is new and provides new views to the regulation of melanoma cell adhesion and spreading. Antibodies and Reagents—The mouse monoclonal anti-human integrin antibodies against β1 (clone 6S6 and clone P5D2), α1 (clone FB12), α2 (clone 1IE6), α3 (clone ASC-6), α4 (clone P1H4), α5 (clone P1D6), αV (MAB1980), and αVβ3 (clone LM609) were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). The goat monoclonal antibody against the human integrin α6 subunit (clone GoH3) and anti-paxillin antibody were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody was from Sigma. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins and streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate were from DAKO D/S (Denmark). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Laminin (from basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma), fibronectin (from human plasma), GRGDTP peptide, and heparan sulfate (from porcine intestinal mucosa) were purchased from Sigma, and heparin was from Leiras (Turku, Finland). Cells and Cell Culture Conditions—Cell lines used were human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEL-299; CCL-137, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and human melanoma cell lines Bowes (CRL-9607; ATCC); G361 (CRL-1424; ATTC); WM793, WM852, WM163, WM164, and WM239 (WM, Wistar melanoma; isolated from melanoma metastasis, established at Wistar Institute); and Chinese hamster ovary cell clones expressing recombinant LTBP-2 (31Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20669-20676Google Scholar) or its fragments. Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Stably transfected LTBP-2 expressing CHO-L2 clone was grown in MEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, supplemented with FCS and antibiotics as above and 0.4 mg/ml neomycin, G418 (Invitrogen). Production and Purification of Recombinant LTBP-2 and LTBP-2 Fragments—The cloning of the expression construct, production, and purification of full-length LTBP-2 have been described elsewhere (31Hyytiäinen M. Taipale J. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20669-20676Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium from CHO-L2 clone was precipitated with 30% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 at +4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, after which it was filtered and applied to MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound proteins were eluted with a 210–700 mm NaCl gradient. LTBP-2-containing fractions were combined, and 4 m urea was added to achieve the final concentration of 2 m. The sample was applied to a MonoQ 5/5 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 2 m urea. Proteins were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing LTBP-2 were fractionated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea. The buffer of LTBP-2 fractions was then changed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with Fast Desalting column HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and purification of LTBP-2 fragments as IgG Fc-tail fusion proteins was carried out essentially as described for LTBP-1 (32Unsöld C. Hyytiäinen M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 187-197Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assays—Plates of 96 wells were coated with the indicated proteins diluted in PBS at +37 °C for 2 h. The residual protein binding sites were saturated with 1% heat-denaturated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at room temperature for at least 30 min. The wells were washed with PBS before the addition of cells. Semiconfluent cultures of cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and suspended at a density of 6.0 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free minimal essential medium. Cell suspension (50 μl) was then transferred to each well. In inhibition studies, the cells were incubated with antibodies or other agents of interest for 15 min before transfer to the wells. The antibodies were used at concentrations up to 25 μg/ml, the RGD peptide was used at 100–500 μm, and heparin was used at up to 800 IU/ml. Each experimental condition was tested in triplicate. The cells were permitted to attach at +37 °C for 1 h, after which the wells were washed with PBS to remove nonattached cells. Cells were then fixed and stained simultaneously with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol and washed with the same fixative without the dye. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS in PBS, and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm. Immunofluorescence Stainings—Glass coverslips were coated with either LTBP-2 or laminin (10 or 20 μg/ml) at +37 °C for 2 h and then treated with 1% heat-denaturated BSA at room temperature for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding of cells. BSA-coated coverslips were used as negative controls. Bowes melanoma cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and suspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free MEM. The coated coverslips were placed in six-well plates, and 1 × 105 cells were transferred to each well. The cells were then allowed to attach at +37 °C for 2 h, and nonattached cells were removed by washing with PBS, after which the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Permeabilization of cells was performed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min. The cells were then treated with 5% BSA for 30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the integrin β1 subunit (P5D2), paxillin, or vinculin at pretested concentrations for 1 h. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with PBS with subsequent incubation either with biotinylated secondary antibodies or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The coverslips were washed again and Streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate was used as fluorescence conjugate when needed. The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The fluorescent images were obtained using epifluorescent microscope. The α3 integrin staining was performed as described above with one exception; the primary antibody, mAb ASC-6, was permitted to bind to living cells on ice for 20 min before fixation. The following steps were carried out as for other stainings. Cell Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers (Falcon cell culture inserts with 8-μm pores). The upper and/or lower sides of the membranes of inserts were coated on either with the indicated concentrations of LTBP-2 or fibronectin at +37 °C for 1 h, washed with PBS, and then treated with 1% heat-inactivated BSA for 30 min to prevent nonspecific binding. The inserts were then washed twice with PBS and placed in 24-well cell culture plates. Bowes melanoma cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, and the cell number was determined by an optical electronic counter. The cells were suspended in MEM containing 0.1% FCS at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Cell suspension (500 μl) was applied to upper chambers, and 750 μl of MEM with 0.1% FCS was added to lower chambers. The cells were allowed to migrate in 5% CO2 at +37 °C for 6 h. The cells were then fixed and stained with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.1% Coomassie Blue for 5 min and washed with the same fixative without the dye. The cells that had not migrated through the pores were removed from the upper surface of the membrane with cotton swabs. The number of migrated cells was counted from three randomly chosen microscope fields of each membrane. Melanoma Cells Attach to LTBP-2—To explore the effects of LTBP-2 on cell adhesion, we produced recombinant LTBP-2 and partially overlapping fragments that covered the whole protein. We tested several cell lines of different origin, such as human lung fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma cells, to analyze their abilities to bind to purified LTBP-2 immobilized to plastic (data not shown). We found that among these cell lines all of the melanoma cell lines tested were able to adhere to LTBP-2 (Fig. 1A). Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (CCL-137) and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) are shown as examples of cells that cannot adhere to LTBP-2. Most efficient adhesion to LTBP-2 was detected using Bowes cells; therefore, we selected this melanoma cell line for further characterization. The adhesion of Bowes cells to LTBP-2 was dependent on the protein concentration used in coating (Fig. 1B). To test the effects of LTBP-2 on cell spreading, we coated glass coverslips with 10 μg/ml LTBP-2. Coverslips coated with 1% denatured BSA were used as controls. Cells were seeded on coated coverslips and allowed to adhere for 90 min, after which they were fixed. The cell morphology was visualized by staining the actin cytoskeleton with phalloidin-TRITC. By microscopic analysis, we found that Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 was associated with cell spreading (Fig. 1C). Actin staining was mostly seen at the cell cortex, which is typical for these cells. Cells seeded on LTBP-2 formed also extensive filopodia, in contrast to cells adhered to BSA, which appeared more round and less spread. Antibodies to β1Integrin Totally Prevent Bowes Cell Adhesion to LTBP-2—Since LTBP-2 contains an RGD sequence in its N terminus, we assumed that the interaction of Bowes melanoma cells with LTBP-2 could be mediated by one or more integrin receptors. We took the approach of inhibiting cell adhesion by a number of monoclonal anti-integrin antibodies. Cells were incubated with function-blocking antibodies for 20 min at room temperature before seeding onto LTBP-2-coated 96-well plates. Among the antibodies, the anti-β1 antibody 6S6 completely prevented melanoma cell adhesion to LTBP-2 (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory effect was clearly concentration-dependent (Fig. 2C). The antibody against the integrin α3 subunit decreased cell adhesion by 50%, whereas mAbs recognizing the α subunits 1, 2, 4, 5, and V did not have any effect on Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 (Fig. 2A). mAb against the integrin α6 subunit had a small decreasing effect on the adhesion and enhanced the inhibitory effect of the anti-α3 antibody when used in combination (Fig. 2B). Together, the antibodies against α3 and α6 integrins decreased Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 almost by 80%, which was comparable with their effect on Bowes cell adhesion to laminin. However, when used individually, both anti-α3 and anti-α6 antibodies were more effective in preventing Bowes cell adhesion to laminin, as could be expected, since α3β1 and α6β1 are known as laminin receptors (summarized in Ref. 33van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Google Scholar). The effect of these antibodies on Bowes cell adhesion to collagen I was negligible. Since antibodies against integrin α3 and α6 subunits did not totally prevent Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2, some other interactions are evidently involved in the adhesion. αVβ3 integrin has been shown to be an important integrin receptor in melanoma cell adhesion and invasion in various studies (28Albelda S.M. Mette S.A. Elder D.E. Stewart R. Damjanovich L. Herlyn M. Buck C.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6757-6764Google Scholar, 29Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Google Scholar, 34Li X. Chen B. Blystone S.D. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Ramos D.M. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 1-14Google Scholar). Although the antibody against αV subunit did not have any effect on melanoma cell adhesion to LTBP-2, we tested monoclonal antibodies against the β3 subunit and an antibody against the entire αVβ3 in inhibition assays. We could not observe any effect on cell adhesion (data not shown), confirming that αVβ3 integrin is not involved in adhesion to LTBP-2. Cells Seeded on LTBP-2 Express the β1and α3Integrins on Their Surface and Form Focal Adhesions—The involvement of the β1 integrin in melanoma cell attachment to LTBP-2 was further verified by immunofluorescence. Cells were allowed to adhere to LTBP-2- or laminin-coated (20 μg/ml) coverslips for 2 h before fixing and staining. The fluorescence signal was localized mostly at the cell membrane, especially in the lamellipodia (Fig. 3, uppermost panel, on the left). Some perinuclear staining was observed as well. In control cells seeded on laminin, β1 integrin was seen in lamellipodia and also inside the cell (Fig. 3). Marginal, more diffuse staining was seen in cells attached to BSA. The α3 integrin staining was similar to β1 localizing mainly to the cell cortex in Bowes cells seeded on either LTBP-2 or laminin (Fig. 3). Both integrins were seen in plaque-like structures on the cell membrane or just beneath it, indicating receptor clustering after ligand recognition. Connection to actin cytoskeleton is important for integrin functions. The connection is formed through many adaptor proteins (e.g. vinculin and talin at the ECM contact sites called focal contacts or focal adhesions) (35Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Google Scholar). We explored next whether Bowes cells form this kind of structure when attached to LTBP-2. We carried out immunofluorescence stainings with antibodies against paxillin and vinculin after Bowes cells were allowed to attach to LTBP-2-coated coverslips. Both paxillin and vinculin were localized to the cell periphery in dot- or plaque-like structures in cells adhered to LTBP-2 or laminin, which indicates that cells are firmly attached and form focal contacts. Melanoma Cell Attachment to LTBP-2 Is Not Dependent on RGD Sequence—Since the α3β1 integrin is known to recognize the RGD sequence in some ligands (36Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Google Scholar, 37Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Google Scholar), and the LTBP-2 molecule also contains one at its N terminus, we tested whether an RGD peptide could interfere with Bowes melanoma cell adhesion to LTBP-2. Cells were allowed to attach to LTBP-2-coated wells in the presence of RGD peptide. In our experiments, the RGD peptide decreased Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 by 40% at a concentration of 500 μm. Lower concentrations did not have any effect (data not shown). To control the function of the RGD peptide, we tested its ability to inhibit Bowes cell adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin. The peptide totally prevented both at a concentration of 500 μm (Fig. 4A). Cell surface proteoglycans are important modulators of cell adhesion, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans cooperate with integrins in many cell-matrix interactions (38Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar). This led us to examine whether Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 would be affected by treating cells with heparin, a wide range inhibitor of cell adhesion (38Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Google Scholar), before seeding cells onto LTBP-2-coated wells. Heparin inhibited Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). The effect of heparin was similar to the inhibition of cell adhesion to fibronectin (data not shown). Total inhibition, comparable with adhesion to BSA, was achieved at a concentration of 800 IU/ml. We explored also the effect of heparan sulfate in the same assay but did not observe any effect on Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 (data not shown). This may implicate the involvement of very specialized form of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Bowes Cell Adhesion to LTBP-2 Is Decreased by Polyclonal Antibody against Recombinant LTBP-2 but Only Slightly by the Soluble Form of the Protein—To confirm that the adherence of Bowes cells to LTBP-2 is not caused by some impurity in the protein preparation, we tested the effect of polyclonal antibody, abL22 (affinity-purified IgG), generated against recombinant LTBP-2, in the adhesion assay. Before seeding the cells into LTBP-2-coated wells, the wells were incubated with the antibody at room temperature for 20 min. After that, the adhesion assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment of the LTBP-2-coated wells with abL22 decreased the melanoma cell adhesion by 40% (Fig. 5). We have observed that abL22 does not recognize the N-terminal epitopes of LTBP-2 as well as the C-terminal ones, which may explain the inhibitory effect being only partial. 2M. Hyytiäinen, P. Vehviläinen, and J. Keski-Oja, unpublished data. We analyzed next whether soluble LTBP-2 could compete with melanoma cell adhesion to an immobilized form of the protein. To test this, Bowes cells were incubated before plating with soluble LTBP-2 (5 μg/ml) at room temperature for 20 min. We observed that soluble LTBP-2 decreased melanoma cell adhesion by ∼15%, suggesting that cells cannot efficiently bind soluble LTBP-2 and that the adhesive properties of LTBP-2 are dependent on its deposition to substratum, namely tissue culture plate in this case. N-terminal Fragment of LTBP-2 Is the Domain Responsible for Bowes Cell Adhesion—We took the recombinant fragment approach to identify the adhesive site in the LTBP-2 protein. To investigate this, we produced several partially overlapping LTBP-2 fragments as Ig fusion proteins covering the whole protein and used the purified fragments in adhesion assays (Fig. 6B). As expected, Bowes cells did not adhere to any of the fragments as efficiently as to full-length LTBP-2. The N-terminal fragments L2-III, L2-V, and L2-VII were the most potent in mediating cell attachment (Fig. 6A). These fragments contain a common proline-rich region. Of these fragments, L2-III contains the RGD sequence, but the shorter fragment L2-V, lacking this RGD, was slightly more potent in mediating Bowes cell adhesion. Fragment L2-II containing the RGD sequence was ineffective, confirming that Bowes cell adhesion to LTBP-2 is independent of the RGD sequence. Some binding was observed to fragment L2-IX, which contains another proline-rich region, and to the pIg control protein. On the other hand, cells did not adhere to purified mouse IgG. LTBP-2 Supports Migration of Bowes Melanoma Cells—We explored next whether LTBP-2 supports melanoma cell migration in addition to adhesion. The migration assay measures the ability of cells to migrate through a porous membrane, which can be coated with the test protein either on one side or both. We used purified LTBP-2 for coating and made control experiments with fibronectin, since fibronectin is haptotactic (39Postlethwaite A.E. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. Kang A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 251-256Google Scholar) for a variety of cell lines. In the experiment where the LTBP-2 was coated only on the upper surface of the membrane of the cell culture insert, the cells migrated very poorly (Fig. 7). When LTBP-2 was coated on th"
https://openalex.org/W1997852904,"African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) are digenetic parasites whose lifecycle alternates between the mammalian bloodstream and the midgut of the tsetse fly vector. In mammals, proliferating long slender parasites transform into non-diving short stumpy forms, which differentiate into procyclic forms when ingested by the tsetse fly. A hallmark of differentiation is the replacement of the bloodstream stage surface coat composed of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) with a new coat composed of procylin. An undefined endoprotease and endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) have been implicated in releasing the old VSG coat. However, GPI hydrolysis has been considered unimportant because (i) GPI-PLC null mutants are fully viable and (ii) cytosolic GPI-PLC is localized away from cell surface VSG. Utilizing an in vitro differentiation assay with pleomorphic strains we have investigated these modes of VSG release. Shedding is initially by GPI hydrolysis, which ultimately accounts for a substantial portion of total release. Surface biotinylation assays indicate that GPI-PLC does gain access to extracellular VSG, suggesting that this mode is primed in the starting short stumpy population. Proteolytic release is up-regulated during differentiation and is stereoselectively inhibited by peptidomimetic collagenase inhibitors, implicating a zinc metalloprotease. This protease may be related to TbMSP-B, a trypanosomal homologue of Leishmaniamajor surface protease (MSP) described in the accompanying paper (LaCount, D. J., Gruszynski, A. E., Grandgenett, P. M., Bangs, J. D., and Donelson, J. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 24658–24664). Overall, our results demonstrate that surface coat remodeling during differentiation has multiple mechanisms and that GPI-PLC plays a more significant role in VSG release than previously thought. African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) are digenetic parasites whose lifecycle alternates between the mammalian bloodstream and the midgut of the tsetse fly vector. In mammals, proliferating long slender parasites transform into non-diving short stumpy forms, which differentiate into procyclic forms when ingested by the tsetse fly.

This protease may be related to TbMSP-B, a trypanosomal homologue of Leishmaniamajor surface protease (MSP) described in the accompanying paper (LaCount, D. J., Gruszynski, A. E., Grandgenett, P. M., Bangs, J. D., and Donelson, J. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 24658–24664). Overall, our results demonstrate that surface coat remodeling during differentiation has multiple mechanisms and that GPI-PLC plays a more significant role in VSG release than previously thought. African trypanosomes are pathogenic kinetoplastid protozoa responsible for human and veterinary trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa. This parasite has a digenetic lifecycle that alternates between the insect vector (tsetse flies) and the bloodstream of mammalian hosts. In the mammalian bloodstream, trypanosomes transform from a replicating long slender form into a non-dividing short stumpy form that is pre-adapted for transmission to the tsetse fly. In the fly midgut, the short stumpy form differentiates into a replicating procyclic form. Bloodstream and insect stage trypanosomes possess distinct developmentally regulated surface molecules: VSG 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; sVSG, soluble VSG; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPI-PLC, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; P27, morpholinourea-phenylalanine homophenylalanine-benz-α-pyrone; RT, reverse transcriptase; CRD, cross-reacting determinant; HSP70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; GP63, 63-kDa glycoprotein; RNAi, RNA interference; MSP, major surface protease; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIC, protease inhibitor cocktail; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; PAS, Protein A-Sepharose; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. in bloodstream trypanosomes (1Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Google Scholar) and procyclin in the procyclic insect stage (2Mowatt M.R. Clayton C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2833-2844Google Scholar, 3Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M. Nature. 1987; 325: 272-274Google Scholar, 4Richardson J.P. Beecroft R.P. Tolson D.L. Liu M.K. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 203-216Google Scholar). VSG, a homodimer that constitutes ∼10% of total bloodstream protein, is attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor. Antigenic variation, which is the sequential expression of distinct VSG genes, enables trypanosomes to evade the host immune response (5Cross G.A.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 283-291Google Scholar). Unlike VSG, procyclin is a monomeric coat protein that can be divided into two classes based on distinct C-terminal repeat motifs (6Roditi I. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 99-100Google Scholar). EP procyclins contain up to 30 Glu-Pro repeats, whereas GPEET procyclin has six Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr repeats followed by three Glu-Pro repeats. Both repeat motifs are protease-resistant, and, therefore, one function of procyclins may be to protect the parasite from the hydrolytic environment of the tsetse fly midgut. Reflecting a difference in the biosynthetic capability of each stage of the lifecycle, procyclin is anchored to the cell surface of insect stage trypanosomes by a GPI moiety structurally distinct from the VSG anchor (7Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Google Scholar, 8Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Google Scholar). Replacement of VSG with procyclin is a hallmark of the transformation of bloodstream stage trypanosomes into the procyclic form. Differentiation can be induced in vitro by a variety of conditions that mimic the environment of the tsetse fly midgut, including mild acid stress and trypsin treatment (9Rolin S. Hanocq-Quertier J. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D. Salmon D. Webb H. Carrington M. Voorheis P. Pays E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10844-10852Google Scholar, 10Voorheis H. Bowles D. Smith G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2300-2304Google Scholar). The most effective treatment, however, is the addition of cis-aconitate to the culture media coupled with a temperature reduction from 37 to 27 °C (11Czichos J. Nonnengaesser C. Overath P. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 283-291Google Scholar, 12Matthews K. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2609-2618Google Scholar). When initiated with enriched short stumpy populations, differentiation is essentially synchronous, allowing for the precise description of temporally regulated events (13Ziegelbauer K. Quinten M. Schwarz H. Pearson T. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 373-378Google Scholar). Early events include the induction of procyclin expression, the repression of VSG synthesis, and the shedding of the old VSG coat from the cell surface (13Ziegelbauer K. Quinten M. Schwarz H. Pearson T. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 373-378Google Scholar, 14Overath P. Czichos J. Stock U. Nonnengaesser C. EMBO. 1983; 2: 1721-1728Google Scholar, 15Roditi I. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Liu M.K. Richardson J.T. Buhring H.-J. Pleiss J. Bulow R. Williams R.O. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 737-746Google Scholar). After VSG shedding has begun, the kinetoplast is repositioned with respect to the nucleus (16Brown R.C. Evans D.A. Vickerman K. Int. J. Parasitol. 1973; 3: 691-704Google Scholar). Differentiating trypanosomes enter into their first procyclic cell cycle following these morphological changes (17Matthews K. Sherwin T. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2231-2239Google Scholar). There are two known ways that VSG is released from the cell surface, GPI hydrolysis and endoproteolysis. Bloodstream stage trypanosomes contain an endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) that is capable of hydrolyzing the GPI anchor found on VSG, but not procyclin (7Field M.C. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2731-2739Google Scholar, 18Ferguson M.A.J. Haldar K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4963-4968Google Scholar). GPI hydrolysis releases a soluble form of VSG (sVSG), which retains the GPI core glycan. This type of VSG release occurs upon cell lysis (19Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Turner M.J. Nature. 1983; 302: 349-353Google Scholar) as well as in normal growth of long slender cells where VSG is slowly shed into the medium with a half-life of ∼32 h (20Seyfang A. Mecke D. Duszenko M. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 546-552Google Scholar, 21Bulow R. Nonnengasser C. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 85-92Google Scholar). GPI-PLC-mediated release of VSG also occurs during differentiation of bloodstream stage trypanosomes (22Ziegelbauer K. Stahl B. Karas M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3737-3742Google Scholar). The second mode of VSG release, endoproteolysis, only occurs during differentiation as evidenced by the shedding of soluble VSG fragments (21Bulow R. Nonnengasser C. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 85-92Google Scholar, 22Ziegelbauer K. Stahl B. Karas M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3737-3742Google Scholar). At no other time is VSG released from bloodstream stage cells in such a manner. It has generally been accepted that the primary means of VSG release during differentiation is proteolytic, because GPI-PLC null mutant trypanosomes have been shown to be fully viable and capable of differentiation (23Webb H. Carnall N. Vanhamme L. Rolin S. Van Den Abbeele J. Welburn S. Pays E. Carrington M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 103-114Google Scholar). Moreover, GPI-PLC has been reported to localize to the cytoplasmic face of intracellular vesicles, sequestering the enzyme away from extracellular VSG (24Bulow R. Griffiths G. Webster P. Stierhof Y.-D. Opperdoes F.R. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 233-240Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that VSG expressed in transgenic procyclics is shed by proteolytic cleavage resulting in soluble N-terminal and membrane-bound C-terminal fragments in a manner similar to that observed during the differentiation of bloodstream cells (25Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). Release is inhibited by the zinc chelator bathophenanthroline and by peptidomimetic inhibitors of mammalian collagenase-type zinc metalloproteases (26Bangs J. Ransom D. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). These findings indicate that fully differentiated procyclics have a potent cell surface metalloprotease activity, the function of which is unknown. In this work, we establish that endoproteolytic release of VSG from the surface of differentiating bloodstream stage cells is also mediated by a zinc metalloprotease activity. This activity has a similar inhibitor profile as the activity that mediates release of transgenic VSG from the surface of procyclic trypanosomes. We propose that a zinc metalloprotease is up-regulated during differentiation to release VSG and is then maintained on the surface of fully differentiated procyclics. In addition, we find that GPI-PLC can be physically detected on the surface of intact short stumpy trypanosomes and that GPI hydrolysis can account for a significant portion of VSG release during differentiation. These results suggest that the role of GPI hydrolysis in surface coat remodeling should be reconsidered. Compounds—Bathophenanthroline was obtained from Sigma. SB227961 and SB227962 were kindly supplied by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (SB, Harlow, UK) and have been described previously (26Bangs J. Ransom D. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). P27 (morpholinourea-phenylalanine homophenylalanine-benz-α-pyrone) was a generous gift from Dr. James McKerrow (University of California-San Francisco). All compounds were dissolved as 50–100× stocks in water or Me2SO as appropriate. Trypanosomes—Lister 427 Strain procyclic cell lines were maintained in Cunningham's media supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (27Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Google Scholar). The pleomorphic cell lines used in the differentiation assay, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (LouTat 1.0, from Dr. John Mansfield, University of Wisconsin-Madison) and T. brucei brucei (AnTat 1.1, from Dr. Peter Overath, Max Planck Institut für Biologie), were grown in Swiss Webster mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (300 mg/kg, Sigma) at the time of infection. LouTat 1.0 and AnTat 1.1 bloodstream trypanosomes were isolated from infected mice on day 14 and day 8, respectively, as described below. Both strains possessed short stumpy populations in excess of 90% as judged by morphology. Synthetic Deoxyoligonucleotides and Construction of Expression Vectors—The following synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were used for RT-PCR. Sequences complementary to the target template are in uppercase; added sequences are in lowercase. Restriction sites are underlined; all sequences are 5′ to 3′: JB196, aaaatcgatATGCAACCCAATGGCGC, 5′ sense primer for LouTat 1.0 VSG (codons 1–7) with ClaI site; JB197, aaagaattcTTAGAAAAGCAAGGCCAC, 3′ antisense primer for LouTat 1.0 VSG (codons 1526–1531) with EcoRI site. The RT-PCR product was cloned directly into the procyclic expression vector pXS2 (28Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Google Scholar) and inserts were sequenced to confirm identity. Stable transformation of cultured Lister 427 strain procyclic trypanosomes has been described (28Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit antiserum against Tbhsp70 (gene 4) has been described (29McDowell M.A. Ransom D.A. Bangs J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 681-689Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-LouTat 1.0 VSG and anti-AnTat 1.1 VSG were prepared by immunization with soluble VSG purified by the procedure of Cross (30Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Google Scholar). Anti-cross-reacting determinant (anti-CRD) (31Barbet A.F. McQuire T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1989-1993Google Scholar) was affinity-purified from whole rabbit anti-VSG 117 serum by absorption to immobilized soluble VSG 221. Anti-EP procyclin antibody (monoclonal 247) was obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories, Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). Anti-GPEET procyclin antibody (K1 polyclonal rabbit α(GPEET)3 peptide) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Bütikofer (University of Bern, Switzerland). Rabbit anti-Trypanosoma cruzi oligopeptidase B was a generous gift from Dr. Barbara Burleigh (Harvard School of Public Health). Rabbit anti-TbRab11 was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Field (Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, England). Anti-GPI-PLC (monoclonal 2A6-6) was a generous gift from Dr. Kojo Mensa-Wilmot (University of Georgia). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Sigma. For immunoprecipitation, rabbit antisera were covalently cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose (PAS, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) beads. PAS suspension (1 ml; ∼50% v/v; in TEN buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C with the individual whole rabbit antisera (0.2 ml). PAS:antibody beads were washed twice with sodium borate (100 mm, pH 9.0) and resuspended to 1.2 ml in the same buffer. Disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, 20 mm in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Following rotation at room temperature (2 h), 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm and rotation was continued (15 min). The PAS:antibody beads were then washed once with 100 mm glycine (pH 9.0), washed twice with TEN, and resuspended to 1.2 ml (∼50% v/v slurry) in TEN buffer supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (400 μg) was pre-adsorbed to PAS (1.0 ml) as described above, but without cross-linking, for use in surface biotinylation assays of short stumpy cells. VSG Release Assay—Proteolytic release of VSG from the surface of transgenic procyclic trypanosomes has been described previously (25Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar, 26Bangs J. Ransom D. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). Briefly, 427 strain procyclic cells stably expressing full-length LouTat 1.0 VSG were surface biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) and then incubated for 4 h at 27 °C in TM-P medium (DTM, 10 mm glycerol, 5.5 mm proline (32Overath P. Czichos J. Hass C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Google Scholar)). VSG was then immunoprecipitated from cell and media fractions and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to membranes, biotinyl-VSG was detected by chemiluminescence with avidin-HRP (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells displayed excellent motility and morphology throughout the assay period. Differentiation Assay—When populations were >90% short stumpy by visual inspection, pleomorphic LouTat 1.0 or AnTat 1.1 cells were harvested from infected mice by cardiac puncture. To enrich trypanosomes from infected blood without temperature shifts that might induce differentiation, a modification of the DEAE-cellulose technique of Lanham and Godfrey (33Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Google Scholar) was employed. Heparinized blood (∼1 ml) was placed directly into a sterile pre-warmed slurry (60% v/v, 13 ml) of DE52 (Whatman, Maidstone, England) equilibrated in Bicine-buffered saline (BBS: 50 mm Bicine, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 70 mm glucose, pH 8.0) and then rotated 2 min at 37 °C. DE52 with bound blood cells was removed by centrifugation (∼1 min, 2000 × g, 37 °C). The cells in suspension were collected and washed once with 37 °C BBS. Cells were diluted to ∼5 × 106 cells/ml in HMI9 media (34Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 81-84Google Scholar) and placed at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 1 h. After incubation, cells were washed once with prewarmed HMI9 media (37 °C) and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in 27 °C Cunningham's media supplemented with 3 mm each of citrate and cis-aconitate (11Czichos J. Nonnengaesser C. Overath P. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 283-291Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 27 °C, and time points were taken over a 48-h period. At each time point, 1.5 × 106 cell equivalents (0.6 ml) were removed and centrifuged, and the supernatants were reserved. The cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml glucose (PBSG), solubilized in 0.6 ml RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and precleared by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 × g). Detergents were added to culture supernatants to the same final concentrations as the RIPA buffer. Protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC; final concentration 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin) was added to both cell and media samples, which were then reserved for subsequent immunoprecipitations. Cells displayed excellent motility and morphology throughout the assay period. Trypanosomal proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated from cell and media fractions with appropriate antibodies covalently immobilized on PAS. The antibody:bead suspensions (40 μl) were added to 0.5 ml containing equivalent amounts of cell lysate or culture supernatant. The samples were mixed overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with RIPA buffer and twice with TEN. All samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P transfer membrane, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the presence of immunoprecipitated proteins was detected by immunoblotting with appropriate primary antibodies and secondary Protein A-HRP conjugate (KPL). Specific binding was visualized on x-ray film with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Procyclin Detection—Whole cell lysates (5 × 105 cell equivalents) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 25 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-EP procyclin or anti-GPEET procyclin antibody diluted in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (KPL), diluted in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, and then washed as before. Antibody binding was visualized as described above. Biotinylated sVSG—LouTat 1.0 or AnTat 1.1 trypanosomes were isolated from infected mice at peak parasitemia (>90% long slender forms, days 3–4) on DE52 columns (33Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Google Scholar). Surface biotinylation was performed as described above. After the biotinylation reaction was quenched, cells were washed twice in PBSG and lysed hypotonically (5 min, 4 °C) at 109 cells/ml in dH2O supplemented with PIC. Lysates were made isotonic with 10× PBS and centrifuged (5 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended at 109 cell equivalents/ml in TEN buffer supplemented with PIC and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Cell ghosts were removed by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant containing biotinylated sVSG was saved (109 cell equivalents/ml). Surface Biotinylation of Short Stumpy Cells—Surface biotinylation was performed as described above with some minor modifications. When populations were >90% short stumpy by visual inspection, AnTat 1.1 cells were isolated from infected mice on DE52 columns (33Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Google Scholar). The cells were washed once in BBS and placed in HMI9 media (107 cells/ml) at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 30 min. Cells were then harvested, washed twice at 107 cells/ml in PBSG, and treated (108 cells/ml, 30 min) on ice with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (400 μg/ml, Pierce Chemical Co.). To quench the biotinylation reaction, cells were diluted to 107 cells/ml in PBSG and NH4Cl (1 m in PBSG) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After a 5-min incubation on ice, cells were washed twice at 107 cells/ml in PBSG and solubilized at 2 × 108 cells/ml in RIPA buffer supplemented with PIC. Cell lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 × g). To remove contaminating mouse IgG that copurifies with short stumpy trypanosomes, cell lysates (2 × 108 cell equivalents) were cycled through two rounds of immunoprecipitation with 0.1 ml of rabbit anti-mouse IgG:PAS followed by one round of immunoprecipitation with 0.1 ml of PAS resuspended in RIPA buffer (0.08 g of beads/1 ml of RIPA). Trypanosomal proteins were then specifically immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of cleared lysate with appropriate antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to membranes, biotinylated proteins were detected by chemiluminescence with avidin-HRP (KPL). Metalloprotease Activity in Procyclic Trypanosomes—We have previously shown that VSG is shed from the surface of transgenic procyclic cell lines stably expressing recombinant VSG (25Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). The appearance of truncated VSG fragments in the culture medium derived from these cells suggests that release results from endoproteolytic cleavage upstream of the C-terminal GPI anchor. Shedding is inhibited by the chelator bathophenanthroline and by peptidomimetic compounds with known inhibitory activity against mammalian collagenases of the metzincin family (26Bangs J. Ransom D. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). These inhibitor studies demonstrate that a zinc metalloprotease activity is responsible for VSG release from the surface of transgenic procyclic cells. VSG is also released by endoproteolysis from the surface of differentiating bloodstream stage trypanosomes (22Ziegelbauer K. Stahl B. Karas M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3737-3742Google Scholar). Although the nature of the protease is unknown, the manner of shedding is similar to that seen with transgenic procyclic cells. To investigate this process, we established an in vitro differentiation assay using pleomorphic LouTat 1.0 trypanosomes (described below). However, before studying VSG release during differentiation, we wished to establish that the LouTat 1.0 VSG was subject to release by endoproteolysis in the transgenic procyclic system. A transgenic procyclic cell line constitutively expressing LouTat 1.0 VSG was established, and a standard biotinyl-VSG release assay was performed (Fig. 1). As seen previously with other transgenic VSGs (VSG221 and VSG117, (25Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar)), LouTat 1.0 VSG is initially cell-associated as a doublet of full-length and proteolytically truncated forms (lane 1). In the absence of inhibitors, essentially all VSG is truncated and released into the medium after 4 h (lane 4). This pattern of release is due to the homodimeric structure of native VSG where sequential cleavage of each subunit will first produce a heterodimer anchored to the membrane by one full-length monomer. After the second subunit is cleaved, VSG is released into the medium as a soluble, truncated homodimer. Release of LouTat 1.0 VSG is blocked by BPS (lanes 5 and 6) and the peptidomimetic SB227961 (lanes 7 and 8), but not its diastereoisomer, SB227962 (lanes 9 and 10), as was previously demonstrated with VSG117 (26Bangs J. Ransom D. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). Collectively, these results confirm that LouTat 1.0 VSG is subject to endoproteolytic release by the endogenous procyclic zinc metalloprotease activity. In Vitro Differentiation of LouTat 1.0 and AnTat 1.1 Trypanosomes—To investigate release of LouTat 1.0 VSG from differentiating bloodstream stage cells, we first established a reliable in vitro differentiation assay. In addition, to confirm that the manner of VSG release is common in other differentiating pleomorphic cell lines, a second strain, AnTat 1.1, was also examined. In each case, bloodstream stage cells were isolated from immunosuppressed mice when the majority of the population (>90%) was short stumpy in morphology and in vitro differentiation was induced by a temperature shift (37 to 27 °C) along with the addition of citrate and cis-aconitate (11Czichos J. Nonnengaesser C. Overath P. Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 62: 283-291Google Scholar). Cell density was monitored for 96 h (Fig. 2A), and expression of either EP-procyclin or GPEET-procyclin was assayed by immunoblotting cell extracts with the respective procyclin antibody (Fig. 2B). Results for both cell lines were similar to other synchronously differentiating pleomorphic strains (35Matthews K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 81-95Google Scholar, 36Vassella E. Abbeele J.V. Butikofer P. Renggli C.K. Furger A. Brun R. Roditi I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 615-626Google Scholar): logarithmic proliferation begins at approximately 12 h post-induction, and both types of procyclin expression are evident by 4 h post-induction. These results indicate that typical synchronous differentiation and cell cycle initiation occurs with both LouTat 1.0 and AnTat 1.1 trypanosomes. VSG Release during Differentiation—Both endoproteolysis and GPI hydrolysis by endogenous GPI-PLC have been implicated in VSG release during differentiation (22Ziegelbauer K. Stahl B. Karas M. Stierhof Y.-D. Overath P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3737-3742Google Scholar). GPI hydrolysis removes dimyristoyl glycerol, releasing the intact sVSG protein that retains the glycan portion of the GPI anchor (19Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Turner M.J.

The hydrolyzed glycan forms a unique immunological epitope known as the cross-reacting determinant (CRD) that can be detected with a specific anti-CRD antibody (38Zamze S.E. Ferguson M.A.J.

We report the identification of the antigenic determinants of an epitope that is present in enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recognized by a cross-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb WN1 222-5) regarded as a potential means of treatment. Using whole LPS and a panel of neoglycoconjugates containing purified LPS oligosaccharides obtained from Escherichia coli core types R1, R2, R3, and R4, Salmonella enterica, and the mutant strain E. coli J-5, we showed that mAb WN1 222-5 binds to the distal part of the inner core region and recognizes the structural element R1-α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-[l-α-d-Hepp-(1→7)]-l-α-d-Hepp 4P-(1→3)-R2 (where R1 represents additional sugars of the outer core and R2 represents additional sugars of the inner core), which is common to LPS from all E. coli, Salmonella, and Shigella. WN1 222-5 binds poorly to molecules that lack the side chain heptose or lack phosphate at the branched heptose. Also molecules that are substituted with GlcpN at the side chain heptose are poorly bound. Thus, the side chain heptose and the 4-phosphate on the branched heptose are main determinants of the epitope. We have determined the binding kinetics and affinities (K D values) of the monovalent interaction of E. coli core oligosaccharides with WN1 222-5 by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration microcalorimetry. Affinity constants (K D values) determined by SPR were in the range of 3.6 × 10–5 to 3.2 × 10–8m, with the highest affinity being observed for the core oligosaccharide from E. coli F576 (R2 core type) and the lowest K D values for those from E. coli J-5. Affinities of E. coli R1, R3, and R4 oligosaccharides were 5–10-fold lower, and values from the E. coli J-5 mutant were 29-fold lower than the R2 core oligosaccharide. Thus, the outer core sugars had a positive effect on binding. Septic shock due to infections with Gram-negative bacteria is a severe disease with a high mortality rate.

Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 31-38Google Scholar), and in enterobacteria they consist of lipid A, core region, and O-antigen in many bacteria (2Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The lipid A moiety is responsible for many of the pathological effects observed in septic shock, a serious condition with high mortality rates, especially among hospitalized patients in intensive care units. Septic shock is the result of an uncontrolled systemic activation of the immune system by endotoxins, leading to high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1. In the fight against septicemia, therapeutic strategies are aimed at the eradication of the bacteria by antibiotics, stabilization of the circulation symptomatically, and the neutralization of endotoxic effects. For the last goal, endotoxin antagonists, antibodies against tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 receptor antagonists, and LPS-binding proteins (BPI (bactericidal permeability-increasing protein) and LBP (LPS-binding protein)) have been considered (3Levy O. Elsbach P. Curr. Infect. Dis. Rep. 2001; 3: 407-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. J.

However, the large number of different O-antigens in enterobacteria, the serotype-restricted specificity of such antisera, and the rapid onset of shock have prevented their introduction into clinical practice. Whereas the chemical structure of the O-antigen is highly variable, the core region and lipid A show only limited structural variability within the enterobacteria. Following the observation that antibodies against the O-antigen are protective against homologous bacteria, the search for LPS antibodies with broad cross-reactivity is a valid concept for the immunotherapy of Gram-negative sepsis. Many investigators attempted the isolation of antibodies that are directed against the conserved regions of LPS (i.e. the lipid A and core region (reviewed in Ref. 7Müller-Loennies S. Di Padova F.E. Brade L. Heumann D. Rietschel E.T. Andrew P.W. Oyston P. Smith G.L. Stewart-Tull D.E. Fighting Infection in the 21st Century. Blackwell Science Ltd., Oxford2000: 143-178Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). Such antibodies have been presumed to be cross-reactive and cross-protective against different Gram-negative pathogens. Such a cross-protective effect was described for a polyclonal antiserum by Braude and Douglas (8Braude A.I. Douglas H. J. Immunol. 1972; 108: 505-512PubMed Google Scholar); however, all subsequently isolated LPS-specific monoclonal antibodies failed to show cross-reactivity in vitro and cross-protectivity in vivo (7Müller-Loennies S. Di Padova F.E. Brade L. Heumann D. Rietschel E.T. Andrew P.W. Oyston P. Smith G.L. Stewart-Tull D.E. Fighting Infection in the 21st Century. Blackwell Science Ltd., Oxford2000: 143-178Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), with the exception of mAb WN1 222-5 (9Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schuetze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mAb bound to LPS from all tested clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella in Western blots and ELISA and showed cross-protective effects in vivo against the endotoxic activities of LPS (9Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schuetze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The smallest LPS structure bound by WN1 222-5 was found to be present in LPS from E. coli J-5. Due to the lack of a functional UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (ΔgalE mutant) (10Elbein A.D. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1919-1925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this strain is unable to incorporate galactose into its LPS and therefore produces a truncated LPS consisting of several glycoforms (Fig. 1). The cross-reactivity was therefore attributed to a common epitope located in the inner core region of these LPS (9Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schuetze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS preparations are heterogenous and there are no methods available for the separation of acylated LPS into homogeneous compounds due to their amphiphilic nature. For this reason, the exact epitope of WN1 222-5 could not be determined using LPS. We have therefore developed methods for the deacylation of these molecules under conditions that do not cleave glycosidic bonds (11Holst O. Müller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the purification of LPS oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are then amenable to a detailed structural characterization and conjugation to proteins (12Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4514-4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Müller-Loennies S. Grimmecke D. Brade L. Lindner B. Kosma P. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 295-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For J-5 LPS, five different oligosaccharides, which differ in their carbohydrate structures and phosphate substitution (Fig. 1), were obtained by deacylation under strong alkaline conditions (14Müller-Loennies S.

Minor differences in the inner core structures relate to the substitution of the side chain heptose with GlcpN and the concomitant lack of phosphate on the branched heptose residue. Major structural differences between the core types are observed in the outer core region. Identical inner core structures have been described for Shigella species (2Holst O. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). Using a panel of highly purified oligosaccharides from Salmonella enterica sv. Minnesota (R1), E. coli F470 (R1 core-type), E. coli F576 (R2 core-type), E. coli F653 (R3 core-type), E. coli F2513 (R4 core-type), and E. coli J-5, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we have determined the minimal epitope that is recognized by mAb WN1 222-5 by ELISA, ELISA inhibition, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and studied the influence of the outer core on the binding of WN1 222-5 to enterobacterial LPS.

Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were cultivated, and LPS was extracted from each. Briefly, LPS was isolated by phenol/chloroform/petrolether extraction (18Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) and de-O-acylated by mild hydrazinolysis, followed by de-N-acylation under strong alkaline conditions (4 m KOH, 120 °C, 16 h) (11Holst O. Müller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After 3-fold extraction with chloroform, the mixture of deacylated oligosaccharides was separated by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) as reported (14Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Vinogradov E.V. Van Der D.K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Meshkov S. Brade H. Holst O. Eur. J.

Pure oligosaccharides were then desalted by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-10 in 10 mm NH4HCO3, followed by lyophilization. Deamination of E. coli J-5 LPS—LPS isolated from E. coli J-5 was subjected to a deamination reaction as described by Vinogradov et al. (19Vinogradov E. Cedzynski M. Ziolkowski A. Swierzko A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One ml of acetic acid and 200 mg of NaNO2 were added to 200 mg of LPS in 10 ml of water, and after a 12-h incubation at ambient temperature, the deaminated LPS was collected by centrifugation (4 h, 4 °C, 120,000 × g). The precipitate was dissolved in water and dialyzed against deionized water (3× 1 liter, 4 °C) and lyophilized (yield: 149 mg). An aliquot (50 mg) was then de-O- and de-N-acylated, yielding four oligosaccharides, which were isolated by semipreparative HPAEC and gel filtration as described above (oligosaccharide (OS) 1, 4.2 mg; OS 2, 1.8 mg; OS 3, 2.3 mg; OS 4, 0.8 mg). Neoglycoconjugates—Neoglycoconjugates of deacylated oligosaccharides were prepared as described (20Brade L. Brunnemann H. Ernst M. Fu Y. Holst O. Kosma P. Naher H. Persson K. Brade H. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 8: 27-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ligands (2.5 mg) were dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.2; glutardialdehyde (25%, electron microscopy grade; Merck) was added (1% final concentration); and the sample was stirred for 4 h at 25 °C under N2 atmosphere. Excess glutardialdehyde was removed by lyophilization, and the samples were redissolved in 200 μl of water. BSA (2.5 mg) was added from a 10 mg ml–1 solution in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 25 °C. Finally, 250 μg of NaBH4 was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark followed by dialysis against water once and three times against PBS, pH 7.2. mAb WN1 222-5—The generation and selection of mAb WN1 222-5 has been described in detail previously (9Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schuetze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of affinity purified mAb were kept at–20 °C in aliquots (1 mg ml–1). ELISA—Binding of mAb WN1 222-5 to the neoglycoconjugates was determined by ELISA. Varying amounts of glycoconjugates were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Maxisorb) and tested against serial dilutions of antibody. Antibody binding was detected with enzyme-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and substrate and measured photometrically at 405 nm. Experiments were done in quadruplicate, and mean values were calculated. Confidence values did not exceed 10%. Binding of the mAb WN1 222-5 to fully acylated LPS was determined using LPS as a solid phase antigen instead of neoglycoconjugates (21Müller-Loennies S. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1237-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For ELISA inhibition, serial dilutions of inhibitor in PBS-Tween 20/casein/BSA (30 μl) were mixed in V-shaped microtiter plates (NUNC) with an equal volume of antibody diluted in the same buffer to give an A 405 of 1.0 without the addition of inhibitor. After incubation (15 min, 37 °C), 50 μl of the mixture were added to antigen-coated ELISA plates. Further steps were as described above. All measurements were done at least twice in duplicate with confidence values not exceeding 20%. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Analyses were performed with a BIA-CORE 3000 instrument (Biacore, Inc.). WN1 222-5 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) at a surface density of ∼20,000 RU using the amine coupling kit from Biacore. Analyses were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20, and 150 mm or 300 mm NaCl. Surface regeneration was not necessary. Data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore). Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—Microcalorimetric experiments were performed on an MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). mAb WN1 222-5 was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.2, and the concentration was determined by UV measurement (1 mg ml–1 = A 280 of 1.35). The mAb concentration was adjusted to 7.55 μm, assuming a molecular mass of 150 kDa, and the microcalorimeter cell was filled with the antibody solution (volume = 1.3 ml). Purified and desalted deacylated LPS oligosaccharide were dissolved at a concentration of 0.35 mm in dialysis buffer and loaded into the syringe of the microcalorimeter. Both solutions were thoroughly degassed prior to loading. After temperature equilibration, the ligand was injected into the cell in 5-μl portions, and the evolved heat was measured with the first injection not considered for data analysis. A total of 20 injections were performed with 5-min equilibration times between injections. Data were corrected for heat of dilution by measuring the same number of buffer injections and subtraction from the sample data set. Dissociation constants were determined using the MicroCal Origin version 2.9 analysis software and the model of 1 set of binding sites. The antibody concentration in the cell was corrected after the curve fitting as described in the ITC Data Analysis in the Origin Version 2.9 manual provided by the manufacturer. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance— 1H (600.12 MHz), 13C (150.13 MHz), and 31P (242.13 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX Avance spectrometer with a 4-mg sample in 0.5 ml of D2O. Acetone (2.225 ppm) (1H) and dioxane (67.4 ppm) (13C) served as references. All spectra were run at a temperature of 300 K. One-dimensional 1H, 13C, and 31P and two-dimensional homonuclear 1H,1H (DQF-COSY, NOESY, TOCSY), heteronuclear 1H,13C, and 1H,31P NMR correlation spectra (HMQC) were recorded using Bruker standard pulse programs and analyzed with Bruker Xwinnmr software.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5982-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), purification of oligosaccharides, and characterization of the chemical structures has been described in the respective publications. S. enterica sv. Minnesota LPS was isolated as described (17Olsthoorn M.M. Petersen B.O. Schlecht S. Haverkamp J. Bock K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and treated according to the same procedure as the other LPS. The chemical structures are depicted in Fig. 2. Deacylation of LPS from E. coli J-5 yielded five oligosaccharides (Fig. 1), which differed in their carbohydrate structure and phosphate substitution (14Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have prepared an additional oligosaccharide from E. coli J-5 by deamination of LPS and subsequent deacylation under strong alkaline conditions that lacked phosphate at the branched heptose and was devoid of GlcpN on the side chain heptose. E. coli J-5 does not naturally produce such an oligosaccharide. Analysis by analytical HPAEC (Fig. 3A) revealed retention times of 25.7, 27.7, 35.0, and 37.3 min for oligosaccharides 1–4, respectively. Oligosaccharides 2–4 possessed identical retention times to those of deacylated E. coli J-5 LPS without deamination (Fig. 3B). From previous studies, it was known that these are heptasaccharide P 3 (Fig. 3, OS 2), octasaccharide P 4 (OS 3), and heptasaccharide P 4 (OS 4). This was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the purified oligosaccharides. There was no signal at a retention time of nonasaccharide P 3 (18.7 min, OS 5) after deamination, and a new peak appeared at 25.7 min (OS 1). A 1H NMR spectrum of the latter compound (Fig. 4) contained six signals of anomeric protons and two pairs of signals of deoxyprotons, indicating the presence of two Kdo residues. Comparison with the 1H NMR spectrum of nonasaccharide P 3 of deacylated E. coli J-5 LPS indicated that the side chain GlcpN was missing. This was finally proven by the assignment of all 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts (Table I), determination of coupling constants by 1H,1H DQF-COSY, and nuclear Overhauser effect NMR experiments. Thus, this oligosaccharide had the same carbohydrate structure as octasaccharide P 4 (Fig. 1). However, the upfield resonance frequencies of proton H-4 and carbon C-4 of the second heptose residue indicated that this position was not substituted with phosphate (Fig. 1). The 31P NMR spectrum accordingly contained only three resonances (Fig. 5) with chemical shifts of –1.41, 0.54, and 1.60 ppm. Therefore, this oligosaccharide, designated octasaccharide 1 P 3, contained only three phosphate residues, and a 1H,31P HMQC-COSY NMR experiment proved that the phosphate at the 4-position of the second heptose (residue F in Fig. 4) was absent as in nonasaccharide P 3.Fig. 4A, 1H NMR spectrum of octasaccharide 1 P3 obtained after deamination and deacylation of E. coli J-5 LPS. Six signals of anomeric protons originating from anomeric protons as indicated (labeling of residues as in the structure depicted) and two pairs of signals from deoxyprotons of Kdo residues (residues C and D) identified the isolated oligosaccharide as an octasaccharide. B, the region of anomeric protons of nonasaccharide P 3 (top) in comparison with octasaccharide 1 P 3 (bottom) did contain a signal of an additional GlcpN residue (marked by an arrow), which was absent in octasaccharide P 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I1H and 13C NMR chemical shift data for octasaccharide 1 P3 obtained by deamination and deacylation of E. coli J-5 LPSResidueChemical shiftH-1H-2H-3axH-3eqH-4H-5H-6aH-6bH-7aH-7bH-8aH-8bC-1C-2C-3C-4C-5C-6C-7C-8PPMA →6-αGlcN 1P5.6853.4303.9063.6124.1163.7684.29091.6654.7469.8469.9272.9670.03B →6-βGlcN 4P4.8403.0983.8713.8153.7433.4533.67599.7255.9772.3374.8274.2962.78C →4,5-αKdo1.9342.1254.1264.2583.6963.8443.8973.605NDaND, not determined.ND34.7870.9070.0372.6970.0364.14D αKdo1.7772.1254.1074.0293.6493.9933.9473.746NDND35.2866.3467.0072.6970.4363.63E →3-αHep 4P5.2824.0644.1574.4274.2044.0963.6723.73199.5571.2777.2870.6672.8069.4863.43F →3,7-αHep5.1274.3554.0164.0183.6924.1693.72-3.753.72-3.75102.7069.9578.9766.1072.6768.6470.76G →3-αGlc5.2403.5313.7803.3973.8473.9033.746100.7772.2173.3470.1072.5560.88H →7αHep4.9163.9853.8553.8603.6394.0103.6723.725101.4370.4171.0066.5871.9869.4063.51a ND, not determined.

The minimal LPS structure bound by WN1 222-5 was the LPS of the rough mutant strain E. coli J-5. To verify this reactivity by ELISA, we first immobilized LPS of E. coli core types R1 to R4 and S. enterica sv. Minnesota on microtiter plates and investigated their reactivity with mAb WN1 222-5 (Fig. 6A). The antibody reacted with all of these LPS. We then investigated whether the lipid A was important for the binding and studied the inhibitory activities of deacylated LPS oligosaccharides by ELISA inhibition. When LPS was treated with mild acid, the mixture of E. coli R3 deacylated LPS oligosaccharides did not show any inhibitory activity up to the concentration tested (5 μg/well; see Table III). On the contrary, oligosaccharides from the same LPS obtained by deacylation under alkaline conditions, which retained the lipid A backbone sugars and the side chain Kdo substitution, possessed inhibitory activity (50% inhibition at 20 ng/well). Therefore, fatty acids did not influence the binding and were not part of the WN1 222-5 epitope. As can be seen in Fig. 6B, mAb WN1 222-5 bound to all tested BSA-neoglycoconjugates of E. coli LPS obtained after alkaline deacylation to the same extent as to LPS. All further experiments were therefore done with oligosaccharides obtained after alkaline deacylation.Table IIIDetermination of inhibitory concentrations of deacylated enterobacterial LPS oligosaccharides with WN1 222–5 by ELISA inhibitionInhibitoraFor structures of inhibitors see Figs. 1 and 2; E. coli R3 OS 1 and OS 2 refer to the core oligosaccharides without and with GlcpN on the side chain heptose, respectively.

To achieve this, Ski has been proposed to recruit the corepressor N-CoR to either the TGF-β-regulated Smad transcription factors or nuclear receptors. Here we define the role of the Ski/N-CoR interaction in Ski-mediated repression of TGF-β and vitamin D signaling. We show that Ski can negatively regulate vitamin D-mediated transcription by directly interacting with the vitamin D receptor. More importantly, a Ski single point mutant lacking N-CoR binding revealed that the Ski/N-CoR interaction is essential for repression of vitamin D signaling, but, surprisingly, not TGF-β signaling. Thus, Ski modulates transcription in either an N-CoR-dependent or -independent manner depending on the signaling pathways targeted."

https://openalex.org/W2033790867,"Laminar flow arrests vascular endothelial cells at the G0/G1 phase with concurrent increase in p53 and p21Waf1. We investigated the molecular mechanism by which laminar flow activates p53 and p21Waf1 in endothelial cells. The application of a laminar flow (12 dyn/cm2) increased the deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373 of p53 and the acetylation at Lys-382 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Laminar flow increased the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the association of p53 with HDAC1. Treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells with trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor, abolished the flow-induced p53 deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373. To investigate the role of the HDAC-deacetylated p53 in the flow activation of p21Waf1, we found that TSA inhibited the activation at both the mRNA and protein levels. Deletion and mutation analyses of the p21Waf1 promoter revealed that flow activated p21Waf1 through p53 and TSA abrogated this p53-dependent activation. The expression plasmid encoding the p53 mutant, with Lys-320 and Lys-373 replaced by Arg, increased the activity of the co-transfected p21Waf1 promoter, which demonstrates that HDAC-deacetylated p53 can transactivate the p21Waf1 gene. The regulation of the p53-p21Waf1 pathway by laminar flow was further supported by observations that flow caused an increase of p21Waf1 level in the wild-type HCT116 (p53+/+) cells but not in the p53-null HCT116 cells.

By controlling cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, the p53 tumor suppressor plays a critical role in cell proliferation (see Refs. 1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar and 2Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 9-12Google Scholar for review). p53 exerts its functions by activating or repressing the transcription of target genes, including p21Waf1, GADD45, Bax, and MDM2, whose gene products are required either to regulate cell cycle progression or to modulate the function of p53. Several distinct functional domains within p53 have been characterized: an N-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 1–43), a central domain that binds specific DNA sequences (amino acids 100–300), the C-terminal tetramerization domain (amino acids 320–360), and a regulatory domain (amino acids 363–393). p53 activity is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications. The phosphorylation at Ser-6, Ser-9, Ser-15, Ser-20, Ser-33, Ser-37, Ser-46, Thr-18, and Thr-81 in the N-terminal leads to the stabilization of the p53 protein (see Ref. 3Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Google Scholar for review). Phosphorylation at Ser-315 and Ser-392 and the sumoylation at Lys-386 are believed to enhance the binding of p53 to DNA and to elevate p53 transcriptional activity (4Liu L. Scolnik D.M. Trievel R.C.

In response to genotoxic stresses such as UV irradiation, γ-irradiation, and DNA damage agents, p53 is also acetylated at multiple Lys residues (see Ref. 9Prives C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Google Scholar for review). The acetylation of Lys is mediated by two distinct classes of histone acetyltransferase. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP 1The abbreviations used are: CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; PCAF, CBP/p300-associated factor; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; EC, endothelial cell; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; TSA, trichostatin A; Luc, luciferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; PCAF, CBP/p300-associated factor; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; EC, endothelial cell; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; TSA, trichostatin A; Luc, luciferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody.)/p300 acetylates Lys-382 and, to a lesser extent, Lys-373 and Lys-381, whereas CBP/p300-associated factor (PCAF) acetylates Lys-320. The functional consequences of p53 acetylation are still not clearly defined. Both CBP/p300 and PCAF can increase the p53-mediated p21Waf1 gene expression in vivo (4Liu L. Scolnik D.M. Trievel R.C.

It has been shown that the acetylation of p53 can increase its DNA binding activity to short DNA sequences in vitro but seems to exert little effect on its binding to long DNA sequences or chromatin DNA (11Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar). p53 is deacetylated by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or Sir2 (12Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Google Scholar, 13Luo J.

Blood flow acts on the vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which play a crucial role in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology (see Ref. 18Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Google Scholar for review). The shear forces result from local blood flow patterns, depending upon the vessel geometry. The regions under laminar flow (i.e. the straight parts of the arterial tree) have been found to be resistant to atherosclerosis, whereas disturbed flow regions at the bends and bifurcations are prone to lesion development (see Ref. 19Wissler R.W. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1995; : S29-S36Google Scholar for review). The results of in vitro experiments using flow channels have demonstrated that laminar flow protects ECs from apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and angiotensin II (20Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Rippmann V. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 71-74Google Scholar, 21Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Google Scholar). We and others have shown that laminar flow suppresses the transition from the G1 to S phase and that this is associated with an increase in the expression of p21Waf1 at mRNA and protein levels (22Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y. Li Y.S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9385-9389Google Scholar, 23Akimoto S. Mitsumata M. Sasaguri T. Yoshida Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 185-190Google Scholar). These changes are accompanied by decreases in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and in the activities of cdk2 and cdk4. In view of the importance of p53 and p21Waf1 in cell cycle regulation and flow-induced changes in EC biology, we investigated the mechanisms by which laminar flow regulates p53 and p21Waf1 in ECs. Our results revealed that Lys residues of p53 are differently regulated. Laminar flow leads to an increase in acetylation at Lys-382 but a deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373. This unique pattern of p53 deacetylation contributes, at least in part, to the activation of p21Waf1. These results provide new insights into the roles of p53 in regulating EC functions. Cell Culture and Stimulation by Laminar Flow or UV Irradiation— Bovine aortic ECs (BAECs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were maintained in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 μg/ml thymidine, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 5 ng/ml EC growth factor, and 15% fetal bovine serum. The p53-null human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116p53–/– and its parental wild-type HCT116p53+/+ were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For laminar flow experiments, BAECs or HUVECs were cultured on collagen-coated glass slides (38 × 76 mm). The cells were exposed to a laminar flow generated by the pressure difference between the upper and lower reservoirs, with the effluent tissue culture medium circulated back to the upper reservoir through a peristaltic pump. The shear stress, determined by the flow rate and the channel dimensions, was 12 dyn/cm2, which is comparable with the physiological range in human major arteries and has been found to increase the amount of p53 (22Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y. Li Y.S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9385-9389Google Scholar). The pH was kept by gassing the flow system with a mixture of 95% air, 5% CO2, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C. Static controls were cells cultured on slides not exposed to flow. For the UV irradiation experiments, HUVECs were exposed to 100 J/m2 UV irradiation after the medium was removed. Fresh culture media were replenished to the irradiated cells for different lengths of time as indicated. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—p53K320R/K373R encoding a mutant p53 was constructed by the use of PCR-based mutagenesis with pcDNA1.1-p53 (24Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler H.P. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Google Scholar) as the template for Arg replacement of Lys-320, Lys-321, Lys-372, and Lys-373. The –2290 to +8 fragment of the p21Waf1 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR using a primer set of 5′-atcggtacccagcaggctgtggctctg-3′ and 5′-atcctcgagccctcagctggcgcagc-3′. The amplified fragment was then cloned into the KpnI/XhoI site of the pGL2-basic vector to create plasmid p21-Luc-2290 that contains both the p53 consensus element (–2255 to –2232) and Sp1/Sp3 sites (–50 to 150). p21-Luc-1190, p21-Luc-33, and p21/CE-Luc-33 were created from p21-luc-2290 by deleting the respective fragments of 1.1 kb (–2290 to –1190), 2.26 kb (–2290 to –34) and 2.24 kb (–2233 to –34). p21-Luc-1190 contains only Sp1/Sp3 sites, whereas p21-Luc-33 contains a TATA box with neither p53 element nor Sp1/Sp3 sites. p21/CE-Luc-33 contains only a p53 consensus element. The various DNA plasmids were transfected into BAECs at 70% confluency using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). A total of 100 ng of Renilla Luc plasmid was included for transfection efficiency. 12 h after transfection, the cells were passed onto glass slides and cultured for another 12 h before the flow experiments. The firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity were detected by use of standard protocols. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in TNEN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-Leu-Leunorleucine-CHO (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Le Roche, Palo Alto, CA). Two micrograms of rabbit anti-p53FL, recognizing amino acids 1–392 of p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-Ace-K320, or rabbit anti-Ace-K373 (Upstate Biotech, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), together with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads, were added to 500 μg of lysates for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed and separated by SDS-PAGE. After being transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with the detecting antibodies in TTBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The antibodies used were anti-p53 DO1 mAb, recognizing amino acids 11–25 of p53, anti-HDAC1 mAb, anti-p21Waf1 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-Ace-K382 (Upstate Biotech). The bound primary antibodies were detected with the use of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). HDAC Activity Assay—Histone deacetylase activity was determined by using the histone deacetylase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). In brief, biotinylated histone H4 peptide was acetylated by PCAF with [3H]Acetyl CoA (Amersham Biosciences) and captured by avidinagarose beads. The cells were lysed by sonication in TNE buffer (TNEN buffer without Nonidet P-40), and 50 μg of the lysates were added to 200 μl of a reaction solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 × 104 cpm [H3]acetyl-histone peptide, with or without 50 mm sodium butyrate. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature on an orbital shaker for 12 h. A total of 50 μl of a quenching solution was added to stop the reaction, and the released [H3]acetate was separated from the H4 peptide beads by centrifugation. The HDAC activity was then determined by radioisotope counting of the supernatant. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizole reagents (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of RNA from each sample was separated by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. After being transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and the hybridized bands were visualized by autoradiography. Laminar Flow Deacetylates Lys-320 and Lys-373 of p53—By using antibodies recognizing acetylated Lys-320, Lys-373, or Lys-382, we investigated the effect of laminar flow on the acetylation of p53. In HUVECs subjected to laminar flow (12 dyn/cm2), there was decreased acetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373 and sustained increase in acetylation at Lys-382 (Fig. 1A). In positive control experiments, UV irradiation (100 J/m2) caused an increase in acetylation at Lys-320, Lys-373, and Lys-382. (Fig. 1B). Both laminar flow and UV irradiation increased the level of p53, as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-p53 DO1 mAb. Normalization of the amount of acetylated Lys to that of p53 confirmed that laminar flow deacetylated Lys-320 and Lys-373 but increased the acetylation of Lys-382. In contrast, UV irradiation increased the acetylation of all three Lys residues. Thus, laminar flow and UV irradiation impose different patterns of acetylation on p53. p53 Deacetylation in Response to Laminar Flow Is Mediated by HDAC—Because p53 is a substrate of HDAC, we investigated the changes of HDAC activity in response to laminar flow and UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 2A, laminar flow increased the HDAC activity in HUVECs as early as 2 h and was sustained for at least 8 h. In contrast, UV irradiation had little effect on HDAC activity. To test whether the flow-induced increase in HDAC activity was associated with p53, we studied the effect of laminar flow on the HDAC1-p53 association and on HDAC activity in anti-p53 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 2B, the application of laminar flow for 4 h increased the amount of HDAC1 co-immunoprecipitated with p53, which reveals an increased association of HDAC1 and p53. Furthermore, the HDAC activity in the immunoprecipitates pulled down by anti-p53 from cells that had been exposed to laminar flow was four times higher than that in static controls, indicating that the p53-associated HDAC was activated by laminar flow (Fig. 2C). To confirm the flow-activated HDAC, we also examined the effect of trichostatin A (TSA), a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC, on the flow-induced deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373. TSA abolished the flow-increased HDAC activity seen in HUVECs treated with Me2SO, the vehicle control (Fig. 3A). TSA treatment also abolished the flow-induced deacetylation of p53 at Lys-320 and Lys-373 (Fig. 3B). Laminar Flow Induction of p21Waf1 Depends on HDAC— p21Waf1, a downstream effector of p53, is up-regulated in ECs exposed to laminar flow (22Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y. Li Y.S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9385-9389Google Scholar, 23Akimoto S. Mitsumata M. Sasaguri T. Yoshida Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 185-190Google Scholar). To correlate the HDAC activity with the flow-induced p21Waf1, we examined the effect of TSA on the flow regulation of p21Waf1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Results of Northern blotting revealed that laminar flow induced the level of p21Waf1 mRNA in HUVECs by 3.1 ± 0.3-fold (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells with TSA under static conditions up-regulated p21Waf1 mRNA by 3.3 ± 0.5-fold, which was consistent with the positive effect of TSA on p21Waf1 in ECs, gastric carcinoma cells, and NIH3T3 cells (25Rössig L. Li H. Fisslthaler B. Urbich C. Fleming I. Förstermann U. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 837-844Google Scholar, 26Suzuki T. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Hayashi K. Naka K. Ono S. Ishikawa T. Tahara E. Yasui W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 992-997Google Scholar, 27Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Google Scholar). However, the application of laminar flow to TSA-treated cells did not cause any further increase in the level of p21Waf1 mRNA. Immunoblotting revealed the same pattern of p21Waf1 regulation by laminar flow, TSA, and a combination in which TSA treatment was followed by flow (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4 indicates that TSA pretreatment abolished the flow-enhanced expression of p21Waf1 as a result of the inhibition of HDAC-deacetylated p53. The Induction of p21Waf1 by Laminar Flow Is p53-dependent—Because TSA could induce p21Waf1 under static conditions but inhibited the flow-induced p21Waf1, we manipulated the sites in the p21Waf1 promoter constructs that respond to p53 and TSA to reinforce the observation that distinct mechanisms are involved in the induction of p21Waf1 by laminar flow and by TSA. Compared with Me2SO treatment, both laminar flow and TSA induced the luciferase activity of p21-Luc-2290, in which the luciferase reporter is driven by the 2.3-kb promoter region of the p21Waf1 gene, by 4.5 ± 0.8 and 5.5 ± 0.5-fold, respectively. However, the promoter activity induced by TSA was not further increased by laminar flow (Fig. 5A). Deletion of the N-terminal 1.1 kb that contains the p53-binding site abolished the flow-induced but not the TSA-induced luciferase activity. Further deletion of the Sp1/Sp3 site, which resulted in the –33 to +1 fragment containing only the TATA box of the p21Waf1 promoter, diminished the response to both flow and TSA. Insertion of the sequence aggaacatgtcccaacatgttgag (e.g. the p53 target site) immediately upstream of the –33 to +1 fragment restored the induction of luciferase activity by flow but not by TSA. More importantly, TSA treatment abolished this p53-dependent induction by laminar flow. To test further the molecular mechanism by which the HDAC1-p53 pathway regulates the transcription of p21Waf1, the expression plasmid p53K320R/K373R was created to encode a p53 mutant in which Lys-320/321 and Lys-372/373 were replaced by Arg. Such a replacement would mimic the deacetylation of these two residues by laminar flow. As shown in Fig. 5B, cells co-transfected with the wild-type p53 expression plasmid showed increased luciferase activity of p21-Luc-2290 by 30 ± 2-fold compared with cells co-transfected with pCDNA3. Co-transfection of p53K320R/K373R further increased the induction of the p21Waf1 promoter (42 ± 5-fold), which indicates the effect of p53 deacetylation on the activation of p21Waf1. Together, Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that the laminar flow induction of p21Waf1 in ECs depends on the HDAC deacetylation of p53 at Lys-320 and Lys-373. By using HCT116p53+/+ cells and its isogenic p53-null cells, we explored further whether p53 is necessary for the laminar flow induction of p21Waf1. The application of laminar flow augmented p21Waf1 in HCT116p53+/+ cells but not in HCT116p53–/– cells (Fig. 6). In separate experiments, p21Waf1 was induced by TSA in both cell types. These results indicate that p53 is necessary for the activation of p21Waf1 by laminar flow but not by TSA. Laminar flow increases p53 and p21Waf1 in ECs, which is associated with the arrest of cells in the G1 to S phase transition (22Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y. Li Y.S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9385-9389Google Scholar, 23Akimoto S. Mitsumata M. Sasaguri T. Yoshida Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 185-190Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that laminar flow-induced HDAC can cause the specific deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373 of p53, which leads to the up-regulation of p21Waf1. Previous studies have shown that p53 is acetylated at Lys-320, Lys-373, and Lys-382 in response to genotoxic stresses, including etoposide, a DNA-damaging agent, as well as ionizing and UV irradiation (4Liu L. Scolnik D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Google Scholar, 28Nagashima M. Shiseki M. Miura K. Hagiwara K. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Wang X.W. Yokota J. Riabowol K. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9671-9676Google Scholar). Our data show that laminar flow causes p53 deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373 but acetylation at Lys-382 (Fig. 1A). HDACs are involved in these deacetylation responses, because (a) laminar flow increases the association of p53 with HDAC1 and (b) the p53-associated HDAC1 has an elevated histone deacetylase activity (Fig. 2). The deacetylation of Lys-320 and Lys-373 by HDAC is further supported by the abrogation of deacetylation when TSA is included in flow experiments (Fig. 3B). HDAC2 and HDAC3 also belong to the class I HDAC family, as does HDAC1 (29De Ruijter A.J. Van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. Van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Google Scholar). Because HDAC2 and HDAC3 can also interact with p53 in vitro and in vivo to regulate its activity through deacetylation (15Juan L.J. Shia W.J. Chen M.H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20436-20443Google Scholar), laminar flow may also activate HDAC2 and HDAC3. Interestingly, laminar flow increases Lys-382 acetylation but deacetylates Lys-320 and Lys-373 through the flow-activated HDAC. This pattern of changes in p53 acetylation is different from that induced by UV irradiation, which acetylates p53 at all three sites in ECs (Fig. 1B). CBP/p300 acetylates Lys-382 and to a lesser extent Lys-373, whereas PCAF acetylates Lys-320. One possible explanation for the flow-induced Lys-382 acetylation is that laminar flow also activates the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 to cause this change. Does laminar flow activate PCAF, and if so, why does HDAC override PCAF but not CBP/p300? Furthermore, why does CBP/p300 acetylate Lys-382 but not Lys-373, as laminar flow causes Lys-320 and Lys-373 deacetylation? In principle, the acetylation of transcription factors by CBP/p300 and/or PCAF facilitates their access to target genes to activate their expression. In contrast, by removing the acetyl residues from histone, HDAC down-regulates the gene expression. The acetylation status of p53 would be a result of the homeostatic balance between histone acetyltransferases and HDACs (30Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 22: 475-487Google Scholar). It is likely that laminar flow renders a specific conformation of p53 that increases or hinders its access to HDAC, CBP/p300, and PCAF to cause a unique deacetylation/acetylation pattern. Such exquisite regulations may require the coordinated effects of histone acetyltransferase and HDAC on p53. Several previous studies suggested a positive correlation between p53 acetylation and p21Waf1 expression. Genotoxic stresses or TSA increase both p53 acetylation and p21Waf1 activation (9Prives C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Google Scholar). The overexpression of HDAC1 or PID decreases the p53 transactivation of p21Waf1 (13Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Google Scholar, 15Juan L.J. Shia W.J. Chen M.H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20436-20443Google Scholar, 16Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Google Scholar). How p53 acetylation affects p21Waf1 transcription is still unclear. A p53 mutant with Lys-320, Lys-373, or Lys-382 substituted by Arg decreases the activity of the co-transfected p21Waf1 promoter construct in Saos-2 cells (4Liu L. Scolnik D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Google Scholar), which suggests that p53 deacetylation at a single Lys residue decreases the p21Waf1 transcription. However, replacement of Lys-320, Lys-373, Lys-381, or Lys-382, or all four sites, with Ala, which is a manipulation that mimics sustained acetylation, has little effect on the level of p21Waf1, although such mutations increase the DNA binding activity of the mutated p53 in vitro (31Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate for the first time that p53 deacetylation at Lys-320 and Lys-373 can activate p21Waf1 (Fig. 5B). When TSA was included in flow experiments, the p53 deacetylation by HDAC was abrogated. Accordingly, the induction of p21Waf1 was attenuated (Figs. 3 and 5A). These results suggest that the deacetylation of p53 at these two Lys residues is necessary for the induction of p21Waf1 by flow. Although deacetylation (Lys-320 and Lys-373) and acetylation (Lys-382) are concurrent in response to laminar flow, p53 can also undergo phosphorylation at Ser-15 and Ser-20 (data not shown). It is likely that a synergistic effect resulting from the intricate coordination of acetylation, deacetylation, and phosphorylation mediates the activation of p21Waf1. Such a synergy is reminiscent of the modulation of p53 acetylation at Lys-382 by phosphorylation at Ser-33 and Ser-37 in response to DNA damage (32Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Google Scholar). Both p53-dependent and -independent pathways have been reported to regulate the transcription of p21Waf1. In addition to the p53 consensus element, several Sp1 and Sp3 binding sites exist in the promoter region of the p21Waf1 gene. By inhibiting HDAC to increase p53 acetylation, TSA activates the expression of p21Waf1 through Sp1/Sp3 in a p53-independent manner (26Suzuki T. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Hayashi K. Naka K. Ono S. Ishikawa T. Tahara E. Yasui W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 992-997Google Scholar, 27Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Google Scholar, 33Sowa Y. Orita T. Hiranabe-Minamikawa S. Nakano K. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 195-199Google Scholar). Laminar flow activates only the p21Waf1 promoter constructs with a functional p53 consensus element (Fig. 5A). In contrast, TSA induction of the p21Waf1 promoter in ECs is mediated through the Sp1/Sp3 sites. Accordingly, laminar flow and TSA activate the p21Waf1 gene through distinct mechanisms. This notion is further supported by the induction of p21Waf1 by laminar flow in HCT116p53+/+ cells but not their p53-null counterparts (Fig. 6). p53-dependent p21Waf1 expression has been observed in the HCT116 cell system in response to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase perturbation or doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging drug (34Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Google Scholar, 35Blagosklonny M.V. Robey R. Bates S. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 533-539Google Scholar). The lack of p21Waf1 in HCT116/p21–/– cells has been linked to the increased sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis induced by anti-cancer drugs (36Javelaud D. Besancon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37949-37954Google Scholar, 37Han Z. Wei W. Dunaway S. Darnowski J.W. Calabresi P. Sedivy J. Hendrickson E.A. Balan K.V. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17154-17160Google Scholar), yet the G1 arrest was completely abrogated in response to DNA damage (38Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190Google Scholar). Thus, the p53-dependent p21Waf1 expression may have dual functions depending upon the types of cells and the stimuli they receive; although the p53-dependent p21Waf1 expression arrests cells in G1/G0, it would also protect the cells from apoptosis. The ECs at the straight part of the arterial tree are quiescent, whereas ECs at branch points have an accelerated mitotic rate (39Lin S.J. Jan K.M. Weinbaum S. Chien S. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 230-236Google Scholar). Undisturbed versus disturbed flows associated with vascular geometry have been suggested to play an important role in regulating EC cycle progression. The physiological implication of the current study is that laminar flow, by preventing EC mitosis, can minimize the lipoprotein permeability through the EC junction at the straight part of the vessel. A recent study by Rössig et al. (25Rössig L. Li H. Fisslthaler B. Urbich C. Fleming I. Förstermann U. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 837-844Google Scholar) demonstrates that inhibition of HDAC activity is associated with an attenuated expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in ECs, as well as impaired vasorelaxation. Thus, the laminar flow-increased HDAC activity may also contribute to an optimal level of eNOS expression. Physiological levels of laminar flow not only arrest the EC cell cycle and increase vessel relaxation but also prevent apoptosis of ECs in response to a variety of stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and angiotensin II (20Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Rippmann V. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 71-74Google Scholar, 21Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Google Scholar). Hence, another possible functional consequence of the p21Waf1 up-regulation by the deacetylated p53 is to protect ECs from apoptosis. This possibility is supported by the finding that TSA inhibition of HDAC induces the apoptosis of several cell types such as Huh-7 hepatoma cells and MKN-7 gastric carcinoma cells (26Suzuki T. Yokozaki H. Kuniyasu H. Hayashi K. Naka K. Ono S. Ishikawa T. Tahara E. Yasui W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 992-997Google Scholar, 40Yamashita Y. Shimada M. Harimoto N. Rikimaru T. Shirabe K. Tanaka S. Sugimachi K. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 572-576Google Scholar). In line with this concept, we found that the UV-induced apoptosis in ECs transfected with p53K320R/K373R was 50% lower than in cells transfected with the wild-type p53 (data not shown). Through the HDAC1-p53-p21Waf1 pathway, laminar flow-generated mechanotransduction and signaling can arrest ECs at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle while preventing apoptosis, which would be beneficial to vascular homeostasis. We thank Dr. Laurie Owen-Schaub (Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California, Riverside) for fruitful discussions."

Our studies of Trp330 provide the first detailed examination of this conserved residue in the λ-integrase family, suggesting that the relative importance of active site residues may differ among Flp and related enzymes. Flp, the best characterized eukaryotic member of the λ-integrase or tyrosine-based family of site-specific recombinases, is a product of the 2-μm plasmid from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is responsible for maintaining the copy number of this plasmid in vivo (1Sadowski P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 53-91Google Scholar). Although many site-specific recombinases require co-factors for activity, Flp-mediated recombination is remarkably simple and requires only the enzyme and target DNA, which makes it a valuable genetic tool. The usefulness of Flp has been enhanced by the isolation of a variant of Flp (“Flpe”) that displays significantly more robust activity than WT 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; Taps, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. Flp at 37 °C (2Buchholz F. Angrand P.O. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 657-662Google Scholar). Although Flp shares many mechanistic and structural similarities with other recombinases and with type IB topoisomerases, in other aspects it is unique, such as in the assembly and regulation of its active site. It has thus been unclear to what extent the results of biochemical studies on other members of these families could be extrapolated to the Flp system. The reaction catalyzed by Flp and other tyrosine recombinases minimally requires four protein monomers and two DNA segments containing specific sequences recognized by the enzyme (Fig. 1a). The reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion, with only one strand of each duplex cleaved at a time. Thus, only two of the four protomers are active in each step of the reaction. For Flp, the required DNA site, named FRT (Flp recognition target), is made up of two 13-bp Flp-binding sequences inverted around an 8-bp spacer region, with a third nonessential Flp-binding site separated by 1 bp from the rest of the sequence. However, whereas most other enzymes in this family assemble the catalytic center in cis, using residues from one protomer, Flp uses a unique in trans mechanism, with its active site consisting of residues from two protomers (3Chen J.W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Google Scholar, 4Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Google Scholar). The α-helix (helix M) containing the catalytic tyrosine (Tyr343) is donated to an adjacent protomer and cleaves DNA in conjunction with the other active site residues provided by that protomer. Corresponding to half of the sites activity, only one DNA cleavage reaction takes place within an Flp dimer, two of which come together to form a synaptic complex. Each of the two exposed 5′-hydroxyl groups then attacks the phosphotyrosyl linkage in the other Flp dimer of the complex. The resulting Holliday junction intermediate can subsequently isomerize and activate the two protomers whose catalytic tyrosines were dormant during the first half of the reaction. These two tyrosines then engage in a second round of DNA cleavage and ligation reactions, ultimately yielding recombined products. Interestingly, structural and biochemical studies have shown significant differences in the mechanisms by which different recombinases control the activity of their catalytic sites (5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar, 6Kazmierczak R.A. Swalla B.M. Burgin A.B. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5193-5204Google Scholar, 7Tekle M.

The DNA relaxation reaction catalyzed by type IB topoisomerases also proceeds through a 3′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate, and the catalytic similarities between these two families of enzymes correspond to a conserved core structure that harbors the active site (10Sherratt D.J.

Despite low sequence homology among these proteins, the secondary and tertiary structures of their catalytic domains are strikingly similar, and they probably share a common ancestor (10Sherratt D.J.

For example, the topoisomerases act as monomers, whereas the recombinases act as tetramers, and Flp differs from other members of both families in the trans assembly of its active site. The active sites of both families include, in addition to the nucleophilic tyrosine, five other highly conserved amino acid residues (reviewed in Refs. 23Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S.

Biol. 1992; 225: 643-649Google Scholar). The arginines presumably position the scissile phosphate and stabilize the build-up of negative charge in the transition state. The histidine (replaced by lysine in topoisomerases) is appropriately positioned in the Flp and Cre complex structures to act as the general base that accepts a proton from the attacking tyrosine, although mutagenesis data suggest that it is not essential (27Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3167-3175Google Scholar, 30Serre M.C. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 643-649Google Scholar, 31Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Google Scholar). 2Y. Chen and P. A. Rice, unpublished data. The lysine is essential for catalysis in other recombinases and has been shown to act as a general acid in the cleavage step in the vaccinia topoisomerase reaction, protonating the leaving 5′-hydroxyl group with the help of one of the arginines (8Van Duyne G. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 93-117Google Scholar, 32Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 118-148Google Scholar). The tryptophan is replaced by histidine in most related enzymes, although tryptophan is found at this position in Cre as well. The DNA complex structures of Cre and human topoisomerase I show that the side chain of this tryptophan/histidine forms a hydrogen bond with a nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate, whereas in Flp-DNA structures, Trp330 sometimes forms a hydrogen bond with the free 5′-OH in the active site. Mutation of the equivalent histidines to alanine in vaccinia topoisomerase (His265) and human topoisomerase I (His632) decreased the reaction rates substantially, whereas the effects of glutamine and asparagine replacements were less drastic (36Petersen B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Google Scholar, 37Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 677-685Google Scholar). Experiments on vaccinia virus topoisomerase using phosphorothioate-containing substrates showed that this histidine forms a catalytically important hydrogen bond to one of the nonbridging phosphate oxygens (38Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Google Scholar). All of these results supported a hypothesis that the key feature of the tryptophan/histidine is its ability to hydrogen-bond with DNA. However, this question had not been addressed experimentally in the tyrosine recombinases. To investigate the roles that Lys223 and Trp330 play in Flp-mediated recombination, mutagenesis and activity studies have been performed on these two residues in Flpe. Whereas our results confirmed the importance of Lys223, they also provided some surprising insights into the function of Trp330, indicating that it might be more important in maintaining a viable active site through its van der Waals interactions with neighboring amino acids rather than stabilizing a reaction intermediate through its hydrogen bonding capability. We confirmed this by determining the structure of the W330F protein complexed with DNA. Protein Cloning and Mutagenesis—In our experiments, Flpe was used as the WT Flp. A Flpe clone was constructed and kindly provided by Dr. Mike Cox. A C-terminal His6 tag plus a single glycine linker residue was added using PCR, and the tagged protein was recloned into pET24d vector. Point mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed kit from Stratagene, with the primers ordered from Operon. The results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—The protein was expressed and purified using a new method recently published (5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar). Two columns were used: a Talon column that bound the His tag and a DNA affinity column containing Flp-binding sequences. The whole purification process took only 1 day (beginning with frozen cell pellets), yielding an average of 1 mg of protein from 1 liter of cell culture. The protein was stored at –80 °C. It was later dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol and 1 m NaCl overnight and aliquoted before usage. The purification and dialysis were performed at 4 °C. DNA Recombination Assays—Plasmid pJFS39 was originally provided by Dr. Michael Cox (39Gates C.A. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4628-4632Google Scholar). It was amplified in DH5α cells and purified with Qiagen Miniprep kits. 15 pmol of SalI-digested pJFS39 plasmid was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Qiagen nucleotide removal kits were used to remove the enzyme and nucleotide afterward. The recombination assay was performed at 30 °C in a 10-μl reaction volume with 2 nm radioactively labeled SalI-cleaved pJFS39, 120 nm Flpe protein, 25 mm Taps (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 12% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of the DNA was calculated based on the assumption that no DNA was lost during the purification procedure after labeling, and the actual concentration might be slightly lower than 2 nm. The reaction was terminated with 0.4% SDS, and the products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel. The reaction conditions were similar to those used by Gates et al. (39Gates C.A. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4628-4632Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Although polyethylene glycol was used in previous studies to enhance activity, it did not increase the reaction rate in our assays and only induced the appearance of reaction intermediates. It was therefore omitted from the reaction buffer. DNA Cleavage Assays—Synthentic oligonucleotides were purchased from the Keck biotechnology facility at Yale University and purified by urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. S3 (TAA TCC AGT GGA AGT TCC TAT TCT T) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified as described under “DNA Recombination Assays.” It was then annealed with S4P (5′-phospho-CTA GAA GAA TAG GAA CTT CCA CTG GAT TA) to form a suicide substrate containing one Flp-binding site. The final substrate for the DNA cleavage assays consisted of both radioactively labeled and unlabeled suicide substrates at a ratio of 1:9. Each 10-μl reaction contained 4 nm DNA substrate, 120 nm Flpe protein, 25 mm Taps (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 12% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The assay was carried out at 30 °C and terminated with 0.4% SDS. The products were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Results were quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The data were processed using Origin software, and the curves were fit to a hyperbola equation to attain the apparent rate constant for a second order reaction. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The complex of W330F Flpe and T4B4 (T4: TAA GTT CCT ATT CT; B4: TTT AAA AGA ATA GGA ACT TC) was prepared with the same procedure as the original Flp-Holliday junction complex (4Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Google Scholar). A slightly higher protein concentration, 0.48 mm, was used. Crystals appeared in hanging drops containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 11% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether, 20% xylitol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, approximately 1 week after the trays were set up. Data were collected from crystals with a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm at the BioCARS 14BM-C beamline at the Advanced Photon Source using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector. The crystals were in space group P21, with unit cell dimensions of a = 80 Å, b = 117 Å, c = 142 Å, and β = 97.3°. The diffraction was anisotropic, with <I/σI> falling below ∼2 at 2.7, 3.0, and 2.9 Å along the three axes. The data were processed with the HKL suite (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Initial phases were provided by the WT Flpe structure, which crystallized isomorphously (Protein Data Bank number 1M6X) (5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar). The structure was refined with CNS_SOLVE (41Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), using a combination of 2- and 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Differences in the refined structures of the WT and mutant were in agreement with difference Fourier maps ((FWT – FW330F) ΦWT and (FWT – FW330F) ΦW330F). In addition to changes in the active site discussed under “Results,” the DNA strand in the catalytic site of the inactive monomer D could be modeled better as nicked rather than intact. Structure figures were generated with Ribbons (42Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Google Scholar). Buried surfaces were calculated using CNS_SOLVE with the side chain atoms of the His/Trp residue as molecule 1 and the surrounding protein as molecule 2. The result was the total buried surface area from molecule 1 and molecule 2, and should be divided by 2 when considering only one molecule in the interface. Flpe Purification—One difficulty in studying Flp recombinase is the usually cumbersome protein purification procedure, which is further complicated by the protein's intrinsic instability (43Meyer-Leon L. Gates C.A. Attwood J.M. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6469-6488Google Scholar, 44Pan H. Clary D. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11347-11354Google Scholar). We were able to improve the efficiency of this process with the use of two affinity columns: Talon column for a newly added C-terminal His6 tag and DNA affinity column containing multimers of Flp-binding sites. The addition of the His6 tag was based on the observation that the C terminus of the enzyme is exposed and far from the active site and DNA-binding regions in the Flp-DNA complex structure. The DNA column was similar to those in previous studies except that the DNA molecules consisting of multiple Flp-binding sites were prepared with a template-free PCR instead of ligation. Purified protein was obtained within 1 day. Flpe is used in our studies, and the wild type in this paper refers to His6-tagged Flpe without further mutations. The four point mutations (P2S, L33S, Y108N, and S294P) found in Flpe are removed from the catalytic center and do not appear to affect the static structure of the enzyme-DNA complex (5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar). Trp330 and Lys223 Are Important for Activity—Single mutations were introduced at Trp330 and Lys223 to study the roles of these two residues in Flp-mediated recombination. Trp330 was substituted with alanine, histidine, glutamine, and phenylalanine, whereas Lys223 was replaced by alanine and arginine. The effects of these mutations were first tested in full recombination assays. The linearized plasmid substrate for the assay, pJFS39, contains a single FRT site with a symmetrical spacer. It can be recombined in two different orientations, one of which regenerates the substrate, whereas the other produces DNA molecules of different lengths (Fig. 1b). Although recombination catalyzed by the wild type protein reached equilibrium within several hours under our conditions, overnight reactions were carried out for the mutants to allow detection of low activity levels (Fig. 1c). Protein and DNA concentrations were also raised in one experiment to further increase the sensitivity (Fig. 1d). W330A, W330Q, and K223A failed to generate any detectable amount of recombined products. W330H was capable of mediating recombination at a much slower rate, whereas K223R showed an extremely low activity only in the assay where the protein and DNA concentrations were increased. In contrast to the poor performances of the other mutants, W330F displayed an activity level indistinguishable from the wild type in these experiments, a surprising observation in light of the previous hypotheses that the hydrogen bond between the Trp330 side chain and the DNA would be important for catalysis. The fact that mutating Lys223 to alanine abolished activity whereas K223R restored some enzymatic capability is consistent with previous findings that this lysine acts as a general acid in vaccinia topoisomerase. In Flp, the side chain of Lys223 is also involved in direct contact with a base in the minor groove and therefore may be important for DNA binding. K223A and K223R showed decreased affinities for the DNA column during protein purification (data not shown), suggesting that part of the activity loss might result from impaired DNA binding capabilities. The long incubation time for the overnight reactions with WT and W330F Flp led to the appearance of some doubly cleaved side products. These double strand cleavage products, like the reaction intermediates, have been observed by others and probably result from slow hydrolysis of the covalent phosphotyrosine intermediate (39Gates C.A. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4628-4632Google Scholar, 45Meyer-Leon L. Huang L.C. Umlauf S.W. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3784-3796Google Scholar). Comparison of Wild Type and W330F in Recombination Assays—A more detailed comparison was carried out between the activities of the wild type and the W330F mutant by measuring the formation of recombined products at time points before equilibrium (Fig. 2). No detectable difference was observed between the reactions catalyzed by the two proteins, suggesting again that the role of Trp330 in Flp-mediated recombination might be different from previous hypotheses. However, the full recombination reaction requires many steps, and the rate-limiting one may actually be a conformational change in the Holliday junction (46Meyer-Leon L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 235-242Google Scholar). This could mask a small decrease in the mutant's catalytic activity. A second group of experiments, DNA cleavage assays, was used to determine whether there is any defect in the ability of W330F to catalyze the chemical reactions. Comparison of Wild Type and W330F in Cleavage Assays— DNA cleavage is the first chemical step in the reactions mediated by this family of enzymes. Our assay used suicide substrates shown in Fig. 3a. The attack of Tyr343 between the Flp-binding site and the spacer region results in a covalent protein-DNA linkage and the excision of two thymines at the end of the DNA top strand, which diffuse into the bulk solution. The reaction is trapped at this stage due to the absence of the 5′-hydroxyl group on the first thymine, which is necessary for the reverse reaction or the subsequent ligation reaction of the recombination process. Because of half of the sites activity, a theoretical 50% of the substrate duplex will be covalently linked to the enzyme when the protein is present in excess. A modest decrease in reaction rate was observed for the W330F mutant, compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 3). The appearance of the covalent protein-DNA product fit better to a second order reaction curve than to a first order one, consistent with the requirement for two DNA-bound Flp protomers to form a single active site. The apparent rate constant for the wild type was estimated to be 1.0 × 108m–1 min–1, whereas that for the mutant was roughly 5-fold lower, 0.18 × 108m–1 min–1. This decrease probably reflects a slight defect in catalysis rather than in DNA binding, because these assays were carried out with a large excess of protein, above the estimated Kd (47Ringrose L. Lounnas V. Ehrlich L. Buchholz F. Wade R. Stewart A.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 363-384Google Scholar), and because our preliminary mobility shift assays using a single Flp-binding site indicated no difference in affinity between the two proteins (data not shown). Radioactive and nonradioactive cleavage assays were also performed on the other mutants. The results were consistent with those of recombination assays, except that W330Q was able to yield covalent protein-DNA adduct at a rate that is slower than the wild type but slightly faster than W330H (Fig. 3b), in contrast to the apparently higher activity level of W330H in the overall recombination assay. This suggests that W330Q is even more defective in the later stages of recombination than in the cleavage step. When compared with the dramatic activity decrease in W330H and W330Q, the small reaction rate difference between the wild type and W330F mutant suggests that hydrogen-bonding capability is not the critical feature of Trp330. Examination of the previous Flp-DNA complex structure revealed an extensive network of amino acids contacted by Trp330 through van der Waals interactions within or close to the catalytic site. The most essential role of Trp330 in the reaction may be maintaining a stable local architecture. To investigate whether the high activity level of the mutant stemmed from the ability of phenylalanine to retain those van der Waals contacts, W330F mutant protein was crystallized with DNA, and a structure of W330F-Holliday junction complex was determined. Structure of W330F Mutant Protein Complexed with DNA— W330F Flpe was cocrystallized with the same DNA substrate as used in the WT Flp and Flpe complex structures (4Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Google Scholar, 5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar). Phases were provided by a newly determined structure of a wild type Flpe-DNA complex (5Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Google Scholar). The overall structure of the mutant is the same as that of the wild type Flpe. The complex has approximate 2-fold symmetry and consists of a mutant tetramer bound to a DNA Holliday junction (Fig. 4a). Two catalytic centers contain a covalent phosphotyrosyl linkage and a free 5′-OH, whereas the other two contain a continuous or nicked DNA strand with Tyr343 displaced from the scissile phosphate. The mutant structure was refined to R and Rfree values of 23.6 and 27.5%, respectively (Table I). 87.6% of the nonglycine protein residues are in the most favored conformational regions of the Ramachandran plot (as defined by Procheck (48Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S.J. M.T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar)). One of the two active protomers (“chain B,” with Tyr343 donated by chain C) was significantly better ordered than the other. Discussions of the active site geometry thus pertain to this protomer.Table ICrystallographic statisticsParametersValuesResolution used in refinementaThe crystal diffracted to 2.7, 3.0, and 2.9 Å along the three principle axes.22-2.7/3.0/2.9 ÅResidualsbR = Σ|Fo - Fc|/ΣFo; 10% of data were used as a test set for Rfree.Rworking23.6%Rfree27.5%No. of reflections64,397Completeness90.9%Root mean square deviation from idealBonds0.007 ÅAngles1.210°B-factors r.m.s.Bonded mainchain1.331 Å2Bonded sidechain1.628 Å2Percentage (no.) of residues by region of Ramachandran plotcAs defined by PROCHECK (48).Most favored87.6% (1290)Additionally allowed12.0% (177)Generously allowed0.3% (5)Disallowed0.0% (0)a The crystal diffracted to 2.7, 3.0, and 2.9 Å along the three principle axes.b R = Σ|Fo - Fc|/ΣFo; 10% of data were used as a test set for Rfree.c As defined by PROCHECK (48Laskowski R.A.

In an attempt to understand the factors that affect this phenotype, we have surveyed the toxicity of a complete set of two-codon ORFs cloned as minigenes in inducible expression vectors. The minigenes were tested in hydrolase-defective hosts and classified according to their degree of toxicity. In general, minigenes harboring codons belonging to the same box in the standard table of the genetic code mediated similar degrees of toxicity. Moreover, the levels of peptidyl-tRNA accumulation for synonymous minigenes decoded by the same tRNA were comparable. However, two exceptions were observed: (i) expression of minigenes harboring the Arg codons CGA, CGU, and CGC, resulted in the accumulation of different levels of the unique peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 and (ii) the toxicity of minigenes containing CUG and UCU codons, each recognized by two different tRNAs, depended on peptidyl-tRNA accumulation of only one of them. Non-toxic, or partly toxic, minigenes prompted higher accumulation levels of peptidyl-tRNA upon deprivation of active RF1, implying that translation termination occurred efficiently. Our data indicate that the nature of the last decoding tRNA is crucial in the rate of peptidyl-tRNA release from the ribosome.

Our data indicate that the nature of the last decoding tRNA is crucial in the rate of peptidyl-tRNA release from the ribosome. Minigenes are DNA sequences present in bacterial chromosomes that may be expressed into functionally active oligopeptides. In Escherichia coli for example, translation of a peptide encoded in a minigene present in the 23 S rRNA, turns cells erythromycin resistant (1Tenson T. DeBlasio A. Mankin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); also, peptides containing five to eight amino acid residues encoded in the attenuator sequence of genes, which confer resistance to chloramphenicol and erythromycin (catA86, cmlA and ermC), inhibit peptidyltransferase activity in bacteria (2Lovett P.S. Rogers E.J. Microbiol Rev. 1996; 60: 366-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation of two-codon minigenes located in bacteriophage lambda chromosome bar regions is lethal to cells partly defective in peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity, but not to wild-type bacteria (3Ontiveros C. Valadez J.G. Hernández J. Guarneros G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Translation of bar minigene mRNAs results in premature release of peptidyl-tRNAs from ribosomes (a phenomenon called “drop-off”); under limited Pth 1The abbreviations used are: Pth, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; ORF, open reading frame; oligo, oligodeoxyribonucleotide; SD, Shine-Dalgarno sequence. activity, these peptidyl-tRNAs accumulate in the cell. It has been proposed that lethality stems from the subsequent shortage in the pool of specific tRNAs for further involvement in protein synthesis (4Hernández-Sánchez J Valadez J.G. Herrera J.V. Ontiveros C. Guarneros G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3758-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence that seems to support this inference has been obtained for a ribosome bypassing system (5Lindsley D. Gallant J. Guarneros G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the alternative explanation that peptidyl-tRNAs might be toxic per se has not been ruled out (6Menninger J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 694-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation ends at the termination codon in an mRNA, when the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase presumably hydrolyzes the ester bond between the completed polypeptide chain and the last tRNA. The termination reaction requires the concurrence of the release factors RF-1 or RF-2 (depending on the nature of the termination codon) and other factors catalyzing the release of the mature protein (7Hershey J.W.B. Neidthardt F.G. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 613-647Google Scholar, 8Buckingham R.H. Grentzmann G. Kisselev L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Drop-off is a normal, if relatively rare, event in protein synthesis that can occur during elongation or instead of polypeptide termination (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Menez J. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4725-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If the rates of peptidyl-tRNA synthesis and drop-off exceed the rates of termination and Pth hydrolysis, peptidyl-tRNA accumulates and thus critically reduces the concentration of aminoacylable tRNA and increases that of peptidyl-tRNAs (4Hernández-Sánchez J Valadez J.G. Herrera J.V. Ontiveros C. Guarneros G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3758-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The up-shift to non-permissive temperatures of a thermosensitive pth mutant, pth(Ts), results in peptidyl-tRNA buildup of all the tRNAs assayed. The rates of peptidyl-tRNA accumulation differ as a function of the tRNA species. Thus, families of tRNA cognate to codons for Lys, Thr, and Asn accumulate the fastest, whereas those cognate to codons for Leu, Gly, and Cys accumulate the slowest (11Menninger J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6808-6813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the drop-off rates depend on the codons involved. Toxicity and peptidyl-tRNA accumulation in the pth(Ts) mutant is alleviated in strains defective for the translation termination factors RF-3 and RRF (12Heurgué-Hamard V. Karimi R. Mora L.

Drop-off during minigene mRNA translation is enhanced by these termination factors as well as the elongation factor EF-G (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments with different synthetic minigenes have shown that the relative rates of termination and drop-off vary according to the composition of the last sense codon, the nature and context of the stop codon, and the length of the mini-ORF and that toxicity is correlated to these conditions (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Heurgué-Hamard V. Dinçbas V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, the strong effect of the SD sequence affects peptidyl-tRNA accumulation by driving minigene mRNA through several rounds of translation without dissociation from the ribosome (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite these results, the scarce number and heterogeneity of minigenes studied so far does not allow us to draw conclusions about the role of codon composition in drop-off. We have studied the effect of the last sense codon on peptidyl-tRNA accumulation, minigene mRNA concentration, translation termination, and toxicity to pth-defective cells. Our results indicate that the degree of toxicity stems from the intrinsic inability of certain codon-tRNA complexes to mediate efficient translation termination. Bacterial Strains and Toxicity Assay—The following E. coli K-12 strains were used: C600 (thr1 leu6 thi1 supE44 tonA lacY1), our collection; pth-defective mutants C600rap (C600 pth[rap] zch::Tn10) and C600pth(Ts) (C600 pth[Ts] zch::Tn10) (14García-Villegas M.R. De La Vega F.M. Galindo J.M. Segura M. Buckingham R.H. Guarneros G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3549-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); C600rap Tcs, tetracycline-sensitive derivative of C600rap (15Cruz-Vera L.R. Toledo I. Hernández-Sánchez J. Guarneros G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); US486 (W3110 prfA1), a thermo-sensitive mutant defective in release factor RF-1 (R. Buckingham collection; Ref. 16Ryden S.M. Isaksson L.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); GG05 (US486 pth[rap] zch::Tn10), US486 with bacteriophage P1 (C600rap); and GG06 (C600 pth[rap] prfA1 zch::Tn10), C600rapTcs with P1 (GG05), this work. The viability experiments to estimate the degree of minigene toxicity were performed by streaking a single colony of cells harboring the minigene library on Luria Broth (LB)-agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm IPTG and incubating at 32 °C for 24 h. Minigene Library Construction—The complete set of 64 constructs harboring two-codon minigenes was obtained by cloning duplex synthetic oligos into vector pKQV4, which carries the IPTG-inducible tac promoter (Fig. 1A; Ref. 17Strauch M.A. Spiegelman G.B. Perego M. Johnson W.C. Burbulys D. Hoch J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). An attempt was made to generate the 64 pairs of complementary synthetic oligos, namely 5′-AATTCATGNNNTAAATA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTATTTANNNCATG-3′ (the EcoRI and HindIII cohesive ends are underlined and in bold, respectively), by random synthesis at positions NNN corresponding to the variable minigene codon (Fig. 1A). Duplexes were obtained by allowing complementary oligos to hybridize in a mixture containing 400 pmol of each random oligo in 100 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) for 5 min at 95 °C and slowly cooled down to room temperature. Duplexes were then cloned into the vector after their double restriction digestion with both EcoRI and HindIII. Ligation of inserts into this vector was performed using 40 fmol of duplex mixture with 15 fmol of the double-restricted vector in 20 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Biosciences)) for 1 h at room temperature. The ligation mix was used to transform C6OOrap cells (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar), and selected clones were tested for the absence of the SalI site present in the unsubstituted vector only. Inserts from these clones were sequenced using Big-Dye sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems), using the forward oligo 5′-GACATAACGGTTCTGGC-3′, corresponding to a sequence close to Ptac, and the reverse oligo 5′-CTGTTTTATCAGACCGC-3′, corresponding to a sequence upstream to the 5 S gene (Fig. 1A). Thirty-two minigenes were obtained after random hybridization, and the rest were obtained by direct cloning of specific duplexes into the expression vector as described above. Peptidyl-tRNA Levels—Peptidyl-tRNA levels were estimated by a modification of the Northern blot technique of Varshney et al. (19Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method is more specific than the traditional assay (20Menninger J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3392-3398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because it distinguishes individual tRNAs. Briefly, the transformants for minigene constructs were cultured on LB (100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 32 °C to an A 600 value of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm IPTG for different periods of time (see “Results”) at 32 °C. To estimate the fraction of peptidyl-tRNA relative to total tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNAs were hydrolyzed by the cupric reaction (21Cuzin F. Kretchmer N. Greenberg R.E. Hurwitz R. Chapeville F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2079-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total extracted tRNA was resuspended in 20 μl of water and divided into two aliquots: a control sample that was mixed with 90 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and a hydrolysis sample with 10 mm CuSO4. Each reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol after addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm. The samples were resolved by acid/urea PAGE and transferred to nylon membranes; tRNA-containing species were revealed using specific 32P-labeled oligo probes (5 × 106 cpm/pmol; Refs. 19Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The peptidyl-tRNA fraction was estimated from the radioactivity ratio between the measured radioactivities in the (peptidyl-tRNA/peptidyl-tRNA + tRNA) respective bands as determined in a Typhoon Scan (Amersham Biosciences). Minigene mRNA Detection—Total RNA was obtained from cultures of transformants for minigene constructs induced with IPTG. Minigene mRNA was revealed by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled DNA probe (2 × 106 cpm/ng; Ref. 23Cruz-Vera L.R. Galindo J.M. Guarneros G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3457-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 150-bp DNA probe was synthesized by 50 cycles of PCR (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s and 72 °C, 1 min) using 30 fmol of pKQV4 template and 10 pmol of each sequencing oligo (defined above) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (6,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 150 μm concentration each of the other three dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Minigenes Harboring Codons from the Same Genetic Code Box Show Similar Toxicity—Changes in the last sense codon of some minigenes determine variations in the degree of toxicity for pth mutants (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Tenson T. Herrera J.V. Kloss P. Guarneros G. Mankin A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Valadez J.G. Hernández-Sánchez J. Magos M.A. Ontiveros C. Guarneros G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To understand the nature of this effect, we used an expression library of two-codon ORF minigenes in which the second, and last, sense codon was any of the 64 possibilities in the genetic code (Fig. 1A). By maintaining the same transcriptional promoter, SD region, initiation and termination codons, and the shortest possible “ORF,” we attempted to minimize the number of variables affecting minigene expression and focus on the effect of the different sense codons on toxicity (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Heurgué-Hamard V. Dinçbas V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The minigene constructs were expressed in two pth mutants differing in the level of Pth activitiy (pth[Ts] > pth[rap]; Ref. 15Cruz-Vera L.R. Toledo I. Hernández-Sánchez J. Guarneros G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as a means for ranking minigene toxicities. The results, summarized in Fig. 1B, showed a wide variation in the degree of toxicity to the two mutant strains arising from minigene expression and depending on the nature of the second codon: 27 were toxic to both pth(Ts) and pth(rap), 18 were lethal to pth(rap), and 16 had no deleterious effects on either mutant. Unlike the toxic minigenes isolated by Tenson et al. (24Tenson T. Herrera J.V. Kloss P. Guarneros G. Mankin A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none of our constructs affected wild-type cell growth under the same assay conditions (data not shown). This effect may be due to the lower strength of minigene expression in the vector we used relative to that recorded for the vector used in the previous report (24Tenson T. Herrera J.V. Kloss P. Guarneros G. Mankin A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Minigenes with any of the three termination codons in the second position do not encode peptides and are therefore expected to be harmless to Pth-defective strains. In effect, the two constructs tested, carrying TAA and TGA respectively, had no toxic effects (data not shown). No correlation was observed between codon pair bias (26Irwin B. Heck D. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22801-22806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or cognate tRNA scarcity (underlined codons in Fig. 1B; Ref. 22Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and minigene toxicity. In general, minigenes harboring codons grouped within the same genetic code box (Fig. 1B) showed a similar degree of toxicity (38 minigenes in 10 out of 16 boxes). Five of these boxes contain codons for two different amino acids (e.g. TTN, Phe/Leu; ATN, Ile/Met-, etc.), suggesting that the codons, rather than the decoded amino acids, determine minigene toxicity. This would not be the case for those minigenes bearing codons within each of the remaining six boxes in which mixed degrees of toxicity were observed (dashed boxes in Fig. 1B). Non-toxic Minigenes Do Not Mediate Peptidyl-tRNA Accumulation—For a number of minigenes, a direct correlation between toxicity and peptidyl-tRNA concentration has been observed in pth mutants (4Hernández-Sánchez J Valadez J.G. Herrera J.V. Ontiveros C. Guarneros G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3758-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Tenson T. Herrera J.V. Kloss P. Guarneros G. Mankin A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1617-1622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the breadth of this observation, we estimated the relative concentrations of peptidyl-tRNAs for selected minigenes. Initially, we determined the time length of IPTG minigene induction which generated the highest peptidyl-tRNA concentrations. The data showed that, for the toxic (AAT and AAA) and partly toxic (GAT and GAA) minigenes assayed, the highest accumulated fraction was reached in all cases within a 30-min induction period (Fig. 2B). Therefore, all subsequent determinations of peptidyl-tRNA concentration were made at 30 min (Fig. 1B , columns 4 and 5). The relative concentrations of peptidyl-tRNA in C600pth(Ts) varied from 40 to 70% for toxic, 10 to 20% for partly toxic, and 5 and 10% for non-toxic minigenes (Fig. 1B , fourth column in each cell). In C600rap, the relative concentrations of peptidyl-tRNA from toxic and partly toxic minigenes were proportionally higher (Fig. 1B , fifth column in each cell), whereas the concentrations of peptidyl-tRNA for non-toxic minigenes were lower, although similar to those observed for pth(Ts). Wild-type transformants did not accumulate peptidyl-tRNA (data not shown). Except for minigene AAT, encoding Asn, which intriguingly promotes accumulation of peptidyl-tRNALys (Fig. 2A), heterologous peptidyl-tRNAs did not accumulate upon minigene expression: minigene AAA did not accumulate peptidyl-tRNAAsn; minigene GAT did not accumulate peptidyl-tRNAGlu; minigene GAA did not mediate accumulation of peptidyl-tRNAAsp (Fig. 2A); and minigene AGA did not accumulate peptidyl-tRNALys. Peptidyl-tRNA Accumulation Depends upon the Specific Codon-tRNA Interaction—In six of the genetic code boxes (dashed boxes in Fig. 1B), minigenes showed mixed degrees of toxicity. To understand the basis of these differences, we analyzed peptidyl-tRNA accumulation upon minigene induction in Pth-defective mutants. For example, in the set of minigenes carrying Arg codons CGU, CGC, and CGA, for which tRNAArg-2 is the sole cognate species, the generated peptidyl-tRNAs must be chemically identical. If we assume an equal decoding rate for the mini-ORFs in each of the three minigenes, toxicity would depend on the drop-off rate, because the rate of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis by Pth is identical. The relative amounts of peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 accumulated after expression of each minigene in Pth-defective strains ranked in the order CGA>CGT>CGC, as expected from their degree of toxicity (Fig. 3). Accordingly, the peptidyl-tRNA concentrations should reflect the rate of peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 drop-off due to differences in tRNAArg-2 interaction with each of the three codons (see “Discussion”). tRNASer-1 is cognate to the codons in partly toxic minigenes TCT and TCA and clearly accumulates as peptidyl-tRNASer-1 in strain pth(rap) (40%, Fig. 1B); by contrast, accumulation of peptidyl-tRNASer-5, produced by both the partly toxic TCT and the non-toxic TCC minigenes, was not promoted in either strain (Fig. 1B). This suggests strongly that the toxicity of minigenes TCT and TCA is associated with peptidyl-tRNASer-1 accumulation. The data for the minigenes CTA and CTG could be explained in a similar way. Non-toxic Minigene mRNAs Are Translated—For the expression of different minigene variants, the cellular levels and stability of minigene mRNA correlate with the strength of toxicity. It has been speculated that the increased messenger stability results from a longer interaction period with the ribosome during translation (25Valadez J.G. Hernández-Sánchez J. Magos M.A. Ontiveros C. Guarneros G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Results with Northern blot assays confirmed that toxic minigenes (e.g. AAA, GTT, and CGA) accumulated high levels of mRNA, whereas non-toxic minigenes (e.g. GCC, GGC, and CGC) did not (data not shown). We then asked whether non-toxic minigene mRNAs were translated at all and, if they were, why their expression did not drive peptidyl-tRNA accumulation. Minigene AGA, lethal to C600pth(Ts), and the non-lethal minigene GGC, were expressed in the presence of antibiotics (Fig. 4). The antibiotics used were pactamycin, which causes ribosome stalling soon after initiation of protein synthesis (27Mankin A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and erythromycin, which enhances the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs containing at least six to eight amino acids (6Menninger J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 694-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2002; 108: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As expected, the expression of the lethal minigene AGA resulted in mRNA accumulation even in the absence of the antibiotics. The non-toxic GGC minigene, on the other hand, accumulated mRNA only in the presence of pactamycin. Similar results were obtained with the lethal CGA and the non-toxic CGC minigenes (data not shown). These results indicate that mRNAs of these non-toxic minigenes are translatable; furthermore, in the absence of antibiotics translation termination should have occurred readily, suggesting that the mRNA-ribosome complex may be short lived. Erythromycin did not mediate accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA nor did it stabilize the ribosome-mRNA complex as deduced from the observation that it did not favor mRNA accumulation (Fig. 4). Given that the erythromycin binding site is at the entrance of the 50 S ribosomal subunit tunnel (29Schlünzen F. Zarivach R. Harms J. Bashan A. Tocilj A. Albrecht R. Yonath A. Franceschi F. Nature. 2001; 413: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), it is not expected to affect dipeptidyl-tRNAs which are too short to reach the site. Efficient Translation Termination Prevents Peptidyl-tRNA Accumulation—To test whether toxic and non-toxic minigenes differ in the efficiency of translation termination, the levels of peptidyl-tRNA, the intermediate previous to termination hydrolysis, were assayed under a condition of defective termination (Fig. 5). An E. coli prfA1-pth(rap) double mutant, defective for both RF1 (thermosensible) and Pth activities, was transformed with constructs carrying minigenes causing different degrees of lethality. In mutant prfA1 the activity of RF1 is greatly reduced at 43 °C (16Ryden S.M. Isaksson L.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We used the partly toxic CGT minigene and the non-toxic variant CGC, for which tRNAArg-2 is the sole cognate isoacceptor. When RF1 was defective, expression at 32 °C of the CGC minigene did not promote detectable peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 accumulation, whereas it did at 43 °C (lane 4 versus lane 8). The partly toxic CGT minigene promoted peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 accumulation at both temperatures (lanes 2 and 6), and accumulation was enhanced at 43 °C. These results suggest that efficient translation termination of non-toxic minigene mRNAs shortens peptidyl-tRNA residence time on the ribosome so that drop-off events remain undetectable. In strain prfA1, which harbors the wild-type pth allele (lanes 10 and 12), no peptidyl-tRNA was identified during toxic minigene expression at 43 °C; this suggests that all the generated peptidyl-tRNA eventually dissociates from the ribosomes and is cleaved by Pth in solution. We used a library of two-codon minigenes to analyze the effect of the variable second codon on Pth-defective cells. The minigenes were ranked as fully toxic, partly toxic, and nontoxic. All analyzed minigenes showed that these categories correlated directly with relative levels of the respective peptidyl-tRNA concentrations. With few exceptions, the four minigenes bearing codons from the same genetic code box showed similar degrees of toxicity (Fig. 1B). This rule held for unmixed boxes, i.e. those encoding only one type of amino acid, as well as for mixed boxes, encoding two amino acids. A nucleotide sequence relationship has been reported for the tRNAs cognate to the codons within the same genetic code box (30Sagara J.I. Shimizu S. Kawabata T. Nakamura S. Ikeguch M. Shimizu K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Chaley M.B. Korotkov E.V. Phoenix D.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that the chemical nature of the cognate tRNA is an important toxicity determinant. A closer look at the exceptions mentioned above seems to confirm this conclusion. A long ribosome pause on the last sense codon, arising from inefficient translation termination, eventually results in peptidyl-tRNA dissociation and mRNA stabilization (9Dinçbas V. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Karimi R. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Heurgué-Hamard V. Karimi R. Mora L. MacDougall J. Leboeuf C. Grentzmann G. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, toxic minigenes would be defective in translation termination, and non-toxic minigenes would terminate readily. Additional support for this idea comes from two types of evidence: first, mRNA of the non-toxic CGC minigene was stabilized by pactamycin (data not shown), an antibiotic which arrests protein synthesis early after initiation and results in the accumulation of a 40 S·Met-tRNAF·mRNA complex (32Levin D.H. Kyner D. Acs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); second, the expression of the same CGC minigene promoted the accumulation of normally undetectable peptidyl-tRNA under limited activity of the termination factor RF1 (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8; Ref. 16Ryden S.M. Isaksson L.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We were unable to find a direct correlation between the minigene mRNA and peptidyl-tRNA accumulation, i.e. the length of the ribosomal pause and the strength of the codon:anticodon bond. If this strength has an influence on the ribosomal pause, it might be part of a more complex interaction which involves several factors. One factor could be the effect of both the amino acid side chains and the tRNA body of the peptidyl-tRNA on the interaction with the ribosome, in a manner similar to their themodynamic contribution to the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA and the EF-Tu (33LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A second factor affecting ribosomal pausing may be the specific architecture of the codon:anticodon interaction. The Arg codons CGA, CGU, and CGC are decoded by the unique tRNAArg-2 (22Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Unlike CGC, CGA is a poor 5′ context for amber suppression by the su7-encoded tRNA suggesting that the CGA codon-peptidyl-tRNAArg-2 in the ribosomal P-site can interfere with either the translation of a codon in the A site (34Curran J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or with enhanced termination at a stop codon. We showed that minigene CGA clearly promoted peptidyl-tRNA accumulation, whereas minigene CGC did not (Figs. 1B and 3), thus indicating that CGA hinders termination. It has been speculated that the A:I pairing of the CGA codon with the tRNAArg-2 anticodon at the wobble position is structurally distorted, thus hampering decoding (34Curran J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Lim V.I. Venclovas C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our results, however, showed that synthesis of peptidyl-tRNA occurs readily (Fig. 3), implying that the defect may be at mRNA translation termination. It is possible that wobble position base pair distortion affects translation termination, because minigene CGT, which accumulates intermediate levels of peptidyl-tRNA (Fig. 3), has a less severe distortion at the U:I pair in the CGU-anticodon interaction (34Curran J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could apply for minigenes AGT and AGC, for which tRNASer-3 is the cognate species. A third factor affecting ribosomal pausing could be the interaction between tRNA in the ribosomal P-site and the release factor in the A-site. For example, in the presence of peptidyl-tRNAGly-3 in the P-site at codons GGA/G, termination efficiency at UAG is higher than in the presence of peptidyl-tRNAGly-2 at the same codons, suggesting an unusual interaction between tRNAGly-2 and RF1 (36Zhang S. Ryden-Aulin M. Isaksson L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This hypothesis could explain why toxicity and peptidyl-tRNA accumulation for TCT and CTG in the corresponding minigenes is associated to only one of the two cognate tRNAs (Fig. 1B). What is the distribution of “toxic” and “non-toxic codons” in bacterial genes? Interestingly, AAA/G and AAU/AAC codons in minigenes, which promote high rates of peptidyl-tRNA accumulation (Fig. 2), are frequently located at the beginning of E. coli ORFs. These codons enhance efficiency of translation when substituted at positions two and three of a reporter gene (37Sato T. Terabe M. Watanabe H. Gojobori T. Hori-Takemoto C. Miura Ki. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Stenström C.M. Jin H. Major L.L. Tate W.P. Isaksson L.A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). By contrast, codons that promoted low rates of peptidyl-tRNA accumulation are rarely located among the first three positions (e.g. CUN, GCN, and GGN gene code boxes; Refs. 37Sato T. Terabe M.

In the pth(ts) mutant, families of tRNAs cognate to these codons are among those with the lowest rates of accumulation of the corresponding peptidyl-tRNAs at non-permissive temperatures (11Menninger J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6808-6813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of codons prone to drop-off in minigenes may represent an advantage for protein synthesis when located at the initial positions in the mRNA ORFs. These codons might act as sensors of the general availability of charged tRNAs. If the availability is appropriate, elongation proceeds, otherwise abortive drop-off occurs. This strategy would prevent wasteful protein synthesis elongation under limiting tRNA availability. Interestingly, a high frequency of AAA/G codons, associated to high drop-off rates in minigenes, has been found at the last sense position of the E. coli ORFs where they also promote drop-off (13Heurgué-Hamard V. Dinçbas V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2701-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This non-random codon distribution at the ends of ORFs has been considered as an important factor in the modulation of translation termination (39Arkov A.L. Korolev S.V. Kisselev L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2891-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This could be explained, because such codons provide an alternative translation termination mechanism including drop-off and Pth-mediated hydrolysis of the final peptidyl-tRNA. We thank Marco A.

https://openalex.org/W2029603201,"In an investigation of the mechanism underlying the functional sublocalization of glycosyltransferases within the Golgi apparatus, caveolin-1 was identified as a possible cellular factor. Caveolin-1 appears to regulate the localization of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) in the intra-Golgi subcompartment. Structural analyses of total cellular N-glycans indicated that the overexpression of GnT-III in human hepatoma cells, in which caveolin-1 is not expressed, failed to reduce branch formation, whereas expression of caveolin-1 led to a dramatic decrease in the extent of branching with no enhancement in GnT-III activity. Because the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc by GnT-III to the core β-Man in N-glycans prevents the action of GnT-IV and GnT-V, both of which are involved in branch formation, this result suggests that caveolin-1 facilitates the prior action of GnT-III, relative to the other GnTs, on the nascent sugar chains in the Golgi apparatus and that GnT-III is redistributed in the earlier Golgi subcompartment by caveolin-1. Indeed, when caveolin-1 was expressed in human hepatoma cells, it was found to be co-localized with GnT-III, as evidenced by the fractionation of Triton X-100-insoluble cellular membranes by density gradient ultracentrifugation.

J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides containing a bisecting GlcNAc (bisected oligosaccharides) do not serve as substrates for GnT-IV and GnT-V, which catalyze the formation of a β1,4-branch at an α1,3Man and a β1,6-branch at an α1,6Man, respectively (2Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the action of GnT-V was strictly inhibited by the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc at the catalytic step (4Sasai K. Ikeda Y. Eguchi H. Tsuda T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the action of GnT-III prior to these enzymes in the Golgi leads to an inhibition of the biosynthesis of multiantennary oligosaccharides. Indeed, the ectopic expression of GnT-III caused an effective reduction in multiantennary oligosaccharides in various types of cells (5Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 12: 8754-8758Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6Koyota S. Ikeda Y. Miyagawa S. Ihara H. Koma M. Honke K. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32867-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For example, in the case of swine endothelial cells, the expression of GnT-III led to a dramatic decrease in multiantennary oligosaccharides, accompanied by a marked increase in bisected biantennary ones (6Koyota S. Ikeda Y. Miyagawa S. Ihara H. Koma M. Honke K. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32867-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, there are exceptions, in which a high GnT-III activity did not lead to a decrease in branching. In the case of human hepatoma cells, the overexpression of GnT-III resulted in a dramatic increase in bisected oligosaccharides but did not cause a decrease of the number of antenna (7Ihara H. Ikeda Y. Koyota S. Endo T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It would be expected that GnT-IV and GnT-V act prior to GnT-III in Huh6 and HepG2 cells, because the activities of GnT-III, GnT-IV, and GnT-V are essentially the same level in both types of cells and because GnT-IV and GnT-V are unable to act on the bisected sugar chains, a product of GnT-III. Namely, if there are fundamental differences in the order of GnT-III action between both types of cells, then a regulating mechanism must be operative that is responsible for the prior action of GnT-III in swine endothelial cells.As long as the final products of oligosaccharide structures are mediated by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases, the order of their action should be, at least in part, regulated by their sublocalization within the Golgi apparatus. It has been suggested that the “CTS” region (cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and stem region) of the glycosyltransferases plays a role in its intra-Golgi functional localization (8Grabenhorst E. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36107-36116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the cell type-specific regulation of oligosaccharide biosynthesis, observed in swine endothelial cells and hepatoma cells, indicates that the functional localization of glycosyltransferases cannot be explained only by the CTS theory. It is possible that this regulation involves cellular factors other than glycosyltransferases.Here, we hypothesize that caveolin-1 is a candidate molecule that plays a role in the functional localization of GnT-III within the subcompartment of the Golgi apparatus, because it is well known that normal liver expresses a negligible amount of caveolin-1 mRNA (9Glenney Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and that most hepatoma cells do not express caveolin-1 (10Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to its high expression in many endothelial cells, including swine endothelial cells. It is also known that caveolin-1 is localized not only on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (11Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar) but also at the Golgi apparatus (12Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), where many glycosyltransferases function. Therefore, it is likely that caveolin-1 may function as a regulating factor for the functional localization of Golgi-resident enzymes.To evaluate this hypothesis, we prepared stable transformants that express GnT-III and caveolin-1, and the oligosaccharide structures produced were analyzed. As a result, we found that the expression of caveolin-1 leads to a dramatic decrease in the extent of branching of N-glycans because of the addition of a bisecting GlcNAc, a product of GnT-III, without the activation of GnT-III activity, suggesting that caveolin-1 regulates the functional localization of GnT-III, thereby modifying N-glycan biosynthesis. The present findings provide new information concerning the mechanism that controls the intra-Golgi functional sublocalization of glycosyltransferases and the organization of their actions in the oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Glycosidases were obtained from the following sources: sialidase (Arthrobacter ureafacies) from Nacarai tesque, β-galactosidase (jack bean) from Seikagaku Co., and α-fucosidase (bovine kidney) from Sigma. UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAc were obtained from Sigma. Pyridylaminated (PA) oligosaccharide standards were purchased from Takara. Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz, anti-GnT-III monoclonal antibody from FUJIREBIO Inc., horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody from Promega, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody from ICN Biomedicals Inc. Biotin-labeled lectins were obtained from Seikagaku Co. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara, Toyobo, or New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Greiner Japan. Other common chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals.Plasmid Construction—A full length of human caveolin-1 cDNA (9Glenney Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. PCR was performed with the primers 5′-ACACGAATTCATGTCTGGGGGCAAA-3′ and 5′-ACGCGAATTCTTATATTTCTTTCTGC-3′ to introduce the EcoRI site at both terminal ends. The amplified fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of a pCXN-II expression vector (13Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar), a generous gift from J. Miyazaki (Osaka University), and the resulting plasmid is referred to as pCXN-Cav. The absence of nucleotide misincorporation during PCR was verified by analysis of the nucleotide sequence.Cell Culture—Huh6 cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter of glucose (Nikken) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—Huh6 cells were transfected with pCXN-Cav and pCXN-GnT-III, an expression plasmid for hGnT-III subcloned into pCXN -II expression vector (14Tanemura M. Miyagawa S. Ihara Y. Matsuda H. Shirakura R. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in a complete medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. The surviving cell colonies were isolated after 10 days.Transient Expression—Expression plasmids were transfected into Huh6 cells by electroporation (15Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and resuspended. Plasmids (20 μg) purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation were added to the cell suspension (4 × 106), followed by electrification. The transfected cells were subjected to biochemical analyses 48 h after transfection.SDS-PAGE, Immunoblotting, and Lectin Blot Analysis—Cell monolayers were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a PROTORAN (Schleicher & Schuell), followed by blocking with 5% skim milk for immunoblotting or 2% bovine serum albumin for lectin blot analysis. The resulting membrane was incubated with the first antibody or biotin-labeled lectin. After washing, the membrane was reacted with the appropriate second antibody for immunoblotting or with an horseradish peroxidase-avidin complex (Vector Co.) for the lectin blot. The reactive signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—Equivalent amounts of lysate were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose conjugated to an anti-caveolin-1 antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed five times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The resulting samples were subjected to Western blotting as described above.Glycosyltransferases Activity Assay—GnT-III, -IV, and -V activities were assayed using fluorescence-labeled oligosaccharide acceptors, as described previously (17Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As acceptors, the PA-agalact-biantennary oligosaccharide was used for the reactions of GnT-III and GnT-V, and the PA-agalacto-triantennary oligosaccharide, a product of the reaction of GnT-V, was used for the assay of GnT-IV. Cell homogenates (5 μg of proteins) were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in the appropriate reaction buffer (17Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) containing 10 μm acceptor and 40 mm UDP-GlcNAc as a donor. The reaction was terminated by boiling, and the sample was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Shimadzu) using TSKgel ODS-80 (4.6 × 150; Tosoh). The solvent used was a 20 mm pH 4.0 ammonium acetate buffer, and the substrate and the product were separated isocratically. Fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence detector (RF-10AXL; Shimadzu) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively.Isolation, Labeling, and Characterization of the N-Glycans—The crude cellular membrane fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation. Briefly, cells (2 × 108) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and nuclei. The resulting supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended and sonicated in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. N-Glycans were isolated from the resulting membrane fraction, then labeled, and characterized as described by Ihara et al. (7Ihara H. Ikeda Y. Koyota S. Endo T. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the free oligosaccharides were liberated by hydrazinolysis at 100 °C for 10 h as described by Hase et al. (18Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The resulting oligosaccharides were reductively aminated with the fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine, and the PA-derivatives were separated by gel filtration on an HW-40 (Toyopear; Tosoh) column equilibrated with 10 mm NH4HCO3 (19Kuraya N. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The PA sugar chains were treated with sialidase, β-galactosidase, and α-fucosidase. The digested PA sugar chains were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (Shimadzu) using a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh). The solvent used was a 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.1– 0.25% butanol. Various PA sugar chains were used as standards.Incorporation of Caveolin-1 into a High Molecular Weight Complex— The cells were removed by scraping in the presence of a 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 60 mm octylglucoside and incubated on ice for 30 min. After removal of cellular debris and nuclei by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant material was loaded on the top of a linear 5–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 16 h at 34,000 × g in a Beckmann TLN-100 rotor. The fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Fraction of Triton X-100-insoluble Membranes—Each dish of cells was washed in ice-cold MES buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then scraped from the dish into 150 μl of MES buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The cells were further incubated on ice for 20 min before homogenizing the sample with a homogenizer. The homogenates were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and mixed with an equal volume of 2.5 m sucrose. The sample was then overlaid with a 10 –30% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 16 h at 30,000 × g in a Beckmann TLN-100 rotor. The fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and the total protein in each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Protease Protection Assay—A protease protection assay was performed as previously described (20Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 21Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 100-mm cell culture dish were collected in 1 ml of buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tricine, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) and homogenized. The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation with 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckmann TLA-45 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer consisting of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide and transferred to microtubes. Each sample was then incubated for 15 min on ice either in buffer alone, 100 μg/ml trypsin, or trypsin plus 1% Triton X-100. Each sample was resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed.Protein Determination—The protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo evaluate the effect of caveolin-1 on GnT-III action and on N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, several lines of transformants were established using human hepatoma Huh6 cells, which do not endogenously express caveolin-1 (10Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of caveolin-1 was confirmed by an immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A) and reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). On the other hand, Huh6 cells have GnT-III activity, albeit at low level (Fig. 1B), but GnT-III protein could not be detected by an immunoblot analysis probably because of its low expression (Fig. 1A). In Huh(GIII) cells, which were established by transfection with the GnT-III expression plasmid, the GnT-III activity was 60 times higher than that in parental Huh6 cells, whereas the activities of other GnT enzymes examined were nearly the same (Fig. 1). In conjunction with the increased activity, the GnT-III protein was increased to a detectable level in the immunoblot analysis. By the transfection of Huh6 cells with a caveolin-1 expression plasmid, three clones of transformants, Huh(cav) cells, which express caveolin-1, were also established, as shown in Fig. 1A. The GnT-III activity in the Huh(cav) cells was decreased only slightly, compared with its activity in the parental cells, and the activities of GnT-IV and GnT-V were variable regardless of the expression of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1B), probably because of clonal selection. This suggests that caveolin-1 does not have great effect on the expression and activities of these glycosyltransferases.Using these stable transformants, the functional consequence of caveolin-1 expression on oligosaccharide structures was investigated. Lectin blot analyses were first carried out using erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E4-PHA), leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (L4-PHA), and wheat germ agglutinin lectins (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, all three Huh(cav) cell clones reacted with E4-PHA, which preferentially binds to bisected oligosaccharides, to a level comparable with that of Huh(GIII) in which GnT-III is overexpressed, despite no increase in GnT-III activity. In the case of lectin blotting using wheat germ agglutinin, however, the staining pattern in the Huh(cav) cells differed from that in the Huh(GIII) cells (Fig. 2B). This clearly shows that caveolin-1 causes structural alterations of oligosaccharides that are distinct from the case of the increased activity of GnT-III, as found in the Huh(GIII) cells, although the levels of bisecting GlcNAc are increased in both type of transfectants. As shown by the L4-PHA blotting results (Fig. 2C), no significant difference was detected among the parental Huh6 cells, Huh(cav) and Huh(GIII), although GnT-V activities were varied (Fig. 1B).Fig. 2Detection of the alteration of oligosaccharide structures by lectin blot analyses. Membrane fractions of Huh6 cells were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transferring to the membrane, glycoproteins were detected using E4-PHA (A), wheat germ agglutinin (B), and L4-PHA (C) lectins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For further evaluation, pyridylaminated forms of total N-glycans were also prepared from the cells and then analyzed with respect to core structures by reversed phase HPLC. The elution profiles of the pyridylaminated oligosaccharides from parental Huh6, Huh(cav), and Huh(GIII) cells are shown in Fig. 3. In the case of Huh(cav) cells, clone 3 was selected, because the enzyme activities of GnT-IV and GnT-V were nearly equal to those of parental Huh6 and Huh(GIII). Because biantennary and tetra-antennary nonbisected sugar chains were not separated under the chromatographic conditions used, the overlapping peaks were collected and reseparated under different conditions, i.e. isocratically (data not shown). The relative amounts of the eight possible structures of the core are summarized in Fig. 4. The overexpression of GnT-III increased the amount of whole bisected oligosaccharides to almost two times as much, consistent with the increase in enzyme activity (Fig. 4A), but the ratio of the oligosaccharides with multiantennae, triantennae, and tetra-antennae relative to the total sugar chains remained unchanged (Fig. 4B). These multiantennary structures suggest that GnT-III acted after GnT-IV and GnT-V. On the other hand, caveolin-1 expression led to an increase in the levels of the bisected oligosaccharides (Fig. 4A), although GnT-III activity was not increased (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the case of GnT-III overexpression, moreover, the formation of multiantennary structures with the bisecting GlcNAc was significantly inhibited (Fig. 4C). In the Huh(cav) cells, the bisected tetra-antennary structure was not detected (Figs. 3B and 4C), and more than 75% of the bisected oligosaccharides were biantennary sugar chains (Fig. 4C). As shown in earlier substrate specificity studies (2Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it has been reported that GnT-IV and GnT-V are unable to act on bisected sugar chains in vitro, whereas GnT-III is capable of reacting with any types of chain, i.e. bi-, tri-, or tetra-antennary. Therefore, these marked alterations in the structural profiles provide reasonable evidence to indicate that caveolin-1 allows the prior action of GnT-III on the nascent oligosaccharides relative to other GnTs, which serve as common acceptor substrates in the Golgi apparatus. It is likely that caveolin-1 regulates the subcompartment distribution of GnT-III within the Golgi apparatus.Fig. 3Structural analysis of the sugar chains from parental Huh6, Huh(GIII), and Huh(cav) cells. Defucosylated PA-agalacto-sugar chains prepared from total cellular oligosaccharides were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (A–C).

To assess a mechanism underlying the regulation of the oligosaccharide biosynthesis by caveolin-1, the interaction between GnT-III and caveolin-1 was examined. Huh cells endogenously expressed GnT-III activity, but the protein level was much lower than the detectable level in the immunoblot analysis, as shown in Fig. 1. Probably because of this low protein level, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous GnT-III protein with caveolin-1 was not successful (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Hence, GnT-III was transiently transfected in Huh(cav) cells to analyze their association.Fig. 5Association and topology of GnT-III and caveolin-1. A, GnT-III was transiently expressed in Huh6 cells (lane 2) and Huh(cav) cells (lanes 3 and 4). The lysates from resulting cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody (lanes 1–3) or control antibody (lane 4). Co-precipitating proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-GnT-III antibody (middle panel) and anti-caveolin-1 antibody (lower panel). The initial amount of GnT-III was also indicated (upper panel). B, protease protection assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a result, GnT-III was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1. Although a small amount of GnT-III was also precipitated with a control antibody (Fig. 5A, lane 4) or beads alone (data not shown), probably because of nonspecific binding, the amount of GnT-III in the precipitate with the anti-caveolin-1 antibody was clearly increased (Fig. 5A, lane 3), indicating that G"

Although the <i>TP53</i> gene is frequently mutated in human cancers, the <i>TP73</i> gene is rarely inactivated. We have found that p73α is highly expressed in a significant fraction of anaplastic thyroid cancer, whereas it is not detectable in normal thyroid epithelial cells or in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, the tumor suppression function of p73α is actively restrained in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. We have also found that c-Abl tyrosine kinase, an activator of p73, is excluded from the nucleus of p73α-positive thyroid cancer cells; whereas c-Abl undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling in normal thyroid and p73-negative thyroid cancer cells. We constructed an AblNuk-FK506-binding protein (FKBP) fusion protein to enforce the nuclear accumulation of an inducible Abl kinase. Activation of this nuclear AblNuk-FKBP by dimerization with AP20187 in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells increased the levels of p73α and p21Cip1 and caused p73-dependent apoptosis. These results suggest subcellular segregation of c-Abl from p73 to be a strategy for disrupting the tumor suppression function of p73α."

https://openalex.org/W2037945577,"We have previously shown that the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 (LAT-2: amino acid transporter) is expressed in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelia and is associated with β1 integrin (Merlin, D., Sitaraman, S., Liu, X., Easterburn, K., Sun, J., Kucharzik, T., Lewis, B., and Madara, J. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39282–39289). In the present study we examined the interaction of CD98/LAT2 with intracellular adhesion molecule I (ICAM-1) and the potential of such interaction on the activation of intracellular signal in Caco2-BBE cell monolayers. ICAM-1 was found to be expressed to the basolateral domain and to selectively coimmunoprecipitate with CD98/LAT-2 in Caco2-BBE monolayers. Using antibodies as ligands to CD98 and ICAM-1, we demonstrate that the basolateral cross-linking of CD98 and ICAM-1 differentially affects the intrinsic activity of the LAT-2 transporter. Whereas CD98 ligation decreases the Km and Vm of the LAT-2 transporter, ICAM-1 ligation increases Km and Vm of the amino acid transporter LAT-2. In addition, basolateral cross-linking of CD98 or ICAM-1 induces threonine phosphorylation of an ∼160-kDa supramolecular complex that is consistent with CD98/LAT-2-ICAM-1 complex. Together these findings demonstrate that (i) CD98/LAT-2 interacts with ICAM-1 in Caco2-BBE cell monolayers, and (ii) CD98 and ICAM-1 ligands generate intracellular signals that regulate the amino acids transporter (LAT-2) activity. Our data provide a novel mechanism by which events such as adhesion may be integrated by amino acid transport activity resulting from the direct interaction of cell surface molecules such as CD98 and ICAM-1. We have previously shown that the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 (LAT-2: amino acid transporter) is expressed in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelia and is associated with β1 integrin (Merlin, D., Sitaraman, S., Liu, X., Easterburn, K., Sun, J., Kucharzik, T., Lewis, B., and Madara, J.

Our data provide a novel mechanism by which events such as adhesion may be integrated by amino acid transport activity resulting from the direct interaction of cell surface molecules such as CD98 and ICAM-1. Glycoprotein CD98 is a cell surface heterodimer formed by the covalent linkage of CD98 heavy chain with several different light chains to form amino acid transporters (1Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pflug. Arch. 2000; 440: 503-512Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 is found only in tissues containing epithelial barriers (2Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Google Scholar, 3Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39282-39289Google Scholar). The amino acid transporter LAT-2, a protein of 535 amino acids, is highly expressed in polarized epithelia (4Pineda M. Fernandez E. Torrents D. Estevez R. Lopez C. Camps M. Lloberas A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19738-19744Google Scholar, 5Rossier G. Meir C. Bauch C. Summa V. Sordat B. Verrey F. Kuhn C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34948-34954Google Scholar). In absorptive epithelia of the small intestine and in the small intestine-like cell line Caco2-BBE monolayers, the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 is polarized to the basolateral side (3Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39282-39289Google Scholar). There is a growing literature implicating CD98 in integrin function (6Fenczik C. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Google Scholar, 7Zent R. Fenczik C.A. Calderwood. D.A. Liu S. Dellos M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5059-5064Google Scholar, 8Fenczik C.A. Zent R. Dellos M. Calderwood D.A. Satriano J. Kelly C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8746-8752Google Scholar). Recently we have demonstrated (3Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39282-39289Google Scholar) that β1 integrins, which are also polarized basolaterally in intestinal epithelial cells, associate with CD98/LAT-2. We found that CD98 not only influences β1 integrin distribution but also affects the cell shape and cytoskeletal order, features known to depend on β1 integrin function (14Mooseker M.S. Annu. Rev. Biol. 1985; 209: 209-241Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD98 interacts specifically with β1 integrins but not with the muscle-specific splice variant β1D or the leukocyte-specific β7 integrin (6Fenczik C. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Google Scholar). The basolateral location of CD98 suggests that this protein could be involved in some form of cell signaling where binding of ligand to the extracellular loop of CD98 results in an alteration in cellular function via the regulation of the amino acid transporter (LAT-2 in the intestine) and β1 integrin functions (9Rintoul R.C. Buttery R.C. Mackinnon A.C. Wong W.S. Mosher D. Haslett C. Sethi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2841-2852Google Scholar). At present, possible ligands for CD98 remain to be determined, but it was reported that galectin-3, a 26-kDa β-galactosidase binding protein of the galectin family (10Dong S. Hughes R.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 165-169Google Scholar, 11Deves R. Boyd C.A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 173: 165-177Google Scholar), could bind to CD98 on T cells. It is possible that CD98 activation could regulate the activity of the amino acid transporter LAT-2. Because epithelial cells rest on the extracellular matrix (ECM), it is logical to expect specific interactions between basolateral “receptors” such as CD98 or ICAM-11 1The abbreviation used is: ICAM, intracellular adhesion molecule. 1The abbreviation used is: ICAM, intracellular adhesion molecule. and ECM. Indeed, upon binding to ECM ligands (outside), integrins deliver signals that control cell proliferation, gene induction, differentiation, and proliferation. The basolateral location of the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 suggests that CD98 may interact with other adhesion molecules. Among adhesion proteins, the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 has been shown to be expressed in inflamed epithelial cells (12Kaiserlian D. Rigal D. Abello J. Revillard J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2415-2421Google Scholar, 13Etienne-Manneville S. Manneville J.B. Adamson P. Wilbourn B. Greenwood J. Couraud P.O. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3375-3383Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is known to be the receptor to the heterodimer of CD11a, and CD18 (β2 integrin) is expressed in leukocytes. It is conceivable that in the intestinal epithelia, ICAM-1 may be part of a multicomponent web that includes CD98/LAT2 and integrin β1. The multicomponent web could orchestrate epithelial cell function such as LAT-2-mediated amino acid transport activity. We hypothesized that the amino acid transporter LAT-2 may be regulated by adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and CD98 in epithelial cells. In the present study we investigate (i) the expression of ICAM-1 in intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2-BBE, (ii) the possibility that ICAM-1 interacts with CD98/LAT-2, and (iii) the effects of cross-linking ICAM-1 and CD98 on LAT-2-mediated amino acid transport activity.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28182-28190Google Scholar) cells were grown as confluent monolayers in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Vogt-modified Eagle's media and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 14 mm NaHCO3, and 10% new-born calf serum. Monolayers were subcultured every 7 days by trypsinization with 0.1% trypsin and 0.9 mm EDTA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cell surface biotinylation and cross-linking studies were carried out with confluent monolayers plated on collagen-coated permeable supports (area 0.3 cm2, pore size 0.4 μm) and examined 10 days post-plating. RT-PCR of ICAM-1 Expression—The expression of ICAM-1 in Caco2-BBE cells was determined using an RT-PCR method with oligonucleotide primers specific for ICAM-1. Total RNA was isolated from confluent Caco2-BBE cells cultured on plastic supports (area: 9.4 cm2) for 14 days with a Micro Fast Track™ kit (Invitrogen). The yield of RNA from each preparation was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. 1 μg of total RNA was primed with oligo(dT) and reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (cDNA cycle kit; Invitrogen). A dilution of the reverse transcription reaction was used as a template for amplification by PCR. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, PCR of the samples was carried out for 35 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. This was followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. For detection of ICAM-1, the primers specific for ICAM-1 corresponded to nucleotide positions 53–70 (sense: 5′-TCGCTATGGCTCCCAGCA-3′) and 1662–1645 (antisense: 5′-ATAGGTTCAGGGAGGCG-3′) of the cDNA (GenBank™ GI:220-51567) were used that yield a product of 1,592 bp. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, visualized by ethidium bromide, and verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Filter-grown cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Basolateral or apical sides of the monolayers were incubated with freshly prepared sulfosuccinimidobiotin (s-NHS-biotine; Pierce) diluted in the same solution (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and cells were lysed with a solution of 1% (wv) Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin supplemented with protease inhibitors. The protein solution was diluted with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) for 24 h at 4 °C to bind biotinylated proteins. The protein solution was then boiled in sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol without β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight at 4 °C to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in blocking buffer. After washing with blocking buffer, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-CD98 (goat anti-CD98 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), sheep anti-ICAM-1 (sheep anti-ICAM-1 from R&D Systems). They were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody diluted 1:1000 and probed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40) containing 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pepstatin, 2 mm serine proteases. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-agarose suspension (50 μlof beads). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s in a microfuge. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and the appropriate amount of specific antibody (1:1000 dilution of goat anti-CD98 (RDI), sheep anti-ICAM-1) was added and gently rocked for4hat 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 μl of protein G suspension was added to the mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s by microfuge. The beads were washed two times for 20 min with buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40), buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P40), and buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P40). 50 μl of gel loading buffer (1% (wv) Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin supplemented with protease inhibitors 2% SDS) was added to the agarose pellet and boiled 5 min at 100 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred overnight at 4 °C to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in blocking buffer. After washing with blocking buffer, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-CD98 (RDI), sheep anti-ICAM-1. They were further incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody diluted 1:1000 and probed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking CD98 and ICAM-1—Caco2-BBE cells were grown to confluence on permeable supports (area: 0.6 cm2; pore size: 0.4 μm). Before the experiment, Caco2-BBE monolayers were washed three times with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Caco2-BBE monolayers were incubated apically with 200 μl of incubation medium and basolaterally with 500 μl of incubation medium containing 5, 10, or 20 μg/ml CD98 or ICAM-1 antibody with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) or with only the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. Amino Acid Transport Uptake Assay—We investigated the effect of cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1 on amino acid (leucine) transport across basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE monolayers. Cells grown on filters were washed twice with a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After CD98 or ICAM-1 cross-linking (see above), Caco2-BBE monolayers were transferred in new wells in Na+-free buffer containing [14C]leucine at different concentrations, 100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.2, to the basolateral reservoir and 100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 to the apical reservoir. Uptakes were performed for 2 min at 37 °C; washing each filter in buffer solution at 4 °C stopped the reaction. The radioactivity of each filter was determined by liquid scintillation. Amino Acid Efflux Assay—We investigated the effect of cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1 on amino acid (leucine) efflux across basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE monolayers. Cells grown on filters were washed twice with a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After CD98 or ICAM-1 cross-linking (see above), Caco2-BBE monolayers were incubated basolaterally with 500 μl of incubation medium (Na+ free buffer: 100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.2) containing 2 μm [14C]leucine and apically with 250 μl of unlabeled Na+-free buffer medium for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the monolayers were rapidly washed four times on both sides with unlabeled incubation medium. The filter containing the monolayers was moved to new wells containing 500 μl of unlabeled medium, and 250 μl of unlabeled medium was added to the upper reservoir. To measure basolateral leucine effluxes, 500 μl of the incubation medium was taken from the basolateral reservoir after 2 min at 37 °C. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactivity of sample was determined by liquid scintillation. Expression of ICAM-1 in Caco2-BBE Monolayers—Expression of ICAM-1 mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR in Caco2-BBE cells. Primers were used that yielded ∼1.6 kb product. Fig. 1A shows that Caco2-BBE expressed the 1.6-kb product. The PCR product was purified from 1% agarose gel using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.), and the sequence showed 100% homology sequence to the published coding sequence of ICAM-1 (bases 53–1662). Additionally, ICAM-1 was detected at the protein level by Western blotting in Caco2-BBE cells (Fig. 1B). Using the anti-human ICAM-1 antibody, Caco2-BBE cell lysates displayed a single immunoreactive band corresponding to ∼90 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1) that was comparable with the immunoreactive band from the recombinant ICAM-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). ICAM-1 Is Expressed at Both Apical and Basolateral Membranes of Caco2-BBE Monolayers—The membrane localization of the human ICAM-1 was assessed in confluent Caco2-BBE monolayers. We examined the plasma membrane expression of ICAM-1 by surface biotinylation. Plasma membrane domain-specific cell surface membrane glycoproteins were labeled by biotinylation of each plasma membrane domain (apical and basolateral). Western blot using the anti-human ICAM-1 displayed one immunoreactive band at ∼90 kDa that was expressed on both apical and basolateral membranes in Caco2-BBE monolayers (Fig. 1C). The ICAM-1 expression in the basolateral membrane of Caco2-BBE monolayers suggests that ICAM-1 could interact with other basolaterally expressed proteins such as CD98 (Fig. 1D). As described previously, Western blot using the anti-CD98 displayed one immunoreactive band at ∼130 kDa under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1D) that is predominantly expressed on the basolateral membrane. We have previously shown that this 130 kDa represents the covalent association between CD98 and LAT-2 (14Mooseker M.S. Annu. Rev. Biol. 1985; 209: 209-241Google Scholar). ICAM-1 Associates with CD98 —To investigate whether ICAM-1 associates with CD98, immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Caco2-BBE cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for CD98 (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3) or ICAM-1 (lanes 2 and 4). ICAM-1 and CD98 immunoprecipitates were detected by either CD98 (lanes 1 and 2) or ICAM-1 (lanes 3 and 4) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and 2) immunoreactive bands (∼160 and ∼85 kDa) were found when ICAM-1 and CD98 immunoprecipitates were detected by the CD98 antibody. The ∼160-kDa band is likely CD98/LAT2-complexed to other molecules, and the ∼85 kDa represents the glycosylated CD98 monomer. In addition, ICAM-1 and CD98 immunoprecipitates displayed two immunoreactive bands at ∼160 and ∼90 kDa when detected by ICAM-1 antibody (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The ∼160-kDa band is likely to be the result of the association between the CD98/LAT-2 heterodimer and ICAM-1 because the CD98 or the ICAM-1 immunoprecipitates displayed this particular band when probed by the anti-CD98, the anti-ICAM-1, or the anti-LAT-2 (data not shown) antibody. The ∼90 kDa represents ICAM-1 because the recombinant ICAM-1 provided the same molecular band when detected by ICAM-1 antibody (Fig. 2, lane 5). Together, these results suggest that ICAM-1 interacts with the CD98 monomer and the CD98 heterodimer in Caco2-BBE cells. Cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1 Regulates Leucine Uptake across Basolateral Membranes in Caco2-BBE Monolayers—The light chain of CD98 has been demonstrated to function as an l-type amino acid transporter. We examined whether cross-linking CD98 with the human anti-CD98 or cross-linking with anti-ICAM-1 (see “Materials and Methods”) had any effect on amino acid transport using an assay that measures tritiated leucine uptake into cells. Uptake experiments were performed in Na+-free buffer at pH 6.2, the optimal conditions for LAT-2-mediated amino acid uptake. To examine whether CD98 or ICAM-1 ligation affects leucine uptake by modifying the intrinsic activity of the amino acid transporter, the effect of basolateral CD98 or ICAM-1 ligation on the kinetics of [3H]leucine uptake was studied. Kinetics analysis of the data (Fig. 3) indicated that CD98 ligation significantly decreased the Vmax (Vmax(control) = 1256 + 160 versus Vmax(CD98 ligation) = 576 + 47.7 mmol/mg protein/2 min) and the Km of the transporter (Km(control) = 7.45 + 1.86 versus 3.01 + 0.69 mm). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4 ICAM-1 ligation significantly increased the Vmax (Vmax(control) = 1306 + 336 versus Vmax(ICAM-1 ligation) = 3504 + 1200 mmol/mg protein/2 min) and the Km of the transporter (Km(control) = 7.65 + 3.80 versus 24.8 + 11.3 mm). Together these data demonstrate that CD98 and ICAM-1 ligation differently affects the intrinsic activity of the amino acid transporter in Caco2-BBE monolayers.Fig. 4The effects of cross-linking ICAM-1 on leucine uptake LAT-2-mediated transport across basolateral membrane in Caco2-BBE monolayers. The concentration dependence of l-leucine uptake for 2 min was determined in the Na+-free uptake solution at pH 6.20 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentration dependence profile for leucine transport was shifted by cross-linking ICAM-1. The values were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten curve. 20 μg/ml of the ICAM-1 antibody with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (+anti-ICAM-1) or only the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (–anti-ICAM-1) were added to the basolateral aspect of Caco2-BBE monolayers for 1 h at 37 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” All data are the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Amino Acid Efflux across Basolateral Membranes of Caco2-BBE Is Regulated by CD98 and ICAM-1 Ligations—The efflux of radioactivity across basolateral membranes of the Caco2-BBE monolayers preloaded with [14C]leucine was measured in the absence of extracellular l-leucine in the extracellular medium (see “Materials and Methods”). Adding l-leucine into the extracellular medium did not significantly increase the l-[14C]leucine efflux (data not shown) that is one of the characteristics of LAT-2 amino acid transporter. Fig. 5, A and B shows that cross-linking basolateral CD98 and cross-linking basolateral ICAM-1 in Caco2-BBE monolayers induced a concentration-dependent increase of [3H]leucine efflux when compared with the controls (basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE were incubated with only the appropriate secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution)). The increase of [3H]leucine efflux began to occur significantly at 5 μg/ml CD98 or ICAM-1 antibody concentration (anti-CD98:14.2% increase 0.3883 + 0.0130 versus 0.4435 + 0.0367 nmol/mg protein/2 min; anti-ICAM-1: 32.0% increase 0.4631 + 0.0114 versus 0.6111 + 0.0672 nmol/mg protein/2 min). At 10 μg/ml CD98 antibody or ICAM-1 antibody concentration, the [3H]leucine efflux across basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE monolayers was 24.0 and 44.0%, respectively (anti-CD98: 0.3883 + 0.0130 versus 0.4824 + 0.0543 nmol/mg protein/2 min; anti-ICAM-1: 0.4631 + 0.0114 versus 0.6693 + 0.0646 nmol/mg protein/2 min), and achieved a 27.4.7% increase at 20 μg/ml CD98 antibody (0.3883 + 0.0130 versus 0.4950 + 0.040 nmol/mg protein/2 min) and a 58.8% increase at 20 μg/ml ICAM-1 antibody (0.4631 + 0.0114 versus 0.7321 + 0.0451 nmol/mg protein/2 min). These results demonstrate that CD98 and ICAM-1 may be important for controlling the LAT-2-mediated amino acid efflux across basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE monolayers. Basolateral CD98 and ICAM-1 Ligations Induce Same Pattern of Threonine Phosphorylation of a 160-kDa Protein in Caco2-BBE Monolayers—Basolateral CD98 and ICAM-1 ligations in Caco2-BBE monolayers were performed for1hat37 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” Caco2-BBE cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for CD98 or ICAM-1. ICAM-1 and CD98 immunoprecipitates were detected by anti-phosphothreonine antibody. The CD98 (Fig. 6, lane 1) and ICAM-1 (lane 5) immunoprecipitates display an ∼160-kDa band that was induced by basolateral CD98 ligation (CD98 control ligation; Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 6). In addition, ICAM-1 (Fig. 6, lane 7) immunoprecipitate displays the same induced 160-kDa band after ICAM-1 ligation (control ICAM-1 ligation; Fig. 6, lane 8). In contrast, CD98 (Fig. 6, lane 3) immunoprecipitate did not display the 160-kDa band after ICAM-1 ligation (control ICAM-1 ligation; Fig. 6, lane 4), suggesting that ICAM-1 ligation induced a less potent protein phosphorylation than CD98 ligation. The detected phosphorylated protein at 160 kDa is likely to be CD98 or one of the molecules complexed to CD98 that immunoprecipitates at ∼160 kDa. We have demonstrated that ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed on basolateral and apical membranes of Caco2-BBE monolayers. These results are in agreement with studies showing that the well differentiated Caco2-BBE cell line shows the highest constitutive expression of ICAM-1 when compared with other less differentiated cell lines such as T84 or HT29 (12Kaiserlian D. Rigal D. Abello J. Revillard J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2415-2421Google Scholar). The expression of ICAM-1 in the basolateral aspect of Caco2-BBE monolayers makes these cells an appropriate cellular model for study of the interaction of ICAM-1 with other basolaterally expressed proteins. ICAM-1 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays an important role in cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and cellular interactions such as the immune response (17Maruo Y. Gochi A. Kaihara A. Shimamura H. Yamada T. Tanaka N. Orita K. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 486-490Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that ICAM-1 associates with the heterodimer CD98/LAT2. This result suggests that to accomplish a task such as adhesion ICAM-1 works not only as an individual receptor but also as a component of supramolecular complexes at the plasma membrane in epithelial cells. In addition, the association of the heterodimer CD98/LAT-2 and ICAM-1 suggest that there may be significant cellular regulation mediated by this supramolecular complex. The complex may induce signals, via the amino acid transporter LAT-2, to regulate multiple aspects of cell physiology. For example, regulation of intracellular amino acid availability mediated by LAT-2 transport activity may modulate the activity-signaling pathway, which leads to phosphorylation of an intracellular target protein. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the intracellular amino acid supply modulates several important regulatory translation factors through a variety of mechanisms (18van Sluijters D.A. Dubbelhuis P.F. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 545-550Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that amino acid leucine availability regulates the activity of the signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of p70 S6 kinase (the 70-kDa protein kinase acting on ribosomal protein S6) (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Google Scholar, 20Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1, which somehow mimics natural ligands for these proteins, modifies leucine LAT-2-mediated transport activity. Interestingly, cross-linking CD98 and ICAM-1 differentially affects the LAT-2 transport activity. CD98 disulfide linked to LAT-2 is basolaterally expressed in intestinal epithelia and in Caco2-BBE (3Merlin D. Sitaraman S. Liu X. Eastburn K. Sun J. Kucharzik T. Lewis B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39282-39289Google Scholar); the resulting dimer is the minimal functional unit for a Na+-independent transporter for zwitterionic amino acids. The extracellular domain of CD98 is responsible for recognition of LAT-2, and that extracellular domain ensures proper translocation to the plasma membrane (1Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pflug. Arch. 2000; 440: 503-512Google Scholar). The mode of regulation of amino acid transport by both subunits (CD98 and LAT-2) and the possible interplay between them remain largely unstudied. In the present study we show that cross-linking CD98 affects the intrinsic activity of the LAT-2 transporter by increasing the affinity and reducing the capacity of LAT-2-mediated uptake of leucine. In addition, we demonstrate that cross-linking CD98 regulates the LAT-2-dependent leucine efflux. However, it will be of interest to characterize the transport kinetics of LAT-2 for the export amino acids to know whether this amino transporter shows an asymmetric amino acid transport function. Interestingly, we demonstrate that cross-linking ICAM-1 decreases the affinity and increases the capacity of LAT-2-mediated leucine uptake. Furthermore, cross-linking of ICAM-1 increases leucine efflux across the basolateral membranes of Caco2-BBE. We suggest that the transport activity changes are the result of a direct or indirect phosphorylation of the LAT-2 transporter. Cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1 induces threonine phosphorylation of an ∼160-kDa supramolecular complex that is likely composed of CD98/LAT-2-ICAM-1. Interestingly, CD98, LAT-2, and ICAM-1 proteins have predicted threonine phosphorylation sites; thus, cross-linking of CD98 or ICAM-1 may phosphorylate one or more proteins of the complex comprised of CD98, LAT-2, and ICAM-1. Cross-linking CD98 or ICAM-1 may induce phosphorylation of LAT-2 itself on threonine and change transport activity of LAT-2, or phosphorylation of associated proteins such as ICAM-1 or CD98 may influence LAT-2 transport activity. In conclusion, the amino acid transporter LAT-2 is regulated by adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and CD98 in epithelial cells. CD98 and ICAM-1 may play a role in delivering intracellular signals. Changes in amino acid transport activity resulting from CD98 and ICAM interaction may ensure integration of events such as cell adhesion."

Using a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay, we determined that the recombinant knob domain of the fiber protein from adenovirus serotype (Ad) 2 binds the soluble, N-terminal domain (domain 1 (D1)) of CAR with 8-fold greater affinity than does the recombinant knob domain from Ad12. Homology modeling predicted that the increased affinity of Ad2 knob for CAR D1 could result from additional contacts within the binding interface contributed by two residues, Ser408 and Tyr477, which are not conserved in the Ad12 knob. Consistent with this structural model, substitution of serine and tyrosine for the corresponding residues in the Ad12 knob (P417S and S489Y) increased the binding affinity by 4- and 8-fold, respectively, whereas the double mutation increased binding affinity 10-fold. X-ray structure analysis of Ad12 knob mutants P417S and S489Y indicated that both substituted residues potentially could form additional hydrogen bonds across the knob-CAR interface. Structural changes resulting from these mutations were highly localized, implying that the high tolerance for surface variation conferred by the stable knob scaffold can minimize the impact of antigenic drift on binding specificity and affinity during evolution of virus serotypes. Our results suggest that the interaction of knob domains from different adenovirus serotypes with CAR D1 can be accurately modeled using the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 crystal structure as a template.

Our results suggest that the interaction of knob domains from different adenovirus serotypes with CAR D1 can be accurately modeled using the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 crystal structure as a template. Interaction of animal viruses with their cellular receptors is of particular interest because the viral proteins that function in molecular recognition are subject to immunoselective pressure to vary their antigenic structure. The potentially negative impact of antigenic variation on recognition of the cellular receptor is minimized in some virus families by protein structural features that shield receptor-binding sites from attack by host-neutralizing antibodies (1Rossmann M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14587-14590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In adenoviruses, by contrast, receptor-binding sites are exposed and highly variable in sequence. Therefore, adenovirus-receptor interaction presents an opportunity to observe the range of structural plasticity that can be tolerated without loss of binding specificity. Receptor-binding function in adenoviruses is associated with viral fibers (2Philipson L. Lonberg-Holm K. Pettersson U. J. Virol. 1968; 2: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J.

Virol. 1985; 56: 439-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that protrude from each vertex of the icosahedral virus capsid. The distal end of viral fibers consists of a globular domain, the head or knob domain, which has receptor binding activity (5Henry L.J. Xia D. Wilke M.E. Deisenhofer J. Gerard R.D. J.

Human adenoviral fiber proteins have evolved to recognize several different host cell receptors (7Wu E. Fernandez J. Fleck S.K. Von Seggern D.J. Huang S. Nemerow G.R. Virology. 2001; 279: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Stevenson S.C. Rollence M. White B. Weaver L. McClelland A. J.

Representative serotypes from adenovirus subgroups A, C, D, E, and F have been shown to interact with CAR (12Roelvink P.W. Lizonova A. Lee J.G. Li Y. Bergelson J.M. Finberg R.W. Brough D.E. Kovesdi I. Wickham T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7909-7915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CAR may be the most common receptor used by human adenoviruses. The CAR protein spans the cell plasma membrane once and has two extracellular Ig domains derived from the N-terminal region of the polypeptide. The CAR N-terminal Ig variable-type domain (D1) alone is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the fiber protein knob domain (13Wang X. Bergelson J.M. J.

Although interaction of viruses with receptors such as CAR that have low expression levels on cell apical surfaces appears paradoxical, recent studies suggest that this arrangement could facilitate the spread of virus infection within tissues and transmission of virus particles to new hosts, because progeny virus particles are released preferentially from the basal-lateral surfaces of infected cells (19Walters R.

X-ray structures of recombinant knob domains from the fiber proteins of adenovirus serotypes 2, 3, 5, and 12 have been determined (22Xia D. Henry L.J. Gerard R.D. Deisenhofer J.

Knob monomers assemble into remarkably stable trimers (26Hong J.S. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7071-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting from a large number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the noncovalent trimer interface (23van Raaij M.J. Louis N. Chroboczek J. Cusack S. Virology. 1999; 262: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Variations in polypeptide chain length are accommodated by changes in the length of surface loops, whereas other sequence variations appear to have had minimal effects on the underlying β-sandwich scaffold. Structures of CAR D1 alone and in complex with the Ad12 knob also have been solved (24Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 27van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Zandt H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CAR D1 has a β-sandwich fold that is characteristic of Ig variable domains (28Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 binary complex indicates that no conformational rearrangement occurs in either molecule upon complex formation and that over 50% of the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 interfacial contacts involve residues within the knob AB loop, with the knob DE and EG loops also providing additional contact residues (24Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the CAR binding activities of Ad5 and Ad12 knobs is consistent with the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 x-ray structure, suggesting that the location of the CAR D1-binding sites on knob domains from different serotypes is conserved (24Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 30Roelvink P.W. Mi Lee G. Einfeld D.A. Kovesdi I. Wickham T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1568-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The trimeric knob domain has three identical binding sites for CAR D1 that can be occupied simultaneously, as observed in the x-ray structure of the binary complex and in surface plasmon resonance experiments (24Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 31Lortat-Jacob H. Chouin E. Cusack S. van Raaij M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9009-9015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alignment of the Ad12 knob amino acid sequence with sequences of knob domains from other CAR-binding serotypes indicated that contact residues are not well conserved. For example, of the 15 total contact residues in Ad12 knob, only six are identical in the Ad5 knob, whereas eight are identical in the knob from Ad41L (32Kirby I. Lord R. Davison E. Wickham T.J. Roelvink P.W. Kovesdi I. Sutton B.J. Santis G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7210-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This extensive variation of contact residues implies that the mechanism of knob-CAR interaction could differ significantly among adenovirus serotypes. Individual contact residues at structurally analogous positions might differ considerably in their relative contributions to binding affinity, as suggested recently in a comparison of the interaction of recombinant knob domains from Ad5 and Ad9 with CAR D1 (31Lortat-Jacob H. Chouin E. Cusack S. van Raaij M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9009-9015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Kirby I. Lord R. Davison E. Wickham T.J. Roelvink P.W. Kovesdi I. Sutton B.J. Santis G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7210-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One question arising from such studies is whether the relative positions of knob and CAR D1 in binary complexes changes significantly with the variation of contact residues in the knob component. This question could be addressed directly by solving crystal structures of knob-CAR binary complexes, but so far we have been unable to obtain diffracting crystals of binary complexes involving knob domains from any adenovirus serotypes other than Ad12, for reasons not presently understood. In this study, we investigated the structural basis for the difference in affinity between Ad2 and Ad12 knob for CAR D1 by first constructing homology models of Ad2 knob-CAR D1 binary complexes to predict important differences in contact residues between the two serotypes. Ad12 knob mutants were then constructed to test these predictions, both in functional binding assays and ultimately in crystal structure determination of binary complexes of the mutant knob proteins with CAR D1. Together, our results suggest that mutation of individual contact residues, as might occur during antigenic drift, in many cases only incrementally decreases affinity for the receptor. Partial retention of binding affinity may enable mutant viruses to successfully infect host cells and subsequently acquire secondary mutations that either restore high affinity binding or shift binding specificity to a novel receptor. Avidity effects resulting from the trivalent binding mechanism of knob may further compensate for mutations that weaken binding affinity, as suggested previously (31Lortat-Jacob H. Chouin E.

Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant knob domain from Ad12 fiber protein and the N-terminal domain of CAR (CAR D1) were prepared as described previously (15Freimuth P. Springer K. Berard C. Hainfeld J. Bewley M. Flanagan J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant knob domain from Ad2 fiber protein was prepared following the same protocol used for Ad12 knob. Briefly, PCR products encoding the Ad2 and Ad12 fiber knob domains and several flanking amino acids from the fiber shaft (Ad2 knob residues 387–582 and Ad12 knob residues 401–587) were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites of vector pET15b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). The constructs were transformed into strain BL21-DE3 (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) for expression of the hexahistidine-tagged knob proteins. All of the knob variants were constructed by primer-directed PCR mutagenesis (mutagenic primers: Ad12 knob P417S, GCAGTTTGGTGATGGGTCAGGAG; Ad12 knob S489Y, TCTATATCCCCAGTAAGCTTGAGGAA; Ad2 knob S408P, TGCAGTTAGGAGGTGGGTCTGGG; and Ad2 knob Y477S, TTCTAAAGTTCCAAGAATGTTTTTTAAGT) and cloned as above. The proteins were purified via ion exchange and nickelnitriloacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and the molecular weight of each construct was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Each soluble expressed knob protein formed stable trimers, as assessed by nondenaturing (native) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of unheated protein samples. PCR products encoding CAR D1 (CAR residues 21–143, numbering from the N-terminal signal peptide) with and without the S46C mutation were cloned between the NcoI and XhoI restriction endonuclease cleavage sites of pET15b. A stop codon was omitted from the reverse primer to extend the CAR D1 C terminus with a 22-residue peptide encoded by vector sequences. This peptide extension was found to increase folding of CAR D1 in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm (15Freimuth P. Springer K. Berard C. Hainfeld J. Bewley M. Flanagan J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAR D1 proteins were expressed in strain BL21-DE3 and were purified by ion exchange chromatography. CAR D1 mutation S46C was constructed by primer-directed mutagenesis, using the mutagenic oligonucleotide primer GTCTTCGGGACAAAGCGTAAATTTG. Labeling of CAR D1 S46C—Serine 46 of CAR D1 was converted to cysteine by primer-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting protein was purified by ion exchange chromatography. CAR D1 S46C protein was covalently labeled with 6-iodoacetamidefluorescein through the introduced reactive thiol group of C46. The S46C protein (2.4 mg/ml) was reduced for 90 min in buffer A (20 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol. Excess dithiothreitol then was removed on a Sephadex G-10 spin column equilibrated in buffer A. The reduced protein was collected directly into a receiving tube containing 1.5 times molar excess of 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 25 °C in the dark with end-over-end tumbling. Excess 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein was removed by gel filtration on a Sephedex G-10 column (60 × 15 mm) in buffer A. The degree of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the labeled protein at 280 and 492 nm. Wild type CAR D1 control protein remained unlabeled after treatment by this procedure, indicating that only the introduced cysteine group of the S46C mutant was reactive. Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Equilibrium binding experiments were performed on a Tecan Ultra 384 plate reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria) using flat bottomed, black, 96-well, untreated microplates (Nalge Nunc Int., Naperville, IL). The reaction mixtures contained 5 nm of fluorescein-labeled CAR D1 S46C in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.0125% Nonidet P-40) with varying concentrations of knob proteins (10 nm to 5 μm). The total reaction volume was 300 μl, and the plates were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The fluorometer was set up with excitation and emission wavelength filters of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, and with a fluorescein dichroic mirror. The integration time was 40 μs, with 10 lamp flashes/measurement. The gain and optimal Z-position were determined manually using a control prior to the start of the experiment. The anisotropy values were calculated as the ratio of the difference between vertical and horizontal emission intensities (I // and I ⊥) normalized to the total intensity (Equation 1). Factor G is the ratio of the sensitivities of the detection system for vertically and horizontally polarized light. A=(I//-GI⊥)/(I//+2GI⊥)(Eq. 1) The equilibrium binding curves were analyzed using Table Curve (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Binding curves obtained for the knob-CAR interaction were fitted to an A + B → AB model that describes single-site independent binding of ligand to the receptor. This model assumes that complexes form with no multivalent avidity effects, because both the receptor and the ligand are free in solution during the analysis. Competitive displacement studies were performed by titrating 5 nm of labeled CAR D1 S46C to ∼90% saturation with 650 nm knob domain from Ad2 fiber protein and then back titrating the complexes with unlabeled wild type CAR D1 while measuring the decrease in fluorescence anisotropy. The results of the concentration-dependent decrease in anisotropy were fitted according to the equations of Huff et al. (35Huff S. Matsuka Y.V. McGavin M.J. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15563-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the concentration of CAR D1 in the anisotropy assays (5 nm) was well below the reported dissociation constant for CAR D1 homodimers (16 μm) (27van Raaij M.J. Chouin E. van der Zandt H. Bergelson J.M. Cusack S. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the protein can be regarded as monomeric under the conditions used. Modeling—Homology modeling of Ad2 knob in complex with CAR D1 was performed using Swiss PDB Viewer (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9689) Google Scholar). The Ad12 knob-CAR D1 binary complex was used as a template (PDB code 1KAC), and Ad2 knob was superimposed on the structure, 1.04 Å root mean square deviation for α-carbon atoms. Visual inspection of this model indicated potential contacts at the interface of Ad2 knob and CAR D1 that are not observed in the Ad12 knob-CAR D1 structure. The residues at the complex interface that were not conserved between Ad2 and Ad12 knob were modeled in the context of Ad12 knob in all rotomer conformations. Positive and negative potential interactions were scored using the Swiss PDB Viewer mutation tool. Crystallization—Crystals of purified knob-CAR D1 complexes were grown at room temperature by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. All of the reagents used were obtained from Hampton Research (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Protein drops contained 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution, and the wells contained 500 μl of crystallization buffer. Crystals of Ad12 knob P417S-CAR D1 were grown in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The crystals of the Ad12 knob S489Y-CAR D1 were grown in 0.8 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The crystals were flash cooled at 99 K with 50% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Data Collection and Model Refinement—In each case, full data sets were collected from single crystals using a 4 cell CCD on National Synchrotron Light Source Beamline X25 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY). The data were processed using the HKL Program suite (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38698) Google Scholar) as summarized in Table II. The protein coordinates of 1KAC were subjected to rigid body refinement in CNS after a 5 Å region around the mutant site had been omitted. A cycle of torsion angle refinement at 5000 K was performed prior to initial F o - F c and 2F o - F c electron density map calculation. The electron density for the substituted amino acids could be assigned unambiguously. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table II. The coordinates for the P417S-CAR D1 and S489Y-CAR D1 structures were deposited in the PDB and assigned PDB codes 1P69 and 1P6A, respectively.Table IISummary of data collection statisticsAd12 knob P417S-CAR D1Ad12 knob S489Y-CAR D1Crystal parametersSpace groupP4332P4332Cell dimensions (Å)a = 168.62a = 168.93Mathew's coefficient5.755.78No. of molecules in AU1 knob monomer, 1 CAR D11 knob monomer, 1 CAR D1Data collectionResolution (Å)30-3.320-2.9Unique observations1225018322Redundancy6.56.2R merge (%)aR merge = ∥Iobs|-|Iavg∥I|Iavg|10.6 (26.5)8.2 (39.5)Completeness (%)95.4 (94.3)97.7 (98.0)I/σI11 (4)14 (4)Refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)25-3.330-2.9No. of protein atoms23592366R factor (%)bR=h∥FP|-|FM∥I|FP| , where |FP| is the structure factor observed data and |FM| is the structure factor of the model.

To assess the effects of this variation on binding affinity, we developed a fluorescence anisotropy-based assay that measures interaction of knob and CAR D1 in solution. This assay limits multivalent avidity effects that can arise when either knob or CAR D1 is immobilized on a two-dimensional surface, because it measures the affinity of individual binding sites on the trivalent knob molecule. For this assay, a reactive sulfhydryl group was introduced into CAR D1 to permit site-specific labeling with fluorescein. Serine 46 was chosen for conversion to cysteine based on its surface exposure and its location outside of the knob-binding surface of CAR D1 (Fig. 2C). Spectroscopic analysis showed that the CAR D1 S46C mutant protein was quantitatively labeled after reaction with 6-iodoacetamide fluorescein, whereas no incorporation of fluorescein was detected in control reactions containing wild type CAR D1 protein (data not shown). Formation of knob-CAR D1 complexes was monitored by the increase in fluorescence anisotropy upon incubation of fluorescein-labeled CAR D1 S46C with increasing, subsaturating concentrations of knob protein (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the fluorescein label influenced the interaction of CAR D1 with the knob proteins, a competitive displacement experiment was performed. Fluorescein-labeled CAR D1 S46C was titrated to ∼90% saturation with Ad2 knob protein, and the complexes were then back titrated with wild type unlabeled CAR D1 (Fig. 2B). The data were fitted to a displacement curve to determine the inhibition constant (K i). The dissociation constant (K d) of the forward titration and the K i of the back titration were equivalent to within 3% error, indicating that the labeled CAR D1 S46C protein retained binding activity similar to that of wild type CAR D1.Fig. 2Analysis of knob-CAR D1 interactions using equilibrium fluorescence anisotropy. A, equilibrium binding curve of Ad2 knob with labeled CAR D1 S46C. B, displacement of labeled CARD1 S46C from Ad2 knob by wild type CAR D1. Labeled CAR D1 S46C was back titrated from a near saturating concentration of Ad2 knob using an increasing amount of wild type CAR D1. C, stereo view of CAR D1 mutant S46C in ribbon representation. The side chain of residue 46 is highlighted in yellow. Residues that interact directly with Ad12 knob are shown in ball and stick representation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using this anisotropy assay, we measured the binding affinities of two different serotypes of adenovirus knob, Ad2 and Ad12, toward CAR D1. Equilibrium binding affinities were derived from binding isotherms, as reported in Table I. Ad2 knob bound to CAR D1 with a K d of 35 nm, whereas Ad12 knob bound to CAR D1 with a K d of 295 nm. To investigate the basis for this 8-fold difference in affinity, we constructed a homology model (rigid body interaction) of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex (Fig. 3). Because the main chain conformations of Ad2 and Ad12 knob are similar (α-carbon atoms have root mean square deviation of 1.04 E), Ad2 knob was built into the homology model in the same relative orientation as that of Ad12 knob in the crystallographically determined Ad12 knob-CAR D1 complex. No steric clashes were observed at the binding interface, suggesting that the homology model reasonably approximated the actual structure of the Ad2 knob-CAR D1 complex.Table IEquilibrium binding affinities of adenovirus knob domains for CAR D1 obtained through fluorescence anisotropy measurements The results are the means ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.Adenovirus knobK dnMAd2 wild type35 ± 1.8Ad2 S408P85 ± 1.8Ad2 Y477S3600 ± 23Ad12 wild type290 ± 48Ad12 P417S76 ± 4.1Ad12 S489Y35 ± 4.4Ad12 P417S-S489Y28 ± 4.4 Open table in a new tab Six contact residues of Ad12 knob are strictly conserved in Ad2 knob, and all of these appear to contact CAR D1 in the homology model of Ad2 knob-CAR D1.

https://openalex.org/W2095027173,"The extracellular domain of the p55 TNF receptor (TNFrED) is an important therapeutic protein for targeting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The expression level of the TNFrED is low for bioproduction, which is presumably associated with the complication of pairing 24 cysteine residues to form correct disulfide bonds. Here we report the application of the yeast display method to study expression of TNFrED, a multimeric receptor. Randomly mutated libraries of TNFrED were screened, and two mutants were identified that express several-fold higher protein levels compared with the wild type while still retaining normal binding affinity for TNF-α. The substituted residues responsible for the higher protein expression in both mutants were identified as proline, and both proline residues are adjacent to cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds. Analysis of the mutant residues revealed that the improved level of expression is due to conformational restriction of the substituted residues to that of the folded state seen in the crystal structures of TNFrED thereby forcing the neighboring cysteine residues into the correct orientation for proper disulfide bond formation.

The ability to obtain a high level of expression of secreted recombinant proteins in yeast and mammalian cells is often found to be protein-dependent. Efforts in maximizing recombinant protein expression are often focused on increasing the levels of the mRNA of the recombinant gene. However, the rate-limiting step in the expression of certain proteins is not the level of mRNA but rather caused by inefficiencies in the folding, addition of post-translational modifications, and secretion of recombinant proteins (1Edgington S.M. Biotechnology (NY). 1992; 10: 1413-1420PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eyles S.J. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Wittrup K.D. Curr. Opin.

TNF-α initiates pleiotropic cytokine regulating effects by binding specifically to multimeric forms of TNF receptors at high affinity (6Bazzoni F. Beutler B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Protein therapeutics in this area are focused on selectively neutralizing the activity of TNF-α with either a monoclonal antibody or a soluble TNF receptor. The soluble extracellular domain of the human p55 TNF receptor exemplifies a protein therapeutic under development to control the signaling initiated by TNF-α. This soluble molecule is responsible not only for inactivation of the TNF, but also for its clearance (7Nophar Y. Kemper O. Brakebusch C. Englemann H. Zwang R. Aderka D. Holtmann H. Wallach D.

We previously found the expression level of TNFrED in CHO cells as measured in picograms/cell/day to be low when compared with other proteins such as immunoglobulins. Analysis of these transfected CHO cells revealed that the rate-limiting step in the expression of TNFrED appears to be either at translation or in a post-translational process. 2W. H. Brondyk and M. Cunningham, unpublished results. A possible bottleneck in the expression of TNFrED is the complicated formation of correct disulfide bonds by pairing 24 cysteine residues in each TNFrED molecule. We used the yeast cell surface display method to identify mutants of TNFrED, which are more abundantly expressed than wild-type TNFrED. Display of mutant libraries on the yeast cell surface has been used to identify mutants of both single-chain antibodies and single-chain T-cell receptors that have a higher affinity for its respective ligands and are also used to improve the level of expression of a single-chain T-cell receptor (9Boder E.T.

We describe the isolation of two novel proline substitutions that increase the expression level of TNFrED in both yeast and mammalian cells. These mutants do not have an altered affinity for TNF-α. Analysis of structural roles of the mutants in the study has revealed an interesting structure-expression relationship. Construction of Yeast and Mammalian Expression Plasmids—The TNFrED-agglutinin fusion was constructed by linking the signal sequence from the invertase gene to the human TNFrED sequence encoding residues 12–172, which was then fused to the C-terminal portion of the α-agglutinin gene encoding residues 330–650. The TNFrED-agglutinin fusion gene was subcloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) to generate pYES2-TNFrED-Agg for expression in yeast. The human TNFrED coding sequence from residue 12 to 172 was subcloned into pCMV, a mammalian expression vector containing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region, to generate pCMV-TNFrED. The human growth hormone signal sequence is fused upstream of the hTNFrED sequence. The TNFrED mutations in pCMV-TNFrED were generated with standard molecular biology techniques. The sequence of all constructs was verified with the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of TNFrED on the Surface of Yeast Cells—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ2168 (a, prc1-407, prb1-1122, pep4-3, leu2, trp1, ura3–52; Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA) was transformed with either pYES2 or pYES2-TNFrED-Agg using the lithium acetate method previously described (13Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown overnight with shaking in Ura– medium supplemented with 2% glucose at 30 °C. Expression was induced by growing the transformed yeast overnight at 30 °C with shaking in Ura– medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. Cells were harvested by centrifuging at 16,060 × g for 2 min, washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen), and then diluted to 4 × 106 cells/ml. 4 × 105 cells were incubated with either biotinylated human TNF-α (50 or 10 nm) or goat anti-human sTNF RI antibodies (0.7 μg/ml, R&D Systems) or both for 1 h at room temperature. Human TNF-α (Protein Purification Group, Serono Reproductive Biology Institute) was biotinylated with the EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation kit (Pierce). Cells were then centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 2 min and resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. FITC-labeled avidin (2.2 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or R-phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (2.2 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or both were added to cells and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Cells were centrifuged at 16,060 × g for 2 min, washed once with ice-cold 1× RDF1 buffer (R&D Systems) and analyzed on Becton Dickinson FACSort. The event rate was set at ∼150 cells/sec, and a total of 10,000 cells were collected per analysis. The yeast population was gated according to light scatter to avoid analysis of clumped cells. Production and Selection of Random Mutant Libraries—Five unique restriction endonuclease recognition sites were introduced into the coding region of TNFrED by silent mutagenesis using the GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). This step was completed in order to divide the TNFrED into 6 regions of between 40 and 105 bp. Five of six regions were separately subjected to a modification of a random mutagenesis method previously described (14Hermes J.D. Parekh S.M. Blacklow S.C. Koster H. Knowles J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Primers flanking the mutated, long oligonucleotide were used to amplify the DNA by PCR into cassettes for each region of TNFrED. Randomly mutagenized DNA regions were digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases, ligated into the pYES2-TNFrED-Agg construct, and transformed into XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells (Stratagene Corp.). Approximately 5 μg of plasmid DNA from each random library was transformed into ten aliquots (1 × 109 cells/aliquot) of BJ2168 cells using the lithium acetate transformation method. Cells were grown for 24–30hat30 °C with shaking and then ∼1 × 108 cells were induced for expression. For each fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiment, 4 × 106 cells were labeled as described above using biotinylated human TNF-α at a final concentration of 50 nm for the mutant library containing mutant clone 6 or 10 nm for the other mutant libraries. Goat anti-human sTNF R1 antibodies were added along with FITC-avidin and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-goat IgG. A total of 1.2 × 107 cells were sorted for each library. FACS was completed on a Becton Dickinson FACsort at an event rate of <2000 cells/sec. The first round of sorting was performed in exclusion mode and subsequent sorting was completed in single cell mode. Selected cells were re-grown at 30 °C and then induced in galactose/raffinose selection medium for the next round of sorting. Each library was sorted a total of 3–4 times. Approximately 0.08–0.4% of cells were collected in the first round, and 0.01–0.2% in the subsequent rounds. The collected cells from the last round of sorting were plated on Ura– plates to yield single colonies. Recovery and Analysis of Mutant TNFrED Clones—Approximately 50 individual yeast clones from each library sort were analyzed by flow cytometry. Induced cells were incubated with either 50 or 10 nm biotinylated TNF-α under the same conditions as described above. Binding of TNF-α was detected with FITC-avidin (2.2 μg/ml), and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on the Becton Dickinson FACsort. Clones having a greater median fluorescence than yeast expressing pYES2hTNFrED-Agg control were chosen for rescue of plasmid. DNA plasmids were recovered from yeast (15Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and transformed into competent E. coli JM109 (Promega). Purified plasmid DNA was re-transformed into BJ2168 yeast cells, and individual clones were re-analyzed using methods described above. The TNFrED regions of positive clones after the re-transformation were sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase-radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). TNF-α Binding Assay—Yeast expressing either the wild-type or mutant TNFrED-agglutinin fusion or yeast containing the control vector pYES2 were resuspended in PBS/bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) at a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml. In each well of a Durapore 96-multiwell plate (Millipore Corp.), 50 μl of the cell suspension were incubated with 50 μl of PBS/bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) containing various concentrations of 125I-TNF-α (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature. Following the incubation, the wells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS using the MultiScreen filtration system (Millipore Corp.). Nonspecific binding was determined at each concentration of 125I-TNF-α with the yeast containing the control vector pYES2, and the nonspecific binding was <10% of total counts. The K d and B max was determined using the GraphPad Prism program. Expression of TNFrED Mutants in Mammalian Cells—The pCMVhTNFrED constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293-EBNA cells using the calcium phosphate method. Transfections were completed in triplicate, and 48 h after transfection the level of hTNFrED in the conditioned medium was measured with an ELISA for hTNF R-1 (R&D Systems). Quantitative RNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from transiently transfected cells using the method previously described (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reactions were preformed using 2.5 μg of total RNA and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. TNFrED mRNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR analysis using primers 5′-TCCAGTGCTTCAATTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCTGTTTCTCCTGGCAGGAGA-3′, and probe 6FAM-TCTGCCTCAATGGGACCGTGCA-TAMRA in a fluorogenic 5′-nuclease assay (TaqMan, PE Applied Biosystems). 18 S rRNA expression levels were quantified using the predeveloped TaqMan assay for eukaryotic 18 S rRNA. 18 S rRNA levels were used as an internal control, and TNFrED mRNA levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA levels. The average threshold cycle was calculated using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection software. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of TNFrED Mutants—Surfaces displaying polyclonal goat anti-human TNFrED were constructed by binding biotinylated antibody (BAF225 from R&D Systems) to a Sensor SA chip (P/N BR-1000-32, BIAcore Inc.), which was conjugated with streptavidin. Biotinylated antibodies bind to the chip with high affinity and create a stable surface for repetitive capture of TNFrED, TNF binding analysis, and regeneration. TNFrED concentrations of conditioned media containing the mutant TNFrEDs had been measured by ELISA prior to submission for binding analyses. Buffer-diluted purified TNFrED or buffer-diluted conditioned medium containing TNFrED was injected onto the chip surface at 50 nm, resulting in the formation of an antibody-TNFrED complex. TNF-α at 1 nm (trimer) was then injected, and the kinetics of the binding and dissociation were recorded via the time course of surface plasmon resonance response. The chip surface was regenerated with 50% 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 2.5, 50% 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.1, which stripped off the TNFrED and the TNF-α. This series of injections was repeated for TNF-α at 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 nm while holding the concentration of injected TNFrED or mutant at 50 nm. Each set of binding curves was fit using global analysis and a 1:1 interaction model.

The ϕ-ψ angles of interesting residues in these structures were calculated and were compared with the ϕ-ψ angles of the same residue type in a large set of representative structures in the PDB. A total of 4930 representative polypeptide chains were selected based on the Astral list (release 1.59) of SCOP domains using an identity filter of <50% (astral.stanford.edu/scopseq-os-1.59.html) to remove closely related structure folds or very similar sequences (21Brenner S.E. Koehl P. Levitt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The structures in the list were then limited to those with resolution 2.4 Å or better and R factor < 22%, which narrowed them down to 2674 structure domains. Residues in the selected domains were further subjected to B factor restrictions. Only those with an average B factor of main-chain atoms (Cα, C, O, and N) between 1.0 and 25.0 are qualified for Ramachandran plots. Each Ramachandran plot was divided into 10° × 10° grids, resulting in 36 × 36 pixels. The conformation in a pixel is considered as accessible if the number of the data points in the pixel exceeds the expected value, which is defined as the ratio of the total number of data points to the total number of pixels. The formula of estimating the approximate entropy gain of protein folding for a mutation from residue X to residue Z was adopted from Ref. 22Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar. The contribution to the entropy of folding residue Z from unfolded states to its folded structure relative to residue X in the mutation of X → Z is given by, ΔSX→Z=-RlnAZAX(Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant, Az is the accessible conformational area in the Ramachandran conformational plot for residue Z, and AX is that for residue X. Expression of Functional TNFrED on the Surface of S. cerevisae.—TNFrED was fused to the C-terminal portion of α-agglutinin and expressed in the S. cerevisae strain BJ2168 (a, prc1-407, prb1-1122, pep4-3, leu2, trp1, ura3–52) using the pYES2 vector. The C-terminal portion of α-agglutinin is tightly anchored in the cell wall and serves as a scaffold to present TNFrED on the cell surface (23Schreuder M.P. Brekelmans S. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The TNFrED-agglutinin fusion gene was under the regulation of the inducible GAL1 promoter. In a flow cytometric analysis with polyclonal antibodies directed against TNFrED we found that in an induced culture ∼70% of the yeast-expressed TNFrED-agglutinin on the cell surface (Fig. 1A). To determine whether TNFrED on the yeast cell surface was folded correctly and could bind TNF-α, we performed a flow cytometric analysis using biotinylated TNF-α as a probe and FITC-labeled avidin as the detection reagent. Yeast expressing the TNFrED-agglutinin fusion gene bound more biotinylated TNF-α than did yeast containing the pYES2 vector (Fig. 1B). Adding excess unlabeled TNF-α (data not shown) reversed the shift in the histogram seen with yeast expressing the TNFrED-agglutinin fusion gene. Selection of Mutant TNFrED Clones with Enhanced Biotinylated-TNF-α Binding—A modification of the mutagenesis approach previously described (14Hermes J.D. Parekh S.M. Blacklow S.C. Koster H. Knowles J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used to generate random mutant libraries. In this approach mutant oligonucleotides are produced by spiking a predetermined level of the “wrong” nucleotides at each position. The level of contamination of the wrong nucleotides was adjusted to generate either an average of two or three random point mutations per oligonucleotide. Each mutant library covered between 40 and 105 base pairs of TNFrED. Ten random clones from each library were sequenced. The type and position of mutations were random, and the regions were found to contain the anticipated average number of mutations. The size of each library was between 0.5 × 106 and 10 × 106 independent mutant clones. Each library was transformed into the strain BJ2168, and ∼1 × 106 independent transformants were selected for binding to both biotinylated-TNF-α and polyclonal antibodies directed against the TNFrED. The window of the two-dimensional fluorescence histogram that was used to select for the subpopulation of yeast expressing active TNFrED is shown in Fig. 1C. This window was originally chosen to select for mutants with an increased affinity for TNF-α. The selected subpopulation of yeast was grown and reselected with two-color sorting. After several rounds of two-color sorting the population of yeast in the selected window was enriched (Fig. 1C). Following three to four rounds of cell sorting, individual clones were analyzed by examining binding of biotinylated-TNF-α to the TNFrED on the cell surface. A majority of the clones analyzed from each sorted library appeared to bind higher levels of biotinylated-TNF-α. The mutant TNFrED plasmid was recovered from each yeast clone and re-transformed into the BJ2168 strain and then reanalyzed by flow cytometry. The vast majority of yeast clones were false positives as the recovered plasmids did not confer higher levels of biotinylated-TNF-α binding. When false positive yeast clones were analyzed in the absence of biotinylated TNF-α and avidin-FITC, they were shifted as compared with the parental BJ2168 strain. These false positive yeast clones are ∼30% larger compared with the parental BJ2168, which is presumably what gives rise to the shift in the baseline absorbance. However two mutant clones, 6 and 11, from different libraries, were identified after re-transformed into the BJ2168 strain as conferring higher levels of biotinylated TNF-α binding and therefore are true positives (Fig. 1D). Characterization of Mutant Clones 6 and 11—The TNFrED coding region in mutant clones 6 and 11 was sequenced and, as anticipated, the mutations for each clone were only found in the sequence region mutated for that specific library. In mutant clone 11 there was a point mutation that resulted in Ser → Pro change at position 87, and in mutant clone 6 there were two point mutations that resulted in an His→ Pro change at position 34 and a Ser → Ile change at position 57. To determine whether the mutations increase binding of biotinylated TNF-α through increased expression of TNFrED or by increasing the affinity for TNF-α, we performed a saturation binding experiment on yeast expressing either mutant clone 6 or 11. Analysis of saturation binding experiments (Fig. 2) indicated that yeast expressing either mutant clone 6 or 11 express higher levels of functional TNFrED than wild-type TNFrED and that the presence of these mutations does not affect the affinity of TNFrED for TNF-α. The number of receptors/cell for yeast expressing mutant clone 6, mutant clone 11, and wild-type TNFrED was 3930, 1490, 740, respectively. Expression of Mutated TNFrEDs in Mammalian Cells—We next determined whether the mutant clones derived in yeast had similar expression characteristics in mammalian cells. The TNFrED mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293-EBNA cells and the amount of secreted TNFrED was measured with an ELISA specific for TNFrED. The results (Table I) indicated that either mutation H34P or S87P increased the expression level of TNFrED. Moreover, the relative increase in expression is similar to what was seen when these mutants were expressed in yeast (Fig. 2). The S57I mutation alone did not alter the expression level of TNFrED (Table I). The effects of these mutations do not appear to be additive because the presence of both H34P and S87P on the same construct did not increase the level of TNFrED secreted in comparison to that found with H34P alone.Table ITransient transfection of HEK293-EBNA cells with wild-type TNFrED and mutants of TNFrEDDNATNFrEDFold over wild-typeng/mlWild-type239 ± 5.0H34P724 ± 403S57I190 ± 190.8S87P361 ± 211.5H34P, S57I614 ± 542.6H34P, S87P711 ± 333H34P, S57I, S87P704 ± 262.9 Open table in a new tab Steady-state RNA levels from transiently transfected HEK293-EBNA cells were analyzed by real-time PCR. The RNA levels of TNFrED for the six mutants were found to be 28–73% of the level of wild-type TNFrED RNA indicating that the presence of the described mutations does not increase RNA levels. The association and dissociation kinetics of TNF-α binding to the mutated TNFrEDs were directly comparable to those of the wild-type protein (Table II). The difference in TNF-α affinity between wild-type and mutated TNFrEDs was not found to be significant, which is consistent with our binding analysis with the yeast transformants.Table IIBinding parameters fit to SPR dataSamplek on × 106k off × 10-3RmxKdχ2m s-1sRUm × 10-9Wild-type (spike)2.12.670.11.01.952.03.071.01.50.962.22.566.71.12.41Wild-type (transient)2.32.081.50.92.4H34P2.43.079.11.21.84S57I2.22.876.91.31.62S87P2.13.376.11.61.32H34P, S57I2.03.071.01.51.25H34P, S87P2.22.771.71.21.84H34P, S57I, S87P2.12.189.61.01.55 Open table in a new tab Analysis of Accessible Conformations of the Mutations—The residue substitutions in mutant clone 6 and 11 and their adjacent residues include proline, cysteine, and glycine. As these three residues are known to have a significant role in protein structure, we analyzed potential functions of the substitutions or the adjacent residues in their protein-folding processes. We first compared the accessible conformations of the substituted residue types before and after the mutations as seen in the PDB structures. As shown in Fig. 3, the conformation of a proline residue is more restricted than the other three residues, and a serine residue is less restricted than an isoleucine residue. Moreover, the conformation of Ser87 and His34 in TNFrED crystal structures (red-filled marks) lies in the most abundantly accessible conformational region of the proline residues. Following the same method as described by Matthews et al. (22Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), we estimated the contribution of the entropy of protein folding before and after the mutations: 6.1 J/mol·degree for S87P, 7.1 J/mol·degree for H34P, and 1.66 J/mol·degree for S57I. In all three cases, each mutated residue contributes favorably to the entropic contribution to protein folding (Fig. 3). We next analyzed the accessible conformation space of the adjacent residues affected by the mutations. Conformational restriction has little effect for a residue following proline (compare Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, conformational restriction of a residue preceding proline is particularly profound due to the steric hindrance, as illustrated in Fig. 4, C and D. The rigidity of the pyrrolidine ring of the proline residue constrains the ψ angle of its preceding non-glycine residue to a positive value in the top left quarter of its Ramachandran plot (refer to Fig. 5B). Glycine is another residue with a noticeable shift of accessible conformational space when it is adjacent to bulky residues. When it follows the bulky asymmetric residue, isoleucine, the accessibility of glycine to conformational space of the small ψ angle region is notably reduced (compare Fig. 4, E and F and refer to Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Ramachandran plots of the residues adjacent to the substituted residue in the mutant clones 6 and 11 and the corresponding wild-type residues. The left column is the plot of the residue preceding the mutant residue, and the right column is the residue following the mutant residue. The top and bottom panels in a same column are the plots of the same residue, but the adjacent residue is the wild type (top) or the mutant (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the effect of adjacent residues in the choice of conformation preferences by the substituted residue, we analyzed the accessible conformational space of the same neighboring residues in the PDB structures as those in clone 6, clone 11, and the wild type. The sequences surrounding the mutated residues are Ser86-Pro87-Cys88, Cys33-Pro34-Lys35, and Glu56-Ile57-Gly58, where the superscript numbers denote residue numbers in the protein. The corresponding sequences in wild-type TNFrED are Ser86-Ser87-Cys88, Cys33-His34-Lys35, and Glu56-Ser57-Gly58. Fig. 5 compares the Ramachadran plots of neighboring residues before and after the mutations. The mutation from Ser to Pro at residue 87 markedly limited the accessible conformations of the preceding serine residue to the neighborhood of the observed serine conformation in the TNFrED crystal structures. Similarly, the mutation from His to Pro at residue 34 also restricts the accessible conformational space of the preceding cysteine residue to those surrounding the folded conformation. This indicates that nearly all of the possible conformations of this cysteine residue in unfolded states are similar to the folded conformation. In contrast, the mutation from Ser to Ile at residue 57 reduces accessibility to small ψ angle conformations of the following Gly residue, although the small ψ angle is its folded conformation. Through screening of mutant TNFrED clones with the yeast display system we were able to identify two mutations of TNFrED that conferred a higher expression level in both yeast and mammalian cells when compared with the wild type. Analysis of transiently transfected cells revealed that the presence of the two mutations does not increase RNA levels of TNFrED indicating that these mutations increase TNFrED expression levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism. In each mutant clone, we showed that the residue responsible for the higher protein expression levels is a proline substitution next to a cysteine involved in a disulfide bond. Structural examination of the TNFrED structures revealed that these residues apparently are not involved in ligand binding, glycosylation, or structural roles of intra- or intermolecular interactions by side-chains. Using an approach similar to that described by Matthews et al. (22Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) who analyzed the contribution of entropy change to protein folding before and after a mutation, we demonstrated that the entropy change of the substituted residues in the mutations S87P, H34P, and S57I contributes favorably to the protein folding of the mutants as compared with the wild type. The degree of contributions is: H34P > S87P ≫ S57I. In addition, we showed that the accessible conformational space of the residues adjacent to the mutated ones contribute to the protein folding either favorably or unfavorably. In the mutant S87P, the accessible conformational space of the preceding Ser residue is limited, and this limitation favors the protein folding of the mutant relative to the wild type. The higher expression level of S87P is most likely the result of the positive entropy contribution of the mutated residue per se and the favorable accessible conformations of the preceding Ser residue. In the mutant H34P, the Cys-Pro combination restricts the conformation of the preceding Cys residue to or near the folded conformation. The correct orientation of the cysteine presumably facilitates proper disulfide bond formation and results in the higher yield of correctly folded molecules that lead to the higher expression. In the mutant S57I, the bulky Ile residue reduces the number of small ψ angle conformations accessible to the following Gly residue, even though the small ψ conformation is the folded structure. This negative contribution from the following Gly residue eliminates the positive contribution of the entropy change from the mutated residue in protein folding of the mutant. This is consistent with the observed expression level of S57I, which is actually slightly lower than the wild type. We also noticed that the expression level increase is non-additive when both H34P and S87P are present on the same construct, possibly because the two cysteine residues are not disulfide bridged to each other. In summary, this study provides a step forward toward the solution of expressing a potentially important therapeutic molecule, TNFrED. It is also the first application, to our knowledge, of the yeast display system to study multimeric proteins. Moreover, this work presents the first analysis of the structure-expression relationship by demonstrating protein conformation is a determinant of expression.

https://openalex.org/W1978278235,"The structural consequences of polypeptide backbone reversal (“retro” modification) remain largely unexplored, in particular, for the retro forms of globular all-β-sheet proteins. To examine whether the backbone-reversed form of a model all-β-sheet protein can fold and adopt secondary and tertiary structure, we created and examined the recombinant retro form of a 110-residue-long polypeptide, an α-crystallin-like small heat-shock protein, HSP12.6, from C. elegans. Following intracellular overexpression in fusion with a histidine affinity tag in Escherichia coli, purification under denaturing conditions, and removal of denaturant through dialysis, retro-HSP12.6 was found to fold to a soluble state. The folded protein was examined using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, gel filtration chromatography, non-denaturing electrophoresis, differential scanning calorimetry, and electron microscopy and confirmed to have adopted secondary structure and assembled into a multimer. Interestingly, like its parent polypeptide, retro-HSP12.6 did not aggregate upon heating; rather, heating led to a dramatic increase in structural content and the adoption of what would appear to be a very well folded state at high temperatures. However, this was essentially reversed upon cooling with some hysteresis being observed resulting in greater structural content in the heated-cooled protein than in the unheated protein. The heated-cooled samples displayed CD spectra indicative of structural content comparable to that of any naturally occurring globular protein. Attempts are being made to refine crystallization conditions for the folded protein.

The heated-cooled samples displayed CD spectra indicative of structural content comparable to that of any naturally occurring globular protein. Attempts are being made to refine crystallization conditions for the folded protein. The structure of a naturally occurring globular protein is determined by its amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence has a definite polarity with the C=O group of every residue forming a peptide bond with the N–H group of the next residue. Here, we explore the structural-biochemical consequences of reversing the polarity of the polypeptide backbone through the creation of a novel protein with an amino acid sequence that is the exact reverse of the sequence of a naturally occurring protein, the α-crystallin-like small heat-shock protein HSP12.6 from Caenorhabditis elegans (1Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The consequences of effecting such a transformation have previously been explored both in theory and in experiment. Among works dealing with polypeptides that are large enough to be called proteins, the following discussions are worthy of note. (a) Guptasarma (2Guptasarma P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Guptasarma P. Trends Biotech. 1996; 14: 42-43Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the retro form of an all-β-sheet protein would fold into a topological mirror image of the structure adopted by the parent sequence through mirror imaging of the entire scheme of side chain-side chain interactions facilitating folding. The dihedral angles characterizing each residue in the parent structure would thus change both sign as well as definition in the mirror-imaged structure because of the replacement of C=O by N–H and vice versa. As a consequence, every ϕ would become –ψ and every ψ would become –ϕ. Notably, with β-sheets, such a transformation could conceivably allow each residue to remain in a β-sheet configuration (3Guptasarma P. Trends Biotech. 1996; 14: 42-43Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, with α-helices, such a transformation would be expected to effect a change in the handedness of the helix and so mirror imaging would not ordinarily occur for single helices and all-helix protein structures, but rather, it would occur only with isolated helices in predominantly β-sheet structural contexts. In other words, only helices that could pay the energy penalty for switching handedness through stabilization by packing contacts with other mirror-imaged substructures would undergo the transformation. (b) Skolnick and colleagues (4Olszewski K.A. Kolinski A. Skolnick J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) performed folding simulations with the retro form of an all-α protein, the B domain of Staphylococcal protein A, and showed that 3 of 12 folding simulations led to mirror-imaged structures, whereas the remaining nine simulations folded into α-helical structures. (c) Another result with α-helical proteins was obtained experimentally by Grutter and colleagues (5Mittl P.R.E. Deillon C. Sargent D. Liu N. Klauser S. Thomas R.M. Gutte B. Grutter M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2562-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) who showed that the retro form of a GCN4 leucine zipper folds into a structure (determined crystallographically) that is almost identical to the parent structure and not a mirror image of the parent structure. The similarity of the parent and retro structures was explained on the basis of the fact that there was a 2-fold palindrome in the hydrophobicity profile of the protein, intersecting the central cavity in the structure of the protein. (d) Importantly, whereas the retro forms of α-helical proteins did display a tendency to fold, an experimental attempt to reverse the backbone of a protein containing β-sheets produced a polypeptide that displayed no tendency to fold. Serrano and colleagues (6Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the retro form of an Src homology 3 domain does not fold. However, structural modeling carried out by the same group established that a mirror image topology was feasible, especially in combination with folding to a molten-globule state rather than a rigid unique structure (6Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since only ∼40% of an Src homology 3 domain constitutes β-structure with the remaining polypeptide being folded into rigid loop-like structures that do not qualify to be called secondary structure (the 60-residue-long domain has only ∼25 residues of 60 forming β-strands (7Kishan K.V.R. Newcomer M.E. Rhodes T.H. Guilliot S.D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), the question of what would happen upon reversal of a larger protein with a much greater propensity to form β-sheets has thus far remained open to question. We decided to examine the consequences of reversing the sequence of a larger all-β-sheet protein. We chose as a parent sequence for backbone reversal the 110-residue-long HSP12.6 from C. elegans. This is the smallest known homolog of all of the proteins belonging to the family of α-crystallin-like heat-shock domains (1Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on actual determination of the structures of several members of this family (8Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 9van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrch K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), α-crystallin-like domains are currently accepted to be proteins of a defined all-β-fold. Our investigations reveal that the reversed sequence too folds and assembles into a multimer like the parent. Molecular Genetic Manipulations and Design of Constructs—From the sequence of the gene encoding the parent protein, Hsp12.6 (1Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the sequence of a novel gene encoding retro-HSP12.6 (RETHSP) 1The abbreviations used is: RETHSP, retro-heat-shock protein. was created by reversing the sequence of codons used by the parent gene. The DNA encoding the reversed sequence (retro-HSP12.6) was then synthesized through a combination of contract synthesis of double-stranded oligonucleotides and our own molecular genetic manipulations to derive constructs encoding retro-HSP12.6 with a choice of restriction sites flanking the sequence for insertion into the vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to facilitate expression in fusion with a His6 affinity tag. Finally, two forms of retro-HSP12.6 were created. (i) The first form, RETHSP-1, was a backbone-reversed form of the 110-residue-long parent sequence flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions. The N-terminal extension consisted of 12 residues incorporating a 10-residue affinity tag (MRGSHHHHHH) and an additional two residues contributed by the cloning site (GS). The C-terminal extension of nine residues (VDLQPSLIS) was entirely due to the choice of restriction sites at the multiple cloning site of pQE-30, as the vector's own stop codon was used. (ii) To make the second form, RETHSP-2, the C-terminal extension was removed through inclusion of a stop codon immediately after the backbone-reversed HSP12.6 sequence. Expression of proteins from both constructs was first checked in XL1Blue, which was the cloning host. The sequence of the insert in the positive clone was confirmed through automated DNA sequencing on an ABI 310 Prism sequencer, and the plasmid was transformed into the expression host M15pREP4. The sequences of HSP12.6, RETHSP-1, and RETHSP-2 are shown in Table I for reference.Table 1Sequences of HSP 12.6 and its retro-forms.HSP 12.6 (110 residues)N-MMSVPVMADE GTKWDWPLNK GDGVVNVLDD DDHFEVGLEA HNFLPKEIEV NKIGELLEIH NEHNVKKDSF GDVSRNITRC YKLPKNVDMK PIKSNLDSHG ILHIEARKNH-CRetro-HSP12.6:RETHSP-1 (131 residues)N-MRGSHHHHHH GSHNKRAEIH LIGHSDLNSK ITKMDVNKPL KYCRTINRSV DGFSDKKVNH ENHIELLEGI NKVEIEKPLF NHAELGVEFH DDDDLVNVVG DGKNLPWDWK TGEDAMVPVS MMVDLQPSLI S-CRetro-HSP12.6:RETHSP-2 (122 residues)N-MRGSHHHHHH GSHNKRAEIH LIGHSDLNSK ITKMDVNKPL KYCRTINRSV DGFSDKKVNH ENHIELLEGI NKVEIEKPLF NHAELGVEFH DDDDLVNVVG DGKNLPWDWK TGEDAMVPVS MM-C Open table in a new tab Expression, Purification, and Folding—The expression of both proteins in the expression host Escherichia coli M15pREP4 was low but this was compensated for by setting up larger culture volumes. For expression, the cells were grown overnight and a 1% secondary innoculum was added to an appropriate volume of LB. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an optical density of 0.6 and harvested 4 h after induction. Harvested cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing denaturant (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant thus obtained was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in the presence of the denaturant, urea. Washing (with 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.3) and elution (with 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 5.9 and pH 4.5) were also done under denaturing conditions. Dialysis of the eluted protein to remove denaturant was done against 20 mm Tris. After dialysis, concentration was effected through centrifugation under vacuum to the point at which the protein started to precipitate after which the sample was centrifuged and supernatant was taken for an estimation of concentration of soluble protein. This was taken as the maximally concentrated solution of the protein since upon further concentration the protein precipitated. The change in molarity of buffer following such concentration was also estimated by reckoning for the change in volume effected by centrifugal vacuum concentration. Spectroscopy and Microcalorimetry—Protein concentrations were estimated through UV absorption measurements at 280 nm using a predicted molar extinction coefficient of 12,780 for proteins encoded by both RETHSP-1 and RETHSP-2. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter with variable excitation and emission bandpasses as appropriate using excitation with light of 280 nm and scanning protein emission between 300 and 400 nm. CD spectra were collected at intervals of 1 nm on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter through scanning of wavelengths from 250 to 200 nm using a protein concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and a cuvette path length of 0.2 cm. CD signals below 200 nm could not be collected because the spectra were noisy. Consequently, no attempt was made to estimate secondary structural contents from this data. Calorimetry was carried out using a Microcal MC-2-ultrasensitive microcalorimeter using a protein concentration of 80 μm and a scan rate of 60 K/h. Fourier Transform Infrared spectra for the solid precipitate of RETHSP-1 obtained through concentration beyond the solubility limit were collected on a PerkinElmer Spectrum BX instrument with the protein sample placed between two calcium fluoride windows at a resolution of 1 cm–1, taking an average of 32 scans. Chromatography and Non-denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Pharmacia SMART system using an analytical Superdex-200 column (bed volume ≈2.4 ml, void volume 0.8 ml) and a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min through use of 0.05-ml protein samples of concentration at 0.4 mg/ml. The fractionation range of the column was 6,00,000 Da, and the exclusion limit was 16,00,000 Da. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis for the determination of the native molecular weight of RETHSP-2 was carried out by the standard procedures involving: (i) determination, plotting, and (linear) fitting of changes in the relative mobilities of protein samples as a function of gel acrylamide percentage by a least squares fitting method, followed by (ii) by plotting of the negative value of the slope thus obtained for each standard protein against its known native molecular weight (Ferguson plot), least squares fitting of this data to a straight line, and interpolation of the value of the slope obtained for RETHSP-2 into the plot. Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy studies were carried out through use of routine negative staining procedures employing phosphotungstic acid and uranyl acetate on a JEOL 1200 EX-2 microscope. Solubility of RETHSP-1 and RETHSP-2—No precipitation was observed during dialysis-based removal of denaturant from solutions of either RETHSP-1 or RETHSP-2 following His6 tag-based affinity purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns in the presence of urea. The protein samples obtained were found to be soluble up to a concentration of 1.2–1.5 mg/ml for RETHSP-1 and ∼0.6 mg/ml for RETHSP-2. Concentration beyond these values led to protein precipitation. Spectrofluorimetric Characterization—The two forms, RETHSP-1 and RETHSP-2, displayed wavelengths of maximal fluorescence emission (λmax) of 348 and 351, respectively, indicating only very nominal burial of their aromatic residues (two tryptophans and one tyrosine). The emission spectrum of RETHSP-2 is shown in Fig. 1A. RETHSP-1 and RETHSP-2 Appear to Be Trimers/Tetramers at Low Concentrations—Because both proteins were soluble, we examined their quaternary structural status using gel filtration chromatography. On an analytical SMART Superdex-200 column, RETHSP-2 eluted at 1.47 ml (Fig. 1B), corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼52–53 kDa. In some preparations of the protein, a minor population was also found to elute close to the void volume of the column (0.8–0.9 ml), which had a bed volume of 2.4 ml and a fractionation range of 10,000–600,000 Da with an exclusion limit of 1.3 × 106 Da. RETHSP-2 has a polypeptide molecular mass of 13,970 Da, indicating that the majority population eluting at ∼ 1.47 ml falling within the optimal fractionation range for the column is predominantly tetrameric. In comparison with the value of 52–53 kDa that was obtained through gel filtration, determination of the native molecular mass at low protein concentration by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 6, C and D) yielded an estimated molecular mass of 45–46 kDa. Both of these estimates turn out to lie between the values expected for trimeric (∼42 kDa) and tetrameric (∼56 kDa) states of a ∼14-kDa polypeptide like RETHSP-2. Thus, three possibilities apply. (i) The molecule is assembled into a tetramer that behaves as a smaller species on account of compactness. (ii) The molecule is assembled into a trimer that behaves as a larger species on account of being swollen, or (iii) the molecule forms a mixed population of trimers and tetramers existing in equilibrium. Because techniques used to determine multimeric molecular masses including non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation are all influenced to varying extents by molecular shape and effective hydrodynamic volume, which need not correlate perfectly with size for non-spherical species, estimates of native molecular mass do not always correspond to expected multiples of subunit molecular weight. We emphasize that dynamic light scattering or analytical ultracentrifugation data could provide more accurate information concerning whether the population is mostly trimeric or tetrameric, and we are organizing to perform these experiments. Meanwhile, we have obtained preliminary plate-like crystals of the protein and attempts are being made to refine crystallization conditions toward eventual structure determination, which should resolve the issue. Notably, the occasional observation of a soluble higher order multimer at the void volume of the Superdex-200 column indicates that this assembly may also be capable of associating further into larger multimers approaching sizes of 600,000 or more, especially at high protein concentrations. Evidence of Formation of a Higher Order Multimer upon Concentration—As already mentioned, RETHSP-1 has a solubility limit of ∼1.2–1.5 mg/ml. Beyond this protein concentration, protein precipitates are obtained. Whereas the gel filtration studies reported above used the sample remaining in the supernatant after concentration, examination of the precipitated protein using transmission electron microscopy and negative staining showed the presence of a globular, bead-like form with a diameter of roughly 18–20 nm (Fig. 2, panels A and B). We are in the process of analyzing multiple images of these beads to attempt partial three-dimensional reconstruction. Fourier Transform Infrared spectra of these beaded samples clearly show the presence of secondary structure (Fig. 2C) with C=O stretch band maxima at 1629 and 1651 cm–1, indicative of predominantly β-sheet with some helical content. Evidence of Secondary Structure Formation—The CD spectrum of any protein is a linear combination of the contributions of peptide bonds in various secondary structures. The CD spectrum of RETHSP-1 (Fig. 3A) indicates β/α-secondary structural content together with a substantial component of randomly coiled structure. It may be noted that for completely randomly coiled polypeptides, no negative ellipticity signal is observed between 250 and 210 nm. Only at wavelengths below 210 nm are spectra observed to show a negative band that dips to display a minimum at ∼198 nm. Since out of a total of 131 residues RETHSP-1 contains 21 residues that comprise N- and C-terminal extensions that are in any case not expected to participate in structure formation (16% of the chain) and, furthermore, because any negative CD signal resulting from random coil is nearly 4–5 times stronger than that due to a β-sheet configuration for any peptide bond (i.e. in a plot of mean-residue ellipticity), the CD spectrum of RETHSP-1 might arguably be expected to be dominated by a negative band at ∼198 nm, however, with significant negative mean residue ellipticity being visible even at wavelengths above 210 nm. Gratifyingly, this is what is seen. When the C-terminal extension is removed as in RETHSP-2, the length of the chain reduces to 122 residues, bringing down the number of extra residues to 12 (only 9% of the chain) from 21. This would be expected to reduce the contribution of residues in a randomly coiled configuration to the CD spectrum and thus lead to a shift of the band minimum to a longer wavelength. As shown by the CD spectrum of RETHSP-2, such a shift is exactly what is seen. RETHSP-2 shows a band minimum at 210 nm together with another band minimum at ∼230 nm (Fig. 3B). Notably, the mean residue ellipticity of the entire spectral range is enhanced by a factor of almost 2.5 over that seen with RETHSP-1, indicating that this polypeptide is significantly more structured even though there is still some random coil component. Heating Causes Structural Consolidation Rather than Unfolding—To examine whether heating of the protein is characterized by an endothermic reaction resulting in a change in enthalpy associated with unfolding, differential scanning calorimetry was carried out with RETHSP-1. The scan showed a small, almost indiscernible endothermic reaction followed by a dramatic and unexpected exothermic reaction at high temperatures (Fig. 4). Such an exothermic reaction could only be due to the formation rather than destruction of non-covalent contacts. Such contacts could be because of either aggregation or further structura1 consolidation within the polypeptide. To examine whether any aggregation occurs upon heating, we heated the proteins at 90 °C for 15 min and found no visible sign of aggregation. Gel filtration of cooled samples also showed no signs of high molecular weight species (see Fig. 6A). One further test excluding any possibility of aggregation was a monitoring of the HT voltage associated with the transmission of light through the sample in a CD spectrometer during heating of the sample. The HT voltage in a spectropolarimeter rises to compensate for reductions in light intensity not associated with differential absorption of left and right circularly polarized light when the detector is starved for light through absorption or scattering. The HT voltage, therefore, is extremely sensitive to changes in the level of scattering of transmitted light. We found no significant changes in HT voltage associated with heating, signaling a lack of aggregation during heating. Because there was no evidence of aggregation and suspecting that structural consolidation could indeed have occurred in the sample, we examined the CD spectrum of RETHSP-2 at high temperature (Fig. 5A). We also examined the nature of changes in ellipticity associated with heating and cooling of RETHSP-2 (Fig. 5B) to further confirm the changes in CD signal associated with heating and investigate the extent to which such changes are reversible for this protein. As is evident from Fig. 5A, the protein is significantly more structured at high temperatures than at room temperature. Fig. 5B reinforces this conclusion, demonstrating that there is a gradual increase in the negative ellipticity at 218 nm during heating (effected at a rate of 5 °C/min) as well as a clear reduction in negative ellipticity associated with cooling (effected at the same rate). This finding shows that the structural consolidation effected through heating is largely reversed upon cooling. However, some hysteresis is also clearly seen to be associated with the process (Fig. 5B) with the signal at 218 nm not returning to its original value upon cooling. Thus, the structural gains effected through heating are not entirely lost upon cooling, and as a result, the heated and cooled protein (Fig. 3C) shows a negative band maximum at 215–216 nm with a second band at ∼230 nm, indicating a clear predominance of β-sheet configuration and a well folded state of the polypeptide even upon return to room temperature. It may be emphasized once again that perhaps because of the fact that the heat-induced changes do not reverse completely, the spectrum of the heated-cooled protein (Fig. 3C) is different from that of the unheated protein (Fig. 3B), which displays a band minimum at ∼210 nm as well as from spectrum of the protein at the high temperature of 92 °C (Fig. 5A), which most resembles the CD spectrum of a well folded naturally occurring protein. The differences in signal intensities among the various spectra, especially at lower wavelengths, conform to what is expected for enhancement of β-sheet content at the expense of unstructured content. As is well known, the negative ellipticity associated with a peptide bond in a β-sheet configuration is much lower than that associated with a peptide bond in a random coil. The intriguing semi-reversible thermally induced consolidation of structure described above caused us to carry out a further comparative examination of RETHSP-2 in the unheated, heated state, and cooled states. The unheated sample and the heated-cooled sample were chromatographed through gel filtration (Fig. 6A) and seen to contain the same dominant trimeric/tetrameric population eluting at 1.47 ml on a Superdex-200 column. As can be seen, there was no evidence of any additional species eluting at the column's void volume (0.8–0.9 ml), indicating that there was no generation of high molecular weight aggregates through the process of heating and cooling. However, a slight difference can be seen in the width-at-half-height of the elution as well as in the volume at which the elution begins for the heated-cooled sample. Thus, the gross quaternary structural status of RETHSP-2 is not changed through heating and cooling, although as already pointed out clearly some of the structural gains effected through heating are retained by the molecule after cooling, evident from the hysteresis seen in the ellipticity signal as a function of temperature (Fig. 5B) as well as from differences in the CD spectral shapes of unheated, heated, and heated-cooled samples (Figs. 3B, 5A, and 3C, respectively). Fluorescence emission spectroscopy at different temperatures did not shed light on structural transitions. The 351-nm emission (λmax) of the protein alluded to earlier (Fig. 1A) remained at 351 nm, even at 90–92 °C as well as upon cooling to room temperature, displaying only a reversible reduction in intensity with increased temperature but no change in other spectral characteristics (Supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, it would appear that the exposed tryptophan residues of the protein remains largely exposed to the solvent, even in course of the heat-induced structural consolidation and resettlement into a more structured state upon cooling. Fluorescence quenching carried out for unheated and heated-cooled samples reinforce this conclusion. Stern-Volmer plots (Fig. 6B) show that the accessibility of the fluorescing aromatic residues is virtually unaltered between the unheated and the heated-cooled samples. To further investigate the conclusion from gel filtration data, which indicated that the unheated and heated-cooled samples have similar sizes despite their structural differences, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out. The gels of four different percentages of acrylamide were run. Variations in the relative mobilities of five different protein standards as a function of varying gel density were analyzed and used to construct a Ferguson plot. A representative gel (10% acrylamide) is shown (Fig. 6C) with unheated and heated-cooled samples run in the last two lanes, establishing that the hydrodynamic volumes of these two forms are entirely similar. The Ferguson plot (Fig. 6D) shows that both forms correspond to a molecular mass of 45–46 kDa as already mentioned earlier. Retro-HSP12.6 appears to fold and assemble into multimeric states that further associate to form large globular structures. At low protein concentrations, the polypeptide displays secondary structural content and no tendency to aggregate, despite possessing solvent-exposed aromatic residues. Secondary structural content is enhanced through heating and lost through cooling as evidenced by CD spectroscopy with calorimetry showing an exothermic reaction to be occurring upon raising of temperature without attendant molecular aggregation. Thus, heating of this backbone-reversed all-β heat-shock protein results in enhancement of structural content, perhaps because of improved hydrophobic interactions among residues at high temperatures facilitating further hydrogen-bonding interactions and greater structure and stability. At the high temperature of 92 °C, the protein shows a CD spectrum not unlike that of any folded naturally occurring protein. Upon cooling, there is loss of most of the structural content gained through heating, but nevertheless some hysteresis is seen and the process is not fully reversible, such that the heated-cooled protein shows greater structural content than the unheated protein and shows a CD spectrum indicative of a considerably better folded state. Most intriguingly, heating is not associated with any aggregation. Independently, concentration of the protein was observed, to lead to assembly of the molecule into larger bead-like structures, which are precipitation-prone and show high secondary structural content. Preliminary plate-like crystals of the protein have been obtained and attempts are being made to refine crystallization conditions to carry out further structural analysis."

To determine the rate of inactivation by 2-pentynoyl-CoA, we investigated the inactivation in the presence of a non-oxidizable analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, which competes for the binding site. The enhanced rate of inactivation does not reflect an alteration in specificity for the acyl group, nor does it reflect the covalent modification of a residue other than the active site glutamate. In addition to determining the inactivation of catalytic activity a spectral intermediate was detected by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, and the rate constants of formation and decay of this charge transfer complex (λmax ≈ 790 nm) were determined by global analysis. Although the rate-limiting step in the inactivation of the other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases can involve the abstraction of a proton at C-4, this is not the case with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase is also differentiated from other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases in that the catalytic base must access both C-2 and C-4 in the normal catalytic pathway. Access to C-4 is not obligatory for the other dehydrogenases. Analysis of the distance from the closest carboxylate oxygen of the glutamate base catalyst to C-4 of a bound acyl-CoA ligand for medium chain, short chain, and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenases suggests that the increased rate of inactivation reflects the carboxylate oxygen to ligand C-4 distance in the binary complexes. This distance for wild type glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase is not known. Comparison of the rate constants of inactivation and formation of a spectral species between wild type glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and a E370D mutant are consistent with the idea that this distance in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase contributes to the enhanced rate of inactivation and the 1,3-prototropic shift catalyzed by the enzyme. 2-Pentynoyl-CoA inactivates glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase at a rate that considerably exceeds the rates of inactivation of short chain and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases by this inhibitor and related 2-alkynoyl-CoAs.

Several years ago, Schaller et al. (1Schaller R.A. Mohsen A.A. Vockley J. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7761-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that 2-pentynoyl-CoA rapidly inactivates Paracoccus denitrificans glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCD) 1The abbreviations used are: GCD, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol; DTNB, 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid); ESI, electrospray ionization; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MCAD, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; SCAD, short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. with t ½ less than 1 min. We also observed an extremely rapid rate of inactivation of human GCD by 2-pentynoyl-CoA. The oxidative reaction catalyzed by GCD is similar to other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases in that it oxidizes the acyl-CoA to the 2-enoyl-CoA, glutaconyl-CoA (2Westover J.B. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14106-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the catalytic pathway of GCD differs from other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, because it also catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA. The latter reaction is formally the substitution of a proton at C-4 for CO2. Glu-370 in human GCD abstracts a proton from C-2, prior to hydride transfer from C-3 to the N-5 of FAD, and then functions as a conjugate acid catalyst, Glu-370H+, to transfer the same proton to C-4 of the transient, delocalized crotonyl-CoA anion following decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA (2Westover J.B. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14106-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 3Gomes B. Fendrich G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several aspects of the mechanism have been investigated with GCD isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens (3Gomes B. Fendrich G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the sequence identity between this bacterial GCD and human GCD (64%) and the level of identity and conservative replacements (77%), a common reaction mechanism is likely. Unlike the glutamate base in MCAD and SCAD, Glu-370 in human GCD is proposed to access both C-2 and C-4 of the bound acyl-CoA in the normal catalytic pathway (3Gomes B. Fendrich G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, mutants of human GCD are available that may also be useful for understanding a possible basis for the extremely rapid rate of inactivation of this dehydrogenase (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Westover J.B. Kim J.-J.P. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MCAD and SCAD are both inactivated by 2-alkynoyl-CoAs (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Powell P.J. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8022-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Lundberg N.N. Thorpe C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inactivation of these two related dehydrogenases is proposed to involve the initial abstraction of a proton from C-4 of the inhibitor even though it is not mandatory that the catalytic base access C-4 during normal catalysis (5Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Westover J.B. Kim J.-J.P. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The residues that are covalently modified by these mechanism-based inhibitors, in both MCAD and SCAD, are the glutamate bases that initiate the catalytic pathways by abstracting a C-2 proton prior to hydride transfer to the N-5 of FAD (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Powell P.J. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8022-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we investigated the rapid inactivation of GCD by 2-pentynoyl-CoA. The experiments show that the catalytic base, Glu-370, is modified in the inactivation process. The rapid inactivation of GCD is, therefore, not because of the covalent modification of another residue. The experiments provide rate constants for the formation and decay of a spectral intermediate in the inactivation pathway along with rate constant for inactivation and equilibrium constants for the binding of 2-pentynoyl-CoA and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. Because the rate of inactivation is extremely rapid, the latter constants were determined in the presence of a non-oxidizable analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, which competes for the active site. A rationale for the enhanced reactivity of GCD based on access of the catalytic base to C-4 of the inhibitor is proposed and is consistent with the rate of inactivation and formation of a charge transfer species in the reaction of 2-pentynoyl-CoA with GCD. Materials—2-Pentynoic acid was purchased from GFS Chemicals. Glutaryl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, CoASH, DTNB, DCPIP, sinapic acid, angiotensin I, and ACTH fragments 1–17, 18–39, and 7–38 were purchased from Sigma. TPCK-trypsin and iodoacetic acid were purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Human wild type and E370D GCDs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and quantitated spectrophotometrically as described before (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human electron transferring flavoprotein was expressed in E. coli and purified as described by Griffin et al. (9Griffin K.J. DeGala G.D. Eisenreich W. Muller F. Bacher A. Frerman F.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—The dehydrogenases were assayed spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer) at 25 °C by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The assays were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 45 μm glutaryl-CoA, 3 μm electron transferring flavoprotein, and 50 μm DCPIP, the terminal electron acceptor, and started by adding the enzyme (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Rates were calculated using Δϵ600 nm = 20.1 mm–1 cm–1 for the reduction of the dye (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In these assays, electron transferring flavoprotein was used in place of 2 mm phenazine methosulfate. Preparation of Acyl-CoAs—2-Pentynoyl-CoA was synthesized from 2-pentynoic acid by the mixed anhydride method (10Bernert Jr., J.T. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6736-6744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified as described (11Rao K.S. Vander Velde D. Dwyer T.M. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1274-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and quantified using ϵ260 nm = 20.9 mm–1 cm–1 (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 3-Thiaglutaryl-CoA was synthesized as described previously (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purity of all synthetic acyl-CoAs was ≥98% as determined by analytical high performance liquid chromatography (12Corkey B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Inactivation of GCD—The reaction of 2-pentynoyl-CoA with GCDs was carried out in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5% ethylene glycol at 4 °C with an enzyme concentration of 2 μm. All inhibition experiments with 2-pentynoyl-CoA were conducted under pseudo first-order conditions. Samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixtures and assayed at regular intervals to monitor the rate of inactivation (13Silverman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 240-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In these experiments, it is assumed that the inactivation reaction is terminated upon diluting an aliquot of the reaction mixture into the assay that contains saturating amounts of substrate (13Silverman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 240-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the initial experiments, the rate of inactivation was extremely rapid with a t ½ of less than 10 s. Alteration of pH and temperature of the inactivation mixture did not slow the inactivation sufficiently. Therefore, further studies were carried out with varying concentrations of 2-pentynoyl-CoA but in the presence of the non-oxidizable substrate analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. Addition of this ligand to the reaction mixtures decreased the rate of inactivation by competition of the analog with 2-pentynoyl-CoA at the active site. The pseudo first-order rate constant of inactivation, k app, was calculated using KaleidaGraph 3.5. The data was further analyzed from a plot of k app versus the concentration of 2-pentynoyl-CoA in the presence of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA by the “competitive inhibition” model shown below in Scheme I (14Tipton K.F. Sandler M. Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs. University Park Press, Baltimore1980: 1-23Google Scholar), where E, I, L, E·I, E – I, and E·L refer to enzyme, inhibitor (2-pentynoyl-CoA), ligand (3-thiaglutaryl-CoA), a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex, an irreversible enzyme-inhibitor covalent complex, and a reversible enzyme-ligand complex, respectively. K i and K L are dissociation constants for inhibitor and ligand, respectively, and k i is the first-order rate constant for the inactivation process. The pseudo first-order rate constant of inactivation, k app, is related to k i, K i, and K L by Equation 1. kapp=ki1+Ki[I]1+[L]KL(Eq. 1) These parameters were evaluated by fitting all the data to Equation 1, which is of the same form as that describing competitive inhibition (14Tipton K.F. Sandler M. Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs. University Park Press, Baltimore1980: 1-23Google Scholar), by multiple non-linear regression using GraFit 4.0 (15Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 4.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). Each of the data sets was fitted simultaneously to Equation 1 with k i, K L, and K i as the shared parameters. Stopped-flow Kinetics and Data Analyses—The rapid reaction kinetics of 2-pentynoyl-CoA with the dehydrogenases were monitored with an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV-R stopped-flow reaction analyzer equipped with a 256-element photodiode array detector and xenon lamp. The dead time of the instrument is about 1.0 ms in this configuration using a cell (20 μl) with a 2.0-mm path length. All concentrations cited refer to final concentrations after mixing. Wild type or E370D GCD was reacted with 2-pentynoyl-CoA at 4 or 25 °C in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5% ethylene glycol. The reaction was monitored over 500 s at 4 °C and 100 s at 25 °C on a log time scale with spectra accumulated in the 330 to 1050-nm region at a spectral resolution of about 3.3 nm yielding a data matrix of 500 × 198. The data were analyzed using Pro-K global analysis/simulation software supplied with the instrument. Global optimization of reaction parameters was achieved by using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm and fitting to models by numerical integration. The data were analyzed simultaneously at all wavelengths by curve-fitting to an irreversible sequential first-order model, represented in Scheme II, below, where k f and k s are the fast and slow first-order rate constants related to the spectral species, A, B, and C. x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“jbc2782926342S2”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;SCHEME II The absorbance at any given wavelength, A λ, is then given by a sum of two exponentials, shown below in Equation 2, where the k f and k s, being independent of wavelength, are averaged. Aλ=AAλe(-kft)+ABλe(-kst)+ACλ(Eq. 2) The amplitudes, A Aλ, A Bλ, and A Cλ, allow the calculation of the spectrum and kinetic profiles of the three spectral species, A, B, and C. Because interchanging the values of the rate constants k f and k s leads to non-meaningful calculated spectra, the assignment of fast and slow phases to either k f or k s becomes unequivocal. Mass Spectrometry—The covalent modification of GCD by 2-pentynoyl-CoA was detected by mass spectrometry. Wild type GCD (16.6 μm) was inactivated with a 5-fold excess of 2-pentynoyl-CoA in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 5 min. As a control wild type enzyme without inhibitor was processed similarly. The molecular mass of a subunit of native and inactivated wild type GCD was determined by ESI mass spectrometry as described below. The ESI mass spectral experiments were carried out by coupling a protein-trapping column to a Q-Tof2™ mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom). Mass spectra were acquired with the time-of-flight analyzer at pusher frequency 16129 Hz covering the mass range from 1000 to 2500 atomic mass units and accumulating data for 5 s per cycle. Time to mass calibration was made with CsI cluster ions acquired under the same conditions. The cone voltage was 60 eV. The collision cell was maintained at 12 eV without gas. Protein samples were desalted by loading protein onto a protein-trapping column (15 × 1 mm) hand-packed with a polymeric reverse phase resin (PRP-1; Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) with 1% acetic acid at 150 μl/min flow rate. Elution of proteins was carried out with 90% methanol/0.5% formic acid at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus 22). Mass spectrometric data were processed using MassLynx software provided by Micromass Ltd. Identification of the modified peptide was accomplished by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the trypsin-digested protein. Native and modified wild type GCD with 2-pentynoyl-CoA (as above) were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetate in 6 m guanidinium chloride (16Charbonneau H. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 15-30Google Scholar). After extensive dialysis against distilled water, the proteins were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 mm NH4HCO3. The proteins were then digested overnight with 2% (w/w) TPCK-trypsin at room temperature (17Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 31-47Google Scholar). The digested samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager DE-PRO; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in linear and reflector modes using sinapic acid (10 mg/ml in an 80:20 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.5 ml) as the MALDI matrix. Spectra were externally calibrated to angiotensin I and the ACTH fragments 1–17, 18–39, and 7–38. The amino acid sequence of human GCD precursor protein (18Goodman S.I. Kratz L.E. DiGiulio K.A.

Genet. 1995; 4: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which includes the 44-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence, can be accessed through the NCBI protein data base under NCBI accession number Q92947. Quantitation of Free CoAS – Anion—The release of CoAS– anion from covalently inactivated GCD was quantitated by reaction with DTNB by two methods. The first method was that described by Freund et al. (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the second method, GCD was inactivated by addition of 10-fold molar excess of 2-pentynoyl-CoA at 4 °C for 1 h in 300 μl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5% ethylene glycol. The enzyme was removed from the reaction mixture by filtering through Centricon centrifugal membrane filter (YM-30), and the free CoAS– anion in the filtrate was quantitated using 0.1 mm DTNB as above, again using ϵ412 nm = 14.1 mm–1 cm–1 (19Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The results obtained by the two methods agreed within ± 10%. Data Base Searches and Molecular Modeling—The amino acid sequence of the mature GCD (18Goodman S.I. Kratz L.E. DiGiulio K.A. Biery B.J. Goodman K.E. Isaya G. Frerman F.E. Human Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used to search against the P. fluorescens genome in the data base of the United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute using TBLASTN (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar). The Pseudomonas GCD was located in Contig302 using the following parameters: percent identity, 40% and minimum matching length, 20. The distances between the nearest carboxylate oxygen of the glutamate catalytic base to the C-4 of the substrate in the crystal structures of MCAD (Protein Data Bank number 3MDE) (21Kim J.-J.P.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7761-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Tiffany K.A. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Paschke R. Mohsen A.A. Vockley J. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8455-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were determined using Insight II 97.0 package of modeling software on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 work station as described (1Schaller R.A. Mohsen A.A. Vockley J. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7761-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Mohsen A.A. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). MCAD and SCAD were co-crystallized with ligands octanoyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, respectively (21Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 22Battaile K.P. Molin-Case J. Paschke R. Wang M. Bennett D. Vockley J. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12200-12207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas isovaleryl-CoA was modeled into the active site of wild type IVD as described (1Schaller R.A. Mohsen A.A. Vockley J. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7761-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Mohsen A.A. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Inactivation of GCD by 2-Pentynoyl-CoA—The inactivation of human wild type GCD by 2-pentynoyl-CoA was extremely rapid with a t ½ that was less than 10 s at 4 °C. To characterize the inactivation quantitatively, the apparent rate of inactivation was determined at several different concentrations of a second ligand that binds to the active site. The ligand chosen was 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, a redox-inactive analog of glutaryl-CoA (3Gomes B. Fendrich G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a plot of k app versus the concentration of inhibitor in the presence of protection afforded by the substrate analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. The analysis of the 20 experimental data points when fitted to the competitive inhibition model converged in five iterations with a reduced χ2 = 2.6 × 10–6. The maximum value for the first-order rate constant of inactivation, k i (extrapolated to zero concentration of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA and infinite inhibitor concentration), is 4.3 ± 0.4 min–1. This rate constant is too rapid to be measured in the absence of protection by a competing ligand. The apparent dissociation constants for the binding of 2-pentynoyl-CoA, K i, and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, K L, were 6.9 and 22.8 μm, respectively. This indicates that the inhibitor, 2-pentynoyl-CoA, binds tightly, and the value for 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA agrees with our earlier determinations (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Westover J.B. Kim J.-J.P. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also compared the pseudo first-order rate constants for the inactivation of wild type GCD and E370D GCD (Fig. 2). The reactions were conducted at 4 °C in incubations containing 135 μm 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, 20 μm 2-pentynoyl-CoA, and 2 μm dehydrogenase in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5% ethylene glycol. The values of k app for inactivation of wild type and E370D GCD are 1.16 ± 0.07 and 0.26 ± 0.01 min–1, respectively. The 4.5-fold lower rate constant of inactivation of the mutant may be explained by the difference in distance (∼1 Å) from the γ-carboxylate of Glu-370 to the C-4 proton (or C-2) compared with the β-carboxylate of Asp-370. Alternatively, the difference in rate constants may also be explained by the distance from the Michael donor, carboxylate, to the Michael acceptor, 2,3-pentadienoyl-CoA, which is an intermediate formed in the inactivation process (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is also possible that there is a difference in the orientation of the carboxylate as it functions as a catalytic base, conjugate acid, or nucleophile in the Michael addition (25Gandour R.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1981; 10: 169-176Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Release of CoAS – Anion and Stoichiometry of Modification—As is the case with MCAD (6Freund K. Mizzer J. Dick W. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5996-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the CoAS– anion is liberated upon covalent modification of wild type GCD and E370D GCD by 2-pentynoyl-CoA. The amount of CoAS– anion released from the inactivated wild type GCD was 0.98 ± 0.10 per site as determined by reaction with DTNB as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stoichiometry of CoAS– anion released from inactivated E370D GCD was 1.12 ± 0.11 per site. Evidence for covalent modification of the protein was obtained by mass spectrometry of the unmodified wild type and modified enzymes. The average mass of the unmodified subunit determined by ESI mass spectrometry was 43601.2 Da; the average mass of the subunit based on the primary sequence deduced from the DNA coding sequence in the expression vector is 43598.0 Da (18Goodman S.I. Kratz L.E. DiGiulio K.A. Biery B.J. Goodman K.E. Isaya G. Frerman F.E. Human Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to subunits and loss of FAD occurs during the processing of the sample (see “Experimental Procedures”). The average mass of the inactivated subunit determined by ESI mass spectrometry is 43699.1 Da (data not shown), an increase of 97.9 Da, corresponding to C5H6O2, which is consistent with the mass of the expected adduct following release of CoAS– anion. Identification of Glu-370 as the Site of Chemical Modification— Table I shows the observed masses of the tryptic peptides from native GCD along with their amino acid sequence. The numbering of the peptides reported here is for mature human GCD without the 44-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence but includes the amino-terminal methionine required for expression from the vector in the case of peptide 1–25 (see footnotes in Table I). Comparison of tryptic maps of the native and 2-pentynoyl-CoA modified enzyme by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed an additional peptide (m/z = 2775.2) that is 98.6 mass units greater than the peptide (m/z = 2676.6) containing residues 359–382 (see Fig. 3 and Table I). The average mass predicted for the latter peptide, [M + H]+, is 2677.0. The peptide 359–382 has seven residues that could act as a catalytic base in the enzymatic reaction: His-359, Glu-364, Glu-370, His-373, Asp-374, His-376, and Arg-382. Of these, only Glu-370 is positioned appropriately to function as the catalytic base (26Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolph Weber, Berlin1999: 539-542Google Scholar). Further, Glu-370 in human GCD occupies the same position as Glu-376 in MCAD and Glu-368 in SCAD (18Goodman S.I. Kratz L.E. DiGiulio K.A. Biery B.J. Goodman K.E. Isaya G. Frerman F.E. Human Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Telford E.A.R. Moynihan L.M. Markham A.F. Lench N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, substitution of Glu-370 by glutamine drastically reduces the catalytic activity of GCD to 0.04% of wild type and substitution by aspartate reduces activity 14-fold (4Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and rate constant of inactivation 4.5-fold. Some native peptide was also detected in the analysis of peptides from the inactivated protein although the reac"
