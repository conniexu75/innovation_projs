https://openalex.org/W1989920563,"Little is known about how neural stem cells are formed initially during development. We investigated whether a default mechanism of neural specification could regulate acquisition of neural stem cell identity directly from embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells cultured in defined, low-density conditions readily acquire a neural identity. We characterize a novel primitive neural stem cell as a component of neural lineage specification that is negatively regulated by TGFbeta-related signaling. Primitive neural stem cells have distinct growth factor requirements, express neural precursor markers, generate neurons and glia in vitro, and have neural and non-neural lineage potential in vivo. These results are consistent with a default mechanism for neural fate specification and support a model whereby definitive neural stem cell formation is preceded by a primitive neural stem cell stage during neural lineage commitment."

https://openalex.org/W2728974037,"Mechanisms underlying seizure generation are traditionally thought to act over seconds to minutes before clinical seizure onset. We analyzed continuous 3- to 14-day intracranial EEG recordings from five patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy obtained during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. We found localized quantitative EEG changes identifying prolonged bursts of complex epileptiform discharges that became more prevalent 7 hr before seizures and highly localized subclinical seizure-like activity that became more frequent 2 hr prior to seizure onset. Accumulated energy increased in the 50 min before seizure onset, compared to baseline. These observations, from a small number of patients, suggest that epileptic seizures may begin as a cascade of electrophysiological events that evolve over hours and that quantitative measures of preseizure electrical activity could possibly be used to predict seizures far in advance of clinical onset."
https://openalex.org/W2171903257,"During a critical period of brain development, occluding the vision of one eye causes a rapid remodeling of the visual cortex and its inputs. Sleep has been linked to other processes thought to depend on synaptic remodeling, but a role for sleep in this form of cortical plasticity has not been demonstrated. We found that sleep enhanced the effects of a preceding period of monocular deprivation on visual cortical responses, but wakefulness in complete darkness did not do so. The enhancement of plasticity by sleep was at least as great as that produced by an equal amount of additional deprivation. These findings demonstrate that sleep and sleep loss modify experience-dependent cortical plasticity in vivo. They suggest that sleep in early life may play a crucial role in brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2086545953,"Newly synthesized Arc mRNA is selectively targeted to synapses that have experienced particular patterns of activity. Here, we demonstrate that the targeting requires NMDA receptor activation. Arc expression was induced by an electroconvulsive seizure, and the newly synthesized mRNA was then targeted to synaptic sites by activating the perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus. When micropipette electrodes containing NMDA receptor antagonists (MK801 or APV) were positioned in the dentate gyrus during the stimulation period, newly synthesized Arc mRNA was transported into dendrites but did not localize in the activated lamina; instead, the mRNA remained diffusely distributed. AMPA receptor antagonists (CNQX) blocked targeting of Arc mRNA in a small region, and mGluR antagonists (MCPG) did not affect localization. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptor activation is required for the targeting of Arc mRNA to active synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2026192447,"Muscle wasting is often associated with chronic inflammation. Because tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated as a major mediator of cachexia, its effects on C2C12 myocytes were examined. TNF-alpha activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and interfered with the expression of muscle proteins in differentiating myoblasts. Introduction of a mutant form of inhibitory protein kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) restored myogenic differentiation in myoblasts treated with TNF-alpha or interleukin 1beta. Conversely, activation of NF-kappaB by overexpression of IkappaB kinase was sufficient to block myogenesis, illustrating the causal link between NF-kappaB activation and inhibition of myogenic differentiation. The inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on myogenic differentiation were reversible, indicating that the effects of the cytokine were not due to nonspecific toxicity. Treatment of differentiated myotubes with TNF-alpha did not result in a striking loss of muscle-specific proteins, which shows that myogenesis was selectively affected in the myoblast stage by TNF-alpha. An important finding was that NF-kappaB was activated to the same extent in differentiating and differentiated cells, illustrating that once myocytes have differentiated they become refractory to the effects of NF-kappaB activation. These results demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines may contribute to muscle wasting through the inhibition of myogenic differentiation via a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2079735011,"Voltage-dependent sodium channels are uniformly distributed along unmyelinated axons, but are highly concentrated at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons. Here, we show that this pattern is associated with differential localization of distinct sodium channel α subunits to the unmyelinated and myelinated zones of the same retinal ganglion cell axons. In adult axons, Nav1.2 is localized to the unmyelinated zone, whereas Nav1.6 is specifically targeted to nodes. During development, Nav1.2 is expressed first and becomes clustered at immature nodes of Ranvier, but as myelination proceeds, Nav1.6 replaces Nav1.2 at nodes. In Shiverer mice, which lack compact myelin, Nav1.2 is found throughout adult axons, whereas little Nav1.6 is detected. Together, these data show that sodium channel isoforms are differentially targeted to distinct domains of the same axon in a process associated with formation of compact myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1994381304,"Synaptic neurotransmitter release is restricted to active zones, where the processes of synaptic vesicle tethering, priming to fusion competence, and Ca2+-triggered fusion are taking place in a highly coordinated manner. We show that the active zone components Munc13-1, an essential vesicle priming protein, and RIM1, a Rab3 effector with a putative role in vesicle tethering, interact functionally. Disruption of this interaction causes a loss of fusion-competent synaptic vesicles, creating a phenocopy of Munc13-1-deficient neurons. RIM1 binding and vesicle priming are mediated by two distinct structural modules of Munc13-1. The Munc13-1/RIM1 interaction may create a functional link between synaptic vesicle tethering and priming, or it may regulate the priming reaction itself, thereby determining the number of fusion-competent vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1998371106,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Circadian rhythms are entrained by light to follow the daily solar cycle. We show that <i>Drosophila</i> uses at least three light input pathways for this entrainment: (1) cryptochrome, acting in the pacemaker cells themselves, (2) the compound eyes, and (3) extraocular photoreception, possibly involving an internal structure known as the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet, which is located underneath the compound eye and projects to the pacemaker center in the brain. Although influencing the circadian system in different ways, each input pathway appears capable of entraining circadian rhythms at the molecular and behavioral level. This entrainment is completely abolished in <i>glass<sup>60j</sup> cry<sup>b</sup></i> double mutants, which lack all known external and internal eye structures in addition to being devoid of cryptochrome."
https://openalex.org/W2146880144,"Recent studies suggest that increased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) may contribute to neuronal death and cytoskeletal abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease. We report here such deregulation of Cdk5 activity associated with the hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilament (NF) proteins in mice expressing a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G37R)) linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A Cdk5 involvement in motor neuron degeneration is supported by our analysis of three SOD1(G37R) mouse lines exhibiting perikaryal inclusions of NF proteins. Our results suggest that perikaryal accumulations of NF proteins in motor neurons may alleviate ALS pathogenesis by acting as a phosphorylation sink for Cdk5 activity, thereby reducing the detrimental hyperphosphorylation of tau and other neuronal substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1968540273,"PDZ domain–containing proteins play an important role in the targeting and localization of synaptic membrane proteins. Here, we report an interaction between the PDZ domain–containing protein PICK1 and monoamine neurotransmitter transporters in vitro and in vivo. In dopaminergic neurons, PICK1 colocalizes with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and forms a stable protein complex. Coexpression of PICK1 with DAT in mammalian cells and neurons in culture results in colocalization of the two proteins in a cluster pattern and an enhancement of DAT uptake activity through an increase in the number of plasma membrane DAT. Deletion of the PDZ binding site at the carboxyl terminus of DAT abolishes its association with PICK1 and impairs the localization of the transporter in neurons. These findings indicate a role for PDZ-mediated protein interactions in the localization, expression, and function of monoamine transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2140053474,"SPECIFIC AIMSOur central hypothesis states that sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) is an important inflammatory mediator implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. We found that SPP levels were elevated in the airways of asthmatic (but not control) subjects after segmental antigen challenge and that, in vitro, SPP modulates human airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction, cell growth, and proinflammatory cytokine production that promote bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and remodeling in asthma.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1.

https://openalex.org/W2074262563,"Cortical interneurons arise from the proliferative zone of the ventral telencephalon, the ganglionic eminence, and migrate into the developing neocortex. The spatial patterns of migratory interneurons reflect the complementary expression of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor, MET, in the forebrain. Scatter assays on forebrain explants demonstrate regionally specific motogenic activity due to HGF/SF. In addition, exogenous ligand disrupts normal cell migration. Mice lacking the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR), a key component of HGF/SF activation, exhibit deficient scatter activity in the forebrain, abnormal interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence, and reduced interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. The data suggest that HGF/SF motogenic activity, which is essential for normal development of other organ systems, is a conserved mechanism that regulates trans-telencephalic migration of interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2115628640,"Na(v)1.6 is the main sodium channel isoform at adult nodes of Ranvier. Here, we show that Na(v)1.2 and its beta2 subunit, but not Na(v)1.6 or beta1, are clustered in developing central nervous system nodes and that clustering of Na(v)1.2 and Na(v)1.6 is differentially controlled. Oligodendrocyte-conditioned medium is sufficient to induce clustering of Na(v)1.2 alpha and beta2 subunits along central nervous system axons in vitro. This clustering is regulated by electrical activity and requires an intact actin cytoskeleton and synthesis of a non-sodium channel protein. Neither soluble- or contact-mediated glial signals induce clustering of Na(v)1.6 or beta1 in a nonmyelinating culture system. These data reveal that the sequential clustering of Na(v)1.2 and Na(v)1.6 channels is differentially controlled and suggest that myelination induces Na(v)1.6 clustering."

https://openalex.org/W2054799212,"SPECIFIC AIMSBecause of the following—controversial role, early heart-specific expression patterns, lack of specific inhibitors, contradictory results obtained via antisense knockdown experiments, and differing functions assigned to Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (Ncx1) during embryonic excitation-contraction coupling—we used gene targeting to delete Ncx1, which allowed us to begin to determine the precise role of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in development of the mammalian heart.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1.

https://openalex.org/W2013902743,The rate of release from nerve terminals depends on both the number of release sites and the rate of release at each site. The latter remains largely unknown at central synapses. We addressed this issue by simultaneously measuring the nerve terminal membrane capacitance and the postsynaptic current at single calyceal synapses in rat brainstem. We found that a 10 ms presynaptic step depolarization depleted a releasable pool containing 3300–5200 vesicles. Released vesicles were endocytosed with a time constant of a few seconds to tens of seconds. Release of only one third of this pool saturated both postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors. A release site can release more than three vesicles in 10 ms (>300 vesicles per second). We conclude that both a large number of release sites and a fast release rate at each site enable synapses to release at a high rate.
https://openalex.org/W2079321364,"The present study investigated the effect of a single bout of exhaustive exercise on the generation of DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage under normal conditions and at high-altitude hypoxia (4559 meters for 3 days). Twelve healthy subjects performed a maximal bicycle exercise test; lymphocytes were isolated for analysis of DNA strand breaks and oxidatively altered nucleotides, detected by endonuclease III and formamidipyridine glycosylase (FPG) enzymes. Urine was collected for 24 h periods for analysis of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage. Urinary excretion of 8-oxodG increased during the first day in altitude hypoxia, and there were more endonuclease III-sensitive sites on day 3 at high altitude. The subjects had more DNA strand breaks in altitude hypoxia than at sea level. The level of DNA strand breaks further increased immediately after exercise in altitude hypoxia. Exercise-induced generation of DNA strand breaks was not seen at sea level. In both environments, the level of FPG and endonuclease III-sensitive sites remained unchanged immediately after exercise. DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage are probably produced by reactive oxygen species, generated by leakage of the mitochondrial respiration or during a hypoxia-induced inflammation. Furthermore, the presence of DNA strand breaks may play an important role in maintaining hypoxia-induced inflammation processes. Hypoxia seems to deplete the antioxidant system of its capacity to withstand oxidative stress produced by exhaustive exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1993944463,"A 34 kD selenoprotein purified from rat testis was identified as a specific sperm nuclei glutathione peroxidase (snGPx) with similar properties to phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx). The determination of its primary structure by analysis of its first N-terminal amino acids, database search, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of the cDNA showed that it differs from PHGPx in its N-terminal sequence. This sequence, which is encoded for by an alternative exon in the first intron of the PHGPx gene, shows more than 50% homology to the protamine sequences and contains a nuclear localization signal. In rats, snGPx is highly expressed in the nuclei of the late spermatids where it is the only selenoprotein present. Its appearance coincides with the reorganization of DNA, which leads to highly condensed chromatin stabilized by cross-linked protamine thiols. In selenium-depleted rats where the concentration of snGPx had decreased to one-third of the normal level, chromatin condensation was severely disturbed. We provided evidence that snGPx acts as a protamine thiol peroxidase responsible for disulfide cross-linking by reduction of reactive oxygen species. Its dual function in chromatin condensation and the protection of sperm DNA against oxidation is necessary to ensure male fertility and sperm quality."
https://openalex.org/W2067386293,"On a radial temperature gradient, C. elegans worms migrate, after conditioning with food, toward their cultivation temperature and move along this isotherm. This experience-dependent behavior is called isothermal tracking (IT). Here we show that the neuron-specific calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is essential for optimal IT. ncs-1 knockout animals show major defects in IT behavior, although their chemotactic, locomotor, and thermal avoidance behaviors are normal. The knockout phenotype can be rescued by reintroducing wild-type NCS-1 into the AIY interneuron, a key component of the thermotaxis network. A loss-of-function form of NCS-1 incapable of binding calcium does not restore IT, whereas NCS-1 overexpression enhances IT performance levels, accelerates learning (faster acquisition), and produces a memory with slower extinction. Thus, proper calcium signaling via NCS-1 defines a novel pathway essential for associative learning and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2111531146,"The trp (transient receptor potential) gene encodes a Ca2+ channel responsible for the major component of the phospholipase C (PLC) mediated light response in Drosophila. In trp mutants, maintained light leads to response decay and temporary total loss of sensitivity (inactivation). Using genetically targeted PIP2-sensitive inward rectifier channels (Kir2.1) as biosensors, we provide evidence that trp decay reflects depletion of PIP2. Two independent mutations in the PIP2 recycling pathway (rdgB and cds) prevented recovery from inactivation. Abolishing Ca2+ influx in wild-type photoreceptors mimicked inactivation, while raising Ca2+ by blocking Na+/Ca2+ exchange prevented inactivation in trp. The results suggest that Ca2+ influx prevents PIP2 depletion by inhibiting PLC activity and facilitating PIP2 recycling. Without this feedback one photon appears sufficient to deplete the phosphoinositide pool of approximately 4 microvilli."
https://openalex.org/W2033472199,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), an enzyme encoded by the Drosophila abnormal wing discs (awd) or human nm23 tumor suppressor genes, generates nucleoside triphosphates from respective diphosphates. We demonstrate that NDK regulates synaptic vesicle internalization at the stage where function of the dynamin GTPase is required. awd mutations lower the temperature at which behavioral paralysis, synaptic failure, and blocked membrane internalization occur at dynamin-deficient, shi(ts), mutant nerve terminals. Hypomorphic awd alleles display shi(ts)-like defects. NDK is present at synapses and its enzymatic activity is essential for normal presynaptic function. We suggest a model in which dynamin activity in nerve terminals is highly dependent on NDK-mediated supply of GTP. This connection between NDK and membrane internalization further strengthens an emerging hypothesis that endocytosis, probably of activated growth factor receptors, is an important tumor suppressor activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1990880789,"Extrasynaptic release of dopamine is well documented, but its relation to the physiological activity of the neuron is unclear. Here we show that in absence of presynaptic active zones, solitary cell bodies of retinal dopaminergic neurons release by exocytosis packets of approximately 40,000 molecules of dopamine at irregular intervals and low frequency. The release is triggered by the action potentials that the neurons generate in a rhythmic fashion upon removal of all synaptic influences and therefore depends upon the electrical events at the neuronal surface. Furthermore, it is stimulated by kainate and abolished by GABA and quinpirole, an agonist at the D(2) dopamine receptor. Since the somatic receptors for these ligands are extrasynaptic, we suggest that the composition of the extracellular fluid directly modulates extrasynaptic release."
https://openalex.org/W2009416811,"Changes in SNARE conformations during MgATP-dependent priming of cracked PC12 cells were probed by their altered accessibility to various inhibitors. Dominant negative soluble syntaxin and, to a much lesser extent, VAMP coil domains inhibited exocytosis more efficiently after priming. Neurotoxins and an anti-SNAP25 antibody inhibited exocytosis less effectively after priming. We propose that SNAREs partially and reversibly assemble during priming, and that the syntaxin H3 domain is prevented from fully joining the complex until the arrival of the Ca2+ trigger. Furthermore, we find that mutation of hydrophobic residues of the SNAP25 C-terminal coil that contribute to SNARE core interactions affects the maximal rate of exocytosis, while mutation of charged residues on the surface of the complex affects the apparent affinity of the coil domain for the partially assembled complex."
https://openalex.org/W2079230824,"Leukocyte infiltration in atherosclerosis has been extensively investigated by using histological techniques on fixed tissues. In this study, intravital microscopic observations of leukocyte recruitment in the aorta of atherosclerotic mice were performed. Interactions between leukocytes and atherosclerotic endothelium were highly transient, thereby limiting the ability for rolling leukocytes to firmly adhere. Leukocyte rolling was abolished by function inhibition of P-selectin (P<0.001, n=8), whereas antibody blockage of E-selectin (n=10) decreased rolling leukocyte flux to 51 +/- 9.9% (mean+/-SE, P<0.01) and increased leukocyte rolling velocity to 162 +/- 18% (P<0.01) of pretreatment values. Notably, function inhibition of the integrin alpha(4) subunit (n=5) had no effect on rolling flux (107+/-25%, P=0.782) or rolling velocity (89+/-6.1%, P=0.147), despite endothelial expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Leukocytes interacting with atherosclerotic endothelium were predominantly neutrophils, because treatment with antineutrophil serum decreased rolling and neutrophil counts in peripheral blood to the same extent. In conclusion, we present the first direct observations of atherosclerosis in vivo. We show that transient dynamics of leukocyte-endothelium interactions are important regulators of arterial leukocyte recruitment and that leukocyte rolling in atherosclerosis is critically dependent on the endothelial selectins. This experimental technique and the data presented introduce a novel perspective for the study of pathophysiological events involved in large-vessel disease."
https://openalex.org/W1999786268,"In this study we tested the hypothesis that expression of heme oxygenases HO-1 and HO-2, which are responsible for the production of carbon monoxide, are reduced in the placenta and placental bed of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) compared with control third-trimester pregnancies. Placental protein expression was determined by Western blotting (n=10 in each group) and immunohistochemistry (controls n=18, PE n=19, FGR n=10). Extravillous trophoblast expression was determined by immunohistochemistry of placental bed biopsy samples (controls n=17, PE n=19, FGR n=10). Western blot analysis of placental homogenates showed no overall differences in HO-2 among groups. However, immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduction in HO-2 expression in endothelial cells in both abnormal groups (PE P<0.01; FGR P<0.0005 vs. control group) but no differences in villous trophoblast staining. HO-1 was undetectable by Western blotting in control and abnormal pregnancies and immunoreactivity was very low, suggesting that there is little HO-1 in the placenta. Within the placental bed, HO-2 but not HO-1 was detected on all populations of extravillous trophoblast, but expression of HO-2 or HO-1 did not change in PE or FGR. The reduced expression of HO-2 on endothelial cells in PE and FGR may be responsible for reduced placental blood flow in these conditions. The data do not show changes in HO in the placental bed in PE or FGR."

Neurons in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus showed altered activity during encoding (9%), recall (22%), and both task phases (23%). The responses of hippocampal neurons during encoding predicted whether or not subjects later remembered the pairs successfully. Entorhinal cortex neuronal activity during retrieval was correlated with recall success. These data provide support at the single neuron level for MTL contributions to encoding and retrieval, while also suggesting there may be differences in the level of contribution of MTL regions to these memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997051387,"Oxidative stress has been suggested as a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation. The pharmacological profile of n-acetylcysteine (NAC), a free radical scavenger, was evaluated in an experimental model of lung injury (carrageenan-induced pleurisy). Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity of rats elicited an acute inflammatory response characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity that contained many neutrophils (PMNs), an infiltration of PMNs in lung tissues and subsequent lipid peroxidation, and increased production of nitrite/nitrate, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 1beta. All parameters of inflammation were attenuated by NAC treatment. Furthermore, carrageenan induced an up-regulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-selectin, as well as nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS), as determined by immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues. The degree of staining for the ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and PARS was reduced by NAC. In vivo NAC treatment significantly reduced peroxynitrite formation as measured by the oxidation of the fluorescent dihydrorhodamine-123, prevented the appearance of DNA damage, an decrease in mitochondrial respiration, and partially restored the cellular level of NAD+ in ex vivo macrophages harvested from the pleural cavity of rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. A significant alteration in the morphology of red blood cells was observed 24 h after carrageenan administration. NAC treatment has the ability to significantly diminish the red blood cell alteration. Our results clearly demonstrate that NAC treatment exerts a protective effect and clearly indicate that NAC offers a novel therapeutic approach for the management of lung injury where radicals have been postulated to play a role."

This study investigated the action of ADP and 2-methylthioADP, a potent ADP analog with selectivity for the P2Y(1) receptor, on osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing multinuclear cells. Using three different assays, we show that ADP and 2-methylthioADP at nanomolar to submicromolar levels caused up to fourfold to sixfold increases in osteoclastic bone resorption. On mature rat osteoclasts, cultured for 1 day on polished dentine disks, peak effects on resorption pit formation were observed between 20 nM and 2 microM of ADP. The same concentrations of ADP also stimulated osteoclast and resorption pit formation in 10-day mouse marrow cultures on dentine disks. In 3-day explant cultures of mouse calvarial bones, the stimulatory effect of ADP on osteoclast-mediated Ca(2+) release was greatest at 5-50 microM and equivalent to the maximal effects of prostaglandin E(2). The ADP effects were blocked in a nontoxic manner by MRS 2179, a P2Y(1) receptor antagonist. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, we found evidence for P2Y(1) receptor expression on both osteoclasts and osteoblasts; thus, ADP could exert its actions both directly on osteoclasts and indirectly via P2Y(1) receptors on osteoblasts. As a major ATP degradation product, ADP is a novel stimulator of bone resorption that could help mediate inflammatory bone loss in vivo."

Where tested, the tuning curve was well predicted at different spatial frequencies. The model was also successful in predicting certain features of the spatial frequency selectivity of the cells. It did not successfully predict the amplitude of the responses to drifting gratings. Our results show that the spatial organization of the receptive field can account for a large fraction of the orientation selectivity of simple cells."

https://openalex.org/W2142053169,"Scavenger receptors mediating the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) by macrophages play a crucial role in foam cell formation during atherosclerosis. One member of this receptor family, the thrombospondin receptor CD36, has recently been shown to mediate a major part of the oxLDL-induced aggravation of atherosclerotic lesions. Here, we show that the expression of CD36 protein and mRNA in human monocytic THP-1 cells is increased by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a derivative of the essential Vitamin A, which leads to increased uptake of oxLDL. CD3106, a specific antagonist at the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), inhibited the atRA-induced CD36 expression, whereas the RAR-specific agonist CD367 induced CD36 to the same degree as atRA. This indicates an RAR-mediated CD36 induction. AtRA and oxLDL had synergistic effects in up-regulating CD36 when in both THP-1 cells and primary monocytes. Applying a sensitive RAR-GAL-4 reporter assay, we could demonstrate RAR ligands in human atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed RAR-a and -g in the lesions, which indicates that atRA may contribute to foam cell formation and the progress of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2033015149,"The ATM kinase, when activated postnatally, exerts multiple functions to prevent the onset of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). Using freshly isolated thymocytes from Atm-/- mice that were under stress during postnatal differentiation, we noted that thiol redox activity, as indicated by reduction of the tetrazolium MTS, and DNA turnover activity, as indicated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine into DNA, were both greatly increased compared with activities in thymocytes from Atm+/+ mice. This increased thymidine incorporation could be suppressed by the thiol N-acetylcysteine. In primary noncycling splenocytes, mitogens proportionally increased both the rate of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and the rate of reduction of MTS. The mitogen-induced activities in splenocytes were not affected by ATM but were suppressed by the calcineurin-dependent inhibitor FK-506, which has no effect on these activities in thymocytes. These findings suggest that increased [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and reducing power indicate increased cell cycling in mitogenically stimulated splenocytes, whereas these two indicators represent increased FK-506-independent DNA turnover activities in thymocytes. Thus, a primary function of ATM is to activate the redox-sensitive checkpoint required for down-regulation of DNA turnover activities in developing lymphocytes. Cell-cycling checkpoints in undamaged quiescent lymphocytes are not activated by ATM with mitogenic stimulation. ATM may suppress abnormal DNA turnover and the resultant oncogenesis by regulating cellular thiol redox pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2133638214,"SPECIFIC AIMSHuntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a glutamine repeat in huntingtin (Htt), a 3154 aa protein with recently described antiapoptotic functions. Degeneration involves striatal GABA/enkephalinergic neurons, key components of the ‘indirect’ efferent pathway, which express adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptors. We analyzed the possibility of an involvement of the A2A receptor and its signaling components in the pathogenesis of HD, by using striatal-derived cells and subclones engineered to express either normal or mutant Htt in its full-length or truncated forms. The rationale for the analysis of the phenotype of cells expressing truncated Htt relies on the demonstration that amino-terminal fragments resulting from proteolytic cleavage of full-length mutant Htt are more toxic than the full-length protein itself.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Both parental striatal-derived ST14A cells and Htt-engineered subclones express the A2A adenosine receptorReverse-tra..."
https://openalex.org/W1971275183,"Neuropeptides are ubiquitous transmitters that have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions, and it is important to understand the processes that control their secretion. We have developed a technique that measures neuropeptide secretion with high temporal resolution. This method involves placing an electrophysiological ""tag"" in a neuropeptide prohormone. The tagged prohormone is subsequently expressed together with an ionotropic receptor that binds the tag. Because the neuropeptide of interest and the tag enter the same population of dense core granules, neuropeptide secretion gives rise to fast, synaptic-like currents. Using this method, we show that peptide secretion can be modulated on a millisecond time scale. This technique could be readily adapted to measure the secretion of any neuropeptide."

https://openalex.org/W2165834442,"Hypoxic damage to the central nervous system triggers morphological and functional responses in astrocytes (AC). When isolated from the cerebral microenvironment and placed in cell culture, hypoxia promotes astrocytic alterations indicative of dedifferentiation. To investigate the effect of hypoxia on AC morphology, we performed studies on cultured AC pretreated with dibutyrylcAMP. These treated cells resemble AC in vivo, assuming a stellate morphology as observed by phase contrast microscopy. Exposure to hypoxia (0.3% oxygen tension) for 24 h induced a flat and polygonal shape in most of the cells as opposed to normoxic controls. A candidate factor to mediate this response is endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide produced by ischemic AC in vivo. The role of the astrocytic ET system during hypoxia, therefore, was investigated. Exogenous application of ET-1 mimicked the effect of hypoxia on the astrocytic morphology. The effects of hypoxia and exogenous ET-1 on the morphology were inhibited by the nonselective ET receptor antagonists PD142893 and PD145065. The ET peptide levels in the culture supernatants of AC increased about 1.5-fold after 24 h of hypoxia as measured by radioimmunoassay. Northern blot analyses revealed a threefold up-regulation of prepro ET-1 mRNA and a concomitant downregulation of ETA receptor and ETB receptor mRNAs. However, calcium responses were still inducible by exogenous ET-1. These results indicate that hypoxia triggers an autocrine loop in AC, resulting in a morphological transformation. This response is independent from neuronal damage and is based on activation of the astrocytic ET system."
